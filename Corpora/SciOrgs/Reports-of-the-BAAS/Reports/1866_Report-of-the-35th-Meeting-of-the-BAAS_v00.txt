Report of the Keio Committee of the British Association for the
                   Advancement of Science for 1864-65.

The Committee of the Kew Observatory submit to the Council of the British

Association the following statement of their proceedings during the past

year :--

A short time before the Meeting at Bath, it had been decided by the

Secretary of State for India, on the recommendation of the President and

Council of the Royal Society, that pendulum observations should be made

in India, and that the officer appointed to conduct this experimental inves-

tigation might receive instruction at Kew Observatory, which might form the

base-station of the Indian series.

In consequence of this decision Captain Basevi, R.E., first assistant in

the Indian Trigonometrical Survey, received instruction at Kew Observatory

in the method of making and reducing pendulum observations, and in that

of taking transits. Colonel Walker, R.E., Superintendent of the Survey, also

attended, in order to make himself acquainted with the details of the' appa-

ratus and the method of observing.

The pendulums used were those marked No. 1821 and No. 4, used

formerly by General Sabine in different parts of the globe. The former was

also used by Mr. Airy in his Harton Colliery experiments.

A receiver, by means of which these pendulums might be vibrated in vacuo,

Awas constructed by Mr. Adie, optician, London.  convenient room for pen-

dulum observations was likewise fitted up in the Observatory, the expense

being defrayed from the Government Grant Fund of the Royal Society;

1865.                                                      c
xxxiv  --REPORT 1865.

and in this room the preliminary observations were made for determining the
constants of the two pendulums about to be used in India. These observa-
tions were made by Mr. Loewy, and the results have been communicated to
the Eoyal Society by the Superintendent, in conjunction with the observer.
The pendulums and other apparatus were subsequently taken to India by
Mr. J. Hennessey, and have arrived safely at the head quarters of the Trigo-

nometrical Survey.

    General Sabine has been informed by Mr. Meldrum, Director of the
Mauritius Observatory, that the necessary funds have been .-voted by the
Government of that colony for hourly meteorological and magnetical observa-

tions; and that he may shortly be expected in this country, in order to become

acquainted with the working of the Kew instruments. In consequence of

this communication, Mr. Adie has constructed a set of self-recording mag-
netographs, in readiness for Mr. Meldrum's arrival.

  A Dip Circle and Unifilar have been verified at Kew, and will shortly be

dispatched to Mr. Ellery, Director of the Observatory, Melbourne, Australia.

   Two Dip Circles and two Unifilars, ordered by Colonel Walker, R.E., Super-

intendent of the Indian Survey, have been Verified in the presence of Colonel

Walker, who has received instruction in the method of observation with these
instruments. They have since been sent to India, where they have safely

arrived.

   Three Dip Circles and three Unifilars, ordered by Colonel Strange, are being
verified at the Observatory, and likewise one Dip Circle and one Unifilar re-
cently ordered by Captain J. Belavenetz of the Russian Navy, for the Compass

Observatory just built at Cronstadt.

   Mr. E. Walker (who has received the Cambridge Adams prize for his

essay on terrestrial magnetism) has been at Kew Observatory, receiving

instruction in the use of magnetical instruments.

   The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-
tinue to be made ; and the self-recording magnetographs are in constant
operation, as heretofore, under Mr. Whipple, magnetical assistant, who has
displayed much care and assiduity in the discharge of his duties.

   The meteorological work of the Observatory continues to be performed by
Mr. Thomas Baker, who likewise takes charge of the photographic depart-
ment connected with the self-recording instruments, and executes both

offices very satisfactorily.

    Since the Meeting at Bath, Senhor da Souza, of the University of Coimbra,
has ordered a self-recording barograph and thermograph, an anemometer and
electrograph, tubes for filling by Mr. Welsh's process in order to obtain a
standard barometer, and a cathetometer. These instruments have been con-
structed by opticians, and forwarded to Coimbra.

   During the past year, 88 barometers and 420 thermometers have been veri-

fied, and 6 standard thermometers have been supplied to men of science

and opticians ; 3 sets of measures of capacity have likewise been verified.
   The Self-recording Barograph continues in constant operation, and traces

in duplicate are obtained, one set of which has been regularly forwarded to
the meteorological department of the Board of Trade.

   At the request of Mr. Charles Cator, an anemometer of his construction
has been tested at the Observatory, and the restdts communicated to him.

Also, at the request of Professor Roscoe, the photographic action of total

daylight is daily registered by an apparatus of his construction.

   The Kew Heliograph, in charge of Mr. De la Rue, continues to be worked

by a qualified assistant, who gives much satisfaction. During the past
year 243 negatives have been takeif on 146 days, and four sets of positives
              REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                                XXXV

have been printed from each, some of which have been given to men of

science interested in this branch of research.

The negatives are being reduced under the superintendence of Mr. De

la Rue, and by means of an instrument of his own construction, which he

has generously presented to the Kew Committee. Mr. B. Loewy has been

engaged in the reduction, which he is executing satisfactorily.

It was mentioned in last Report that an addition to the Micrometer was

in the course of construction, by means of which the proportion of the sun's

disk obscured by spots might be conveniently measured. This arrangement

is now completed; and the materials for measurement have been greatly in-
creased through the kindness of Mr. Carrington, who has placed his original

drawings, in which the size and appearance of the spots are delineated with

Kewgreat fidelity, at the disposal of the  Observatory. It may be desirable

to state in a few words the proposed method of exhibiting the results of

these reductions. In the progress of this branch of knowledge observers have

been led to recognize certain laws which represent the average behaviour of

sun-spots ; but to all of these laws there are individual exceptions. In this
state of things it is probable that our knowledge of the subject will ulti-

mately be advanced, not only by a study of those groups which behave in a

normal manner, but also by a study of those which are exceptions in their

behaviour to the general rule; and on this account it has been thought desi-

rable to publish the results in such a way that anyone may be able to study

-- --the appearance and behaviour in fact the whole history of any one group.

   In order to accomplish this, a lens is being made by Dallmeyer, by means
of which individual groups may be magnified to a scale on which the diameter

of the sun will be equal in size to two feet.

The sun-spots continue to be observed after the method of Hofrath Schwabe,

of Dessau.

  As Kew is the first public institution which has taken up the subject of

sun-spots, and as it is intended to continue the method of numbering groups

so long and successfully adopted by Hofrath Schwabe, it was thought desirable

to endeavour to procure, if possible, for this countr}- the original drawings made

by this eminent and assiduous observer during a course of about forty years;

A joint letter by Mr. De la Rue and Mr. Stewart was consequently addressed

to Hofrath Schwabe ; and the following answer to it was soon received.

--" Gentlemen, The request contained in your letter, although in the highest

degree honourable and complimentary to me, and although it gives me an op-

portunity to show the Royal Astronomical Society my gratitude for the Royal

Medal granted to me, has still cost me some struggle before complying with it;

for it is not easy to part with what has given me very often much pleasure

and enjoyment as a compensation for the labour- devoted to the work.

" But in complying with your desire I do so on one condition, viz. that you

would grant me permission to obtain the observations back again at any time

that I should be desirous of looking into them, during the short time of life

still left to me. I do not think that I shall have an occasion to avail myself

of the permission asked for ; but permit me kindly to believe that it is in my
power to do so. After my death you may consider the whole of the observa-

tions as the property of the Royal Astronomical Society.

   " Please to write me if you are willing to agree to the above desire, and
I shall then immediately send you my astronomical diaries, &c. from 1825 to the

end of 1864.  " I remain, Gentlemen,

                                                " Tours very faithfully,

                                                          " S. H. Schwabe."

                                                                 c2
xxxvi  --REPORT 18G.J.

   In order to realize this generous bequest of Hofrath Schwabe, Mr. Loewy of

the Kew Observatory went to Dessau, taking with him a selection of dupli-

cate negatives and prints of the sun, which he presented, in the name of the
Association, to that gentleman. After receiving Mr. Loewy most courte-
ously, Hofrath Schwabe expressed his gratification at the high degree of
perfection attained in photoheliography, which surpassed his most sanguine
expectations ; he also handed over to Mr. Loewy's trust not only his valu-

able collection of sun-drawings, but also all his astronomical observations.

Some of these will be exhibited at the Association.

    It has long been a desideratum in photoheliography, with the view of ob-
taining the apparent diameter of the sun's disk, to ascertain the absolute values

in arc of the divisions of the measuring-instrument (Mr. De la Hue's Micro-
meter), and preliminary experiments were made with that object during the

period that the Heliograph Avas at the Cranford Observatory. These were only
partially successful. The mode of operation was this : a suitable object suffici-

ently distant was photographed by means of the Kew instrument, with the

lenses in the same positions as when solar pictures were taken. Different por-

tions of the object (windows, doors, &c. of a house, for example) were then care-
fully measured so as to ascertain their value in minutes and seconds of arc ; and
by measuring the pictures of these several portions with the arbitrary scale of
the Micrometer, the value of the latter in arc could be calculated. The experi-
ments did not succeed so well as could have been desired, in consequence of
the disturbance of the images by the undulations of the atmosphere, none
but very low objects coming within the desired range. More recently, how-
ever, the experiments have been taken up again with great promise, and

excellent photographs of the Kew Pagoda have been obtained, which possess

the requisite sharpness. The object itself, on account of its numerous galleries,

is peculiarly fitted for such' observations, as it will be possible to ascer-

tain and allow for any optical distortion of the photographic image. Thus
it is not improbable that the Pagoda will afford the means of ascertaining,

photographically, with the greatest accuracy, the angular diameter of the
sun, and will give data for correcting the assumed semidiameter of the moon,

by the discussion of photographic pictures of solar eclipses.

    M. Oussew has informed Mr. De la Eue that the Wilna Heliograph is
now at work under his direction, during the absence, on account of ill health,
of the Director, Prof. Sabler. At present he experiences some difficulty in

obtaining perfect photographs, and he has been invited to receive instruction

at the Kew Observatory. It is considered to be desirable on other accounts

that M. Gussew shoiild be able to avail himself of the advantage thus
offered to him, as an arrangement might then be made for the division of the

labour of reducing the Heliographic observations.

  An apparatus will shortly be added to the Kew Observatory for the important

object of the ready verification of sextants ; the system of distant mirrors

now in use, designed by Mr. Galton and erected at his own cost, being only

available in steady sunshine.

   The new apparatus has been designed by Mr. Thomas Cooke, the well-
known optician. In principle, it consists of four collimators fixed radially,

at various angles apart, round the table on which the sextant is to be laid
for examination. The cross wires of the collimators in each of their com-
binations are to be brought successively into contact by the sextant. Then
a comparison of its readings with the constant angles of construction of the
apparatus determines the error of the sextant at various points of its arc.
However, in practice, to avoid the cost of very large collimators, whose
REPORT OF THE &EW COMMITTEE.  XXXV11

object-glasses would suffice to include the rays proceeding both to the index
and to the horizon-glasses of large sextants, Mr. Cooke employs double colli-
mators of moderate size ; and he adjusts each pair to strict parallelism by
aid of a detached telescope.

    The coloured shades of the sextant are readily examined by strongly illu-
minating the fields of two of the collimators, after contact of their cross wires
has been made in the ordinary manner.

   On the application of Mr. Galton, backed by the recommendation of the
Kew Committee, the Council of the Eoyal (Society has allotted .£80 from the

Government Grant, to defray the estimated cost of Mr. Cooke's apparatus,
and its establishment in the Observatory at Kew.

   The apparatus will be erected in the basement-hall of the Observatory;
and when the arrangement is complete it is hoped that the Observatory will
become a place where quadrants and sextants can be verified with great
facility, and where scientific travellers or officers in Her Majesty's Service

may receive instruction in the use of geographical instruments.

   The solar spectrum is being mapped by the spectroscope belonging to the

Chairman. All the measurements for the region between D and E have

been made and carefully verified ; and a map of this region, in accordance
with these measurements, has been constructed by Mr. Loewy. Many more
lines are exhibited in this map than in that lately made by Professor Kirch-
hoff. Observations made by this instrument have likewise brought out

several new lines in the spectrum of ignited sodium.

   At the joint suggestion of Professor Tait of Edinburgh and the Superin-
tendent, an ingenious apparatus has been constructed by Mr. Eeckley, by
means of which a disk can be made to revolve in vacuo with great velocity
and a short description of some experiments performed by means of this
instrument, with the view of ascertaining whether visible as well as mole-
cular motion is dissipated by a medium pervading space, has been commu-
nicated to the Eoyal Society by the Superintendent in conjunction with

Professor Tait.

   The instrument devised by Mr. Broun, for the purpose of estimating the
magnetic dip by means of soft iron, remains at present at the Observatory.

   The Superintendent has received grants from the Eoyal Society for special
experiments ; and when these are completed, an account will be rendered to

that Society.

   It will be seen from the foregoing Eeport, that many other experiments
and observations, of a nature to advance science, are made under the sanc-
tion of the Committee, besides those which form the ordinary work of the

Observatory; it is, however, always stipulated that the cost of such experi-
ments shall be defrayed by their promoters.

REPORT OF THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE.  XXXlX

Report of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                   Association at Birmingham, September 1865.

  The Parliamentary Committe have the honour to report as follows :--

   By a Resolution passed at Bath your Committee were requested to press
on the Government the expediency of instituting a series of experiments oir
Foo- Signals, but on consulting some of the Members of the Committee
appointed for the purpose of making experiments on the transmission of
sound under water, your Committee were informed that no action on the part

of the Government was at present necessary.
   Your Committee brought under the notice of the Council the unsatisfactory

character of the provisions of the Public Schools Bill of last Session, so far as

they affected the interests of Science.

   Your Committee advocated such alterations therein as they believed would
be most likely to promote these interests ; and it was at the suggestion of one

of their members that Professors Sharpey, W. A. Miller, Huxley, and TynclaU

were applied to, and gave the admirable evidence on the extent to which
Physical Science might with advantage be introduced into the studies of our
great Public Schools, which will be foimd in the Appendix to the Report of
the Committee of the House of Lords on the Bill above referred to, and to

which the attention of all engaged in the instruction of youth may be usefully
 directed. Some valuable remarks on the same subject by our President Elect

 had been previously referred to in the course of the Debate ; and the evidence
 of our President, Drs. Carpenter and Hooker, the Astronomer Royal, and
 others, before the Public School Commissioners, furnishes an additional proof,
 if any were wanting, of the zeal and energy with which the Cultivators of
 Science continue to remonstrate against the system, which still unhappily

 prevails in many of our Schools, of ignoring the claims of Science.

Assembled for the third time in this busy centre of industrious England,
amid the roar of engines and the clang of hammers, where the strongest

powers of nature are trained to work in the fairy chains of art, how softly

falls upon the ear the accent of Science, the friend of that art, and the
guide of that industry ! Here, where Priestley analyzed the air, and Watt
obtained the mastery over steam, it well becomes the students of nature to
gather round the standard which they carried so far into the fields of know-

ledge. And when, on other occasions, we meet in quiet colleges and Aca-
demic halls, how gladly welcome is the union of fresh discoveries and new

inventions with the solid and venerable truths which are there treasured and

taught. Long may such union last ; the fair alliance of cultivated thought

and practical skill ; for by it labour is dignified and science fertilized, and the

condition of human society exalted !

    Through this happy combination of science and art, the young life of the

added to the working strength of a thousand millions of men the mightier

power of steam *, extracted from the buried ruins of primeval forests their
treasured elements of heat and light and colour, and brought under the con-

trol of the human finger, and converted into a messenger of man's gentlest

--Hi report 1865.

where disco very, everywhere enjoyment, everywhere some useful and there-

fore some worthy result. Life in every form, of every grade, in every stage

--man in every clime and under all conditions ; the life that now surrounds

us, and that which has passed away ; -these subjects of high contemplation

have been examined often, if not always, in the spirit of that philosophy

which is slowly raising, on a broad security of observed facts, sure induc-

tions, and repeated experiments, the steady columns of the temple of physi-

cal truth.

Few of the great branches of the study of nature on which modern philo-

sophy is intent were left unconsidered in the schools of Athens ; hardly one

--of them was or indeed could be made the subject of accurate experiment.

The precious instruments of exact research -the measures of time, and space,

--and force, and motion are of very modern date. If instead of the few

lenses and mirrors of which traces appear in Greek and Roman writers *,

there had been even the first Galilean or the smallest Newtonian telescope in

the hands of Hipparchus, Eratosthenes, or Ptolemy, would it have been left

to their remote successors to be still struggling with the elements of physical

astronomy, and waiting with impatience till another quarter of a century

shall have rolled away and given us one more good chance of measuring the

distance of the Sun by the transit of Venus ? Had such instruments as

Wheatstone's Chronoscope been invented, would it have been left to Foucault

to condense into his own apartment an experimental proof of the velocity of

light, and within a tract of thirty feet to determine the rate of its movement

through all the vast planetary space of millions and thousands of millions of

miles, more exactly than had been inferred by astronomers from observa-

tions of the satellites of Jupiter t ? By this experiment the velocity of light

appears to be less, sensibly less, than was previously admitted ; and this con-

clusion is of the highest interest. For, as by assuming too long a radius for

the orbit of Jupiter the calculated rate of light-mavement was too great ; so

now by employing the more exact rate and the same measures of time we

can correct the estimated distance of Jupiter and all the other planets from

Wethe sun.  have in fact a really independent measure of planetary space

and it concurs with observations of the parallax of Mars, in requiring a con-

siderable reduction of the assumed diameters of the planetary paths. The

distance of the earth from the sun must be reduced from above ninety-five

to less than ninety-three millions of miles, and by this scale the other space-

measures of the solar system, excepting the diameter of the earth and the

distance and diameter of the moon, may be corrected +.

   * The effect of lenses or globes of glass or crystal (iJaXo?) in collecting the solar rays

to a point are familiarly referred to by Aristophanes in the Nubes, 76G ; and the orna-
mental use of convex and concave reflectors is known by the curious discussions in tile
IVth Book of Lucretius.

   t Fizeau performed experiments on the velocity of light between Suresnes and the
Butte Montmartre, by means of the oxyhydrogen light, reflected back in its own path.

                                                                                                                                                               1

The space was 28,324 feet Engl. Twice this distance was traversed in 7iT7jn77 of a

lambre inferred 107,976 miles, Struve 166,096. The experiment of M. Foucault gives

=298,000,000 metres 160,920 geogr. miles.

    J Estimates of the earth's distance from the sun have varied much. Cassiniand
Flair steed, using observations of the parallax of Mars, ascribe to it 10,000 or 11,000

= =diameters of the earth 79 or 89 millions of miles. Huyghens estimated it at 12,000

   The light and heat which are emitted from the sun reach the earth without
great diminution by the absorptive action of the atmosphere ; but the waste
of heat from the surface of our planet through radiation into space is pre-

vented, or rather lessened by this same atmosphere. Many transparent

bodies admit freely heat-rays derived from a source of high temperature, but
stop the rays which emanate from bodies only slightly warmed. The atmo-
sphere possesses this quality in a remarkable degree, and owes it to the pre-
sence of diffused water and vapour ; a fact which Dr. Tyndall has placed in
the clear light of complete and varied experiment *. The application of this
truth to the history of the earth and of the other planets is obvious. The

vaporous atmosphere acts like warm clothing to the earth. Hy an augmented

quantity of vapour dissolved, and water suspended in the air, the waste of
surface-heat of the earth would be more impeded ; the soil, the water, and
the lower parts of the atmosphere woiild grow wanner; the climates would
be more equalized ; the general conditions more like what has been supposed
to be the state of land, sea, and air during the geological period of the Coal-

measures.

    Such an augmentation of the watery constituents in the atmosphere would
be a natural consequence of that greater flow of heat from the interior, which

by many geologists, mathematicians, and chemists is supposed to have hap-

pened in the earlier periods of the history of the earth.

   By the same considerations we may understand how the planet Mars, which
receives not half so much heat from the sun f as the earth does, may yet

enjoy, as in fact it seems to enjoy, nearly a similar climate, with snows alter-
nately gathering on one or the other of its poles, and spreading over large
spaces around, but not, apparently, beyond the latitude of 50° or 40°; the
equatorial band of 30° or 40° north or south being always free from snow-
masses bright enough and large enough to catch the eye of the observer.

Mars may therefore be inhabited, and we may see in the present state of

this inquiry reason to pause before refusing the probability of any life to
Jupiter and even more distant planets.

    The history of suns and planets is in truth the history of the effects of
light and heat manifested in them, or emanating from them. Nothing in
the universe escapes their influence ; no part of space is too distant to be
penetrated by their energy ; no kind of matter is able to resist their trans-

forming agency. Many if not all the special forces which act in the parti-

cles of matter are found to be reducible into the general form of heat ; as
this is convertible and practically is converted into proportionate measures of
special energy. Under this comprehensive idea of convertibility of force,

familiar to us now by the researches of Joule J, the reasonings of Grove § and

Helmholtz, and the theorems of Eankine |[, it has been attempted by Mayer,
Waterston, and Thomson^! to assign a cause for the maintenance of the heat-
giving power of the sun in the appulse of showers of aerolites and small

in 1769, he allowed 33 millions. Such was the effect of that now supposed erroneous ex-

periment on the opinions of astronomers. (Epoques de la Nature.)

masses of matter, and the extinction of their motion on the surface of the

luminary. By calculations of the same order, depending on the rate of radi-

ation of heat into space, the past antiquity of the earth and the future
duration of sunshine have heen expressed in thousands or millions of centu-
ries *. In like manner the physical changes on the sun's disk, by which
portions of his darkly heated body become visible through the luminous
photosphere, have been connected, if not distinctly as a cause, certainly as a
coincident phenomenon, with particular magnetic disturbances on the surface
of the earth; the solar spots and the magnetic deflections concurring in

periods of maxima and minima of ten or eleven years' duration. Thus even
these aberrant phenomena become part of that amazing system of periodical
 variation which Sabine and his fellow-labourers, British, French, German,
 Russian, and American, have established by contemporaneous observation over

 a large part of the globe t.

    With every change in the aspect and position of the sun, with every alte-
 ration in the place and attitude of the moon, with every passing hour, the
 magnetism of the earth submits to regular and calculable deviation. Through
 the substance of the ground, and across the world of waters. Nature, ever
 the beneficent guide to Science, has conveyed her messages and executed her
 purposes, by the electric current, before the discovery of Oersted and the

 magical inventions of "Wheatstone revealed the secret of her work.

    Even radiant light in the language of the new Philosophy is conceived of
 by Maxwell J as a form of electro-magnetic motion. And thus the impon-

 derable, all-pervading powers, by which molecular energy is excited and
 exchanged, are gathered into the one idea of restless activity among the

 particles of matter :

 ever-moving and being moved, elements of a system of perpetual change in
 every part, and constant preservation of the whole.

    What message comes to us with the light which springs from the distant

 stars, and shoots through the depths of space to fall upon the earth after
  tens, or hundreds, or thousands of years ? It is a message from the very
 birthplace of light, and tells us what are the elementary substances which

 have influenced the refraction of the ray. Spectral analysis, that new and
 powerful instrument of chemical research for which we arc indebted to
  Kirchhoff, has been taught by our countrymen to scrutinize not only planets

  and stars, but even to reveal the constitution of the nebula?, those mysterious

 --masses out of which it has been thought new suns and planets might be

  evolved nursing-mothers of the stars. For a time, indeed, the resolution

     * Professor Thomson assigns to the sun's heat, supposing it to be maintained by
  the appulse of masses of matter, a limit of 300,000 years ; and to the period of cooling of
  the earth from universal fusion to its actual state, 98 million years. These are the lowest

  estimates sanctioned by any mathematician.

    mt A ong the interesting researches which have been undertaken on the subject of the

  spots, may be mentioned those of Wolf (Comptes Kendus, 1859), who finds the number

   and periodicity of the spots to be dependent on the position of Venus, the Earth, Jupiter,
  and Saturn. Stewart has made a special study of the relation of the spots to the path of
  Venus (Proc. of the Koy. Soc. 186-1) ; and Cliacornac is now engaged iu unfolding his
  conception of the spots as the visible effect of volcanic excitement. The peculiar features
   of the solar surface are under examination by these and other good observers ; such as
   Dawes, Nasmyth, Secchi, Stone, Fletcher, Howlett, and Lockyer.

of some nebuhe, by the giant mirror of Lord Rosse, afforded ground for

opposing the speculation of Herschel and the reasoning of Laplace, which

required for their very starting-point the admission of the existence of thin

gaseous expansions, with or without points or centres of incipient condensa-

tion, with or without marks of internal movement. The latest results, how-

ever, of spectral analysis of stars and nebulas by Mr. Huggins and Professor

W. A. Miller, have fairly restored the balance. The nebulas are indeed found

to  have  in  some instances  stellar points, but they are      not stars                                       the whole

resembles an enormous mass of luminous gas, with an interrupted spectrum

of three lines, probably agreeing with nitrogen, hydrogen, and a substance at

present unknown*. Stars tested by the same accurate hands are found to

--have a constitution like that of our own Sun, and, like it, to show the pre-

sence of several terrestrial elements as sodium, magnesium, iron, and very

often hydrogen. While in the Moon and Venus no lines whatever are found

due to an atmosphere, in Jupiter and Saturn, besides the lines which are

identical with some produced in our own atmosphere, there is one in the red,
which may be caused by the presence of some unknown gas or vapour. Mars

is still more peculiar, and enough is ascertained to discountenance the notion

of his redness being due to a peculiarity of the soil f.

   To aid researches into the condition of celestial bodies, the new powers of

light, discovered by Niepce, Dagucrre, and Talbot, have been employed by

Bond, Draper, De la Rue, and other astronomers. To our countryman, in

particular, belongs the honour of successful experiments on the rose-coloured

flames which extend from certain points of the sun's border during an

eclipse ; as well as of valuable contributions through the same agency to that

enlarged survey of the physical aspect of the moon, which, since 1852, the

Association has striven to promote. By another application of the same

beautiful art, in connexion with clock-work, the momentary changes of

magnetic force and direction, the variations of temperature, the fluctuations

of atmospheric pressure, the force of the wind, the fall of rain, the propor-
tion of ozone in the air, are registered in our observatories ; and thus the
inventions of Ronalds and his successors have engaged the solar rays in

measuring and comparing contemporaneous phenomena of the same order

--over lar£ e parts of the globe phenomena some of which are occasioned by

those very rays.

   As we ascend above the earth, heat, moisture, and magnetic force decrease,
the velocity of wind augments, and the proportion of oxygen and nitrogen
remains the same. The decrease of heat as we rise into the air is no new

subject of inquiry, nor have the views respecting it been very limited or very

accordant. Leslie considered it mathematically in relation to pressure

Humboldt gave the result of a large inquiry at points on the earth's surface,
unequally elevated above the sea ; and finally, Mr. Glaisher and Mr. Coxwell,
during many balloon ascents to the zones of life-destroying cold, far above

our mountain tops, have obtained innumerable data, in all seasons of the year,

through a vast range of vertical height. The result is to show much more
rapid decrease near the earth, much slower decrease at great elevations

thus agreeing in general with the decrease of density, and yet throwing no
discredit on the determinations of Humboldt, which do not refer to the free
atmospheric ocean, but to the mere borders of it where it touches the earth,

and is influenced thereby J.

   The proportion of carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere at great heights is
not yet ascertained : it is not likely to be the same as that generally found

near the earth ; but its proportion may be more constant, since in those

regions it is exempt from the influence of the actions and reactions which

are always in progress on the land and in the water, and do not necessarily

compensate one another at every place and at every moment.

    Other information bearing on the constitution of the atmosphere comes to

us from the auroral beams and other meteoric lights known as shooting-stars.

For some of these objects not only appear at heights of ten, fifty, and one
hundred or more miles above the earth, but at the height of fifty miles it is
on record that shooting-stars or fire-balls have left waving trains of light,
whose changes of form were in seeming accordance to varying pressure in the
elevated and attenuated atmosphere *.

Researches of every kind have so enriched meteorology since our early

friend, Professor J. Forbes, printed his suggestive reports on that subject, and

so great have been the benefits conferred on it by the electric telegraph, that
at this moment in M. Leverrier's observatory at Paris, and the office so lately
presided over by Admiral FitzEoy in London, the messages are arriving from

all parts of Europe to declare the present weather, and furnish grounds for

reasonable expectation of the next probable change. Hardly now within

the seas of Europe can a cyclone begin its career of devastation, before the
warning signal is raised in our sea-ports, to restrain the too confident sailor.
The gentle spirit which employed this knowledge in the cause of humanity

has passed away, leaving an example of unselfish devotion, in a work which

must not fail through any lack of energy on the part of this Association, the

WeRoyal Society, or the Government.  must extend these researches and

enlarge these benefits by the aid of the telegraph bringing the ends of the

world together. Soon may that thread of communication unite the two great

sections of the Anglo-Saxon race, and bring and return through the broad
Atlantic the happy and mutual congratulations for peace restored and friend-

ships renewed.

   The possible combinations of force by which, in the view we have been
considering, the characteristic forms and special phenomena of solid, liquid,
and gaseous matter are determined, may be innumerable. Practically, how-

ever, they appear to be limited, as natural products, to less than one thousand

distinguishable compounds, and less than one hundred f elementary sub-
stances. Of these elements the most prevalent are few on the earth ; as of
gases, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen ; of solids, silicon, calcium, magnesium,
sodium, iron ; and it is interesting to learn by analysis of the light of stars
and planets, that these substances, or some of them, are found in most of the

celestial objects yet examined, and that, except in one or two instances, no

other substances have been traced therein. Even the wandering meteoric
stones, which fall from their courses, and are examined on the earth, betray
only well-known mineral elements, though in the manner in which these are
combined, some differences appear, which by chemical research and the aid

of transparent sections Professor Maskelyne and Mr. Sorby are engaged in
studying and interpreting +.

   * This is the result of a careful discussion made by myself of observations on a meteor
seen from Rouen to Yorkshire, and from Cornwall to Kent, Jan. 7, 1856.

   f At the present moment the number of " elementary substances " is sixty-one.

meteorites in the British Museum, under the titles of "Aerolite or Meteoric Stone;"

By the labours of Lavoisier and his contemporaries, Chemistry acquired a

fixed logic and an accurate nomenclature. Dalton and the great physicists

of the early part of this century gave that law of definite combination by

proportionate weights of the elements which is for chemistry what the law

Aof gravitation is for celestial mechanics.                                                                                                                              great expansion of the meaning

of the atomic theory took place, when Mitscherlich announced his views of

isomorphous, isomeric, and dimorphous bodies. For thus it came gradually

to appear that particular forces resided in crystals in virtue of their struc-

ture, lay in certain directions, and exhibited definite physical effects, if the

chemical elements, without being the same, were combined in similar propor-

tions, and aggregated into similar crystals. Some years later, ozone was

discovered by Schonbein, and it concurred with a few other allotropic sub-

stances in reviving, among philosophic chemists, the inquiry as to the relative

situation of the particles in a compound body, and the effects of such

arrangements : an idea which had been expressed by Dalton in diagrams of

atoms, and afterwards exercised the ingenuity of Exley, MacVicar, and

others *.

' Everything connected with this view of the modification of physical pro-

--perties by the arrangement of the particles- whether elementary or com-

--pound is of the highest importance to mineralogy, a branch of study by no

means so much in favour even with chemists as its own merits and its col-

lateral bearings might justly deserve. Yet it is in a great measure by help

of this branch of study that the opinions now current regarding metamor-

phism of rocks in situ, and the formation of mineral veins, must acquire that

solid support and general consent which at present they do not possess.

Crystals, indeed, whether regarded as to their origin in nature, their fabrica-

tion by art, or their action on the rays of light, the waves of heat and sound,

and the distribution of electricity, have not been neglected by the Association

or its members. In one of the earliest Reports, Dr. "Whewell calls attention

to the state of crystallographical theory, and to the artificial production of

crystals ; and in another Report, Professor Johnston notices epigene and

pseudomorphous crystallisation                                                                                                                                 and  for  many years, at almost every meet-
                                                                                                                                                            ;

ing, new and brilliant discoveries in the action of crystals on light were

made known by Brewster t, and compared with the undulatory theory by

Herschel, MacCullagh, Airy, Hamilton, "Whewell, Powell, Challis, Lloyd, and

Stokes.

   The unequal expansion of crystals by heat, in different directions, first

observed by Mitscherlich, has been carefully examined in the cases of

sulphate and carbonate of lime by Professor W. H. Miller J, who has also

considered their elasticity, originally measured in different relations to the

axis by Savart. These and many other interesting relations of crystals have

varieties. Mr. Sorby, whose latest results are unpublished, but will be communicated to

the Royal Society, is of opinion that the substance of meteorites has undergone changes

due to physical conditions in some ancient period not now to be paralleled on our planet,

or on the moon, but rather to be looked for only in the immediate neighbourhood of the

sun. Professor Haidinger has also made a special study of meteorites.

been attended to ; but the Association has not yet succeeded in obtaining a
complete digest of the facts and theories connected with the appearance of

--crystals in nature in the fissures of rocks ; in the smaller cavities of rocks ;

in the solid substance or liquid contents of other crystals. Such an inquiry,
however, it did earnestly demand, and some steps have been taken by our

own chemists, mineralogists, and geologists. But more abundant information

on this class of subjects is still needed, even after the admirable contributions
and recent discoveries of Bischof, Delesse, and Daubre'e *.

    Within our Association-period both the nomenclature of chemistry and the
conception of the atomic theory have received not indeed a change, but such
an addition to its ordinary expression as the more general language and

larger meaning of Algebra have conferred on common arithmetical values.
The theory of compound radicals, as these views of Liebig, Dumas, and Hof-
mann may be justly termed, embraces the consideration of groups of elements

united in pairs by the ordinary law, these groups being for the purpose in
hand treated as single elements of combination. The nomenclature which
attempts in ordinary words to express these relations grows very unma-

--nageable even in languages more easily capable of polysyllabic combinations

than ours ; but symbols of composition the true language of chemistry

are no more embarrassed in the expression of these new ideas than are the
mathematical symbols which deal with operations of much greater com-
plexity on quantities more various and more variable f. The study of these
compound radicals conies in aid of experimental research into those numerous

and complex substances which appear as the result of chemical transforma-
tions in organic bodies. Thus in some instances the very substances have

been recomposed by art which the vital processes are every moment pro-

ducing in nature ; in others the steps of the process are clearly traced ; in all
the changes become better understood through which so great a variety of
substances and structures are yielded by one circulating fluid ; and the result

is almost a new branch of animal and vegetable physiology, not less import-
ant for the health of mankind than essential to the progress of scientific

agriculture.

The greater our progress in the study of the economy of nature, the more

she unveils herself as one vast whole ; one comprehensive plan ; one universal

rule, in a yet unexhausted series of individual peculiarities. Such is the

aspect of this moving, working, living system of force and law : such it has

ever been, if we rightly interpret the history of our own portion of this rich

inheritance of mind, the history of that Earth from which we spring, with

which so many of our thoughts are coordinated, and to which all but our

thoughts and hopes will again return.

  How should we prize this history ! and exult in the thought that in our

own days, within our own memories, the very foundations of the Series of

Strata, deposited in the beginning of time, have been explored by our living

friends, our Murchison and Sedgwick, while the higher and more complicated

parts of the structure have been minutely examined by our Lyell, Forbes,

tants which received in primeval times the gift of life, and filled the land,
sea, and air with rejoicing myriads, through innumerable revolutions of the

planet, before in the fulness of time it pleased the Giver of all good to place

man upon the Earth, and hid him look up to Heaven.
   Wave succeeding wave, the forms of ancient life sweep across the ever-

changing surface of the earth ; revealing to us the height of the land, the

depth of the sea, the quality of the air, the course of the rivers, the extent of

--the forest, the system of life and death yes, the growth, decay, and death

of individuals, the beginning and ending of races, of many successive races
of plants and animals, in seas now dried, on sand-banks now raised into
mountains, on continents now sunk beneath the waters.

   Had that series a beginning ? Was the earth ever uninhabited, after it
became a globe turning on its axis and revolving round the sun ? Was there

--ever a period since land and sea were separated a period which we can
--trace when the land was not shaded by plants, the ocean not alive with

animals '? The answer, as it comes to us from the latest observation, declares

that in the lowest deposits of the most ancient seas in the stratified crust of
the globe, the monuments of life remain. They extend to the earliest sedi-

ments of water, now in part so changed as to appear like the products of fire.
What life ? Only the simpler and less specially organized fabrics have as

--yet rewarded research among these old Laurentian rocks only the aggre-

gated structures of Foraminifera have been found in what, for the present at

least, must be accepted as the first deposits of the oldest sea. The most

ancient of all known fossils, the Eozoon Canadense of Sir W. Logan, is of
this low, we may even say lowest, type of animal organization.

   Then step by step we are guided through the old Cambrian and Silurian
systems, rich in Trilobites and Brachiopoda, the delights of Salter and Da-
vidson ; with Agassiz and Miller and Egerton we read the history of the
strange old fishes of the Devonian rocks ; Brongniart, and Goppert, and
Dawson, and Binney, and Hooker unveil the mystery of the mighty forests
now converted to coal ; Mantell and Owen and Huxley restore for us the
giant reptiles of the Lias, the Oolite, and the Wealden ; Edwards and
Wright almost revive the beauteous corals and echinodermata ; which Avith
all the preceding tribes have come and gone before the dawn of the later
periods, when fragments of mammoths and hippopotami were buried in
caves and river sediments to reward the researches of Cuvier and Buckland,

Prestwich and Christy, Lartet and Falconer.

   And what is the latest term in this long series of successive existence ?

--Surely the monuments of ever- advancing art the temples whose origin is in

caverns of the rocks ; the cities which have taken the place of holes in the
ground, or heaps of stones and timber in a lake ; the ships which have out-
grown the canoe, as that was modelled from the floating trunk of a tree, are

sufficient proof of the late arrival of man upon the Earth, after it had under-
gone many changes and had become adapted to his physical, intellectual, and

moral nature.

    Compared with the periods which elapsed in the accomplishment of these

changes, how short is the date of those yet standing monoliths, cromlechs,
and circles of unhewn stone which are the oldest of human structures raised

in Western Europe, or of those more regular fabrics which attest the early
importance of the monarchs and people of Egypt, Assyria, and some parts of
America ! Yet tried by monuments of natural events which happened within

the age of man, the human family is old enough in Western Europe to have

been sheltered by caverns in the rocks, while herds of reindeer roamed in
1* REPORT 18G5.

Southern France*, and bears and hyenas were denizens of the South of

England f. More than this, remains of the rudest human art ever seen are
certainly found buried with and are thought to belong to races who lived
contemporaneously with the mammoth and rhinoceros, and experienced the

cold of a Gallic or British winter, from which the woolly covering of the
wild animals was a fitting protection.

    Our own annals begin with the Kelts, if indeed we are entitled to call by
that historic name the really separate nations, Belgian, Iberian, and Teu-
tonic, whom the Roman writers recognize as settlers in Britain J ; settlers
among a really earlier family, our rudest and oldest forefathers, who may

have been, as they thought themselves to be, the primitive people of the

land§. But beyond the KeXrai who occupied the sources of the Danube
and the slopes of the Pyrenees, and were known to Borne in later days, there
was present to the mind of the father of Grecian history a still more western
race, the Cynetae, who may perhaps be supposed the very earliest people of
the extreme west of the continent of Europe. Were those the people, the
first poor pilgrims from the East, whose footsteps we are slowly tracing in

the vaUeys of Picardy and the south of England, if not on the borders of the
lakes of Switzerland ? Are their kindred still to be found among the Rhaetic
Alps and the Asturian cliffs, if not amid the wilds of Connemara, pressed
into those mountainous recesses by the legions of Borne, the spear of the

Visigoth, and the sword of the Saxon ? Or must we regard them as races of
an earlier type, who had ceased to chip flints before the arrival of Saxon, or

Goth, or Kelt, or Cynetian ? These questions of romantic interest in the

study of the distribution and languages of the families of man are part of a

large circle of inquiry which finds sympathy in several of our Sections,
especially those devoted to Zoology, Physiology, and Ethnology. Let us not
expect or desire for them a very quick, or, at present, a very definite settle-
ment. Deep shadows have gathered over all the earlier ages of mankind,

which perhaps still longer periods of time may not avail to remove. Yet let
U3 not undervalue the progress of ethnological inquiry, nor fail to mark how,

within the period to which our recollections cling, the revelations of early
Egypt have been followed by a Chronology of the ancient kingdoms on the
Tigris and Euphrates, through the same rigorous study of language. Thus

has our Rawlinson added another page to the briUiant discoveries of Young
and Champollion, Lepsius and Bosellini.

   Nor, though obtained in a different way, must we forget the new know-
ledge of a people nearer home, which the philosophic mind of Keller has
opened to us among his native mountains. There, on the borders of the
Alpine lakes, before the great Roman general crossed the Bhone, lived a

people older than the Helvetians ; whose rude lives, passed in hunting and

fishing, were nevertheless marked by some of the many inventions which

everywhere, even in the most unfavourable situations, accompany the least
civihzed of mankind. Implements of stone and pottery of the rudest sort
belong to the earliest of these people ; while ornamented iron weapons of war,
and innumerable other fabrics in that metal, appear about the later habita-

tions, and correspond probably to tbe period of tbe true Helvetii, who quitted
their home and contended with Caesar for richer settlements in Gaul. The

people of whom these are the traces on almost every lake in Switzerland are

recognized as well in the ancient lake-basins of Lombardy and among the
Tyrolean Alps, and further on the north side of the mountains ; and probably
fresh discoveries may connect them with the country of the Sarmatians and

the Scythians.

    Thus at length is fairly opened, for archaeology and palaeontology to read,
a new chapter of the world's histoiy, which begins in the pleistocene periods
of geology, and reaches to the prehistoric ages of man. Did our ancestors
really contend, as the poets fancied*, with stones and clubs against the lion
and the rhinoceros, and thus expel them from their native haunts, or have

they been removed by change of climate or local physical conditions ? Was

the existence of the hyena and the elephant only possible in Western Europe

while a climate prevailed there such as now belongs to Africa or India ? and

was this period of high temperature reduced in a later time for the elk, rein-
deer, and musk ox, which undoubtedly roamed over the hills of England and
France? If we think so, what a vista of long duration stretches before us, for no
such changes of climate can be supposed to have occurred except as the effect of

great physical changes, requiring a lapse of many thousands of years. And
though we may think such changes of climate not proved, and probably
careful weighing of evidence may justify our disbelief, still, if the valleys in

Picardy have been excavated since the deposit of the gravel of St. Acheulf,
and the whole face of the country has been altered about the caverns of

--Torquay since they received remains of animals and traces of man J how

can we admit these facts and yet refuse the time required for their accomplish-
ment '? First, let us be sure of the facts, and especially of that main fact

upon which all the argument involving immensity of time really turns, viz.

the contemporaneous existence of man with the mammoth of the plains and
the bear of the caverns. The remains of men are certainly buried with those
of extinct quadrupeds ; but did they live in the same days, or do we see relics

of different periods gathered into one locality by natural processes of a later

date, or confused by the operations of men ?

    Before replying finally to these qiuvstions, further researches of an exact
kind are desirable, and the Association has given its aid towards them, both in
respect to the old cavern of Kent's Hole, and the newly opened fissure of

Gibraltar, from which we expect great results, though the best of our la-
bourers has ceased from his honourable toil§. When these and many other
researches are completed, some future Lyell, if not our own great geologist,
may add some fresh chapters to the ' Antiquity of Man.'

   In judging of this antiqiuty, in counting the centuries which may have
elapsed since smoothed flints fitted with handles of wood were used as chisels

 and axes by the earliest people of Scandinavia or Helvetia, and flakes of flint

 were employed to cleanse the skins of the reindeer in the caves of the Dor-

dogne, or stronger tools broke up the ice in the valley of the Somme, we
must be careful not to take what is the mark of low civilization for the indi-
cation of very remote time. In every country, among every race of men,

 such rude weapons and tools are used now, or were used formerly. On the
 banks of the Ohio, no less than on the English hills, mounds of earth, rude

 pottery, and stone weapons occur in abundance ; and indicate similar wants,

contrivances, customs, ideas, in different races of men living in different
periods. Even when in the same country, as in Switzerland, or England, or

Denmark, successive deposits of instruments of stone, bronze, or iron ; suc-
 cessive burials of pines, beeches, and oaks ; successively extinguished races of
elephants, elks, and reindeer, give us a real scale of elapsed time, it is one of
which the divisions are not yet valued in years or centuries of years.

    Toward a right judgment of the length of this scale of human occupation,
two other lines of evidence may be thought worthy of notice ; one founded

on the anatomical study of the remains of early men, the other on the laws of
language. If the varieties of physical structure in man, and the deviations
of language from an original type, be natural effects of time and circumstance,

the length of time may be in some degree estimated by the amount of the

diversities which are observed to have happened, compared with the varia-

tion which is now known to be happening. This process becomes imaginary,
unless we assume all mankind to have had one local centre, and one original
language. Its results must be erroneous, unless we take fully into account the

superior fixity of languages which are represented in writing, and the greater
tendency to diversity of every kind which must have prevailed in early times,

when geographical impediments were aggravated by dissocial habits of life. It

appears, however, certain that some differences of language, organization,

and habits have separated men of apparently unlike races during periods

longer than those which rest on historical facts*.
   Ever since the days of Aristotle, the analogy existing among all parts of

the animal kingdom, and in a general sense we may say among all the forms

of life, has become more and more the subject of special study. Related as
all living beings are to the element in which they move and breathe, to
the mechanical energies of nature which they employ or resist, and to the
molecular forces which penetrate and transform them, some general confor-
mity of structure, some frequently recurring resemblance of function, must
be present, and cannot be overlooked. In the several classes this analogy
grows stronger, and in the subdivisions of these classes real family affinity is
recognized. In the smallest divisions which have this family relation in the
highest degree, there seems to be a line which circumscribes each group,
within which variations occur, from food, exercise, climate, and transmitted

peculiarities. Often one specific group approaches another, or several others,

and a question arises whether, though now distinct, or rather distinguishable,

they always have been so from their beginning, or will be always so until

their disappearance.

   Whether what we call species are so many original creations or derivations

from a few types or one type, is discussed at length in the elegant treatise of
Darwin f, himself a naturalist of eminent rank. It had been often discussed

before. Nor will any one think lightly of such inquiries, who remembers
the essay of Linnaeus, " De Tulluris orbis incremento," or the investigations
of Brown, Prichard, Forbes, Agassiz, and Hooker regarding the local origin

of different species, genera, and families of plants and animals, both on the
land and in the sea. Still less will he be disposed to undervalue its import-

ance, when he reflects on the many successive races of living forms more or

less resembling our existing quadrupeds, reptiles, fishes, and mollusca, which

appeared to have occupied definite and different parts of the depths of an-

cient time ; as now the tiger and the jaguar, the cayman and the gavial, live

on different parts of the terrestrial surface. Is the living elephant of Ceylon

the lineal descendant of that mammoth which roamed over Siberia and Eu-

rope and North America, or of one of those sub-Himalayan tribes which Dr.
Falconer has made known, or was it a species dwelling only in circumpolar
regions ? Can our domestic cattle, horses and dogs, our beasts of chace and

our beasts of prey, be traced back to their source in older types, contempo-

raries of the IJrus, Megaceros, and Hyena on the plains of Europe ? If so,
what range of variation in structure does it indicate ? if not so, by what

characters are the living races separated from those of earlier date ?
    Specific questions of this kind must be answered before the general pro-

position, that the forms of life are indefinitely variable with time and cir-
cumstance, can be even examined by the light of adequate evidence. That
such evidence will be gathered and rightly interpreted, I for one neither
doubt nor fear ; nor will any be too hasty in adopting extreme opinions or

too fearful of the final result, who remember how often that which is true
has been found very different from that which was plausible, and how often
out of the nettles of danger we have plucked the flowers of safety. At the
present moment the three propositions which were ever present to the mind
of Edward Forbes may be successfully maintained, as agreeing with many
observed phenomena ; and around them as a basis of classification may be

gathered most of the facts and most of the speculations which relate to the

history of life*. First, it may be admitted that plants and animals form
many natural groups, the members of which have several common characters,

and are parted from other groups by a real boundary line, or rather unoccu-

pied space. Next, that each of these groups has a limited distribution in
space, often restrained by high mountains or deep seas, or parallels of tem-
perature, within which it has been brought into being. Thirdly, that each

group has been submitted to, or is now undergoing, the pressure of a general

law, by which its duration is limited in geological time ; the same group
never reappearing after being removed from the series.

   How important, in the view of this and many other questions, is that

never-tiring spirit of geographical and maritime discovery, to which through
four hundred years Europe has sent her noblest sons and her most famous
expeditions ; sent them, alas ! too often to an early grave. Alas ! for

Franklin, who carried the magnetic flag into the Icy Sea from which he had
already brought trophies to Science ! Alas ! for Speke, who came home with

honour from the head waters of the Nile ! Forgotten they can never be,

whenever, on occasions like this, we mourn the absence of our bravest and
our best ; praise, never-ending praise be theirs, while men retain the generous
impulse which prompts them to enterprises worthy of their country and bene-

ficial to mankind

their efforts to accomplish purposes which we approve. In all instances our

elastic system responds quickly to pressure, and returns the friendly impulse.

If we look back on the work of previous years, it is easy to mark the special

action of the Association in fields which hardly could be entered by any other

adventurers.

   Many of the most valuable labours of which we are now reaping the fruits,

were undertaken in consequence of the reports on special branches of Science

--which appear in the early volumes of our Transactions reports in which

particular data were requested for confirming or correcting known genera-
lizations, or for establishing new ones. Thus a passage in Professor Airy's
report on Physical Astronomy* first turned the attention of Adams to the
mathematical vision of Neptune ; Lubbock's Report on Tides f came before
the experimental researches and reductions, which since 1834 have so often
engaged the attention of Whewell and Airy and Haughton, with results so
valuable and so suggestive of further undertakings. Among these results
may be placed additional knowledge of the probable depth of the channels of

the sea. For before the desire of telegraphic communication with America
had caused the bed of the North Atlantic to be explored by soundings to a
depth seldom exceeding three miles, there was reason to conclude from the
investigations of Whewell on Cotidal Lines J that a depth of nine miles was
attained in the Sonth Atlantic, and from the separate computations of Aiiy
and Haughton that a somewhat greater depth occurred in a part of the course
of the tide-wave which washes the coast of Ireland§. The greater portion of
the sea-bed is within reach of soundings directed by the superior skill and
greater perseverance of modern scientific navigators ; a depth of six miles is
said to have been reached in one small tract of the North Atlantic ; depths of
nine or ten miles in the deepest channels of the sea are probable from consi-
dering the general proportion which is likely to obtain between sea-depths
and mountain-tops. Thus the data are gradually being collected for a com-
plete survey of the bed of the sea, including among other things information,
at least, concerning the distribution of animal and vegetable life beneath tbe

waters.

  --Waves their origin, the mechanism of their motion, their velocity, their

elevation, the resistance they offer to vessels of given form, these subjects
have been firmly kept in view by the Association, since first Professor Challis

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ||

reported on the mathematical problems they suggest, and Sir J. Robison and
Mr. Scott Russell undertook to study them experimentally^. Out of this in-
quiry has come a better knowledge of the forms which ought to be given to
the ' lines ' of ships, followed by swifter passages across the sea, both by
sailing vessels and steamers, of larger size and greater lengths than were ever

tried before**.

    One of the earliest subjects to acquire importance in our thoughts, was the
unexplored region of meteorology laid open in Professor J. Forbes's Reportsft.
Several of the points to which he called attention have been successfully at-
tained. The admirable instruments of Whewell, Osier, and Robinson have
replaced the older and ruder anemometers, and are everywhere in full opera-

tion, to record the momentary variations of pressure, or sum the varying
velocities of the 'wind. No small thanks were due to Mr. Marshall and Mr.
Miller* for their enterprise and perseverance in placing rain-gauges and

thermometers amidst the peaks of Cumberland and Westmoreland. These

experiments are now renewed in both counties and in North Wales ; and I
hope to hear of similar efforts among the mountains of the West of Ireland
and the West of Scotland. Our meteorological instruments of every kind

have been improved ; our system of photographic registration has spread

from Kew into other observatories ; and our corresponding member, Pro-

fessor Dove, has collected into systematic maps and tables the lines and
figures which represent annual and monthly climate over every land and

sea.

   In the same manner, by no sudden impulse or accidental circumstance,

rose to its high importance that great system of magnetic observations, on
which for more than a quarter of a century the British Association and the

Royal Society, acting in concert, have been intent. First, we had Eeports

on the mathematical theory and experimental researches of magnetism by

--Christie (1833), Whewell (1835), and Sabine (1835) : afterwards, a magnetic

survey of the British Islands t ; then, the establishment of a complete obser-
vatory at Dublin, with newly arranged instruments, by Dr. Lloyd, in 1838.

On all this gathered experience we founded a memorial to Her Majesty's
Government, made a grant of £400 from our funds for preliminary expenses,

and presented to the Meeting of this Association in Birmingham, in 1839, a

Report of progress, signed by Herschel and Lloyd. From that time how
great the labour, how inestimable the fruits ! Ross sails to the magnetic
pole of the south ; America and Russia cooperate with our observers at Kew,

Toronto, and St. Helena ; and General Sabine, by combining all this united

--labour, has the happiness of seeing results established of which no man

dreamed laws of harmonious variation affecting the magnetic elements of
the globe, in definite relation to the earth's movement, the position of the
sun and moon, the distribution of temperature, and the situation in latitude
and longitude J.

   Our efforts have not been fruitless, whether with Mr. Mallet we make ex-

periments on artificial earth-shocks at Dalkey, or survey the devastations
round Vesuvius, or tabulate the records of earthquakes since the beginning of

history§ ; or establish the Kew Observatory as a scientific workshop where

new instruments of research are made and proved and set to work ||; or

dredge the sea with Forbes, and Brady, and Jeffreys If; or catalogue the
stars with Baily** ; or investigate electricity with Harris, Ronalds, Thomson,

and Jenkin*; or try the action of long-continued heat with Harcourtf:

in these and a hundred other directions, our attempts to gain knowledge

have brought back new facts and new laws of phenomena, or better instru-

ments for attaining or better methods for interpreting them. Even when

we enter the domain of practical art, and apply scientific methods to test a

great process of manufacture, we do not fail of success ; because we are

able to join in united exertion the laborious cultivators of science and the

scientific employers of labour.

  Am I asked to give an example? Let it be iron, the one substance by

the possession of which, by the true knowledge and right use of which,

--more than by any other thing, our national greatness is supported. "What

are the ores of iron what the peculiarities and improvements of the

--tion its strength in columns and girders as cast iron ; in rails and
--boiler plate, in tubes and chains, as wrought iron what are the best

forms in which to employ it, the best methods of preserving it from

--decay ; these and many other questions are answered by many special

Reports in our volumes, bearing the names of Barlow, Mallet, Porter, Fair-

bairn, Bunsen, Playfair, Percy, Budd, Hodgkinson, Thomson ; and very nu-

merous other communications from Lucas, Fairbairn, Cooper, Nicholson,

Price, Crane, Hartley, Davy, Mushet, Hawkes, Penny, Scoresby, Dawes,

Calvert, Clark, Cox, Hodgkinson, May, Schafhaeutl, Johnston, Clay, and

Boutigny. Beyond a question, a reader of such of these valuable documents

as relate to the strength of iron, in its various forms, would be far better in-

formed of the right course to be followed in experiments on armour-plated

ships and forts to resist assault, and in the construction of ordnance to at-

tack them, than he is likely to be from merely witnessing a thousand trials

of the cannon against the target. Anyone who remembers what the iron

furnace was forty years ago, and knows its present power of work, or who

contrasts the rolling mills and hammers of other days with the beautiful ma-

chines which now, with the gentlest motion but irresistible force, compel the

strong metal to take up the most delicately moulded form, will acknowledge

that, within the period since the British Association began to set itself to the

task of reconciling the separated powers of Theory and Experience, there

has been a total change in the aspect of each, to the great advantage of both.

WeOur undertakings have not been fruitless.  attempted what we had

well considered, and had the power to accomplish ; and we had the more than
willing help of competent persons of our own body, the friendly aid of other

Institutions, and the sanction of the Government, convinced of the sincerity

of our purpose and the wisdom of our recommendations.
   The same work is ever before us ; the same prudence is always necessary ; the

same aid is always ready. Great indeed should be our happiness, in reflecting on

the many occasions, when the Royal Society in particular, and other Institutions

older than our own, have readily placed themselves by our side, to share our re-

sponsibility and diminish our difliculties. But for this, our wishes might not al-
ways have prevailed ; and the horizon of science would not have been so clear

as now it is. Of late years, indeed, Societies formed on our model have taken
up special parts of our work ; and thus to some extent have relieved us of the

pressure of communications relating to the practice of particular professions
and the progress of some public questions. Not that scientific agriculture,

social statistics, or physiology are neglected in our meetings, but that these and

 other practical subjects are found to have more than one aspect, and to re-
 quire more than one mode of treatment. With us, facts well ascertained,
 conclusions rightly drawn, will ever be welcome, from whatever quarter of
 the horizon of science they make their appearance. Whatever societies cul-

 tivate these objects, they are our allies, and we will help them, if we may.
 With pleasure we receive proofs of the good work done in limited districts by
 the many admirable Field Clubs formed by our countrymen ; whether, like

 those of Tyneside and the Cotswolds, and in this immediate vicinity those of
 Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and Dudley, they explore the minutest re-

 cesses of our hills and glens ; or, bike the rangers of the Alps, bring us new

 facts regarding glaciers, ancient climate, and altered levels of land and sea.

    By these agreeable gatherings natural history is most favourably com-
 mended ; and in the activity and enlarged views of the officers who conduct

 them, the British Association recognizes the qualities by which the vitality
 of scientific research is maintained, and its benefits diffused among the pro-
 vincial Institutions of the Empire.

    Such, Gentlemen, are some of the thoughts which fill the minds of those,

who, like our Brewster, and Harcourt, and Forbes, and Murchison, and Dau-
beny, stood, anxious but hopeful, by the cradle of this British Association
and who now meet to judge of its strength, and measure its progress. When,
 more than thirty years ago, this Parliament of science came into being, its
first child -language was employed to ask questions of Nature ; now, in riper

years, it founds on the answers received further and more definite inquiries
directed to the same prolific source of useful knowledge. Of researches in

science completed, in progress, or in beginning, each of our annual volumes
contains some three hundred or more passing notices, or full and permanent

records. This digest and monument of our labours is indeed in some respects

 incomplete, since it does not always contain the narrative or the result of

undertakings which we started, or fostered, or sustained ; and I own to

having experienced on this account once or twice a feeling of regret. But
the regret was soon lost in the gratification of knowing that other and equally
beneficial channels of pubbcation had been found ; and that by these ex-
amples it was proved how truly the Association kept to the real purpose of
its foundation, " the Advancement of Science," and how heartily it rejoiced
in this advancement without looking too closely to its own share in the
triumph. Here, indeed, is tbe stronghold of the British Association. Where-
ever and by whatever means sound learning and useful knowledge are ad-
vanced, there to us are friends. Whoever is privileged to step beyond his
fellows on the road of scientific discovery, will receive our applause, and, if
need be, our help. Welcoming and joining in the labour of all, we shall
keep our place among those who clear the ways and remove the obstacles
from the paths of science ; and whatever be our own success in the rich

fields which lie before us, however little we may now know, we shall
prove that in this our day we knew at least the value of knowledge, and

joined hearts and hands in the endeavour to promote it.

                                    ON

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

       Report on Dredging among the Channel Isles.

                By J. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.R.S.

Our dredgings, which occupied six weeks, were confined to the coasts of

Guernsey and Jersey. Owing to the rocky nature of the sea-hed, and to the

extraordinary rapidity of the tides, the work was very difficult and unsatis-

factory ; and one of my dredges was unavoidably lost, notwithstanding the

rope was a new one and every precaution had been taken to prevent an

accident of this kind. The depth of water seldom exceeded 30 fathoms

although there was one remarkable exception in a long submarine trough,

called Hurd's Deep, lying about fifteen miles north of Guernsey, and having

a depth of 60 fathoms and more.

As regards the Mollusca (to which I shall, as in former Beports, confine

myself), they exhibit somewhat of a Mediterranean or South-European cha-

racter. This will appear from the accompanying lists. No new species were

procured; but scientific research does not consist entirely of such discoveries.

It may be well questioned whether the reduction of some forms, which have

heretofore been regarded as species, to the rank of varieties may not be of

equal importance. The sexual relation of known species, their development,

mode of growth, food, habits, economy, geographical and bathymetrical dis-

tribution, are all matters which require careful investigation. I had likewise

an opportunity of observing for the first time the animals or soft parts of

several species of shell-bearing Mollusca, and of rectifying the published

descriptions of other species. In the first of these categories I would

enumerate Cardium papillosum, Rissoa crenulata, R. striatula, Defrancia

Philberti, and Mangelia laevigata. In the second category may be placed

Qaleomma Turtoni, Chiton discrepans, C. cancellatus, and Trochus exasperatus.

Among the rarer or more local species taken by us were Argiope capsula,

Cardium papillosum, Tellina balaustina, and Crimora papillata. It was also

noteworthy that Aplysia depilans and A. punctata (usually considered distinct

species) copulated when a pair was placed in a vessel of sea-water. This

genus is not hermaphrodite in the same sense as Helix, inasmuch as each

individual of Aplysia performs the functions of one sex only, while each snail

wards of 40 feet. This is very different from what takes place in the Medi-

terranean, and it occasions a remarkable variation of habitat in many species.

Psammohia costulata lives at Herm in the sand which is laid bare at low

water, but in Shetland it occurs at a depth of between 80 and 90 fathoms.

Hence we may infer that the depth of water cannot always be safely pre-

dicated from a cursory examination of shells either in a recent or fossil state.

Their comparative solidity and size afford better criteria *.

  A collection of the shells obtained on the present occasion has been placed

in the British Museum.

  We were indebted to Mr. Lukis, Mr. Gallienne, Mr. Macculloch, Mr. Le

Lievre and Mr. Cooper, of Guernsey, and to Mr. Piquet and Mr. Rose of

Jersey, for much assistance and pleasant companionship. From the first-

named of these gentlemen I received Purpura hcemastoma, from the second

Emarginula cancellata, and from the third Triton (or Murex) cutaceus, all of

which had been taken alive at Guernsey and Herm. There cannot be the

slightest reason to doubt that Triton nodiferus, as well as T. cutaceus, inhabit

MM.this part of our seas.                                               Cailliaud and Tasle have recorded the latter

species, and M. Cailliaud the former, as natives of the coast of Brittany.

Off Jersey were dredged a few worn specimens of Cerithium vulgatum, a

species which does not seem to have been observed in a living state anywhere

on the shores of the North Atlantic. It is common throughout the Medi-

terranean and Adriatic. M. Cailliaud has included it in his list of shells from
the Loire-Inferieure, but only in a dead and rolled condition. From careful

inquiries which I made at Jersey, I am enabled to state with some degree

of certainty that no ballast containing shells has ever been brought there.

I should be disposed to attribute the presence of C. vulgatum (as a semi-

fossil shell) on the coasts of Jersey and Lower Brittany to an ancient sub-
mergence of the land, at a period probably anterior to that when submarine

forests and peat-beds were formed on the shores of the north of Europe, and

when the bays of St. Aubin and St. Michel were produced. Fossil shells, of

Eocene species, were likewise met with ; and they will be noticed in the

Geological Section of this Meeting.

The following Tables may be useful to show which species are apparently

restricted to the more southern limits of Great Britain.

reckoned 80 as peculiar to each extremity (and 80 more as inhabiting
the intermediate area only) ; so that 360 is the probable number of species
belonging to the Channel Isles and Shetland. The Mediterranean has from

700 to 800 species.

     Report on the Cultivation of Oysters by Natural and Artificial

         Methods. By Frank Buckland, M.A., M.R.C.S., §-c.

Feeling highly honoured with the confidence you have placed in me to_ in-

--quire into this subject--important not only in a physiological but also in a

commercial bearing I have since the last Meeting used my best endeavours

--to obtain all the facts and all the information circumstances and labour would

allow and this not only near at home, but also at distant localities. I would

                                                                            b2
4 REPORT 1865.

beg to state that the facts hereafter mentioned are in no ease derived from
books, but from actual observation and experiment.

   I have found that there is an amazing amount of most valuable informa-

tion, because the result of practical experience, afloat. This information lias,
however, never yet been properly collected, sorted, and reduced to a scientific

bearing. The further, moreover, that I investigate the question of that most
mysterious mollusk the Oyster, the more I find that, after all, we know little

or nothing at all about it.

   The cultivation of the full-grown oyster is indeed pretty well known after

it has arrived over the state of " brood ;" but in its earliest stages of deve-
lopment comparatively little or nothing is known. It is the more important
therefore to turn our attention in this direction, as legislation is actually at
fault in the matter, and, as recent events have proved, those whose duties it

is to make laws for the fisheries hardly know what laws to make.

   I would propose to divide my Eeport under several heads

   1. The cultivation of the oyster by natural means.
   2. The cultivation of the oyster by artificial means.
   3. Experiments in hatching by artificial heat.
    4. Experiments on a large scale on the fore shore.
   5. The chemical analysis of the oyster.
   6. On dredging.

    7. Comparison of the French and English system of oyster-culture.
    8. Experiments on oyster-spat.

   9. On the cause of greenness in oysters.

   Although we know not as yet the actual process by means of which the

delicate and thin-shelled young spat manages to cling to various substances,

yet we can by observation find out the objects which it seems to prefer; and

these I woidd place in order as follows :
    1 The shell of the living oyster.
   2. The shell of the dead oyster, technically called " Culch."
   3. The shells of mussels, periwinkles, whelks, clams.

    4. Pieces of crockery, glass, tiles, tobacco-pipes.

    5. Iron.

   6. Wood.

    I would propose to examine these in rotation.

  --1. T7ie Shell of the Living Oyster. In the natural state, when not dis-

turbed by the hand of man, we find that the tendency of the oyster is to

accumulate in large groups, crowded and packed together in the most fan-

tastic shapes. You find them of all ages, the nucleus of the group being a

very old oyster, and around it oysters of ages varying from six or eight years

to spat of as many months. It is curious to remark that these oysters have

a tendency to accommodate each other ; for I find that very seldom is there a

dead one among the group, but that they are for the most part alive and

thriving.

   There is a locality in the North Sea, known to the deep-sea trawlers,

not far from the island of Heligoland, in lat. 54° to 55°, long. 5° to 6°
the trawlers avoid this spot, because the great clumps of oysters cut then-

nets and do much damage. By the kindness of my friend Mr ."Thomas, owner
of the trawling-smack ' Hurricane,' I am enabled to show samples of these

oysters ; and I cannot but think that, were capital provided, and if expe-

rienced men undertook the task, the fishing of this oyster-bank, at the present

high price of oysters, would turn out to be a remunerative speculation. The
CULTIVATION OF OYSTERS BY NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL METHODS. 5

oysters are exceedingly thin, but, as direct experiment proves, they are

capable of being fattened if placed in a favourable locality.

 --2. TJie Shells of the Bead Oyster, technically called " Culch" I look upon

the study of the culch and its management as one of the most important
things in oyster-culture ; for upon its state, whether abundant or not abun-
dant, whether clean or dirty, depends the detaining or the loss of the young
oysters after they are emitted from the mother's shell, and also the important

question as to whether the public grounds (or commons) should or should not

be taken by private companies.

  We start the question with two facts :

   1. That the oyster will adhere to dead oyster-shells in preference to any

other substance, even the shells of the living oyster.

   2. That in order that the spat may adhere, tbe culch must be perfectly
clean and free from mud and weed.

   There are but few localities where the shells of the dead oysters have ac-

cumulated in sufficient quantity to give the spat a chance of adhering ; it is

therefore necessary to collect these shells from elsewhere and throw them

down upon localities where the spat is likely to fall. This process is carried

out by oyster- culturists on a pretty large scale ; and it seems almost provi-

dential that beds of oyster-shells should be found in the neighbourhood of
the grounds which are cultivated. Thus, for instance, you will see on the

map a place called the " Pan Sand," at the mouth of the Thames. Now, near

this spot there is an accumulation of oyster-shells ; and dredging-boats from
various localities dredge up these shells and carry them on to places nearer
inshore, and throw them again to the bottom of the sea, knowing full well

that, if there be spat floating about, and if they be in a proper condition to

Howadhere, these shells will assuredly catch it.  this Pan Sand oyster-bed

came into existence I am quite unable to tell you ; but, from the appearance

of the oysters themselves, I can assert that the oysters were of great age,

that they had lived there many years undisturbed by dredges, and that a con-

siderable time has elapsed since they thrived in this locality.

   Hence we learn an important fact, viz. that the spat seems to prefer adher-
ing to a shell that is partially decayed, and softened, rather than to a new shell

lately placed down. So great is the value of oyster-shells as " culch," that I

have often cast a longing eye upon the shells which are carted away in large

quantities from the oyster-shops in London and thrown on dust-heaps. They

would be of much greater value if thrown on to the bottom of the sea, where

they would certainly, if the season were favourable, form a trap for the

floating spat. Such, however, is the abundance of old oyster-shells on the

Pan Sand, that having, with the officers of the oyster -fishery with which I am

connected, considered the idea, we find it would be cheaper to fetch them

from the Pan Sand.

   I cannot, however, quit the subject of oyster-shells without lamenting

that no use has yet been found for them on land. They are now to lands-

men but waste material ; and I cannot help thinking that, if technology were

to throw her lamp upon the matter, a use might be found for them. True it

is that they make good lime ; but lime can be obtained from other materials
at a less expense. The fact, however, of the lime of the oyster-shell being

so very good has led my friend Mr. Bartlett, Superintendent of the Zoological

Gardens, to give them in a burnt state to poultry and the more valuable

breeding pheasants. The birds seem to like it much, and it certainly is be-

neficial to laying hens and growing chicks. Another use of oyster-shells I

have lately heard of. Mr. Browning, of Paglesham, tells me that the poor
6 KEPORT 1865.

people grind the shell and take as much of the powder as will cover a four-

penny piece as a cure for ague.

     We3. will now consider the third materials the spat loves to fasten itself

to.  The  most  prominent  of  these  is  "                                                     1  I am enabled to show you

                                             mussels.'

several fine specimens where oysters have adhered to mussels. The reason

of this is obviously that the shell of the mussel presents the two requisites

--for the adhesion of the spat perfect cleanliness and great smoothness.

Oyster-proprietors shoxdd treasure this fact carefully in their memory, and

should apply it. Mussels in beds form one of the greatest enemies to oysters,

for they spin their web over them, accumulate mud, and suffocate the oysters

beneath. They should therefore be dredged up, placed on the foreshore to

die and decay, and the shells thrown back into the sea at the places where

the spat is expected to fall.

   For some reason or other the spat seems to like the shell of the common
whelk, especially when the animal is dead. I now show you several specimens

to prove this fact. Whelks, however, are far too valuable, not only as hunian

food, but also as a bait for the cod in the North Sea cod-fishery, to which

locality they are annually sent in quantities of such enormous money-value, to

prevent our ever thinking of using whelk-shells as cidch in large quantities.

     The spat will also adhere to clams and to cockles. There is a large bed of

these shells outside the mouth of the River Crouch in Essex ; and friends
of mine who have oyster-fisheries in this region dredge large quantities to

place down on their grounds. I show you samples of all these facts.

  We4. cannot be too observant of facts. I now show you a common

saucer, on which oysters of three years old have fastened themselves. It was

dredged up at a place called the Sandheads. at the nioiith of the Thames ; it

is marked Queen's Channel in the maps. The French oyster-culturists have

long been aware of the fact shown by the saucer, and in their oyster-parks

place down all the broken potteryware they can find; and to these the

--oysters will adhere in considerable numbers that is, in France. Unglazed

earthenware has also attractions for the oyster ; and upon this fact is founded

the whole system of catching oysters by means of earthenware tiles, as I

shall state hereafter.

   5. It has often been a question as to whether oysters will or will not adhere

to iron. I am able to answer this in the affirmative. The piles which sup-

port the pier at Heine Bay are covered over with broad-headed iron nails,

and upon these, when the tides are very low, I have frequently found oysters

Aadhering.      dredgerman, moreover, lately brought me in an exceedingly

fine specimen, viz. the square bit of iron that A\as used formerly to go round

the head of the wooden stock of an anchor ; upon this square bit of iron I

found no less than twenty-four oysters pf various sizes and ages.

     6. Oysters will also adhere to wood. Much has been said lately upon the

advantage of placing down fascines or faggots for the use of the young oyster.

I at once pronounce this to be a delusion and a snare, and I entreat those

interested in the matter never to go to any trouble or expense in placing
down fascines for this purpose. The experiment has been tried over and

over again in England, and with the simple residt that the fascines are ex-

cellent cellectors of mud and seaweeds, sometimes of barnacles, but hardly
ever of spat. I now show you two solitary specimens, one from the Isle of

Re, and the other from Mr. Wiseman's grounds at Paglesham ; but the

failures in this direction so much preponderate over the successes that I

should never advise their use.

  In the experiments now under my charge at Heme Bay, it is true, I have
   CULTIVATION OF OYSTERS Bl NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL METHODS. 7

--used fascines very largely, and this for two reasons first, to try the expe-

riment of catching oysters with them ; and secondly, to make the fascines
do the very work they seemed most inclined to do, viz. to collect the weeds
and the mud. I made with these fascines enclosures of various sizes and
shapes, and inside them I placed the tiles, which were thus guarded both
from the mud and also from the long belt-weed, which bothered me much by
floating among the tiles and upsetting them. This is a good example of one
of the difficulties of oyster-culture, and a proof that he who undertakes such
matters must closely observe the actions of various materials when placed in
the sea, and use these natural tendencies to the advancement of the object he

has in view. I show a water-colour drawing of my works at Heme Bay.

                                            On Dredging.

  The subject of dredging has occupied my most serious attention. It is a

question upon which legislation is at fault, or rather those who make the
laws know not what laws they ought to make, as they have not studied the

natural history of the animal which they wish to protect from injury.
   Dredging consists in sailing over the grounds and scraping the ground with

an instrument called a dredge ; it is made chiefly of iron : the front part of
it has a sharpish edge to pick up the oysters, which are received into a network,
the network being of chain in the deep-sea dredging-boats, of cow's hide- in
those boats which fish in more shallow water.

   As the dredge passes over the bottom of the sea it performs two opera-

tions :

   1st. It picks up what oysters it may happen to meet with in its course.
   2nd. It clears away the mud and dirt from the stones over which it passes.

   The failure of spat has been popularly attributed to over dredging, i. e. the
ground has been so much worked that all the oysters have been taken off
from it, and none left for breeding-purposes. This theory I hold to be some-
what fallacious. True it is that the Jersey beds are now unproductive ; but
I fear that unless they are regularly dredged they will remain for ever \m-

--productive. It is well known and it is one of the first principles in oyster-
--culture that in order to enable the spat to adhere the culch must be perfectly

clean ; if it is not dredged the mud will quickly accumulate on it, and there

will be no places left fit for the reception of spat, should there happen to be

spat.

    It has been argued that if no parent oysters are left on the bed to spat

there can be no young ones bom to adhere to the culch. The answer to this

is, that no number of dredges can pick up all the oysters on a given space
of ground, and that there will be enough left to stock the ground should there

be " a fall of spat," in other words, should the spat live after it has been
emitted from the mother's shell.

    Supposing the ground to have but few oysters left on it on account of the

place being so much worked with the dredge, the young oysters (should it

be a favourable year for them) would find plenty of harbour on the clean
culch, and the grounds would be restocked. Supposing, on the contrary, that
the ground is thoroughly stocked with oysters, and has not been dredged for
some time, they must all of them inevitably perish, on account of the culch
being covered with mud, even though the year has been favourable for their

living.

   I would, however, draw a serious distinction as regards locality. In the
case of the deep-sea oyster-beds, I should certainly not permit any dredging
to go on during the months that the oysters are spatting, for the simple rea-
 8 REPORT 1865.

 son that there is but very little mud and dirt about, and that therefore it

 cannot collect to a great extent upon the culch.

    In the case, however, of oyster-beds, -whether common or private, situated

 in rivers or near the mouths of rivers, I should advise the dredging to be
 continued with the greatest vigour up to the time that the first spat is seen
 on the culch, and then, and not till then, should the beds be allowed to re-
main quiet.

    It has been proposed to stop the dredging during the months of May and
 June. What would be the inevitable consequence ? It is during the months
 of May and June that the sea flora is most luxuriant ; every stone and shell

 would become coated with weed and slime-like- material of some kind or
 another, and this vegetable varnish upon it would entirely prevent the young
 oysters adhering to the culch, and they would inevitably perish. If, on the
 contrary, the dredges are kept well going during these two months, the culch
will become thoroughly clean, and the spat will be able to adhere to the sur-

face thus prepared for them.

    The dredge in going over the ground would not, I feel convinced, do injury

cither to the spawning oyster or to the young spat. The former may be

knocked about without any injury to its constitution, and the latter are so
very minute that they would escape destruction by the dredge. Shoidd,
however, even the dredge destroy numbers of them, the mischief done would
be well compensated by the space of ground cleaned and got ready for others

for it must be recollected that when the oysters on a well-stocked bed are
at the height of spatting the water must be perfectly full of them.

    Some friends of mine, whose riving depends upon oysters, never think of
taking off the dredges from their best spatting-ground until they see the
spat fixed upon the culch. The theory that dredging during spatting-time
injures the spat, they know perfectly well ; they have therefore tried the
experiment of leaving certain portions of the ground untouched ; the conse-
quence has been that less spat was found upon this ground than upon the
neighbouring grounds where dredging was going on all the time ; the grounds,
in fact, which had been most dredged had most spat upon them. The case of
the flats outside Whitstable is very remarkable. Large numbers of boats from
"VVhitstable and other parts have for many years past been in the habit of
dredging these flats every day in the year, and all the year round ; it follows
to reason that, unless it paid the men to go there, they would resort to other

--places. They, however, keep to the flats a plain proof that oysters are there.

They are there; and the reason is, that perpetual dredging has kept the
ground clean, and that the spat floating about from the oysters on the neigh-
bouring beds, these flats, and other places find a place suited for them, and
adhere there. Could we look at the bottom of the sea at the mouth of the
Thames, we should find a well-marked spot covered with oysters more or less,
whereas all the ground surrounding it woidd be blank, containing no oysters
at all. In illustration of this fact, I woidd imagine a large number of corn
seeds thrown from the sky on to Salisbury Plain : should there happen to be
a ploughed field in the plain, the seed would fall into the earth prepared for
its reception, would germinate and grow ; whereas if it fell on the ground
not so prepared it must inevitably perish.

   This question of dredging very seriously affects the taking in of common

--ground and applying it to private purposes. Two cases lately occurred the

one where Parliament granted the Heme Bay Company a considerable tract

which had hitherto been common ground ; the other case is that of the Eoach
Eiver Fishery, where Parliament refused to give over the commons to a pri-
CULTIVATION OF OYSTERS BY NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL METHODS. 9

vate company. I premise by stating that commons are absolutely necessary

for the stocking of private beds ; they are generally in the neighbourhood of

private beds, and the spat which falls upon them is the produce of the oysters

upon the private bed. These commons are worked by poor men to obtain

what they can upon them, and sell them to the owners of the beds ; in so

doing they keep the ground clean for the reception of spat.

In the case of the Roach River Fishery, the commons are situated in a

comparatively narrow river, and the commons adjoin the private beds almost

as near as the various paving stones in the streets. The spat, therefore, which

Aare born on paving-stone (which is private) are very likely to fall on

the neighbouring paving-stone B (which is " commons ") ; anyhow the spat is

carried up and down by the tide, and must of necessity fall in the river.

The dredgermen perpetually work these commons, and in so doing keep them

ready for the reception of spat. When the spat falls, they pick it up in the

form of brood, and sell it to the oyster-proprietors, from whose oysters it ori-

Aginally came. Now it would not be right that oysters belonging to Mr.

should become the property of Mr. B, because they happen to swim over an

imaginary hue and settle on the adjoining ground ; it would be just the same

thing as if, a farmer breeding a number of lambs in a private field, these lambs,

because they happen to get over into a common where donkeys and geese are

feeding, should become the property of the gipsies.

  The case of the Heme Bay Fishery is different from that of the Roach River.

Here, as will be seen from the map, the oysters may come from anywhere.

The Whitstable people said they came from their ground ; a few of them

might possibly have done so, but experience shows that the set of the tides

is towards the flats out to sea, and there oysters are always found. The

authorities who laid down the Admiralty Charts gave their evidence before

the House of Commons, that the set of the tide at Heme Bay was from east

to west ; in fact their evidence was hardly needed, as the drift of the shingle

along the shores of Heme Bay amply proves it. Whitstable being to the
westward of Heme Bay, the prevailing set of the tide would carry the spat
back to their ground, and not on to that of the Heme Bay ground. There
was not very long ago a large number of spat picked up on the Heme Bay
ground, and I learnt from observant persons living at Heme Bay that at that

--time the wind was from the eastward.
   Periwinkles. To those who lay oysters on the foreshore I would now ven-

ture to give a valuable hint, which they may possibly know before. Between

high- and low-water mark green weed is very apt to accumidate ; this col-

lects mud, and in other respects docs injury to the oysters. "No amount of

dredging or other cleaning will keep this green weed off; it is nevertheless

very desirable to get rid of it ; and this would form an excellent problem for

those who are in the habit of studying what is called the police of nature

that is, to mark the way in which the undue increase of one animal is kept

down by the increase of another. Everybody knows that periwinkles are

Myof great use in keeping clean the walls of an aquarium.    friends Mr.

Wiseman and Mr. Browning of Paglesham, who are proprietors of large

oyster-fisheries, have applied the observed fact of periwinkles eating weeds

to a practical operation on a large scale.

The foreshore where their oysters are laid is very subject to this green

weed ; they have therefore turned out large numbers of periwinkles upon it,

and these, eating up the green weed, clean the foreshore in the most wonder-

ful way. It is curious to remark how periwinkles, obeying their apparently

natural instinct, are in the habit of climbing up poles which are put in as
--10 REPORT 1865.

beacons ; they crawl up these poles as far as they can, and then, remaining
out of water till they are nearly dried up, drop back again.

                           Expert mints on the Foreshore on a large scale.

   The Heme Bay Oyster Company having deputed me to carry out experi-
ments on their grounds at Heme Bay according to the much talked-of French
system of oyster-culture, I have since the month of May last been almost

exclusively occupied in these experiments. Having carefully studied the
whole system of tiles and fascines as adopted in the Isle of Be, actual ex-

perience has shown me that the French system cannot be adopted on the

English foreshores in exactly the same manner as it has been in France; almost
at every point minor puzzles occur, which require much foresight and per-
petual contriving to overcome. The Kemmerer tiles are, as is well known,
coated with cement on the under side, so that, the oyster having fixed itself,
the cement can be broken in pieces, and the oyster, when arrived at the age
of one year, immediately let free. I have not adopted this system, prin-
cipally on account of the expense it would necessarily entail. I have, how-
ever, with the assistance of an ingenious brick-maker, contrived a tile of such
a size and such a consistency, that the necessity of having cement is avoided,
and the oyster will be able to be set free without fracturing its shell.

    At a comparatively small cost, but with great personal labour, I have laid

down four thousand of these tiles on the foreshore at Heme Bay. Three great

 difficulties have occurred: these are, firstly, to keep the tiles from being
knocked over by the waves ; secondly, to obviate their unaccountable desire
to sink into the mud, and in consequence become useless ; and thirdly, the
inconvenience of the very short time allowed by the tides to place the tiles
in their proper position on the foreshore. Most of these matters I have,
however, seriously considered, and, with the able help of Mr. Dilnot, a trades-

man of Heme Bay, have overcome.

    The tiles I placed down at three different periods in the year, viz. in June,
 July, and beginning of August ; I examined them carefully every spring tide :
 the waves have displaced them but very slightly, and broken hardly any.

     It is as yet (September) rather early to report the actual result of the ope-
 ration, as the spat would not yet be sufficiently large to be easily appreciable

 I therefore hope that the present warm weather may encourage what is called
 the Michaelmas spat, and that the tiles may be found to have caught some.

     In their present condition the tiles are covered with what are locally called
 " Nuns," in other words balani or acom-shells ; but no young oysters are to

 be seen as yet.

    In accordance with the French plan, I have placed in my submarine parks

 and gardens broken pieces of glass, earthenware, pottery, &c. In France these
 objects wo\dd have become covered with oysters. At the locality, however,

 where we placed them the nuns took the place of the oysters. The numbers

 of numerous marine creatiu-es which have adhered to the tiles amply prove
 that their structure is most favourable for the catching of spat, should there

 be any to catch ; and the local fishermen, who first laughed at my operations,

 no longer laugh, but express their opinion that the tiles would be capital
 things, should there be any spat about.

     Anxious to ascertain the fact whether the tiles did not catch spat because
 they were not in structure adapted so to do, o'r because the spat perished be-
 tween the time of its being emitted from the mothers shell and in fixing

 --itself, I devised the following experiments : I procured large glass jars and

  bottles, and, placing in these oysters which I could see to be in a spatting
CULTIVATION OF OYSTERS BY NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL METHODS. 11

condition, covered over the top with a material which would admit the water

freely into the bottle, and placed it at the bottom of the sea, defended from

injury by fascines. Upon subsequent examination I found that the young

oysters had not adhered to the sides of the glass, though, in my opinion, there

was no reason why they should not do so, except the temperature of the water

--surrounding the bottle. Experiment No. 2. I obtained wooden boxes, and,

without injuring them, placed in each one or two spatting oysters ; I placed

tiles over these oysters, and over the tiles a covering of coarse canvas, the

meshes of the canvas being large enough to let in water, but not let out the

Myoyster-spat.  idea in doing this was to prove whether, or not, as has been

supposed by some, the spat immediately on being emitted from the parent

fixes itself. These boxes were placed on the foreshore in such a locality that

they would never be dry ; after they had been down one month I cut off the

canvas and examined the tiles, but not one single trace of oyster-spat could

be seen, the oysters which had been shut up in the box underneath the tiles

I found to be quite hearty, and to have got very fat on their captivity. I

tried the same idea in closing the spatting oyster between two flower-pots

wired together; here again the results were nil. To my mind these experi-

ments prove conclusively that the young ones cannot survive the state of

things favourable to their parent, and that they certainly do not adhere the

moment they are sent forth from their mother's shell.

             Comparison of the French and English System of Oyster-culture.

      I have now examined both methods very carefully, and have come to the

  conclusion (and I am bound in honesty to state it) that in my humble opinion

   the French system has been much overrated ; or at least the idea that the

   system is applicable to this country is more or less fallacious.
       The public seem to have got it into their heads that our English system is

   faulty, because for several successive years it failed to produce any large
   number of oysters ; at the same time highly favourable reports were issued

   of the success of cidtivating oysters in France by what is called the artificial
   system. I candidly confess I was one of the first to fall into the trap, and
   to imagine with others that, because the tiles, fascines, &c. were placed in the
   sea, therefore the oysters could be made to breed, and that if you placed tiles
   you would have oysters, if you placed no tiles you would have no oysters.

       As I have explained before, the English system is to catch the spat upon
   culch, the French to catch it upon tiles. I have examined both systems, and
   come to the conclusion that the tiles will (except under certain favourable

    circumstances) never beat the culch.

       I have been to the Isle of Re, and have seen (through the great kindness

  of Dr. Kemmerer) the whole system ; and the long and short of it is this :--

, For many years the oyster-spat in France was totally neglected, and the in-

   habitants thought nothing about turning their beds to profitable account.

   The learned pisciculturist, M. Coste, suggested the idea of tiles being placed
   down, the idea having, I believe, been first suggested by a poor mason, M.

  Bceuf, with whom I have had a long conversation. The tiles, fascines, &c.

   were placed down under the patronage of the government, and they were
   picked up covered with young oysters. The success was pronounced complete,
   fascines and tiles were all the rage, and all those who had oyster-fisheries

   thought their fortunes were made.
       The fact of the matter is, that the first year these various oyster-catching

   implements were laid down happened to be a year famous for an exceed-
   ingly heavy fall of spat ; in other words, a vast majority of the young spat
12 REPORT 1865.

born lived, thrived, and ultimately adhered to whatever they could find to
adhere to. They found the fascines and tiles, and covered them as bees
cover the boughs of a tree at swarming-tirne ; and the idea was at once
started that these fascines and tiles were the means, as it were, of creating

the oysters which otherwise would not have been created.
   The first two or three years after these tiles, &c., were laid down happened

to be good years for the spat living ; but for the last few years the spat has
not lived, and the natural consequence has been that they have not been

found on the tiles in very large quantities. Oysters, in fact, are just as scarce

this year in France as they are in England. If the artificial system with

tiles had been such a great success, and had the tiles caught the sj)at when

culch would not catch the spat, it would of necessity follow that oysters in

France would have been very cheap, whereas in fact they are quite as dear as

in England, and there are so few of them to be had that French agents are

at this moment in this country buying all they can get hold of.

   There can, however, be no doubt whatever that as a rule the oysters spat

much more freely on the west coast of France than they do at the mouth of

the Thames and the adjoining coasts of Essex. The reason of this is, to my

mind, obvious. Oysters require heat, or rather warmth, in their younger

state. From the nature of the vegetation the general state of the climate can

Nowbe pretty well ascertained.  at the headquarters of artificial breeding,

at the Isle of Re, the temperature is so great that vines grow luxuriantly.

In England the temperature is such that we can only grow corn, turnips, &c.
   The latitude of the Isle of Re, which is situated in the Bay of Biscay, is about

46°, whereas the mouth of the Thames is about 51|°; it is natural therefore

to suppose (as indeed the facts show) that in ordinary years there should be

a much larger fall of spat at the Isle of Re than on the east coast of England.

The state of things on the west coast of Ireland seems to confirm this con-
clusion ; for here, again, the oysters breed much more freely than they do in

England, the cause being the warm moist climate and the even temperature

of the air.

   In accordance with hydrographical facts, the oysters bred both in Ireland

and Re are taken elsewhere to fatten ; those from Ireland are brought round
by vessels or else in boxes by railway and laid down at the mouth of the

Thames, where in a year or so they increase greatly in the quantity of meat
contained in the shells. The shell, too, seems inclined to take on the cha-
racteristics of the oysters natural to the place, though direct observation will

not as yet enable me to be sure about the fact " whether the young of trans-

ported oysters will, if born in the locality where a purer breed of oysters
exist, assume the character of the natives of the place :" this is a subject of the

highest importance, about which no facts are yet known. In Re the lean

--oysters are placed in what are called clares that is to say, mud ponds ; in

these mud ponds they find food, and certainly become fatter than at the

place where they were first born.

                                                 Chemical Analysis.

   The object of this investigation is, first, to ascertain whence the oyster
obtains the mineral material to secrete his house, and, secondly, what those
materials are ; for, commercially speaking, the proportion of the meat to the
shell is of the greatest importance to the merchant who has to pay high
prices for the transport of oysters long distances. If he buys oysters with a

thick shell, containing a large proportion of mineral, he cannot possibly ob-

tain as much profit as if there were more meat than shell at a given weight.
CULTIVATION OF OYSTERS BY NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL METHODS. 13

With this idea, I have, with the assistance of my clerk, ascertained the pro-
portion of meat to shell in nearly forty kinds of oysters. I am indebted to

Mr. Moore, of the Derby Museum, Liverpool, for many specimens of these

oysters ; and I shall be exceedingly obliged to any gentleman who will give

me any specimens to enlarge my table.

   It struck me that, whereas the oysters were very different in appearance,

their mineral ingredients would differ correspondingly. I have therefore

obtained the assistance of Mr. A. P. Tarner, F.C.S. He finds that the chemical

--ingredients composing the oyster-shell are three animal matter, phosphate

of lime, and carbonate of lime.

    Six different kinds of oysters were taken from localities widely apart
and the result (given in the Table) proved directly that, as I had supposed
from theory, the more animal matter there was in an oyster-shell, and the
less mineral, the greater value it would be for the market ; it is very satis-

factory to find that the chemical ingredients of the shell of the oyster tally
almost exactly with the prices they bear at the market. I have not as yet

had time to examine the meat of the oyster, but propose to report on this

at a future time.

CULTIVATION OF OYSTERS BY NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL METHODS. 15

not in the summer. The greenness docs not extend throughout the whole of
their body, but simply to their beard or fin. The cause is totally unknown
some attribute it to the green weed among which the oysters are placed ; others

to the infusoria upon which they feed : for all practical purposes suffice it to

say, they are most excellent and nutritious food to the human frame. Dr.
"Letheby has made an analysis of them for Mr. Wiseman, and reports that they

are perfectly wholesome and contain no copper. Practical experience, more-

over, proves that they are wholesome, and many dozens of them may be eaten

with impunity. The 03-sters at Marcnnes, in France, are so highly esteemed

by the French people on account of their greenness, that the oyster-culturists

at Marennes placed them in pits in order that they might become green.

myFrom all that I can observe or ascertain,  present opinion is (and is fur-

ther confirmed by experiments which I have carried out), that the cause of

the greenness is the presence of chlorophyll in the beard of the oyster.

From this fact we may deduce an important practical conclusion, viz. that, if

it be desirable to get off the greenness from the oysters, all that is required

will be to place them in pits, and place a covering of hurdles, brands, or

other materials over them, so as to prevent the action of light, the chloro-

phyll will, I believe, not be formed, and the oyster in consequence not be able

to take it up. This is a practical suggestion which I have made to Mr. Wise-

man, and which he has promised at once to experiment on.

                                          Falmouth Green Oysters.

   The green oysters from Falmouth have undoubtedly a bad reputation, on
account of their being said to contain copper. Mr. Fox, of Falmouth, has

been good enough to send me samples of these oysters. I have submitted
them to the analysis of Mr. Tarner, who reports the presence of copper in

them, but in very minute quantities, hardly sufficient, I should imagine, to

do injury to the human system ; still that it is present there can be no doubt.
It may be that the oysters obtain the copper from a solution in sea-water,

or from the fresh water running from the copper-mines. I propose, if oppor-
tunity serves, to visit Falmouth, and inquire more minutely into this fact.
Falmouth oysters are imported in considerable quantities to the mouth of the
Thames ; and practical experience shows that they lose all their green colour
on being exposed for a few months in water suited to their fattening. The

bodies of these Falmouth oysters when first caught are almost as green as
arsenical paper ; the shells also look green in external appearance. Upon
placing them in spirits of wine the spirits become dark green ; there can be
no doubt whatever that this is caused by the presence of chlorophyll.

   In conclusion, I would remark that so anxious am I about the cultivation

of the waters, especially with reference to the Salmon and the Oyster, that I

have established, at my own expense, at the Royal Horticultural Gardens,

under the Science and Art Department of the South Kensington Mriseum, a

" Museum of Economic Fish-culture," in which I have exhibited drawings

and preparations illustrating the habits and natural history of the salmon,

together with samples of oysters from many parts of the United Kingdom.

The development of the young oyster from its embryonic state to the time
that it is fit for market, together with the various modes of its cultivation,
both by ordinary and by artificial methods, is fully illustrated. Samples of
oysters, alive or dead, from any part of the world will be most thankfully

received ; for any fact, however insignificant it may seem to be, is valuable.
16 REPORT 1865.

First Report of the Committee for exploring Kent's Cavern, Devon-
   shire. The Committee consisting of Sir Charles Lyell, Bart.,

   Professor Phillips, Sir John Lubbock, Bart., Mr. John Evans,
   Mr. Edward Vivian, and Mr. William Pengelly (Reporter)

The celebrated Kent's Cavern, or Kent's Hole, is about a mile due east from

Torquay barbour. It is situated in a small, wooded, limestone hill on tbe
western side of a valley wbicb, about half a mile to the south, terminates
on tbe northern shore of Torbay.

    Tbe hills -which surround the district consist of limestone, greenstone,
clay-slate, and a reddish grit or compact sandstone. Tbe two last are tra-
versed by veins of quartz ; and, with tbe possible exception of tbe green-
stone, they all belong to tbe Devonian system. Indeed the entire Torquay
peninsula is exclusively made up of rocks of this age.

    According to tradition, there were formerly four or five entrances to the
cavern, of which two only were generally known, the others being merely
narrow apertures or slits through which, until they were blocked up from
within, tbe initiated were wont to enter clandestinely. The remaining two
are about 50 feet apart, and occur in tbe face of one and the same low
natural cliff, running nearly north and south, on the south-eastern side of
the hill. The northern entrance is in form a rude triangle, about 6 feet
high and 8 feet wide at the base. The southern is a natural and tole-
rably symmetrical arch, 9g feet wide at the base, and 6 feet high. Its

--form is due partly to a gentle curvature of the strata the apex of the
--opening being in the anticlinal axis and partly to the actual removal, by

natural causes, of portions of the limestone beds ; the base of the opening,
or chord of the arc, consists of undisturbed limestone ; so that the entrance

may be aptly compared to tbe mouth of an oven.
    From the time of the researches and discoveries which, forty years ago,

rendered the cavern famous, to the commencement of the exploration under

 the auspices of this Association, the southern entrance has been blocked up,
the northern alone being vised by visitors. The base of the latter is about

 189 feet above the lovel of mean tide*, whilst that of the former is about
4 feet lower.

    The Cavern has been known from time immemorial. Even tradition fails

 to reach back to the date of its discovery. It did not, however, attract the

 attention of scientific inquirers until September 1824, when Mr. Northmore

 visited it with the double object, as be stated, " of discovering organic remains,
 and of ascertaining the existence of a temple of Mithras," and he declared

himself" happy to say that he was successfid in both objects." He was speedily
followed by Mr. W. C. Trevilyan, who, according to the Rev. Mr. M'Enery,

 " was the first that obtained any results of value to science." Mr. M'Enery,
 whose name must be for ever associated with the cavern, first visited it in the

 summer of 1825. He was at that time quite inexperienced in cavern re-

 searches ; for he states that the party which he had been induced to accom-
 pany was a large one, and that on entering the cavern he " was the last of
 the train, for he could not divest himself of certain undefinable sensations, it
 being his first visit to a scene of this nature." The visit was a memorable
 one ; for, separating himself from his companions, and devoting himself to

   A* " bench mark " of the Ordnance Survey in the road from Torquay to Ilsham farm,

 and which is at no great distance from the cavern, is, as Col. Sir H. James kindly informs

 me, 131'629 feet above the level of mean tide at Liverpool. By pocket aneroid, the base

--of the northern entrance of the cavern is 575 feet above this mark. W. P.

what he conjectured to be a favourable spot, he found several teeth and

--bones. He thus describes his feelings on the occasion : " They -were the

myfirst fossil teeth I had ever seen, and as I laid  hand on these relics of

extinct races, and witnesses of an order of things which passed away with

them, I shrank back involuntarily ; though not insensible to the excitement

attending new discoveries, I am not ashamed to own, that in the presence of

these remains I felt more of awe than joy." He at once communicated his

discovery to Dr. Euckland, and with great energy followed up his " good

fortune " for several years. So far as can be ascertained from his memoranda,

the date of his latest visit was August 14th, 1S29.

Though he at one time intended to publish a narrative of his labours and

discoveries, and had made arrangements for the requisite illustrations, the

intention was unfortunately abandoned. After his decease, it was feared

that his manuscripts had been destroyed or lost ; but after experiencing a

variety of fortune they passed into the hands of Mr. Vivian of Torquay, who

from them compiled a Memoir which was published in 1859*.

In 1840, Mr. Godwin- Austen read a paper before the Geological Society

of London, on the " Bone Caves of Devonshire," when he described the results

of his investigations in Kent's Hole.

In 1846, the Torquay Natural History Society appointed a Committee to

conduct an exploration of a small portion of the cavern. Though their object

was mainly to obtain specimens for the Society's Museum, very careful atten-

Ation was given to the positions and associations of all the articles found.

paper embodying the results of this investigation was drawn up by Mr.

Vivian, a member of the Committee, and read in 1847 before the Geological

ASociety of London.  mention of this communication appeared in the 3rd

volume of the Quarterly Journal of the Society.

Though it may be doubted, perhaps, whether any of the foregoing explora-

tions were conducted with that rigid observance of method which is now held

to be necessary, all the explorers are unanimous in stating that they found

flint " implements " mixed up with the remains of extinct animals.

In 1858, the results of the systematic and careful exploration of Brixham

Cavern, on the opposite shore of Torbay, induced the scientific world to sus-

pect that the alleged discoveries which, from time to time during a quarter

of a century, had been reported from Kent's Hole, might, after all, be en-

titled to a place amongst the verities of science ; and from that time various

proposals for further investigations have been made. As is well known,

these suggestions took a definite form at the last Meeting of this Association,

when a liberal grant of money was made, and a Committee was appointed

for the purpose of further exploration. It is the object of this communica-
tion to state what up to this time the results have been, so far as they are at

present determined.

   The Committee have great pleasure in stating that, in reply to their appli-
cation for permission to make the proposed investigation, the proprietor, Sir
L. Palk, Bart., M.P., assured them most promptly that it would " give him

great pleasure to place every facility in their hands." He placed the cavern

in their exclusive custody, and suggested the most satisfactory arrangement

for the ultimate disposal of such objects of interest as might be found.
   Though large portions of the deposits were broken up by Mr. M'Enery

and his successors, there is still within the cavern a very considerable amount
of virgin ground. The Committee, however, were desirous of selecting an

 not present any very great difficulties in working. After a visit of inspec-
 tion it was decided to undertake the exploration of the large chamber into
 which the southern entrance immediately opens. The mode of investigation
 was laid down, trustworthy and intelligent workmen were engaged (Mr.
 Charles Keeping, brother of the well-known fossil collector, being the chief),
 and the work, consigned to the superintendence of the two resident members
 of the Committee, Mr. Vivian and the Honorary Secretary, was commenced
 on March 28th of the present year.

     Immediately outside the cave lay a considerable talus of earth and stones,
 the upper portion of which, at least, is believed to have been thrown out by

 Mr. M'Enery, who conducted his researches through the northern opening.
 It was necessary to cut through this mass in order to reach and make avail-

 able the entrance which the Committee had selected for their operations.
 This material was very carefully examined, partly for the purpose of detect-
 ing any objects of interest which it might contain, and partly as an initiatory
 exercise for the workmen.

    The cavern is in no part subject to any considerable amount of drip ; and
 no portion of it is drier than the chamber selected for exploration. Since the
 commencement of the work unusually heavy rains have fallen in the district,
 but water has entered through the roof at a very few points only, and in no
 instance in such an amount as to produce discomfort or inconvenience.

    The following is the succession of deposits, in descending order, which the
 chamber contained.

    1st. Huge blocks of limestone which had manifestly fallen from the roof.
Many of them required blasting to effect their removal ; and in several
instances it was necessary to blast even the masses into which they were by
this means divided. One of the blocks measured 11 feet long, 5| half

broad, and 2^ thick; hence it contained upwards of 100 cubic feet, and
must have weighed fully 7 tons. In some cases two or three of them
lay one on another, and, in a few instances, were firmly cemented together
by a separate cake of stalagmite between each pair; whilst others lay
unconformably with considerable interspaces. Occasionally, what appeared
to be a boss or dome of stalagmite proved to be a block, or two or three
small blocks, of limestone invested on all sides with a stalagmitic sheet.
Certain masses, lying at some distance from a drop, were without even a

trace of stalagmite.

    2nd. Beneath these limestone blocks there was a layer of mould of an almost
black colour. It varied from a few inches to upwards of a foot in depth.

   3rd. Underneath the black soil came a cake of stalagmitic breccia, made up

of comparatively small fragments of limestone so very firmly cemented to-
gether with carbonate of lime as occasionally to require blasting. It was

rarely less, but not unfrequcntly much more, than a foot thick. Everywhere
it was firmly attached to the walls, and it occasionally extended completely
across the chamber. Not unfrequently, however, the centre of the chamber
was altogether destitute of this breccia, in some instances, because there is
no drip near the area, in others, because it was intercepted by an overlying

limestone block.

    4th. The breccia is succeeded by the ordinary reddish cave-loam, which
contains a large number of limestone fragments, varying in dimensions
from bits not larger than sixpences, to masses but little smaller than those which
lay on the surface. They lie at all angles without anything like symmetrical
 arrangement. In fact the entire deposit is without any approach to strati-

fication. Many of the stones are partially encrusted with calcareous matter,
                  on Kent's cavern, Devonshire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     19

and not unfrequently loam, stones, and splinters of bones are cemented by

the same substance into a very tough breccia. The presence of a calcareous

drip is more or less traceable everywhere. Hitherto the cave-earth has been

Howexcavated to the depth of 4 feet only.                                                                                                                                                far it extends below this, or

what may be beneath it, is at present unknown. Where it is not covered

with the stalagmitic breccia, the black soil lies immediately on it ; but the
line of junction is everywhere sharply defined. In no instance do the two

commingle.

    Since the large masses of limestone occur at all levels in the cave-earth as

well as everywhere above it, it is obvious that whatever may be the cause to

which their fall is attributable, they cannot be referred to any one and the
same period. They fell from time to time throughout the accumulation of

the cave-earth, they continued to fall whilst the stalagmitic breccia was in

process of formation, as well as during the introduction of the black mould,

and they are amongst the most recent phenomena which the cavern presents.

And even of those which lie on the surface, there is conclusive evidence that

in some cases a considerable interval of time must have elapsed between the

--fall of two blocks lying one on the other an interval sufficiently great for

the formation of the cake of stalagmite between them, and which is some-

times fully 6 inches thick. There can be little doubt that some of them
fell very recently, even when measured by human standards.

It is by no means easy to determine the cause which threw them down.

To call in the aid of convulsion seems undesirable, since it would be necessary

to do so very frequently. Moreover, it may be doubted whether anything

short of a violent earthquake would be equal to the effect. Though the roof
of the chamber is of very great span and entirely unsupported, and though

it presents appearances which are not calculated to inspire confidence, the

violent concussions produced by the frequent blastings already mentioned,
blastings which not unfrequently throw masses of limestone, weighing up-

wards of a ton, to a distance of several feet, have never brought down even a

splinter.

The fall of the blocks has sometimes been attributed to changes of dimen-

sions in the roof arising from changes                                                                                                                                          of temperature                                                         but the fact that the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

cavern temperature is all but constant throughout the year, seems fatal to

this hypothesis.

The masses lying on the surface were a sufficient guarantee that the de-

posits beneath them remained intact. There can be no doubt that they are

at once a proof and the cause of the undisturbed character of the soil they
Acover.
            portion of the cavern so easily accessible as is this chamber,

would not have been spared by Mr. M'Enery, but on account of some great

difficulty or discouragement                                                                                                                                            and in  fact he  states  that                                                  the  fallen  masses

completely foiled him in his attempts to make explorations in it, excepting

in one branch some distance south of the area selected by the Committee.

Their own characters, moreover, render it absolutely certain" that the deposits

have never been violated.

   The following is the method of exploration which has been observed from
the commencement, and which it is believed affords a simple and correct
method of determining the exact position of every object which has been

found.

   1st. The black soil accessible between the masses of limestone on the sur-
face was carefully examined and removed.

   2nd. The limestone blocks occupying the surface of the deposits were
blasted and otherwise broken up, and taken out of the cavern.

                                                                                 c2

A3rd. line, termed the " datum line," is stretched horizontally from a

fixed point at the entrance to another at the hack of the chamber.
   4th. Lines, one foot apart, are drawn at right angles to the datum line,

and therefore parallel to one another, across the chamber so as to divide the
surface of the deposit into belts termed " parallels."

   5th. In each parallel the black mould which the limestone masses had

covered is first examined and removed, and then the stalagmitic breccia, so

as to lay bare the surface of the cave-earth.

   Gth. Horizontal lines, a foot apart, are then drawn from side to side across

the vertical face of the section so as to divide the parallel into four layers or
" levels," each a foot deep.

    Finally, each level is divided into lengths, called " yards," each 3 feet
long, and measured right and left from the datum line as an axis of abscissas.

    In fine, the cave-earth is excavated in vertical slices or parallels 4 feet
high, 1 foot thick, and as long as the chamber is broad where this breadth
does not exceed 30 feet. Each parallel is taken out in levels 1 foot

high, and each level in horizontal prisms 3 feet long and a foot square

in the section, so that each contains three ci;bic feet of material.

This material, after being carefully examined in sitn by candlelight, is

taken to the doorway aud reexamined by daylight, after which it is at

Aonce removed without the cavern.  box is appropriated to each yard ex-

clusively, and in it are placed all the objects of interest which the prism

yields. The boxes, each having a label containing the data necessary for

defining the situation of its contents, are daily sent to the Honorary Secre-

tary of the Committee, by whom the specimens are at once cleaned and

packed in fresh boxes. The labels are numbered and packed with the speci-

mens to which they respectively belong, and a record of the day's work is

entered in a diary.

The same method is followed in the examination of the black mould,

and also of the stalagmitic breccia, with the single exception that in these

cases the parallels are not divided into levels and yards.

With very rare exceptions the cavern has been visited daily by one, and

frequently by both of the Superintendents ; and Monthly Reports of progress
have been regularly forwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, the Chairman of the

Committee.

   Though it would be premature to attempt anything like an exhaustive

list, it may be of interest to furnish a brief and general account of the objects

which have been found.

Of the articles met with in the black mould, those occurring between the

fallen masses of limestone have been kept distinct from such as have been

detected beneath them. Such a division, however, is not rendered necessary

by the characters of the objects themselves, and will not be attended to on
the present occasion. In this category also may be placed the greater num-

ber of the specimens found in the talus outside the cavern. The collection is

of a various miscellaneous nature. It consists of stones of various kinds,

human industrial remains, charred wood, bones of various animals, marine

and land-shells, and the broken shells of hazel-nuts. It passes from the

Rabbit's nest fined with clean dry fur and containing a couple of fresh

green ivy-leaves, and numberless fragments of wine and porter bottles flung

away by parties who have visited the cavern mainly from a love of frolic,

back to the age of bronze implements and of flint flakes, and probably repre-

sents from fifteen hundred to two thousand years.

The stones are in most cases well rounded, and, at least, some of them are
          on rent's cavern, Devonshire.                               21

of marine origin, since they are distinctly lithodoniized. They consist of

limestone, quartz, red grit, greenstone, and flint ; all except the last derivable

from the rocks of the immediate district, and were probably obtained from

the neighbouring beaches, where also the flints were perhaps found ; for

though there is no flint in situ within five miles,- it is a well-known fact

that such pebbles are met with on existing beaches at much greater distances

from any known accumulation of flints in place. The rounded stones are

extremely numerous in the black mould, and were undoubtedly selected and

taken to the cavern ; but for what purpose it may not be easy to determine.

There are also several pieces of hard greenish-grey grit of an elongated

form, which were perhaps used as whetstones. Angular pieces of slate are

also numerous. They are probably fragments of articles fashioned by man,

as occasionally a piece is met with which is obviously a portion of a curvi-

lineal plate. Such plates are mentioned by Mr. M'Enery, who supposes

them to have been used as covers for earthenware vessels. The human in-

dustrial remains consist of articles in bronze and in bone, pottery, spindle-

whorls, and flint-flakes. The bronze articles are a fibula, the bowl and

part of the stem of a spoon, a spear head, a fragment of a socketed celt, two

or three rings, one eoil of a helical spring, a pin about 3| inches long, and

and an object resembling a horseshoe in form, but not more than an inch long.

In this connexion may be mentioned a lump of metal which, from its

general appearance, would be termed copper ore, but from its interior, a small

portion of which has been exposed accidentally, it is probably native copper,

Aor a mass of metal which has been smelted.  similar mass mentioned by

Mr. M'Enery, is said to have been analyzed " by Mr. Phillips and found to be

pure virgin ore." Much of the pottery, excepting one small piece, undoubt-

Aedly Samian, is extremely coarse, and in most cases it is unglazed.  large

number of fragments have been found, but nothing approaching a perfect

vessel. They are generally ornamented, and from the different .patterns, as

well as from other facts, it may be concluded that they represent a consider-

able number of utensils. One piece probably formed part of a vessel in

which things were burnt, as on its inner surface there is a firm admixture of

clay and small bits of charcoal. Much of the pottery is without doubt of
Roman age.

The objects fashioned in bone are a comb, which in size and outline

resembles a common shoe-lifter having teeth cut in the broad end ; a

spoon, neatly formed of a portion of a rib, and measuring about 6 inches long

and ^jths of an inch broad ; a chisel about 2-jSjths inches in length, and at

its broad end -jiyths of an inch in width ; a wedge, somewhat rudely fashioned

out of a horn or antler ; two small fragments which appear to be portions of

combs, and one of which bears traces of ornamentation ; and an article about

3 inches long, apparently the handle of some tool.

The spindle-whorls are formed of different materials, such as Devonian

red grit, one of the harder varieties of Triassic sandstone (rocks abundant

in the neighbourhood), a somewhat coarse, greenish, schistose rock not found

near the district, and Kimmeridge coal. They differ somewhat in dimen-

sions and in workmanship ; some being well finished, whilst others are so
roughly made as to render it safer perhaps to call them simply " holed

stones." "With them may be mentioned a large bead, which appears to con-

sist of amber or some analogous substance ; and a small, holed, ellipsoidal

fragment of limestone, which was perforated probably by some lithodomous

mollusk.

The flint-flakes are four in number, two of dark and two of light or white
--22 report 1865.

flint, the latter being the best formed. The light colour is more or less
superficial, the centre being of a dark grey.

   The charred wood is very abundant. Some specimens are undistinguish-
able from prepared charcoal, whilst others are obviously nothing more than
partially burnt sticks, some of them of considerable size.

    Bones are extremely numerous. They are more or less discoloured, and
have lost a considerable portion of their weight. It may be doubted whether
the entire elements of any skeleton have been found lying together.
Amongst them there are the relics of pig, deer, sheep, fox, wolf (?), bat,
hare, rabbit, with smaller rodents, birds, and various kinds of fish. Some of
them appear to have been exposed to the action of fire.

    The land shells are principally various kinds of snail, the larger forms
being the most prevalent. They occur in all stages of growth, and thus
render it probable that they had established a colony in the cavern.
Amongst the marine shells are the limpet, whelk, oyster, cockle, mussel,
pecten, solen or razor-shell, and the internal shell of the cuttle-fish, Sepia
officinalis. From the unrubbed condition of the last, it was probably not
found cast ashore on the beach, but taken directly from the cephalopod to
which it belonged.

    The source of the shells of hazel-nuts is not far to seek. They were no
doubt obtained from the wood in which the cavern is situated, and were
perhaps carried in by small animals whose homes were under the fallen
masses of limestone where the shells were found. Most of them are per-

forated at one end.

    In passing below the black mould we first encounter the stalagmitic
breccia. This the workmen carefully break into small fragments, in order to

 detect any articles of interest imbedded in it. The search, though not very
productive, has not been quite fruitless. In the breccia have been found
charred wood, marine and land shells, and bones of various animals, some of
which perhaps are extinct.

    Immediately beneath this cake we enter the red cave-loam, and at once
find ourselves amongst the relics of several species of extinct animals. The

 only differences in the four successive levels in which, as already stated, the
 red loam is taken out are simply that the first or uppermost is the poorest,
 and the third, perhaps, the richest in osseous remains ; and that the three

 lower levels contain a large amount of minutely comminuted bone, of which
 there are very few instances in the uppermost foot. In other respects the

--levels are the same everywhere the same in the materials which form the

 staple of the deposit ; in the occurrence of pebbles of various kinds of rock,

 which differ from those in the overlying black mould only in being less
 numerous ; in the presence of bones in the same condition and representing
 the same species of animals ; and in yielding " flint implements " of the
 same types. It will not be necessary, therefore, to describe each level sepa-

 rately or in detail.

    The bones found below the stalagmite are heavier than those met with
 above it. This distinction is so well marked and so constant as to be cha-
 racteristic. It would be easy to assign them to their respective deposits
 by their specific weights alone. Most of those from the red loam are but

Alittle discoloured, indeed some of them are of a chalk-like whiteness. few,

 however, occur here and there which have undergone a considerable amount
 of discoloration, a consequence, probably, and also a proof of a greater degree

 of exposure before their inhumation. On most of the latter, certain lines

 and patches of fighter colour not unfrequently present themselves, which
on Kent's cavern, Devonshire.  23

may be likened to such as are sometimes left by mosses or lichens on objects

on which they have grown.

  A large number of bones, including jaws, teeth, and horns, are scored with

teeth-marks, clearly the work of animals of different kinds. Some of the
long bones are split longitudinally. Many appear to have been rolled,
including most of those which have been gnawed ; and in the case of the
latter, it is tolerably obvious that the rolling was subsequent to the gnawing.
Some of those found beneath the large masses of fallen limestone are in a
crushed condition, and thus apparently attest the fact that the deposit on
which they lay, and on which the blocks fell, was of a compact nature, and

capable of a firm resistance.

   The minutely comminuted bone already spoken of, is commonly found
converted with loam and stones into a firni breccia. Not unfrequently,
however, it occupies the hollow cavities of some of the larger bones.
"With it there sometimes occurs a cream-coloured substance, which in a few
instances has been met also in the form of small detached lumps having a
low specific gravity. This, as well as some of the comminuted bone, has

been supposed to be of faecal origin.
   In cleaning the bones it is frequently found to be impossible to remove

entirely the earthy matter from them. They are at least partially invested

with a thin film, which defies the brush and water. On drying, however,

this matter commonly scales off, and proves to be a paste or paint composed
of loam and carbonate of lime, the latter probably derived from drip from

the roof.

   Large portions of the osseous remains occur in the forms of fragments
and mere splinters. The identifiable parts are chiefly teeth, which are ex-

tremely numerous. Amongst the Mammals represented, there are certainly

the Cave-bear, Cave-lion, Cave-hyaena, Fox, Horse (probably more than
one species), Ox, several species of Deer, the tichorhine Ehinoceros, and
Mammoth. Remains of the Hyaena are probably the most abundant, after

which come those of Ehinoceros and Horse. The relics of the Mammoths

(both molars and tusks) are those of very young individuals.
    It has already been hinted that " flint implements " occur everywhere in

the cave-earth mixed up with the remains of extinct Mammals. Several of
them were found in the presence of, and some of them by, the Superin-
tendents. Like the bones, they are least abundant in the uppermost
foot, and occur in greatest numbers in the lowest zones. Altogether, and
without reckoning doubtful specimens and numerous chips, nearly thirty
'·implements" have been dug out. Though the designation of "flint" is
given to all, some of them are perhaps of chert. Of the flints properly so
called, some are of a dark, and others of a light-grey colour, whilst a third
kind are almost white, and have a porcellanous aspect. With the exception

--of three, they are all of the kind known as flakes flat on one side, and more

or less carinated on the other. Some of them are fragments only, others
were found broken in the deposit with the parts lying in contact, whilst
others again are perfect. Some of the broken specimens of the white variety
show that they are not of this colour throughout their entire mass, but have a
dark central axis or core. The flakes agree in character with those in the
black overlying mould. The excepted three are of chert, and are worked on
both sides. They were found in the second, third, and ftrarth levels ; one in
each. That from the second foot is about 4| inches long, and, where
widest, 2| broad. At one end it tapers to a point, and narrows to no more
than | of an inch at the other. In outline it is rudely a segment of a
--24 REPORT 18C5.

  curvilineal figure, and is slightly falciform. The inner or concave margin is
  the cutting edge. Unfortunately the tip of the pointed end was broken off
  after exhumation. Those from the third and fourth levels are more highly-
 wrought "implements." They are worked to an edge around the entire
  perimeter. In outline they are rather ovoid than elliptical, being narrower
  at one end than at the other. That from the third foot measures 4-1- inches
 in length, and its greatest breath and thickness are respectively 3^ inches
  and |- of an inch. That found in the fourth zone, the lowest yet reached, is
 the most elaborately finished "implement" of the series. It is lighter in
 colour and somewhat smaller than the preceding two, its dimensions being
 3| inches long, 2\ broad, and ^ in thickness.

     Without intending at present to enter on the consideration of all the
 bearings of the entire evidence produced, the Committee feel at liberty to

 express their conviction that it is totally impossible to doubt either the human

 origin of the "implements," or their inosculation, in undisturbed soil, with

 the remains of the Mammoth, the Cave-bear, and their extinct contem-

 poraries.

    Nor are these the only indications of human existence found in the cave-
 earth. Several small pieces of burnt bone have been met with in the red
 loam, some of them loose and detached, others of small size and incor-
 porated in the breccia composed of loam, stones, and comminuted bone.

    Mention has been made already of the occurrence in the cave- earth of
 rounded stones not derivable from the limestone hill in which the cavern is
 situated. It seems probable that at least some of them were selected and taken
 there by man ; though it may not be easy, perhaps, to determine in all cases
for what purpose. But, waiving this point, there are two stones which must
not be hastily dismissed. The first of them is 4| inches long, and something
less than 1 inch square in the section. It is a mass of hard purplish-grey grit,
and is undoubtedly a whetstone, or rather a portion of one. It was found

in the first level of the cave-earth, in a small recess or cavity in the northern
wall of the chamber, immediately beneath a projecting stratum of limestone

in situ. In this cavity the stone stood with its longest axis vertical. The
Superintendents were inclined to the opinion that it had slipped through a
hole into the cavity at a comparatively recent date ; and they diligently set
to work to find the means of its ingress. Here, however, they were com-
pletely foiled. There was no hole or passage, vertical or lateral, by which
the cavity could have been entered. Not only, as has been said, was

there a thick stratum of limestone in situ immediately over the recess,
but over this again, as well as over the red loam, there was a thick com-
pact mass of stalagmitic breccia, consisting of large and small pieces of lime-
stone firmly cemented, and having a height of fully 8 feet ; the whole of

which was removed before the cavity was disclosed or its existence suspected.
    The second stone is a rude flattened spheroid, formed from a pebble of

coarse, hard, red sandstone, and apparently used for breaking or crushing.
Its diameters measure 2| and 1| inches. It was found in the second level
of the red cave-earth, over which lay an enormous block of limestone, but
no stalagmite.

   In addition to the pleasure which always attends scientific discovery, the
Committee have had the gratification of confirming most of the statements

of their predecessors. Any differences observable between the statements
now made and those of the earlier investigators arise from defective, not

conflicting evidence. For example, the Committee have not yet been so
fortunate as to find the remains of Machairodus latidens, mentioned and
RULES Or ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.  25

figured by Mr. M'Enery *, nor of Hippopotamus major, alluded to by Prof.
Owen f as occurring in tbe cavern ; nor bare they found anything in the

least degree calculated to bring the statements alluded to into discredit-
Again, so far as their researches have gone, the Committee have not, like

Mr. Godwin-Austen, found the bones of man mixed up, in undisturbed soil,

with those of extinct animals + ; it will be seen, however, that there is no
a priori improbability in the statement of the distinguished geologist just

mentioned ; and the Committee would remind such as may be disposed to

attach importance to the fact that men's bones are not forthcoming as readily
as their implements, that in the black mould, as well as in the red loam of
the cavern, the only indications of man's existence are remnants of his handi-
work. Pottery, implements and ornaments in bone, metal, and stone, ' the
remnants of his fires, and the relics of his feasts are numerous, and betoken
the lapse of at least two milleniums ; but here, as well as in the older de-
posits below, the Committee have met with no vestige of his osseous system.

   In conclusion, the Committee would observe that the value of their
labours is not to be measured by the discoveries, or rather the rediscoveries,
which they have made. They have not only disinterred a valuable body of
fact, but with it a confirmation of the concurrent statements of M'Enery,

Report of a Committee " appointed to report on the changes which

   they may consider desirable to make, if any, in the Rides of Zoolo-
   gical Nomenclature drawn up by Mr. H. E. Strickland, at the

    instance of the British Association at their Meeting in Manchester
    in 1842."

Pefokm of the Nomenclature of Zoology was a subject which occupied much
of the time of the late Hugh E. Strickland §. It was his object that this

reform should be brought forward under the auspices of the Pritish Asso-
ciation, and at a meeting of the Council of that body, held in London upon

--11th of February, 1842, it was resolved "That with a view of securing

attention to the following important subject, a Committee, consisting of Mr.
C. Darwin, Professor Henslow, Eev. L. Jenyns, Mr. "W. Ogilby, Mr. J.
Phillips, Dr. Pichardson, Mr. H. E. Strickland (reporter), Mr. J. 0. "Westwood,
be appointed, to consider of the rules by which the nomenclature of zoology

may be established on a uniform and permanent basis ; the Peport to be

presented to the Zoological Section, and submitted to its committee at the
Manchester Meeting"^.

   This Committee met at various times in London, and the following gen-

--tlemen were added to it, and assisted in its labours : W. J. Proderip,

Professor Owen, W. E. Shuckard, G. P. Waterhouse, and W. Yarrell. An

outline of the proposed code was drawn up and circulated, and many valuable

suggestions were received from eminent zoologists at home and abroad. The
" plan " was further considered by the Committee during the Meeting at

Manchester, " and the Committee having thus given their best endeavours

--to maturing the plan, beg now to submit it to the approval of the British

Association under the title of ' Series of Propositions for rendering the
nomenclature of zoology uniform and permanent ' "*.

    The propositions were printed in the Reports of the British Association,
and a grant of money was voted to print copies for circulation. The rules
thus laid down were very generally adopted by zoologists, both in this
country and abroad; but in Great Britain having been printed only in
the volumes of the British Association, 'Annals of Natural History,' and
'Philosophical Magazine 'f, or depending on private circulation, it was
deemed advisable that greater publicity should be given to them, and at the
Meeting at Oxford in 1860 it was resolved, that " The surviving members of
the Committee appointed in 1842, viz., Mr. C. Darwin, Rev. Professor

Henslow, Rev. L. Jenyns, Mr. W. Ogilby, Professor Phillips, Sir John

Richardson, Mr. J. 0. Westwood, Professor Owen, Mr. "W. E. Shuckard,
and Mr. G. R. "Waterhouse, for the purpose of preparing rules for the esta-
blishment of a Uniform Zoological Nomenclature, be reappointed, with Sir

W. Jardine, Bart., and Dr. Sclater. That Sir W. Jardine, Bart., be the

Reporter, and that the sum of £10 be placed at their disposal for the pur-

pose of revising and reprinting the Rules "J.

   Prom the difficulty of bringing such a Committee together, nothing was

done since the time of its appointment ; but the resolution and a grant of
money were again renewed at the late Meeting in Newcastle, as follows :
"That Sir W.- Jardine, A. R. Wallace, J. E. Gray, Professor Babington, Dr.
Francis, Dr. Sclater, C. Spence Bate, P. P. Carpenter, Dr. J. D. Hooker,

Professor Balfour, H. T. Stainton, J. Gwyn Jeffreys, A. Newton, Professor

T. H. Huxley, Professor Allman, and G. Bentham, be a Committee, with
power to add to their number, to report on the changes, if any, which they

may consider it desirable to make in the Rules of Nomenclature drawn up

at the instance of the Association by Mr. H. E. Strickland and others, with
power to reprint these Rules, and to correspond with foreign naturalists and
others on tbe best means of ensuring their general adoption, and that the
sum of £15 be placed at their disposal for the purpose."

    Accordingly the Rules, as originally approved of, were reprinted, and
zoologists were requested " to examine them carefully, and to communicate
any suggestions for alteration or improvement, on or before the 1st of June,

1864, to Sir William Jardine, Bart., Jardine Hall, by Loclerby, N. B., who
will consult with the members of the Committee, and report upon the sub-

ject at the next Meeting of the British Association appointed to be held at

Bath."

   Erom the press of business at Bath the Committee did little there to com-
plete further the code of Zoological Nomenclature, and I was directed to
take some opportunity while in London to call together as many members
of the Committee as possible. Accordingly in the month of June last I sent

Gray, Professor Babington, Dr. Francis, Dr. Sclater, Dr. J. Hooker, Mr.

Stainton, Professor Huxley, Mr. A. Newton, and Mr. G. Bentham. Mr. Gwyn

Jeffreys kindly permitted this meeting to be held at his house in Devonshire-

place, and it was attended by myself, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, Mr. Wallace, and
Dr. Sclater ; the other gentlemen who had been invited sending apologies that

from various causes they were unable to come up to London or to attend.

Tbey, however, expressed themselves generally favourable to some code of

rules being adopted.

Professor Babington having returned his printed copy of the rules with

his observations written on the margin, the Committee were fully in posession

of his views. Mr. Wallace had brought with him a written memorandum

containing notes of what he thought could be altered or modified with
advantage. The members present then read over the printed rules and

recommendations one by one, and carefully compared them with the memo-

randa above mentioned, as well as with many letters from other naturalists,
and the observations made upon each were taken down at the time. The re-

commendations of the Committee, which I shall presently read to you, have

been based upon these observations, and upon the conferences and discussions

held at Birmingham during the present Meeting.

Since the time that Mr. H. E. Strickland's Rules and Recommendations

were printed in the Reports of the British Association, zoological nomen-

clature has not been improved. Whether it is from the rules and recom-

mendations not being sufficiently well known, or from an idea that no one

has any right to interfere with or make rules for others, many gentlemen

appear to cast them away, and do not recognize them at all, while others
accept or reject just what pleases themselves ; in consequence many very
objectionable names have been given, and a very base coinage and spurious

combinations have been going on. The Committee does not allude to very

long or harsh sounding names, though they are much to be deprecated even

when classically compounded                                                                                                         but they object to  indelicate names, or to such
                                                                                                                                 ;

compounds as Malherbipims, Kawpifalco, Zebrapicus, &c; or, when a new

form in the genus Procelhria is thought to be discovered, and honour is

intended to be done to a distinguished navigator, such a word as Coohilaria

is proposed ; or, when provincial names are attempted to be Latinized, as in

the case of a fish commonly known as the " Tom Cod," which is entered in

our systems under the scientific (?) name of Morrhua tomcodus. These may

be said to be extreme examples, but hundreds might be given, and it is the

opinion of the Committee that the only way to deal with such names is

to reject them altogether.

    In this condition of our zoological nomenclature, then, it is of the greatest
importance that some general code of rules should be adopted and acted
upon. The Committee were perfectly agreed upon this point, but on calling
them together during the present Meeting of the British Association, the

botanists arrived at the conclusion that, having long acted in concert upon
the rules laid down by Linnaeus in the ' Philosophia Botanica,' and by Sir
James E. Smith, Decandolle, and others, it was unnecessary for them to have
Botany included in the Stricklandian code ; at the same time they were sen-
sible that some generally recognized code would be of the utmost importance

to zoology. The Committee therefore are of opinion and recommend :
28 report-- 1865.

I. That Botany should not be introduced into the Strickland rules and
        recommendations.

II. That the permanency of names and convenience of practical appli-
         cation being the two chief requisites in any code of rules for scien-
        tific nomenclature, it is not advisable to disturb by any material
         alterations the rules of zoological nomenclature which were au-

      Dthorized by Section at the Meeting of the British Association at

      Manchester in 1842.

III.  The Committee are of opinion, after much deliberation, that the
         Xllth edition of the ' Systema Natura) ' is that to which the limit
         of time should apply, viz. 1766. But as the -works of Artedi and

         Scopoli have already been extensively used by ichthyologists and
         entomologists, it is recommended that the names contained in or
        used from these authors should not be affected by this provision.
        This is particularly requisite as regards the generic names of

      Artedi afterwards used by Linnaeus himself.

   In Mr. H. E. Strickland's original draft of these Bules and Recommen-
dations the edition of Linnaeus was left blank, and the Xllth was inserted by
the Manchester Committee. This was done not as being the first in which the
Binomial nomenclature had been used, as it commenced with the Xth, but as

being the last and most complete edition of Linnoeus's works, and containing

many species the Xth did not. For these reasons it is now confirmed by

this Committee, and also because these rules having been used and acted

upon for twenty-three years, if the date were altered now, many changes of
names would be required, and in consequence much confusion introduced.

IV. In Rule 13th, " Specific names, when adopted as generic, must be
         changed." The Committee agree that it is exceedingly injudicious
         to adopt a specific name as a generic name, but they are of opinion
          that where this has been done, it is the generic name which must be
          thrown aside, not the old specific name, and that this rule shoidd
          be so altered as to meet this.

 Y. The recommendations under " Ckisses of objectionable names,'' as

           already pointed out, cannot be too carefully attended to. Specific-
          names from persons have already been sufficiently prostituted, and
         personal generic names have increased to a large and undeserving

         extent. The handing down the name of a naturalist by a genus

          has always been considered as the highest honour that could be
          given, and shoidd never be bestowed lightly*.

TI.   The recommendation, " Specific names to be written with a small
        initial." The Committee propose that this recommendation should

        be omitted. It is not of great importance, and may be safely left

         to naturalists to deal with as they think fit.

   These are the chief alterations and modifications the Committee have to
suggest. It is scarcely possible to make any code of rules for a subject so
extensive as zoology either perfect in itself or such as will meet the opinions
of every one. It must be a matter of compromise, and as working by no
rides is creating great confusion and an immense increase in synonymy, the
Committee would ask this Section to approve their present report or finding,

RULES FOR RECTIFYING THE PRESENT ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.

[Limitation of the Plan to Systematic Nomenclature.']

In proposing a measure for the establishment of a permanent and uni-

versal zoological nomenclature, it must be premised that we refer solely to

Wethe Latin or systematic language of zoology.  have nothing to do with

vernacular appellations. One great cause of the neglect and corruption

wbich prevails in the scientific nomenclature of zoology, has been the

frequent and often exclusive use of vernacular names in lieu of the Latin

binomial designations, which form the only legitimate language of systematic

zoology. Let us then endeavour to render perfect the Latin or Linnajan

method of nomenclature, which, being far removed from the scope of national

vanities and modern antipathies, holds out the only hope of introducing into

zoology that grand desideratum, an universal language.

                    [Laiu of Priority the only effectual and just one.~\

    It being admitted on all hands that words are only the conventional signs
of ideas, it is evident that language can only attain its end effectually by
being permanently established and generally recognized. This consideration

ought, it would seem, to have checked those who are continually attempting

to subvert the established language of zoology by substituting terms of their
own coinage. But, forgetting the true nature of language, they persist in
confounding the name of a species or group with its definition ; and because
the former often falls short of the fulness of expression found in the latter,

they cancel it without hesitation, and introduce some new term which
appears to them more characteristic, but which is utterly unknown to the

science, and is therefore devoid of all authority f. If these persons were to

object to such names of men as Long, Little, Armstrong, Golightly, &c, in cases
where they fail to apply to the individuals who bear them, or shoidd complain

of the names Gough, Lawrence, or Harvey, that they were devoid of meaning,
and should hence propose to change them for more characteristic appella-
tions, they woidd not act more unphilosophically or inconsiderately than
they do in the case before us ; for, in truth, it matters not in the least by

what conventional sound we agree to designate an individual object, provided

the sign to be employed be stamped with such an authority as will suffice to

make it pass current. Kow in zoology no one person can subsequently claim

an authority equal to that possessed by the person who is the first to define
a new genus or describe a new species ; and hence it is that the name
originally given, even though it may be inferior in point of elegance or

expressiveness to those subsequently proposed, ought as a general principle

to be permanently retained. To this consideration we ought to add the
injustice of erasing the name originally selected by the person to whose
labours we owe our first knowledge of the object ; and we should reflect how
much the permission of such a practice opens a door to obscure pretenders

for dragging themselves into notice at the expense of original observers.

Neither can an author be permitted to alter a name which he himself has
once published, except in accordance with fixed and equitable laws. It is
well observed by Decandollc, " L'auteur menie qui a le premier etabli un nom

n'a pas plus qu'uu autre le droit de le changer pour simple cause d'impro-

priete. La priorite en effet est un terme fixe, positif, qui n'admet rien, ni

d'arbitraire ni de partial."

   For these reasons, we have no hesitation in adopting as our fundamental
maxim, the " law of priority," viz.,

   § 1. The name originally given by the founder of a group or the describer

of a species shoidd be permanently retained, to the exclusion of all subse-
quent synonyms (with the exceptions about to be noticed).

   Having laid down this principle, we must next inquire into the limitations

which are found necessary in carrying it into practice.

                        [Not to extend to authors older than Liimams.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ~\

   As our subject matter is strictly confined to the binomial system of nomen-
clature, or that which indicates species by means of two Latin words, the one
generic, the other specific, and as this invaluable method originated solely
with Linnaeus, it is clear that, as far as species are concerned, we ought not
to attempt to carry back the principle of priority beyond the date of the 12th
edition of the ' Systems Naturae,' 17G6. Previous to that period, natural-
ists were wont to indicate species not by a name comprised in one word, but
by a definition which occupied a sentence, the extreme verbosity of which
method was productive of great inconvenience. It is true that one word
sometimes sufficed for the definition of a species, but these rare cases were
only binomial by accident and not by principle, and ought not therefore in
any instance to supersede the binomial designations imposed by Linnaeus.

   The same reasons apply also to generic names. Linnaeus was the first to
attach a definite value to genera, and to give them a systematic character by
means of exact definitions ; and therefore, although the names used by pre-

vious authors may often be applied with propriety to modern genera, yet in
such cases they acquire a new meaning, and should be quoted on the authority
of the first person who used them in this secondary sense. It is true, that

several of the old authors 'made occasional approaches to the Linnaean exact-
ness of generic definition, but still these were but partial attempts ; and it

is certain that if in our rectification of the binomial nomenclature we once

trace back our authorities into the obscurity which preceded the epoch of its

foundation, we shall find no resting-place or fixed boundary for our researches.
The nomenclature of Eay is chiefly derived from that of Gesner and Aldro-
vandus, and from these authors we might proceed backward to iElian, Plinv,
and Aristotle, till our zoological studies would be frittered away amid the

refinements of classical learning*.

              RULES OF ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.                           31

   We therefore recommend the adoption of the folio-wing proposition :

    § 2. The binomial nomenclature having originated with Linnaeus, the law
of priority in respect of that nomenclature, is not to extend to the writings
of antecedent authors, and therefore specific names published before 1706
cannot be used to the prejudice of names published since that date.

    [It should be here explained, that as the works of Artedi and Scopoli have
already been extensively used by ichthyologists and entomologists, the names
contained in or used from these authors should not be affected by this provi-
sion. This is particularly requisite as regards the generic names of Artedi,

afterwards used by Linnaeus himself. Brisson also, who was a contemporary

of Linnasus and acquainted with the ' Systema Naturae,' defined and pub-
lished certain genera of birds which are additional to those in the twelfth edi-
tion of Linnaeus's works, and which are therefore of perfectly good authority.
But Brisson still adhered to the old mode of designating species by a sentence

instead of a word, and therefore while we retain his defined genera, we do
not extend the same indulgence to the titles of his species, even when the

latter are accidentally binomial in form. For instance, the PerdLv rubra of

Brisson is the Tetrao rufus of Linnaous ; therefore as we in this case retain
the generic name of Brisson and the specific name of Linnaeus, the correct

title of the species would be Perdix rafa (Linn.).

            [Generic names not to be cancelled in subsequent subdivisions.']

   As the number of known species which form the groundwork of zoological

science is always increasing, and our knowledge of their structure becomes
more complete, fresh generalizations continually occur to the naturalist, and
the number of genera and other groups requiring appellations is ever becom-
ing more extensive. It thus becomes necessary to subdivide the contents of

old grotips, and to make their definitions continually more restricted. In

carrying out this process, it is an act of justice to the original author 'that his

generic name should never be lost sight of; and it is no less essential to the
welfare of the science, that all which is sound in its nomenclature should
remain unaltered amid the additions which are continually being made to it.
On this ground we recommend the adoption of the following rule :

  A§ 3. generic name, when once established, should never be cancelled in

any subsequent subdivision of the group, but retained in a restricted sense
for one of the constituent portions.

[Generic names to be retained for the typical portion of the old genus.]

When a genus is subdivided into other genera, the original name shoidd

be retained for that portion of it which exhibits in the greatest degree its

essential characters as at first defined. Authors frequeutly indicate this by

selecting some one species as a fixed point of reference, which they term the

" type of the genus." When they omit doing so, it may still in many

cases be correctly inferred that the first species mentioned on their list, if

found accurately to agree with their definition, was regarded by them as the

Atype.  specific name, or its synonyms, will also often serve to point out

the particular species which by implication must be regarded as the original'

type of a genus. In such cases we are justified in restoring the name of the

old genus to its typical signification, even when later authors have done

Weotherwise.  submit therefore that

§4. The generic name should always be retained for that portion of the

--original genus which was considered typical by the author.
   Example. The genus Picumnus was established by Temminck, and in-
--32 report 1865.

eluded two groups, one with four toes, the other with three, the former of
which was regarded by the author as typical. Swainson, however, in raising

these groups at a later period to the rank of genera, gave a new name, Asthe-

nurus, to the former group, aud retained Picumnus for the latter. In this

case we have no choice but to restore the name Picumnus, Temm., to its cor-
rect sense, cancelling the name Asthenurus, Sw., and imposing a new name

on the three-toed group which Swainson had called Picumnus.

   [ When no type is indicated, then the original name is to be kept for that

                           subsequent subdivision which first received it.']

    Our next proposition seems to require no explanation :

   § 5. When the evidence as to the original type of a genus is not perfectly
clear and indisputable, then the person who first subdivides the genus may

affix the original name to any portion of it at his discretion, and no later
author has a right to transfer that name to any other part of the original

genus.

      [A later name of the same extent as an earlier to be wholly cancelled.]
   When an author infringes the law of priority by giving a new name to
a genus which has been properly defined and named ahead}-, the only penalty
which can be attached to this act of negligence or injustice, is to expel the
name so introduced from the pale of the science. It is not right, then, in
such cases to restrict the meaning of the latter name so that it may stand

side by side with the earlier one, as has sometimes been done. For instance,
the genus Monaulus, Yieill. 1816, is a precise equivalent to Lop>hophorus,

Temm. 1813, both authors having adopted the same species as their type,
and therefore, when the latter genus came in the course of time to be di-
vided into two, it was incorrect to give the condemned name Monaulus to one

:--of the portions. To state this succinctly
   § 6. When two authors define and name the same genus, both making it

exactly of the same extent, the later name should be cancelled in toto, and

not retained in a modified sense*.
    This rule admits of the following exception :
    § 7. Provided, however, that if these authors select their respective types

from different sections of the genus, and these sections be afterwards raised

into genera, then both these names may be retained in a restricted sense for
the new genera respectively.

 --Example The names (Edemia and Melanetta were originally coextensive

synonyms, but their respective types were taken from different sections which

are now raised into genera, distinguished by the above titles.

   [No special ride is required for the cases in which the later of two generic
names is so defined as to be less extensive in signification than the earlier,
for if the later includes the type of the eaidier genus, it would be cancelled
by the operation of § 4 ; and if it does not include that type, it is in fact

a distinct genus.]

   But when the later name is more extensive than the earlier, the following

--rule comes into operation :

         \_A later name equivalent to severed earlier ones is to be cancelled.]

   The saiue principle which is involved in § 6 will apply to § 8.

   * These discarded names may, however, be tolerated, if they have been afterwards
proposed in a totally new sense, though we trust that in future no one will knowingly
apply an old name, whether now adopted or not, to a new genus, (See proposition,

c[. infra.)
       RULES OF ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.     33

    § 8. If the later name be so denned as to be equal in extent to two or

--more previously published genera, it must be cancelled in toto.
    Example. Psarocolius, Wagl. 1827, is equivalent to five or six genera
previously published under other names, therefore Psarocolius should be

 cancelled.

    If these previously published genera be separately adopted (as is the case

with the equivalents of Psarocolius), their original names will of course
prevail ; but if we follow the later author in combining them into one, the

following rule is necessary :

\_A genus compounded of two or more previously proposed genera ivlwse cha-
  racters are now deemed insufficient, should retain the name of one of them.~]

    It sometimes happens that the progress of science requires two or more
genera, founded on insufficient or erroneous characters, to be combined toge-
ther into one. In such cases the law of priority forbids us to cancel all the

original names and impose a new one on this compound genus. We must

therefore select some one species as a type or example, and give the generic

name which it formerly bore to the whole group now formed. If these

original generic names differ in date, the oldest one should be the one

adopted.

    § 9. In compounding a genus out of several smaller ones, the earliest of
them, if otherwise objectionable, should be selected, and its former generic

--name be extended over the new genus so compounded.
   Example. The genera Accentor and Prunella of Vieillot not being consi-

dered sufficiently distinct in character, are now united under the general
name of Accentor, that being the earliest.

  We now proceed to point out those few cases which form exceptions to the

law of priority, and in which it becomes both justifiable and necessary to
alter the names originally imposed by authors.

\_A name should be changed ivhen previously applied to another group ivhich

                                                         still retains it.~\

It being essential to the binomial method to indicate objects in natural

history by means of two words only, without the aid of any further designa-

--tion, it follows that a generic name should only have one meaning in other

words, that two genera should never bear the same name. For a similar

reason, no two species in the same genus should bear the same name. When

these cases occur, the later of the two duplicate names should be cancelled,

and a new term, or the earliest synonym, if there be any, substituted.

When it is necessary to form new words for this purpose, it is desirable to

make them bear some analogy to those which they are destined to supersede,

as where the genus of birds Plectorhynchus, being preoccupied in Ichthyology,

is changed to Plectorhamphus. It is, we conceive, the bounden duty of an

author, when naming a new genus, to ascertain by careful search that the

name which he proposes to employ has not been previously adopted in other

departments of natural history*. By neglecting this precaution he is liable

to have the name altered and his authority superseded by the first subsequent

aiithor who may detect the oversight, and for this result, however unfortu-

nate, we fear there is no remedy, though such cases would be less frequent

   # This laborious and difficult research is now greatly facilitated by the very useful
work of M. Agassiz, entitled " Nomenclator Zoologicus," and "Index Universalis " to

that work.

if the detectors of these errors would, as an act of courtesy, point them out
to the author himself, if living, and leave it to him to correct his own inad-
vertencies. This occasional hardship appears to us to be a less evil than to
permit the practice of giving the same generic name ad libitum to a multi-
plicity of genera. "We submit, therefore, that

  A§ 10. name should be changed which has before been proposed for some

other genus in zoology or botany, or for some other species in the same
genus, when still retained for such genus or species.

           \_A name whose meaning is glaringly false mag be changed.]

    Our next proposition has no other claim for adoption than that of being a

concession to human infirmity. If such proper names of places as Covent

Garden, Lincoln's Inn Fields, Newcastle, Bridgewater, &c, no longer suggest
the ideas of gardens, fields, castles, or bridges, but refer the mind with the
quickness of thought to the particular localities which they respectively de-

signate, there seems no reason why the proper names used in natural history
should not equally perform the office of correct indication, even when their
etymological meaning may be wholly inapplicable to the object which they
typify. But we must remember that the language of science has but a

limited currency, and hence the words which compose it do not circulate with
the same freedom and rapidity as those which belong to every-day life. The
attention is consequently liable in scientific studies to be diverted from the
contemplation of the thing signified to the etymological meaning of the sign,
and hence it is necessary to provide that the latter shall not be such as to
propagate actual error. Instances of this kind are indeed very rare, and in
some cases, such as that of Monodon, Caprimulgus, JParadisea apoda and
Monocidus, they have acquired sufficient currency no longer to cause error,

and are therefore retained without change. But when we find a Batrachian
reptile named in violation of its true affinities Mastodonsaurus, a Mexican

species termed (through erroneous information of its habitat) Picus cafer, or

an olive-coloured one Muscicapa atra, or when a name is derived from an

accidental monstrosity, as in Picas semirostris of Linnasus, and Helix dis-

juncta of Turton, we feel justified in cancelling these names, and adopting
that synonym which stands next in point of date. At the same time we

think it right to remark that this privilege is very liable to abuse, and
ought therefore to be applied only to extreme cases and with great caution.

With these limitations we may concede that

   A§ 11. name may be changed when it implies a false proposition which

is likely to propagate important errors.

                      [Names not clearly defined may be changed.']

    Unless a species or group is intelligibly defined when the name is given, it
cannot be recognized by others, and the signification of the name is conse-
quently lost. Two things are necessary before a zoological term can acquire

any authority, viz., definition and. publication. Definition properly implies

a distinct exposition of essential characters, and in all cases we conceive

this to be indispensable, although some authors maintain that a mere enu-
meration of the component species, or even of a single type, is sufficient to
authenticate a genus. To constitute pvMioation) nothing short of the inser-

tion of the above particvdars in a printed booh can be held sufficient. Many

birds, for instance, in the Paris and other continental museums, shells in the

British Museum (in Dr. Leach's time), and fossils in the Scarborough and

other public collections, have received MS. names, which will bo of no

authority until they are published with characters*. Nor can any unpub-
lished descriptions, however exact (such as those of Forster, which are still
shut tip in a MS. at Berlin), claim any right of priority till published, and
then only from the date of their publication. The same rule applies to cases
where groups or species are published, but not defined, as in some museum
catalogues, and in Lesson's ' Traite d Ornithologie,' where many species are
enumerated by name, without any description or reference by which they

can be identified. Therefore,

  § 12. A name winch has never been clearly defined in some published

work should be changed for the earliest name by which the object shall have

been so defined.

[Si>ecijic names, when adopted as generic, must be changed.]

The necessity for the following ride will be best illustrated by an example.

The Corvus pyrrhocntrcue, Linn., was afterwards advanced to a genus under

the name of Pyrrhocorax. Temminck adopts this generic name, and also

retains the old specific one, so that he terms the species Pyrrhocorax pyr-

rhocorax. The inelegance of this method is so great as to demand a change

Weof the generic name.  propose, therefore, that

A§ 13.  specific name must not be altered in order to use that name for

the genus ; where this has been already done the old specific name must be

--restored, and a new generic name given to prevent an unharmonious repetition.
   N.B. It will be seen, however, below that we strongly object to the

further continuance of this practice of elevating specific names into generic.

                                  [Latin orthography to he adhered to.']

   On the subject of orthography it is necessary to lay down one proposi-

tion,

   § 14. In writing zoological names, the rules of Latin orthography must
be adhered to.

   In Latinizing Greek words there are certain rides of orthography known
to classical scholars which must never be departed from. For instance, the
names which modern authors have written Aipucnemia, Zenophasia, poio-

cephala, must, according to the laws of etymology, be spelt ^Epycnemia,
Xenoph isia, and pceocephala. In Latinizing modern words the rules of classic

usage do not apply, and all that we can do is to give to such terms as clas-
sical an appearance as we can, consistently with the preservation of their

etymology. In the case of European words whose orthography is fixed, it is

best to retain the original form, even though it may include letters and com-
binations unknown in Latin. Such words, for instance, as Woodivardi,

Knighti, BuUocki, Eschscholtzi, would be qiute unintelligible if they were
Latinized into J'udvardi, Cnichti, Bidlocei, Essolzi, &e. But words of bar-
barous origin, having no fixed orthography, are more pliable, and hence,
when adopted into the Latin, they should be rendered as classical in appear-
ance as is consistent with the preservation of their original sound. Thus

the words Tortus, awsuree, argoondah, leundoo, &c., should, when Latinized,

have been written Toccus, ausure, argunda, cundu, &c. Such words ought,
in all practicable cases, to have a Latin termination given them, especially if
they are used generically.

   In Latinizing proper names, the simplest rule appears to be to use the

termination -us, genitive -i, when the name ends with a consonant, as in

* These MS. names are hi all cases liable to create confusion, and it is therefore much

to be desired that the practice of using them should be avoided in future.

                                                                            d2

the above examples ; and -ius, gen. -ii, when it ends with a vowel, as,

Latreille, Latreillii, &c.

   In converting Greek words into Latin the following rules must be attended

to:--

   When a name has been erroneously written and its orthography has been

afterwards amended, we conceive that the authority of the original author
should still be retained for the name, and not that of the person who makes

the correction.

            [Classes of objectionable names.']

It follows from hence that the following classes of words are more or less

objectionable in point of taste, though, in the case of genera, it is often neces-

sary to use them, from the impossibility of finding characteristic words which

Wehave not before been employed for other genera.  will commence with

--those which appear the least open to objection, such as
   a. Geographical names. These words being for the most part adjectives
can rarely be used for genera. As designations of species they have been

so strongly objected to, that some authors (Wagler, for instance) have gone

the length of substituting fresh names wherever they occur ; others (e. g.

WeSwainson) will only tolerate them where they apply exclusively.  are by

no means exposed to go to this length. It is not the less true that the

Hirundo javanica is a Javanese bird, even though it may occur in other
countries also, and though other species of Hirundo may occur in Java. The

utmost that can be urged against such words is, that they do not tell the

whole truth. However, as so many authors object to this class of names, it

is. better to avoid giving them, except where there is reason to believe that
the species is confined to the country whose name it bears.

  --b. Barbarous names. Some authors protest strongly against the introduc-

tion of exotic words into our Latin nomenclature, others defend the practice

Wewith equal warmth.  may remark, first, that the practice is not contrary

to classical usage, for the Greeks and Eomans did occasionally, though with

reluctance, introduce barbarous words in a modified form into their respec-

tive languages. Secondly, the preservation of trivial names which animals

bear in their native countries is often of great use to the traveller in aiding

Wehim to discover and identify species.  do not therefore consider, if such

words have a Latin termination given to them, that the occasional and judi-

cious use of them as scientific terms can be justly objected to.

c. Technical namcs.^-All words expressive of trades and professions have

been by some writers excluded from zoology, but without sufficient reason.

Words of this class, when carefully chosen, often express the peculiar cha-

racters and habits of animals in a metaphorical manner, which is highly

Weelegant.  may cite the generic terms Arvicola, Lanius, Pastor, Tyrannus,

Hegulus, Ploceus, &c, as favourable examples of this class of names.

 --d. Mythological or historical names. When these have no perceptible re-

ference or allusion to the characters of the object on which they are conferred,

they may properly be regarded as unmeaning and in bad taste. Thus the

generic names Lesbia, Leilus, Remus, Corydon, Pasijmae, have been applied

to a Humming bird, a Butterfly, a Beetle, a Parrot, and a Crab respectively,
without any perceptible association of ideas. But mythological names may

sometimes be used as generic with the same propriety as technical ones, in

cases where a direct allusion can be traced between the narrated actions of a

personage and the observed habits or structure of an animal. Thus when the

name Progne is given to a Swallow, Clotho to a Spider, Hydra to a Polyp, Athene

to an Owl, Nestor to a grey-headed Parrot, &c, a pleasing and beneficial con-

nexion is established between classical literature and physical science.

  --e. Comparative names. The objections which have been raised to words of

this class are not without foundation. The names, no less than the defini-

tions of objects, should, where practicable, be drawn from positive and self-

evident characters, and not from a comparison with other objects, which may
be less known to the reader than the one before him. Specific names ex-

pressive of comparative size are also to be avoided, as they may be rendered

inaccurate by the after discovery of additional species. The names Picoides,
--38 report 1865.

Emberizoides, Pseudoluscinia, rubeculoides, maximus, minor, minimus, &c, are

examples of this objectionable practice.

 --f. Generic names compounded from other genera. These are in some degree

open to the same imputation as comparative words ; but as they often serve
to express the position of a genus as intermediate to, or allied with, two other

genera, they may occasionally be used with advantage. Care must be taken

not to adopt such compound words as are of too great length, and not to cor-
rupt them in trying to render them shorter. The names Gallopavo, Tetrao-

--gallus, Gypaetos, are examples of the appropriate use of compound words.
   g. Specific names derived from persons. So long as these complimentary
designations are used with moderation, and are restricted to persons of emi-

nence as scientific zoologists, they may be employed with propriety in cases
where expressive or characteristic words are not to be found. But we fully
concur with those who censure the practice of naming species after persons

of no scientific reputation, as curiosity dealers (e.g. Caniveti, Boissoneauti),

--Peruvian priestesses (Cora, Amazilia), or Hottentots (Klassi).
    h. Generic names derived from persons. Words of this class have been ex-
tensively used in botany, and therefore it would have been «'cll to have
excluded them wholly from zoology, for the sake of obtaining a memoria
technica by which the name of a genus would at once tell us to which of the
kingdoms of nature it belonged. Some personal generic names have, how-
ever, crept into zoology, as L'uvieria, Mulleria, Rossia, Lessonia, &c, but they
are rare in comparison with those of botany, and it is perhaps desirable not
to add to their number.

  --i. Names of harsh and inelegant />ronuneiation. These words are grating to

 the ear, either from inelegance of form, as Hidma, Yuhina, Oraxirex, Esch-
 scholtzi, or from too great length, as chirostrongylosti nus, Opetiorhynchus, bra,-
 chypodioides, Thecodontosaurus. It is needless to enlarge on the advantage of
 consulting euphony in the construction of our language. As a general rule it

 may be recommended to avoid introducing words of more than live .syllables.

  --Tc. Ancient names of animals applied in << wrong sense. If has been cus-

 tomary, in numerous cases, to apply the names of animals found in clas.-ic
 authors at random to exotic genera or species which arc wholly unknown to
 tbe ancients. The names Cebus, Callithrix, Spiza, Kitta, Struthus, ave ex-
 amples. This practice ought by no means to be encouragi d. The usual
 defence for it is, that it is impossible now to identify the species to which
 the name was anciently applied. But it is certain that if any traveller will
 take the trouble to collect the vernacular names used by the modern Greeks
 and Italians for the Ycrtebrata and Mollusca of southern Europe, the mean-

 ing of the ancient names may in most cases lie determined with the greatest

 precision. It has been well remarked that a Cretan fisher-boy is a far better

 commentator on Aristotle's ' History of Animals' than a British or German
 scholar. The use, however, of ancient names, when comvctly applied, is most

 desirable, for " in framing scientific terms, the appropriation of old words is

 preferable to the formation of new ones"*.

  --1. Adjective g> n> rie mimes. The names of genera are in all cases essen-

 tially substantive, and hence adjective terms cannot be employed for them
 without doing violence to grammar. The generic names Hians, Oriniger,
  Cursorius, Nitidula, &c, arc examples of this incorrect usage.

  --m. Hybrid names. Compound words, whose component parts are taken

 from two different languages, are great deformities in nomenclature, and
 naturalists should be especially guarded not to introduce any more such terms

                        * Whewell, Phil. Ind. Sc. vol. i. p. lxvii ; Nov. Org. Ken. iv. iii.

Weinto zoology, which furnishes too many examples of them already.  have

them compounded of Greek and Latin, as Denclrofalco, Gymnocorvus, Mono-

eulus, Arborophila, Jlavkfaster ; Greek and French, as Jacamaralcyon, Jaca-

merops ; and Greek and English, as BullocJcoides, Gilbertsocrinites.

 --n. Names closely resembling other names already used. By Ride 10 it was

laid down that when a name is introduced which is identical with one pre-

viously used, the later one shoidd be changed. Some authors have extended

the same principle to cases where the later name, when correctly written,

Weonly approaches in form, without wholly coinciding with, the earlier.

do not, however, think it advisable to make this law imperative, first, because

of the vast extent of our nomenclature, which renders it highly difficult to
find a name which shall not bear more or less resemblance in sound to some

other ; and, secondly, because of the impossibility of fixing a limit to the

degree of approximation beyond which such a law shoidd cease to operate.

We content ourselves, therefore, with putting forth this proposition merely as

a recommendation to naturalists, in selecting generic names, to avoid such as

too closely approximate words already adopted. So with respect to species,

the judicious naturalist will aim at variety of designation, and will not, for

example, call a species virens or virescens in a genus which already possesses

--a viridis.
   o. Corrupted words. In the construction of compound Latin words, there
are certain grammatical rides which have been known and acted on for two

thousand years, and which a naturalist is bound to acquaint himself with
before he tries his skill in coining zoological terms. One of the chief of these

rules is, that in compounding words all the radical or essential parts of the
constituent members must be retained, and no change made except in the

variable termiuations. But several generic names have been lately intro-

duced which run counter to this ride, and form most unsightly objects to all

Awho are conversant with the spirit of the Latin language.  name made

up of the first half of one word and the last half of another, is as deformed

a monster in nomenclature as a Mermaid or a Centaur would be in zoo^gy
yet we find examples in the names Corcoran (from Corvus and Pyrrhocorax),

Oypsnagra (from Cypselus and Tanagra), Merulaxis (Merula and Synallcuvis),

Loxigilla (Loxia and Fringilla), ike. In other cases, where the commence-

    ,it of both the simple words is retained in the compound, a fault is still

committed by cutting off too much of the radical and vital portions, as is

the case in Bucorvus (from Buceros and Corvus), Ninox\(Nisus and Noc-

tua), &c.

 --p. Nonsense names. Some authors having found difficulty in selecting

generic names which have not been used before, have adopted the plan of

coining words at random without any .derivation or meaning whatever. The

following are examples : Viralva, Xema, Azeca, Assiminia, Quedius, Sjoisula.

To the same class we may refer anagrams of other generic names, as Dacelo

and Cedola of Alcedo, Zajoornia of Porzana, <kc. Such verbal trifling as this

is in very bad taste, and is especially calculated to bring the science into

contempt. It finds no precedent in the Augustan age of Latin, but can be

compared only to the" puerde quibblings of the middle ages. It is contrary

to the genius of all languages, which appear never to produce new words by

spontaneous generation, but always to derive them from some other source,

however distant or obscure. And it is peculiarly annoying to the etymologist,
who, after seeking in vain through the vast storehouses of human language

for the parentage of such words, discovers at last that he has been pursuing

an ignis fat mis.
--40 REPORT 1865.

 --q. Names previously cancelled by the operation of § 6. Some authors con-

sider that when a name has been reduced to a synonym by the operations of

the laws of priority, they are then at liberty to apply it at pleasure to any

new group which may be in want of a name. We consider, however, that

when a word has once been proposed in a given sense, and has afterwards

sunk into a synonym, it is far better to lay it aside for ever than to run the

--risk of making confusion by re-issuing it with a new meaning attached.
    v. Specific names raised into generic. It has sometimes been the practice
in subdividing an old genus to give to the lesser genera so formed, the names
of their respective typical species. Our Rule 13 authorize^ the forming a

new generic name in such cases ; but wc further wish to state our objections
to the practice altogether. Considering as we do that the original specific
names should as far as possible be held sacred, both on the grounds of justice
to their authors and of practical convenience to naturalists, we would strongly

dissuade from the further continuance of a practice which is gratuitous in

itself, and which involves the necessity of altering old names or making new

ones.

  We have now pointed out the principal rocks and shoals which lie in the

path of the nomenclator ; and it will be seen that the navigation through
them is by no means easy. The task of constructing a language which shall
supply the demands of scientific accuracy on the one hand, and of literary
elegance on the other, is not to be inconsiderately undertaken by unqualified

persons. Our nomenclature presents but too many flaws and inelegancics

already, and as the stern law of priority forbids their removal, it follows
that they must remain as monuments of the bad taste or bad scholarship of
their authors to the latest ages in which zoology shall be studied.

                    [Families to end in idae, and Subfamilies in inse.]

   The practice suggested in the following proposition has been adopted by

many recent authors, and its simplicity and convenience is so great that we
strongly recommend its universal use.

   § B. It is recommended that the assemblages of genera termed families
should be uniformly named by adding the termination idee to the name of the
earliest known, or most typically characterized genus in them ; and that their
subdivisions, termed subfamilies, should be similarly constructed, with the

termination ince.

   These words are formed by changing the last syllable of the genitive case

into idee or ince, as Strix, Strigis, Strigidce, Buceros, Bucerotis, Bucerotidce,
not Strividce, Buceridce.

     [The authority for a species, exclusive of the genus, to be followed by a

                                                     distinctive expression.^

   The systematic names of zoology being still far from that state of fixity
which is the ultimate aim of the science, it is frequently necessary for correct
indication to append to them the name of the person on whose authority they

have been proposed. When the same person is authority both for the specific

and generic name, the case is very simple ; but when the specific name of
one author is annexed to the generic name of another, some difficulty occurs.
For example, the Muscicapa crinita of Linnams belongs to the modern genus
Tyrannus of Vieillot ; but Swainson was the first to apply the specific name
of Linnceus to the generic one of Vieillot. The question now arises, Whose
authority is to be quoted for the name Tyrannus crinitus ? The expression
Tyrannus crinitus, Linn., would imply what is untrue, for Linnaeus did not
                RULES OF ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.                                                    41

use  the  term  Tyrannus                                            and Tyrannus crinitus, Yieill.,  is equally incorrect,
                                                                 ;

for Vieillot did not adopt the name crinitus. If we call it Tyrannus crinitus,

Sw., it would imply that Swainson was the first to describe the species, and

Linnaeus would be robbed of his due credit. If we term it Tyrannus, Vieill.,
crinitus, Linn., we use a form which, though expressing the facts correctly,

and therefore not without advantage in particular cases where great exact-

ness is required, is yet too lengthy and inconvenient to be used with ease and

rapidity. Of the three persons concerned with the construction of a bino-

mial title in the case before us, we conceive that the author who first

describes and names a species which forms the groundwork of later gene-

ralizations, possesses a higher claim to have his name recorded than he who

afterwards defines a genus which is found to embrace that species, or who

may be the mere accidental means of bringing the generic and specific names
into contact. By giving the authority for the specific name in preference to

all others, the inquirer is referred directly to the original description, habitat,

&c, of the species, and is at the same time reminded of the date of its dis-

covery ; while genera, being less numerous than species, may be carried in

the memory, or referred to in systematic works without the necessity of per-

petually quoting their authorities. The most simple mode then for ordinary

use seems to be, to append to the original authority for the species, when not

applying to the genus also, some distinctive mark implying an exclusive re-

ference to the specific name, as Tyrannus crinitus (Linn.), and to omit this
expression when the same authority attaches to both genus and species, as

Ostrea edulis, Linn. Therefore,

§ C. It is recommended that the authority for a specific name, when not

applying to the generic name also, should be expressed thus, (Linn.), as Tyran-

nus crinitus (Linn.).

             [Neiv genera and species to be defined amply and publicly.]

  A large proportion of the complicated mass of synonyms which has now

become the opprobrium of zoology, has originated either from the slovenly
and imperfect manner in which species and groups have been originally de-
fined, or from their definitions having been inserted in obscure local publica-
tions which have never obtained an extensive circulation. Therefore,

although under § 12 we have conceded that mere insertion in a printed
book is sufficient for publication, yet we would strongly advise the authors of
new groups always to give, in the first instance, a full and accurate defini-

tion of their characters, and to insert the same in such periodical or other
works as are likely to obtain an immediate and extensive circulation. To

state this briefly,

   § D. It is recommended that new genera or species be amply defined,

published, and extensively circulated in the first instance.

 [The names to be given to subdivisions of genera to agree in gender with

                                                          the original. genus.~\

   In order to preserve specific names as far as possible in an unaltered form,

whatever may be the changes which the genera to which they are referred
may undergo, it is desirable, when it can be done with propriety, to make
the new subdivisions of genera agree in gender with the old groups from

which they are formed. This recommendation does not, however, authorize
the changing the gender or termination of a genus already established. In

brief,

   § E. It is recommended that in subdividing an old genus in future, the
--42 report 1865.

names given to the subdivisions should agree in gender with that of the ori-

ginal group.

                    [Etymolor/ies and types of new genera to be stated.']

   It is obvious that the names of genera would in general be far more care-
fully constructed, and their definitions would be rendered more exact, if
authors woidd adopt the following suggestion :

   § F. It is recommended that in defining new genera the etymology of
the name shoidd be always stated, and that one species should be invariably

selected as a type or standard of reference.

In concluding this outline of a scheme for the rectification of zoological

nomenclature, we have only to remark, that almost the whole of the propo-

sitions contained in it may be applied with equal correctness to the sister

Wescience of botany.  have preferred, however, in this essay to limit our

views to zoology, both for the sake of rendering the question less complex,

and because we conceive that the botanical nomenclature of the present day

stands in much less need of distinct enactment than the zoological. The

admirable rides laid down by Linnaeus, Smith, Decandolle. and other botanists

(to which, no less than to the works of Fabricras, Illigcr, Vigors, Swainson,

and other zoologists, we have been much indebted in preparing the present

document), have always exercised a beneficial influence over their disciples.

Hence the language of botany has attained a more perfect and stable condi-

tion than that of zoology; and if this attempt at reformation may have the

effect of advancing zoological nomenclature beyond its present backward and

abnormal state, the wishes of its promoters will be fully attained.

Report of the Committee on the Distribution of the Organic Remains

  --of the North Staffordshire Coal-jield.- Concluding lleport. By a

   Committee, cons'/stint/ of Sir Philip db M. Grey Egerton, Bart.,
   F.R.S., Professor T. H. Huxley, F.R.S. Reporter, William Mo-

    LYNEUX, F.G.S.

The coal-measures of North Staffordshire may be divided into four distinct

groups, namely,

                          feet.  feet.

The Lowest Measures       from about 800 to 1000

The Lower Thick Measures  ,, 2000 to 2500
The Upper Thick Measures  ., 1400 to 1800
The Upper Measures        ,, 1000 to 1200

giving a total vertical thickness of from 5200 to G500 feet.
   The divisional formations of the lowest and lower thick measures in the

Cheadle-field consist of shaly coarse and fine sandstones, which, although not
proved by actual workings, would appear to be from 300 to 400 feet thick.
The extension of these sandstones northwards is checked by an upthrow of
Millstone-grits near Consall in the Churnet valley, and their place is occupied
in the Knypersley and Biddulph districts of the extreme northern point by
masses of black and brown shales and clayey laminated sandstones. The
divisions of the other groups correspond with this in some respects, but they
are less marked and massive. Each of these groups is characterized by the

presence of a distinct series of beds of coal and ironstone of greater or less
value and persistency. The lowest measures contain seven seams of coal,
three of which are worked for local use only, but the base is occupied by a

most valuable bed of Hydrate, known as the Froghall ironstone. The lower
thick measures contain all the best and thick coals, but only one band of
ironstone (the Burnt Wood) of sufficient thickness or quality to be worked.
The upper thick measures afford a remarkable contrast, as containing nearly

all the workable bands of ironstone, while the upper measures contain thick
masses of brick clays, with a few thin seams of coal, and but one or two
bands of ironstone to which any attention has been paid.

    It is probably a somewhat remarkable feature in connexion with these
great divisions, that in no instance have the two middle groups been found
to contain deposits showing an extended continuous water-action of a turbulent
character ; but in the upper part of the lowest measures, and the top beds of
the upper measures occur rocks resembling in every particular those of the
Millstone-grit. It may, however, be mentioned that instances have come
under notice of the occurrence of large rounded quartz pebbles in shales and
ironstones, lying near the base of the upper thick measures at Apedale ; and
in another case a large siliceous water-worn boulder, some pounds in weight,
was met with at considerable depth near a fault in one of the pits of the
Cheadie coal-field. It not unfrequently happens, however, that large masses,
composed of fragments of plants, broken shells, and other organic remains,
intermixed with subangular pieces of ironstone, coal, and shaly sandstones,
cemented together by a hard paste, are met with in sinkings and workings in
the neighbourhood of faults, but as a ride the enormous stratigraphical
deposits of these fields evidence tranquillity of action extending over a very
long period of time. This conclusion is borne out by the nature and condi-
tion of the organic remains imbedded in the shales and ironstones of the
different measures, which are not only exceedingly numerous, but of a most

remarkable and interesting order ; and it may here be stated as evidence of

the results of an extended pakeontological inquiry, that before the commence-
ment of a systematic course of research with reference to the subject, the
known species of fish-remains were limited to the number of nine, with
about the same number of shells, including those of a marine type then sup-
posed to be confined to a single bed belonging to the lowest measures of the
Churnet valley and its representative at Wetley Moor. The fish-remains

are, however, now found to consist of from 35 to 40 genera, embracing

upwards of 80 species, while the mollusca range out into upwards of 22
genera, represented by about 60 species ; the marine forms extend at intervals
upwards from the lowest to the upper thick measures, while the frequent
occurrence of reptilian remains, and the vast number of the smaller crusta-
ceans indicate the extended range and variety of the organic life of these
fields during the period of their formation. These reptilian remains consist
of single internal bones, with occasionally roughly ornamented external
bones of the head. The range of these animals has been traced from the
horizon of the Stinking Coal of the lowest beds, here and there up through
the whole of the measures, to the chalky mine ironstone of the upper thick
group. They are generally found in association with fish-remains, and appear

to have been more numerous during the formation of the New Ironstone, the

Knowles, and the Brown Mine ironstones of Kidsgrove, Fenton, Longton,
Silverdale, and Apedale. They are, however, by no means confined to these
localities, traces of them being found over the greater part of the area in-
cluded in these fields, and also in direct association, both with shells referable

                                                                                                              DD

to marine conditions, and those assumed to be of brackish or freshwater

 origin.

    Of all the forms of life met with in these fields the little Cytheropsis is the
most numerous and persistent. It occurs in almost every distinct mineral
deposit, and sometimes forms compact masses several inches in thickness, and
entirely separated from all other organisms ; at others it appears in associa-
tion with Mieroconchus alone, or is mixed indiscriminately with fish and
shells, or forms a thin layer'or parting between beds of shale or ironstone, or
the nucleus of ironstone nodules. It is, however, a fact of some importance
in the question referable to the conditions under which certain coal and iron-
stone beds were deposited, that the little fossil has never been found in the

Afields under notice in direct association with shells known to be marine.

most interesting example of this severance oecurs in the shales of the Stinking
Coal at Windsend, in the Churnet valley. The lower parte of these shales im-
mediately overlying the coal are remarkable for the immense number of Avi-
culopectens they contain in a compressed form, and associated with Goniatites,
Orthoceras, and Posidonia. In various instances the same shale-bed has yielded
 Ci/theropsis and Beyriehia, and occasionally Anthracosia ; but these three latter
fossils are always separated from the former. After repeated examinations,
it has been ascertained that about two feet above the coal a well-defined
division occurs in the form of a bone-bed, containing teeth, scales, coprolites,
and other remains, with frequent concretionary nodules, distinctly compressed
into the under surface of the shales. Above this line the Avievlopecten never
passes, and in no instance have the Ci/theropsis or Anthracosia been found
below it ; but each organic deposit is separated from the other as clearly and
distinctly as could have been effected by the intervention of thick masses of

 strata.

    With Cytheropsis are frequently found Beyriehia, Mieroconchus, and Ser-
pula, but the latter genus is by no means so generally distributed. Beyriehia
oocurs in great numbers in the shales of the Cockshead ironstone at Adderley
Green, in association with Cytheropsis and Mieroconchus ; but Serpula, so far
as has been proved, is confined to the shales of the Woodhead coal in the
Cheadle field. Each of these forms, like Cytheropsis, is confined to the beds

containing Anthracosia ; they never pass into the marine horizons of either the
upper or lowest measures.

    Until the present year these fields were not known to contain any of the

higher order of Crustacea ; recently, however, a fragment of Limulus has

been met with in a small nodule of the Hard Mine ironstone at Adderley
Green ; and more recently still a curious ironstone deposit, lying near the

base of the lowest measures of the Churnet valley, has been found to contain
Maoruran remains of an interesting form associated with Cytherop>sis and

Anthracoptera. It is by no means unlikely that these latter organisms may

be found to pass into the higher strata ; but so far they appear to be con-
fined to the particular bed in question.

    The fish-remains of these fields are of an exceedingly interesting character,
and in certain beds occur in great numbers, and in a most beautiful state of

preservation. Many new forms have been met with, and individual speci-

mens of well-known species occasional^ come to hand, by which some im-
portant anatomical points have been satisfactorily established. The whole of
these remains are now undergoing examination, and ere long a more complete
knowledge of their specific character will be arrived at.

    Of the Ganoid fishes, the most commonly distributed are the Paheonisci,
which range throughout the whole of the four great divisions of the fields,
NORTH STAFFORDSHIRE COAL-FIELD ORGANIC REMAINS.                                                                                                         45

and pass downwards into the shales of the Millstone-grit and the grey iron-

stone nodules of the Carboniferous shales. In the Aviculopecten shales of the

Stinking Coal two or three at present undetermined species are imbedded,

but rarely in a well-preserved condition. The species of this bed are inter-

mixed with the marine shells, and appear to be different to those so largely

distributed amongst the beds of the upper thick measures ; and in no instance
have they been found in this deposit to pass above the line of the bone-bed

alluded to, where detached scales are largely intermixed with Lhujulce and

other organisms in a fragmentary condition.

Towards the upper part of these lower beds a small species, tolerably per-

fect, is occasionally found imbedded in nodides of clay ironstone ; but, gene-
rally speaking, between this point and the shales of the Ash Coal, the base of

the upper thick measures, evidence of the existence of these fish seldom

occurs, except in the form of detached scales, scattered over the face of the

numerous intervening bone-beds. In the Ash-coal shales, however, they

appear in a more perfect form, and attain their maximum development in

the shales of the Deep Mine ironstone, 200 yards above it. This latter iron-

stone is at Longton, on the extreme western boundary of the proved measures,

1 foot 3 inches thick, and divided into four bands overlaid by a bed of black

shale, hard, clean, and easily split into thin slabs. As an ichthyolitic

depository it is one of the most interesting met with, and affords in addition

some curious data referable to the range of animal life in one distinct horizon.

This stone is worked at Longton, Fenton, Shelton, Berryhill, Sneyd Green,

Golden-hill, and other places, but not always under the same name. The

Longton bed is opened at two points communicating with each other, and from

the shales of these two workings have been collected, in a remarkable state of

preservation, specimens of eighteen genera, and about twenty-six species of

fish. One new genus, under the name of Cycloptychius, occurs in great

numbers and the most perfect condition ; but beyond the limits of the two

pits at Longton it has never as yet been known to pass ; and in each direc-

tion from this point, where the stone has been worked, the whole of its

organic remains die gradually out to a few detached scales and isolated teeth.

The restriction of the Palcronisci of this deposit to a definite range would

appear to indicate the prevalence of either deep or shallow water along this

particular line                                                                           but  it  is in the  character of its organic  contents  that  this
                                                                                       ;

peculiarity is the more observable ; the stone itself, where it has been

pierced, although showing a tendency to thin out towards its eastern out-

crop, retains over the greater part of the field a tolerably uniform thickness

and character.

Of Coslacanthus there are two species, ft leptums and C. granulates, the

former being the more common, and of greater range. Detached scales are

met with in the Hydrate shales, and here and there in the fossiliferous beds

of the lowest measures, including the Stinking Coal shales. In the Wood-

head coal-shale of the lower thick measures, 0. lepturus is occasionally found

in a fair state of preservation, and also in the nedular grey ironstones inter-

mixed with the grey shales above it. More frequently, however, it occurs as

detached scales ; and in this form, wherever Palceoniscus is detected, both
Gcelacanthvs and Platysomus are generally in association with it. The Deep

Mine ironstone contains numerous fine specimens, and it not unfrequently

occurs in the Cockshead, Knowles, and Brown Mine ironstones and shales.

   Platysomus, of which there are two species, has a somewhat similar range
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but in certain deposits, in different localities, each species appears to be a

characteristic feature.
--46 report 1865.

Many of the coal and ironstone beds are either of local extent, or

evidence a variation of condition of deposit within a limited area, and con-

sequently the measures of one district are no sure guides in engineering to

those of another. This more frequently happens in the upper thick beds

with the ironstone group, and it is found that this diversity in the character

of the mineral deposits is partaken of in a somewhat similar degree by the

forms of life directly associated with them. Taking the Longton and Fenton

beds as one example, the Deep Mine shales show the predominating form to

be PalcEoniscus, the Knowles ironstone Platymmus, and the New Ironstone

Megalichihys. At Silverdale and Apedale Palceoniscus is rare, while the

Brown Mine teems as it were with Platysomi. Passing to the Kidsgrove

district, the Brown Mine becomes the New Mine, and Phttysomus gives place

to Rhizodopsis, and passing downwards to the Woodhead coal, Ccelacanthus

appears as the characteristic fossil of its bed. The life-zone, as it were, of

each of these deposits also varies. In the case of the Deep Mine, it is con-

hned to a few inches of black shale immediately overlying the stone, and in
no known instance passing into the mineral itself. In the Knowles ironstone

shales the same conditions are observable                                                                                                                                                                                                            but  the  life-zone extends down-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

wards into the stone, fine specimens of Rhizodus, Ccelacanthus. Acanthodes,

and Megalichihys beim>- of frequent occurrence in the upper division of the

bed. The Brown Mine of Silverdale and the New Mine of Kidsgrove present

parallel conditions ; but in the Brown Mine of the latter district the shales

--form only the matrix of its interesting organisms. The beds of ironstone

and coal enumerated the Woodhead and Ash coals, and the Cockshead,

Knowles, Deep Mine, Brown, and New Mine ironstones--appear to be the

great fish-zones of these fields ; but it may be accepted that the whole of the

mineral beds contain the remains of either fish or shells, generally both. These

remains, as previously stated, are rare in certain localities ; but no bed has
hitherto been found totally unfossiliferous over the whole of its proved area.

It is also worthy of note, that in almost all, if not every case, the divisional

line between each seam of coal and band of ironstone and their associated

shales or bass, consists of a thin film, as it were, of detached scales and teeth

of fishes or compressed mollusks, showing in a simple but conclusive manner
that whatever may have been the condition under which each bed of coal
was formed, it was immediately after its formation covered by water con-

taining the ordinary forms of life of that period, and which by its agency

were spread over the surface of each coal-bed before becoming charged with

the mud now forming its superimposed shales. Frequently the ironstones

are immediately overlain by thin beds of coal ; and in the case of the New

Mine at Kidsgrove, this coal is largely intermixed with fragments of Gyra-

carrihus, Megalichihys, and other fish-remains                                                                                                                                                                                                            but this  is  the only instance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

in the field in which such fossils have been detected within the body of coal

itself                             and in this case the  coal which forms a parting between two bands of
                                ;

stone is not of the ordinary character of coal-deposits, but evidently the

aggregated parts of an older bed brought from another point, and redeposited
by aqueous agency.

In addition to the Ganoid fishes enumerated, Acanihodes, Acrolepis,

Gyrolepis, Pyyopterus, Dipkpterus, aai:Megalichihys are forms more or less

familiar to these beds, most being represented by two or more species,
winch appear here and there at intervals throughout the entire vertical strata.

Megalichihys Hibberti is by far the most common form ; but hitherto no

perfect specimen has been met with. The New Ironstone of Fenton Park,

the Gubbin ironstone shale of Shelton, and the Chalky Mine ironstone of
           NORTH STAFFORDSHIRE COAL-FIELD ORGANIC REMAINS.               47

--Silverdale, have yielded fine examples of this fish in the latter case a frag-

ment of a jaw 16 inches in length. With this fish are frequently associated

in the New and Knowles ironstones large jaws referred to Rhizodus, and

others as yet not satisfactorily determined.

The small cycloidal-scaled fish assigned to Rhizodopsis is also of common

occurrence, and with it are occasionallyfound large circular scales,with concen-

tric and radiating lines of ornamentation. Acanthodes is also of wide range,

heing more abundant in nodules of the Cockshead ironstone, and in the

Knowles and Deep Mine ironstone shales, which also contain Gyrolepis and

Pygopterus. Strepsodus, a long somewhat curved tooth with parallel lines,

also ranges from the Stinking Coal to the upper beds, but always in detached

forms. Amblypterus so far appears to be extremely rare in these fields.

The Placoid order of fishes is freely represented, and possesses an equally

determinate range with the ganoid forms of the field. Pleuracanthus, or the old

Diplodus gibbosus, occurs in thousands in the New Ironstone at Fenton Park,

making its first appearance in the shales of the Stinking Coal, and ranging

upwards to the Red Shag ironstone of the upper beds. The spine described

as Pleuracanthus, is frequently found associated with the teeth and dermal

covering of the fish, in a manner which confirms the now received opinion

of their common origin. Pleura canthus minutus is not so common, but it

has a wide and general range, and another species is not unfrequent in the

New Ironstone of Fenton Park, but it is rarely found to pass from this

horizon. Of the large dorsal spines, Ctenacanthus, the species hybodoides is

the most familiar, but it is seldom found out of the New Ironstone, Deep

Mine, Knowles and Brown Mine shales. Gyracanthus formosus is of far

wider distribution, being found in twelve different beds of the lower and

upper thick measures. G. tuberculatum is frequently associated with it, but

it is of less vertical range. Orthaeanthus cylindricus is also confined to the

upper part of the thick coal and the lower part of the ironstone groups, but,

like Ctenacanthus and Gyracanthus, the finest specimens are obtained from

the New Ironstone of Fenton Park. The fossil known as Onchus is remark-

ably persistent in its distribution, being plentiful in the Stinking and Wood-

head coal-shales, and in nearly the whole of the coal and ironstone beds of

Athe succeeding measures.  form resembling Leptacanthus, and others with

double or single rows of curious hooked teeth, are not unfrequently met

with, especially in the New Ironstone, which appears to have been the great

life-centre of the singular animals to whom those defensive weapons

belonged.

The remainder of the Placoid fish consist of the genera Cladodus, Peta-

lodus, Gtenodus, Orodus, Ctenoptychins, Archodus, Pcecilodus, Helodus, some

forms resembling Cochliodus, a small tooth with numerous branching cusps,

and others as yet undetermined. Gtenodus appears to be limited to the New,

Brown Mine, Knowles, and Black-band ironstones, and is of somewhat rare

occurrence. Petalodus is of similar range, and Cladodus extends to the

Woodhead coals, and is frequently found in groups on slabs of the Knowles

ironstone and Ash-coal shales. Orodus is confined to the Stinking Coal of the

lowest measures, and also another form of an exceedingly interesting character,

of which but two specimens have been detected. Ctenoptychius is represented

by three or four species, of which ap'ualis is the most common, the New

Ironstone containing remarkably fine examples. Archodus is a rare form,

and appears to be confined to the latter bed. To Helodus no limit can well

be given, it being met with in almost all the beds, and in the Knowles is

frequently of large size. The tooth resembling Cochliodus is rare, and has
--48 report 1865.

not been met with in other beds than the Stinking Coal, and in the stony

8-foot ironstone at Kidsgrove. Pcecilodus is a common form in the Cockshead

ironstone shales, and has a tolerably wide range from the Stinking Coal

upwards. The little tooth with numerous cusps is confined to the New and

Deep Mine ironstones, but is frequent in the former bed. In addition to
these, there is a fine lancet-shaped tooth rarely found in the Deep Mine,
Wood's Mine, New, Bassey Mine, and Gubbin ironstones, to which at present
no name has been assigned.

  --The Mollusca of these fields may be divided into three distinct groups

the Avieulopecten and Goniatite group of the lowest measures, the Spirifer-
and Distinct group of the middle, and the Anthracosia of the entire fields.
The Avieulopecten of the lowest measures is represented simply by the species
papyraceus, and is confined to two horizons, that of the Stinking Coal about
 100 feet above the Millstone-grit, and a lean grey ironstone about the same
distance above the Stinking Coal. In the latter bed it is associated with
 Goniatites, Posidonia, Orthoceras, and Lingula, each of which are invariably
found to occupy different and successive levels in the deposits to which they

 are confined.

    Immediately upon the coal, which is strongly sulphureous, comes a bed
of Aviculopectens, from 6 to 8 inches thick ; this is succeeded by a layer of
 Goniatites of similar thickness ; then Posidonia and Orthoceras ; the black
shales containing fish, and at the top of all comes Lingula mixed with
scales of Ptdceoniscus. The Avieulopecten, Goniatites, Posidonia, and Ortho-
ceras bands are generally dovetailed, as it were, into each other, but each
contains nevertheless its characteristic features. Lingula is, however, always
sharply cut off from them and confined to one definite line on the top of the
shales immediately below the bone-bed which separates these fossils from the
on-coming C'gtheropsis and Anthracosia. The Aviculopecten-bed is of great
areal extent, and retains a remarkable degree of uniformity in whatever
district it is found, and in more than one important case the existence of
certain valuable mineral deposits have been determined by its presence alone.
In the Goldsitch-moss basin, 10 miles direct north from Ipstones, it forms
one of the coals worked there under the name of the Thin Seam ; at Wetlcy
Moor it is represented by the Four-foot coal, at Biddulph by the Biddulph
Moor coal, and in each locality it contains its characteristic tranquilly
deposited fossils, in equal numbers and corresponding conditions.

    The other Aviculopecten-hed is a thin grey laminated ironstone about 100
feet above the Stinking Coal, and hitherto has not been detected beyond the
limits of the Churnet valley. Its fossils are in a fine state of preservation,
but so far it has not been found to contain other remains than Avieulopecten
papyraceus and Posidonia.

    The base of the lowest measures of the Churnet valley is a clayey marl,
which reposes directly upon the upper beds of the Millstone-grit, and varies
in thickness from a thin film to 15 feet. This is succeeded by the well-
known Hydrate, a most curious and remarkable deposit, varying from an
inch to 2 feet 6 inches. The shales in contact with this ore, and the stone

--itself in certain localities, contain great numbers of Anthracosia acuta a form

of life which take3 precedence of all others in the history of the period
represented by these rocks. Between this bed and the Stinking Coal the
only recognizable fossils are scanty remains of fishes ; but here, as before
stated, Anthracosia again comes in, and again gives place to the Avieulo-
pecten of the laminated ironstone. In the succeeding clay ironstone nodules

opened up at Hawley's sinkings, there are no known indications of the intro-

duction of other forms of life than those of which this genus is the type.

In the Woodhead coal-shales of the Cheadle field, and other basement beds

of the lower thick measures at Norton and Bucknall, Anthracomya and An-

thracoptera are found in association with Anthracosia, the latter being repre-

sented by the species subconstricta, robusta, ovalis, and others ; Anthracomya by

Adamsii, and Anthracoptera by two new species, and others. In the Bullhurst

coal and its succeeding shales these bivalves frequently occur in immense num-

bers, especially in the Cockshead ironstone, the Hard Mine, Little Mine, and

the various Banbury coals of the Silverdale and Kidsgrove districts, and in

the Bassey Mine, Gutter Mine, Cannel Mine, and Black-band ironstones of

the upper thick measures. It is however remarkable that, where they are

unusually abundant, fish-remains become scarce and fragmentary ; in fact

none of the deposits which retain their original condition afford conclusive

evidence of other than the occasional commingling of these vertebrate and

invertebrate animals in the waters of the period, and it is only in the aggre-

gated bone-beds that their remains are associated in anything like equal

proportions.

In many cases the bone-beds covering the surface of coal pass into thick

irregularly-deposited masses of shells, which by their persistency become

valuable guides in mining operations. Not unfrequently, however, they are

confined to a definite horizon, the shales above them being destitute of other

remains than those of plants matted together and imperfectly preserved. As

a rule the coal-beds are of greater extent and of a more uniform character

than ironstone deposits. In the upper measures both are usually but

slightly divided, and, generally speaking, where the ironstone thickens the

coal becomes inferior. The Longton ironstone-beds in many instances die

out altogether, or are but obscurely represented in the Silverdale and the

more easterly districts, and this is in fact the case with the coal in many

cases. The position of the shells varies according to the character of their

matrix                                 in some  instances  they appear in situ, smoothly laid out, and rising
                                    ;

layer upon layer to the thickness of several feet. In this form they are

generally compressed, but in many others, such as the Moss coals, Hard

Mine, and Cockshead ironstone-shales, they retain their original shape.

   Until within the last two or three years there was no published evidence
to show that the generally received opinion of the restriction of marine

fossils to the lower measures of the British coal-fields was incorrect; but
some sinkings at Longton in the spring of 1863 revealed the existence of

a series of such remains in the shales of a thin unworked coal called the
Bay Coal, situated towards the base of the upper thick measures. These

remains consisted of Aviadopecten, Goniatites, languid, Orthoceras, Spirifer,

Ctenodonta, Macrocheilus, Katicopsis, Nautilus, Loxonema, and Biscina. The

discovery of Lingula, which at the time was the only form met with, was

announced in the Report of your Committee read at the Meeting at New-

castle, and the occurrence of the additional forms was also noticed in their

Report read at Bath last year. It has, however, been subsequently found

that, about eight years ago, Discince were discovered in nodules of the Priors-

field ironstone at Fenton Park.

   From the Bay Coal not being a workable seam, its extension can only be

proved by sinkings in other parts of the field, where it will have to be looked

for under different names and position, no other section appearing to agree
with the one at Longton. The Priors-field ironstone, which lies below the
Bay Mine, also yielded at the same sinkings Lingulce and Discince, but,
--50 REPORT 1865.

except in one instance, of the association of the young of Discina with An-

thracoptera, none of the other forms were found in direct contact with them.
Discince have recently been met with at Kidsgrove in grey ironstone nodules,
which would appear to be representatives of the Longton Priors-field bed.

   The Bay Coal fossils appear to be confined to a thin stratum of shale,
containing grey flattish nodules of lean ironstone overlying the coal. The
Lingulce were never known to pass into the ironstone, but appeared to lie
near the top of the shales in association with Discince. Below these come
Orthoceras, Spirifer, and the others, and the nodules were generally taken
up with Aviculopecten, Spirifer, and Productus. Immediately above these
shales came another nodular bed of ironstone and thick shales, and these
were the depositories of several species of Anthracosia with Gytheropsis ; but
here, as in the Stinking Coal, the line of demarcation was in no case passed
by either of the forms above or below it. The Priors-field group appears to
be equally defined, Anthracoptera and Gytheropsis overlying the Linyuhe
and Discince. This isolation of Lingulce from all other than Discince is a
somewhat curious fact, but the cases cited are not the only ones which have
come under notice. It occurs in the shales of a coal worked on the western
flank of Axedge, and referred to the middle beds of the Millstone-grit.

    In June and July of the present year a bed of greyish shale, lying a few feet
above the Gin Mine coal, belonging to the upper part of the lower thick mea-
sures, was sunk through on the hill which divides Longton from Adderley Green.
These shales far surpass the Bay Mine in the number and variety of their
organic contents. They contain Productus, Chonetes, Lmgula, Aviculopecten,
Ctenodonta, A-vinus, Natteopsis, Ghemnitzia, Lo.vonema, Platyschism i, Pleu-
rotomaria, Discites, Goniatites, Nautilus, Orthoceras, and others, most of them
being represented by two or more species, some of which are new.

   More than one of these forms are common in the carboniferous rocks of

Scotland, and others are found abundantly in the Millstone-grits of Stafford-
shire. It is an interesting feature in these deposits that they contain Pro-
ductus, Spirifer, and Nautilus, which are absent in the lowest measures of
these fields. The occurrence of this bed is important as showing that the
two great divisions of the upper and lower thick measures are at widely
separated intervals, interlined by deposits which point to the sudden cessa-
tion of one order of natural operations, and the introduction of another,
which obtained for a comparatively short period and then passed away, to be
repeated Ion? after in two distinct but less important forms, but still equally
clear and equally conclusive. Whether there are other instances of these
isolated marine conditions in the middle measures, or whether they stretch
into the upper strata of the coal-field, a careful examination of beds passed
through in future sinkings will alone determine.

   On the extreme western outcrop of the coal strata at Longton a bed of
limestone, supposed to be of freshwater origin, overlies the Bassey Mine

ironstone at a distance of about 30 feet. Recent sinkings on the Longton
Hall estate have revealed a second band of limestone 30 feet below the
other, and like it divided into three beds by thin partings of clayey shale.
The upper bed has long been known, but in no other instance has the second
bed been met with, although there are several pits within the space of 300
yards. Far above this, however, a little below the base of the brick clays of
the upper measures, a third, if not a fourth bed of similar limestone has been
exposed at distant points, in each of which the fossil contents specifically
agree. The lower beds are the more fossiliferous, and include great numbers
of Gytheropsis, Microconchus, Anthracosia Phillipsii, with scales and teeth of
        MARINE FAUNA AND FLORA OF SOUTH DEVON AND CORNWALL. 51

Ccelacanthus, Platysomw, Ehizodopsis, MegaUchthys, and Pleuracanthns.
Anthmcosia PMUipsii is also remarkably abundant in the Bassey Mine and
the Gutter Mine ironstones, the latter being composed almost wholly of
compressed forms of this shell. The Black-band ironstone of Apedale is
also extremely rich in similar species, and contains, in addition, SanguinoUtes,
with thick masses of Cytheropds. Anthmcosia Phillipsii appear to be the
characteristic shell of these upper thick measures, occurring abundantly in
the Cannel Mine and other beds worked in different localities, until it dies
out in the valueless coal-seams which interline the arenaceous shales of the
upper beds of Hartshill and Newcastle-under-Lyne.

   It may be stated in conclusion that, in drawing up their Report, your
Committee have confined themselves as much as possible to the more strik-

ing particulars of the inquiry. The subject is in itself of too voluminous a
character for detailed treatment, and a great amount of interesting matter

has been necessarily omitted. Much of this, however, will be supplied by

carefully prepared lists of the whole of the fossils found in the various
measures of the field, which will be arranged in stratigraphical order for

future publication.

Report of the Committee appointed to explore the Marine Fauna and

 --Flora of the South Coast of Devon and Cornwall. No. 1. Consist-

   ing of J. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.R.S., Rev. Thomas Hincks, Jonathan

   Couch, F.L.S., Charles Stewart, J. Brooking Rowe, F.L.S., and

J. Ralfs, F.L.S. Reporter, C. Spence Bate, F.R.S. fyc.

In presenting the first Report of the results of the Committee formed for the

purpose of dredging the southern coast of Devon and Cornwall, we think it

undesirable to repeat the full list of animals as recorded in our Dredging

WeTables.  shall therefore mention only those species that are either new or

rare, or exhibit some especial interest from observation of some hitherto unre-

Wecorded peculiarity of habit or structure.  cannot communicate the residt

of our labours without expressing our appreciation of the service that we

received from Her Majesty's Gunnery Ship ' Cambridge.' Capt. Ewart, C.B.,
having kindly offered any assistance that we might require on the water, we

were not slow to avail ourselves of the ship's launch and crew for the purpose

of dredging, and were on those occasions accompanied by Dr. Forbes of the
' Cambridge,' a gentleman known to science for an excellent memoir on the

History and Topography of Vancouver's Island.

                                                                   Pisces.

   In reporting on the Eish, Mr. Couch says that although our success in
this quarter has not been very abundant, still however our labour has not
been without some considerable amount of success.

   Among the ordinary inhabitants of our coast we scarcely expected to have

found the Twait shad, so near the bottom, in rather deep water, as to be taken

in the trawl ; we were also enabled to obtain a knowledge of tbe ordinary
food of the Megrim or scaldfish, P. arnoghssus, of which the examples were

numerous : small specimens of Galathcce were in their stomach.

  We were also fortunate enough to obtain a specimen of the Eilefish,

Balistes capriscms, the second on record as having been taken in England,
and offering in some respects a different appearance from the figures given of

                                                                           e2

it by Willughby and Yarrell ; but tbe particulars of this difference, as well

as the way in which it was caught, it would be tedious to give now, and
Mr. Couch reserves them for his work on our native fishes that is now pub-
lishing. Also an account of another fish which we have obtained within a
few days (Aug. 18th), and now report for the first time as a visitor to our

coasts. This is the Short-finned Tunny, Thynnus hraehyterus of Cuvier; an

example of which we procured from Mevagissy, and a second from Polperro
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

Mr. Couch has made drawings of both these rare fish.

  We also obtained from the trawl a specimen of Myliobates aquilce, or Eagle

Ray.

                                                            MOLLTTSCA.

   Among the Mollusca of more or less interest the following are recorded :
   An exceedingly fine specimen of Octopus vulgaris, as well as of Loligo

media, Sepia elegans, and S. officinalis. Also the ova of a Sepia, containing
the rudimentary shell, apparently differing from those of S. officinalis, but of

what species we have not yet been enabled to determine.

   A beautiful specimen oildalia elegant, far more brightly rose-coloured than

the figure given by Messrs. Alder and Hancock, from which our specimen

also differed in the posterior extremity of the foot, terminating in three in-

stead of a single point.

  We might also mention a specimen of Avicula being taken about half an

inch longer than the greatest length ascribed to it by Prof. Edward Forbes.

                   Crustacea.

   The first species of crab to which we shall allude is that of Achceus

cranchii, spoken of by Bell as being rare ; two specimens only being re-
corded, one from Ealmouth, the other from the South of Ireland.

   Certainly this little crab is by no means uncommon off the coast of South

Devon, in depth from six to twenty fathoms. This circumstance enables us

to state that the second and third pairs of pereiopoda are not drawn of suffi-

cient length in proportion to the two posterior, in both Prof. Bell's and Dr.

Leach's figures of the species.

   Among the specimens that we dredged, we took two from six fathoms of
water near the Knapbury, that possibly may be a second species. Our atten-

tion was first drawn to the circumstance from observing a peculiarity in its
habits from that of the known species, which is that it covers itself with
weed as we know is done by those of the genus Pisa.

    In Pisa this is no accidental occurrence, since all the spines are sharp-

pointed and curved ; and my friend Mr. Whitford has informed me that he has

observed specimens in his aquarium which soon after having cast their
exuviae, pick up with the claws pieces of weed and place them on the spine.

    In Achceus cranchii the spines are straight, a circumstance that gives the
animal generally a hairy appearance. In the second form the spines are not
visible to unassisted observation, and the legs of the animal look smooth and
free from hairs, but a nearer and closer inspection shows that the spines are
all hooked as in Pisa. The form of the eye somewhat varies also; but
whether these are sufficient to ground a specific distinction of the two ani-

mals, we have not quite determined, particularly as we have observed among

the mass of straight hairs in A. cranchii a few hooked ones also.

   Of the interesting genus of soldier- crabs, Pagurus, we have taken six or

seven species, viz.

P. bernhardus.     P. hyndmanni.     P. laevis.
      prideauxii.                         ulidianus.
     cuanensie.          dillwynii.
MARINE FAUNA AND FLORA OF SOUTH DEVON AND CORNWALL. 53

   Of the last species we have some doubt, as Mr. Bell remarks, it is ex-
tremely like the young of P. bernliardus, and certainly until we can capture
a specimen bearing ova we are much inclined to believe that it is so.

  We are glad to be able to record P. dillwynii from the south coast

of Devon. It is now about fifteen years since the first and only specimen

was taken on the coast of South Wales. ~No other naturalist appears to have

fallen in with it, and we found it necessary to take an occasional look at the

original specimen to assure ourselves that we had not committed a mistake

in considering it to be distinct.

  A few weeks since, seeing a woman shrimping on the sandy beach at

Teignmouth, we requested to have a look into her net, and among the com-

mon shrimp we saw to our great pleasure numerous specimens of P. dillwynii

after purchasing her entire stock we hastened to the beach, and with the in-
coming tide took numerous specimens which we kept alive for a short time.

This, the prettiest of all the pretty genus, has the habit of burrowing in the

sand, and it is probably to this circumstance that it has not been met with

before ; but, curious enough, we have since taken it with the dredge in about

four fathoms of water in Bigberry Bay, and again one specimen in six fathoms

as near to Plymouth as the mouth of the river Yealme.

  An interesting point in the history of this genus we have been enabled to

make out relative to the development of the young. The end of April or

the beginning of May is the period when the young appear to be most abun-
dant. Early in June we were enabled to capture many specimens of the

young animal in various degrees of progressive development, a circumstance

that has enabled us to determine that the species Glaucothoe peronii, described

by Prof. Milne-Edwards in the Annales des Sc. Nat. for March 1830, is none

other than an immature stage of the genus. At this period the little crea-

ture swims freely in the ocean, until obliged by increasing age to take refuge
in a shell, when he settles down and becomes a hermit crab.

   Of the genus Palinurus we would desire to point out a curious and in-

teresting structural condition of the inferior antennas. In all macrourous

decapods the inferior pair of antennas is furnished with a lateral scale, or ar-

ticulated process. This is invariably situated at the extremity of the third

joint of the peduncle ; now in Palinurus this scale or squamiferous process

is incorporated with the walls of the peduncle, the third and fourth joints

being fixed together, and the squamiferous process exists in form only as a

figure impressed against the sides of the antennae.

   In the elaborate memoir of Prof. Kinahan on the genus Crangon, we think
that he has erroneously figured the common shrimp, or that the common

shrimp of the Irish, differs from those of the English, shores. The small and
delicate second pair of pereiopoda that Mr. Bell describes as being " nearly as

large as the third," and figures rather shorter than the first, Dr. Kinahan

makes as long again as the first pair. Prof. Kinahan's figure is also more

slender than that of our edible shrimp ; neither can we see the desirability or

convenience of the generic separation which he has made between those hav-

ing the second pair of pereiopoda short from those that have them a little

longer. This being only variation in degree, and not structurally important,

we consider as being only of specific and not generic value.
   Among the prawns we are enabled to add a new genus to the British

fauna, namely, Caradina of Prof. Milne-Edwards. In making this interest-
ing addition, we must remark that it is one of name only, since it is, we be-

lieve, the same that Dr. Leach described under the name of HippoTyte va-

Werious, which has remained so long misinterpreted.  have occasionally
--54 report 1865.

taken this species when dredging in Plymouth Sound, but never so abun-

dantly as of late.

  We have previously observed the peculiar robust looking second pair of

pereiopoda, but it was not until recently we discovered that it had the pecu-

liar structural formation pecidiar to the genus Caradina, in which the pro-

podos articulates with the carpus, not at the centre, but at the infero-anterior

angle, and thus appears as a partially dislocated joint.

   There is a second specimen that appears to me to be specifically distinct

from the preceding ; it is more slender, and has the rostrum long and slight.
The teeth are two above, the one at the base flanked by a lateral tooth on
each side, and one near the apical extremity ; on the under side there is a
tooth immediately under the anterior upper tooth, and a second posterior to
it : to this species we provisionally give the name of Caradina tenuis.

   Among the sessile-eyed Crustacea we have added to our local fauna Mono-
culodes stimpsoni and Amphithoe albomaeulata ; of the latter we took but a

single specimen, and remarked the similitude of its colouring to that of half-

grown specimens of Amplntho'e ridjieaudata.
   Considerable numbers of Tanaia have been captured deeply inserted in the

crevices of the slate rocks of the coast, a habitat that is also favourable for

the residence of Anceus, a genus whose sexes have long been placed in sepa-

rate genera. These we have been enabled to work out with great care, a
circumstance that enables us to support some of the views of M. Hesse, and

unite the two supposed genera as the male and female of one.

  We have only to add the peculiar circumstance of our having captured

Chondrocantha zeia attached parasitically to a specimen of Synopta.

                           Annelida.

   Among the Annelida, Mr. J. Brooking Howe remarks that the following

                                 Alctonidiad^;.

   Among the Alcyonidiadas we have taken two species, in addition to
gelatinosum, to which we do not find any reference in the first edition of

Dr. Johnston's 'Natural History of British Zoophytes.' One of these resembles
so much the coral Eschara cornu-cervi, that but for its soft texture and
flexibility it migbt be compared to it. The other resembles a short club,
almost an oval mallet, on the top of a slender footstalk. Figures of these

have been taken.

                                 EcHINODEKMATA.

Amongst the Echinodermata may be mentioned Echinus flemingii, Spatan-

guspurpureus, Porania pulvillus (Goniaster templetoni of Forbes), and Pal-

mipes placenta : these specimens are often brought in by the trawlers, but some-
times a maund containing little else than the Pahnipes is procured at one

time, the others being rather rare. Amongst these and their more common

associates we have on three occasions found a specimen of Luidia savignii

about eight inches in the greater diameter, and twice a single ray of what we

believe to be Luidia sarsii. It is seven inches long, more abruptly tapering

than in the other species ; its upper surface orange, with purplish-brown

spots at the base of the spines of the paxilla? ; in all other respects it answers

the description given of the species by the Rev. A. M. Norman in his paper

on the genera and species of British Echinodermata published in the ' Annals

of Natural History.' This is, we believe, the first notice of a western locality

for this interesting animal, which must have been fifteen inches in its greater

diameter. On the inner side of the eastern end of the Breakwater, where

grey  mud  has  collected,  six  specimens of                                 Amphiura                                                                                                                 filiform  is,  remarkable for

its pickaxe -shaped spines, occurred in one haul of the dredge. This species

also has not been noticed here before, the Durham and Northumberland coasts

being the only English localities yet given. Antedon rosaceus is common in

the Sound, where it is found principally on the rocks that project from the

mud   and  rubble of the    bottom                                   of late  years  they                                                                                                              have      greatly extended
                                                                  ;

their colonies, owing probably to the injured specimens having been thrown

overboard wliilst the boat was moving to a different spot.

Ophiothrix fragilis (Ophiocoma rosula, Forbes) is common everywhere, its

Wecolours being most varied.     only mention it here to point out an important

modification of the spines nearest the cirrhi, they being converted into books

of two or three points, which must greatly assist them in maintaining their

hold of the rocks on which they live ; and more especially must these be use-
ful in the young star-fish_, whose life is for some time spent on sponges, from

which it is, indeed, often difficult to remove them without injury. Ophio-

coma nigra often occurs mixed with the last species, but is never so

numerous. Specimens of Holothuria nigra are sometimes dredged, and

Ocnus brunneus is not uncommon in the Sound. We have also obtainedIPen-

tacta hyndmanni deeply wedged into the holes made by Sa.vicava in the rocks

outside the Breakwater. Sipunculus bernhardus, Thalassema neptuni, and one

example of Syrinx modus have also been found here. From Polperro we have

received a specimen of Synapta, but was unable to determine its species as

the preservative fluid had destroyed its anchors and plates. Some years since

one was also obtained in the Sound, but was not, I believe, preserved.

Before concluding this Report it may be interesting to briefly describe a

curious, and probably unique abnormal growth found on the oral surface of

an Echinus sphcera. On opening the shell the inner surface of this part

appeared as if sand or some foreign substance had got under the perisoma,

but on closer examination this was found to be owing to a growth from the
--56 report 1865.

shell, principally occurring at the lines of junction of its separate plates.

It was in the form of short columns and fungoid masses, on the tops of which
the perisoma rested : this outgrowth presented, on microscopical examination,
a calcareous network, finer and more loose than the other portions of the
shell. The Echinus was not altered in form externally, but it seems pro-
bable that such a growth, by uniting the plates composing the shell and so
preventing the increase at that part, should ultimately cause some distortion.

Interim Report of the Committee on the Resistance of Water to Floating

   and Immersed Bodies. By W. J. Macquorn Rankine,C..E., LL.D.,

   F.R.S., John Scott Russell, C.E., F.R.S., James R. Napier,

   Marine Engineer, and William Froude, C.E.

   1. The following Interim Report describes the experiments made by the
Committee up to the day before the commencement of the present Meeting.

Those experiments are still in active progress.
   2. The Committee held several meetings in the course of the past winter

and spring, and agreed to a programme of experiments of which the follow-

ing is a summary.

  A3. Two models to be made of painted wood, designated respectively as

and B.
   The models to be ship-shape, and each of them to consist of two equal

and similar halves joined together at the middle water-line.

AModel to be in two parts joined at the circular midship section, so that

Toy turning the after-body through a right angle about a longitudinal axis
the water-lines can be converted into buttock-lines, and vice versd.

   4. Experiments to be made according to the method formerly put in prac-

tice by Mr. Scott Russell, in which the uniformity of the propelling force is
maintained by means of a regulating weight hanging from a pulley under
which the hauling cord passes ; the model to be guided in a straight course

by means of a stretched wire.
   5. Those experiments to be made principally at speeds not exceeding the

natural speed of the wave corresponding to the length of the model, viz., about
two knots per hour ; but a few experiments may be made at higher speeds.

   6. The experiments to be made on each model under two circumstances,
viz. with the model immersed as nearly as may be to the middle water-line,

and with the model totally immersed.
   7. The programme of experiments having been thus drawn up by the Com-

mittee, the superintendence of its execution was undertaken by Mr. Scott Rus-
sell, as being the only Member of the Committee resident in or near London.

has not been sent to Birmingham.

   9. The actual performance of the experiments was entrusted by Mr. Russell
to Mr. J. Quant, Naval Architect, who has performed that duty with great

skill and assiduity.

10. Twenty-eight experiments have already been made on model A, upon

a run of about 98 feet in length on a lake in Blackheath Park, the use of

which for that purpose has been liberally granted by Dr. Joseph Kidd.

AFurther experiments on model are in active progress ; and when they are

finished those upon model B will be begun.

11. The Committee deem it advisable to defer giving a detailed account of

those experiments until the whole series shall have been completed, because

the separate publication of the portion of that series which has hitherto been

made would be but imperfectly useful, and also because, having only yesterday

(11th Sept. 1865) received the account of those experiments, they have not

had time to give them due consideration.

12. The following general results, however, may be stated :

AI. The resistance of model when immersed so as to be just covered with

water, and no more, is more than double of its resistance when half immersed

at the same speed.

  AII. When the after-body of model is turned so as to convert the water-

lines into buttock-lines, its resistance is increased, and that whether the

model is half immersed or just covered.

Report on Observations of Luminous Me teors, 1861-65. By a Committee,

   consisting of James Glaisher, F.R.S., of the Royal Observatory,

Greenwich, Secretary to the British Meteorological Society, fyc.

Robert P. Greg, F.G.S., §·<;.; E. W. Brayley, F.R.S., Professor

of Physical Geography and Meteorology in the London Institution,
fyc. ; and Alexander S. Herschel, B.A.

The Chairman, in presenting the Eeport, said, The class of phenomena

--known as Luminous Meteors includes the familiar appearances of shooting-

stars and fireballs in the words of M. Quetelet, (i a much despised phe-
nomenon, long neglected by astronomers," but which now justly claims their

attention, and, as shown by the papers contained in this Report, commands

the consideration of those best able to speculate upon cosmical phenomena.
   The number of meteors observed during the past year has been unusually

small, partly owing to the cloiidy state of the sky, partly owing to the absence

this year of certain acknowledged star-showers, namely, those of January,

April, and August. The November shower, although concealed in England
by clouds, did not disappoint expectation. It attracted attention, and was

observed with considerable interest at Malta, as described in the Report. If

the sky is clear, the circumstances are altogether favourable for its reappear-

ance in the present year and the next, in the morning of the 13th of No-
vember. Its greatest display is expected to visit us in 1866 ; but even in the
present year it is advisable to be prepared for its appearance by organizing a
competent staff of observers, and furnishing them with the proper means for

determining the radiant-point, and the heights and velocities of the meteors.

The British Association in the past year having sanctioned a set of Maps to
be printed for the use of the Committee, which are now completed and are

presented with this Eeport, every means will he provided to Members of the

Association willing to take part in the observations of this shower, to enable

them to record their observations with facility, and to reduce as far as pos-

sible the inevitable uncertainty of cloudy nights, which attaches to our in-

sular climate in November.

  A shower of remarkable meteors observed on the 18th of October last

(of which a map, showing the radiant-point, was exhibited), coincided with a

date at which fireballs have made their appearance in more than average

numbers. The radiant-point of this shower was perfectly denned in Orion, and

Aillustrates well the manner in which these maps may be employed.  star-

shower less conspicuous, on the 28th of July last, was observed with a radiant-

point equally distinct, close to Fomalhaut, the most southerly star observed

on our meridian. These and other accurate observations of star-showers are

included in the Eeport. Continued observation will doubtless reveal other

radiant-points, and at the same time will lead to determining more exactly

the position and character of those already known.

   Of large meteors, the greater number described in the Catalogue took place

in December last. Two detonating meteors were also observed. The first

occurred in England on the 20th of November last, the second in Scotland on

the 21st of February. Observations show that on the first of these nights

shooting-stars were extremely scarce, so that at Weston-super-Mare and

Hawkhurst only one or two meteors could be counted in an hour. This fact,

of which the description is contained in the Catalogue, illustrates in a re-

markable manner the adventitious character of large meteors. Nevertheless

the 20th of November is one among the well-known dates preferred by fire-

Aballs.  third detonating meteor, on the 30th of April, was doubly observed

at Manchester and Weston-super-Mare, and its height was well determined.

The nearest approach of this meteor to the earth was thirty-seven miles.

Startling as are the accounts of detonations heard from such a height, it is

yet more surprising that the report from such a distance should be brief and

momentary. The sounds caused by meteors yet offer much which, it is

hoped, will be explained and illustrated by further observations.

Interesting papers appear in the Eeport, " On the Origin of Meteorites,

the series of Physical Processes of which they are the result, and their

functions in Nature," by Professor Brayley ; and " On the Physical History

of Meteorites," by Mr. Sorby. It appears from a microscopic analysis of

their structure by Mr. Sorby, that when aerolites resemble in their appear-

ance igneous terrestrial rocks, the evidence of their previous history has been

more or less obliterated, while characteristic peculiarities in their structure

evince that they could not have originated in the volcanic action of the

moon or any planet. Mr. Brayley infers that they originate in gaseous

matter projected from the equator of the sun, and condensed to the solid

Aform in its passage through interplanetary space.  gradual condensation

from a vaporous state is said by Mr. Sorby also to represent more nearly

than any other the conditions under which they must have been consolidated.

In this view of the origin of meteorites (including in the term Meteoric

Irons), their source is considered to be unique, and they are traced to the

energetic forces whose modes of action are considered in Solar Physics. The

bodies thus arising are termed by Mr. Brayley Meteoritic Masses, to di-

stinguish them emphatically from all other members of the solar system, as

well as from fallen meteorites.

In another paper contained in this Eeport, which is an abstract of a

' Memoir on Sporadic Shooting- stars,' Mr. Newton, basing his conclusions

upon a certain knowledge of their height, arrives at some interesting results
             --

A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.             59

regarding the number and distribution of tbese bodies in space. The average

height of the centres of their visible tracks is sixty miles above the earth.

Their number in the atmosphere daily is seven and a half millions, and, if
not intercepted in their flight, there would be found in the space occupied by
the earth at any instant in its orbit, 13,000 of such bodies pursuing different
orbits. Of shooting-stars visible in telescopes, Mr. Newton calculates that
the number is at least fifty times as great as the number of those visible to
the naked eye. Indeed there appears to be no limit to their minuteness or

to their numbers. Tbeir velocity is greater than the velocity of the earth in

its orbit, ard Mr. Newton supposes that they are grouped together according
to some law, probacy that of rings encompassing the sun, resembling in their

inclinations and dimensions the orbits of the comets. Mr. Newton, in con-

clusion, supposes that these bodies, which he terms Meteoroids, are not frag-

ments of a former world, but rather materials from which new worlds are

forming ; the latter view is taken by Mr. Brayley.
   Meteoroids and meteoritic masses constitute the two classes of bodies

which have to be considered in Meteoric Astronomy. It is, however,

reasonable to suppose that the same forces which in the phase of greatest
concentration of the solar system give rise to " meteoritic masses," might in

a phase of vastly greater antiquity, and of greater extension of the solar orb,
have given rise in a similar manner to the rings of " meteoroids." Continued
observations directed to the phenomena of shooting-stars will end by remov-

--ing doubt from this province of astronomy, and throw new light on certain

difficult questions in cosmical philosophy such, for example, as the existence
of organic matter (a kind of peat or humus) in the meteorites of Orgueil.

   At the request of the Committee, the following Report for the past year has
been drawn up by Alexander S. Herschel :

   The Committee have the satisfaction to present in this Report several

descriptions of large meteors ; of which the details are given in the Cata-
logue, and have led in some instances to determining their real heights and
velocities. In investigating the path of the detonating meteor of the 30th

of April last (Monthly Notices, R.A.S., 1805, June 9), although resting on

two observations only, a high degree of accuracy was attainable. The Com-
mittee take this opportunity of congratulating Members and other, observers
on the increasing precision of their observations, by which this satisfactory

result could be obtained (Appendix I. 6).

  A few observations of old date, not previously recorded, are entered in the

Catalogue, together with extracts from authentic foreign sources. Obser-

vations of several star-showers are included, of which the results are col-

lected in Appendix II. Recent additions of meteorites to museums, and

remarkable meteors, are desciibed in the third and fourth appendices of the

ACatalogue.  number of contributions to literature in meteoric astronomy

are either noticed or given in full in Appendix V.

Sky-maps prepared especially for observations of shooting-stars, and par-

ticularly of their radiant-points, have been placed for constant use in the

hands of observers. Dr. Heis, of Miiuster, warmly seconding the appeal of

the Committee, has lithographed copies of these charts, by which the meteors

observed in the same latitude* at Miinster are conveniently compared with

those observed at Greenwich. To his courteous zeal and devoted labours, the

Committee are indebted for the heights of shooting-stars observed at Miinster

in July and August 1864 and 1865, contained in Appendix YI.

   * The latitude of Greenwich Observatory is 51° 28' 38" : that of Miinster Observatory

--is 51° 58' 10". The difference is therefore 29' 32", or not quite half a degree about the

average error unavoidably committed in copying, and producing a requisite quantity of

lithographic impressions of the maps.

                            (1.) Fireball; 1864, August 31st, 10 h 31 ra p.m.

          At Exeter, the meteor disappeared at an altitude of 18° in the E.N.E.,
       whilst at Frant in Sussex it appeared to move at an altitude of about 50° in
       the W., disappearing S.W. From Exeter to Frant, the direct distance is
       1G7 British statute miles, and the distance of the meteor from the earth at
       disappearance was from forty-five to fifty miles above Chichester, on the
       coast of Sussex. The character of the data does not permit the investigation

       to be carried further.

                       (2.) Fireball; 1864, November 11th, 5h 35m p.m.

           The meteor was vertical over the west of Auvergne, where it was seen in
       twilight, and over the valleys of the Lot, Dordogne, and Garonne, in the
       south of France. It was observed at Hawkhurst, Tunbridge, and West
       Pcckham, near Maidstone, in Kent. The height at disappearance, derived
       from the English, compared with the French observations, is forty -five miles,
       between Limoges and Rhodez. The flight, of more than eighty miles, was
       accompanied by a brilliant streak, which remained visible several minutes in
       the twilight. This was nearly horizontal, directed from between N.E. and N.

                   Uppingham, in

the distance. The descriptions at Manchester, Mobberly, Weston-super-Mare
S&c, leave no doubt that the meteor was directed from N.E. The detonating

19th of November 1861, was directed from a little E. of S., or very nearly
trom an opposite direction. In other respects the two meteors resemble one
another veiy closely (v. Report, 1862, p. 79).

         The meteor observed at Manchester disappeared N.E. At Hawkhurst the
point ot disappearance was 8° above the horizon, N.N.W. The situation of
this point is therefore fixed. The flight was directed from the usual radiant
ot the 6th to
the rest of        the  13th of December, between Gemini and Auriga,                                                                     and thus

   Over Perthshire, in the neighbourhood of Perth and Stirling. In Fife-
shire, a concussion like prolonged thunder was heard in the N. The light
reflected from the snow had a very imposing effect. The track of the meteor
was from between N. and N.E., with no great inclination towards the earth.

    Path seventy-five miles in two and a half, to five seconds, directed from

azimuth 161° W. from S., altitude 12°, near the star CapeMa. Velocity

twenty miles per second. Began fifty-two miles above Lichfield (N. lat. 52° 43',
"W. long. 1° 52'). Disappeared thirty-seven miles above Oxford (N. lat.

51° 44', W. long. 1° 16'). The disappearance took place with a flash, at a

distance of eighty-six miles from "Weston-super-Mare, where eight or ten
minutes afterwards a rumbling report was heard, which lasted a few seconds.
Sound, with its ordinary velocity of 1090 feet per second, would take seven
minutes to travel the same distance. This meteor belongs to the few whose
real tracks are found to lie from the "W. to the E. side of the meridian.

II. Meteoric Showers and their Radiants.

(1.) (R. A. S. Monthly Notices, 1864, Dec. 9.)

AThe radiants T and G,, (of the list contained in the last Report) were

conspicuous on the night of the 27th of September 1864. The first, evidently

an early appearance of F (No. 49 in the same list), remained in force until

the 6th of October, producing swift white meteors, almost entirely dissolving

Ainto streaks.  third radiant, (No. 48 of the same list), was for the first

time observed during the occurrence of a considerable shower of ruddy

meteors, on the night of the 18th of October 1864. The meteors of this

shower are swift and leave voluminous streaks.

                                   (2.) November Star-shower.

   The sky was generally cloudy in England on the morning of the 13th of
November 1864. The following extract from a letter addressed to the
Secretary, Mr. Herschel, proves that the shower was observed at Malta on
the morning of the 13th of November, ami that no trace of it remained on
the morning of the 14th :

   S. S. Ellora, off Malta, 1864, November 14. " There was a grand display
of meteors from midnight to 4h a.m., all through the watch, the night before
last. The watch, an old ' salt,' and an intelligent man, said that it was the
grandest shower he had ever seen, and that the whole watch had been look-
ing at them with delight. There were no very striking ones, and none burst.
Last night [Sunday night] I watched till ll h 30m myself, and told the watch

to wake me up if any were seen, and at all events at 5 o'clock. He did so,

but reported that not one single one had been visible. The sky was clear
enough, but bright moonlight. I looked out a little while, but not a single

shot. The watch told me in the morning that there had not been a single

one visible till daylight."

                   (3.) (R. A. S. Monthly Notices, 1865, March 10.)
   Two fireballs, on the 9th and 13th of December 1864, were shown to be
conformable to G, the general radiant of smaller meteors, which reaches its

maximum about this period. The radiant coincided, as in the previous year,

with a point between r and fl Geminorum,

                (4.) Star-showers of April, July, and August.

The numbers of meteors recorded on the nights of the lst-2nd of January,

19th-20th of April, and lOth-llth of August, in the year 1865, were not
greater than ordinary. The return of these well-known star-showers was

either altogether wanting, especially in January, or very inconsiderable, as in

April and August. On the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th of August, a few

meteors were observed. Several large meteors appeared on the night of the

25th of April 1865. The same was also noticed by Sir John Herschel on the

25th  of April  1843  (Proceedings,  Brit.  Met.  Soc.  Jan.  1865                    p.  314).
                                                                                   ;

During a considerable shower of meteors on the 28th of July 1865, a

radiant of novel and interesting character was observed at Hawkhurst. The

new radiant was situated- close to Fomalhaut, and belongs properly to the

southern hemisphere. The letter H, omitted by Dr. Heis from his nomen-

clature of radiant-points, is chosen to designate the shower.

   Epoch of the shower; 1865, July 28-9. Position; R. A. 338°, S. Decl. 28°.
   The following extract from Sir James C. Ross's ' Voyage to the Southern

Seas ' (vol. i. p. 98), may be noticed in connexion with this shower.
   " H. M. S. Erebus, S. lat. 47°, E. long. 97°, 1840, July 28th to 29th. The

gale continued all night with a heavy cross sea ; there was much lightning

to the eastward ; meteors in great numbers were seen darting about in all
directions, and the whole aspect of the sky proclaimed a convulsion or dis-

turbance of the atmosphere of an unusual character."

   The position of Fomalhaut above the horizon, at the time and place of this

observation, on board the ' Erebus' was 17° from the zenith. Only one such

vmeteor was observed at Hawkhurst on the night of the 29th.

(5.) General Radiant-points of shooting-stars (Proceedings, Brit. Met.

                      Soc. 1865, Jan., vol. ii. p. 302).

A list of fifty-six General Radiant-points of shooting-stars, which appeared

in the last Report, was founded upon a series of charts prepared by Mr. Greg.

The accompanying reduced engravings of meteor tracks contained in three of

shooting-stars occurring in January, February, and March. (Pp. 124, 125.)

A GThe radiant     l  (fig. 1.), near Aldebaran (No. 3 in the list), embraces the

Aperiod from Dec. 21 to Eeb. 4.      remarkable display of it was first noticed

by Mr. Herschel, and by other observers, on the night of the 24th of December

1861. (Report 1862, pp. 40, 80.)

  M (fig. 2) represents a radiant between Leo Minor and the head of Leo
               3

(No. 7 in the list), enduring from February 4th to 26th, and having a tendency

to a maximum on the 13-1 5th of the month. It was first noticed by Mr. Greg,

Mr. Herschel, and Mr. Wood, in February 1863.

In other showers no tendency to a maximum can be perceived. The
Mradiants M.,
                6  are of this kind (Nos. 14, 15 in the list), and form a double

or twin radiant (fig. 3), advancing, with the time, across the principal stars of

Ursa Major, from March 3rd to 31st. The same radiant afterwards advances

as far as the last star in the Tail of Ursa Major, presenting an interesting and

well-established instance of the same meteoric shower enduring (from March

3rd to June 2nd) a period of thirteen weeks, and having a radiant advancing

throughout the interval in a right line.

       (1.) 1864, September 24th, 12" 20m (noon). Tarbes (S. France).

   The occurrence is described in the ' Comptes Rendus' (for 1864, October 3rd
and 10th). The meteor presented the appearance of a ball of fire moving with
the rapidity of a flash of lightning, and leaving a cloud of smoke for several
minutes. It was seen in broad day as far south as the Balearic Islands, and
as far north as Nerac, and Couzon in Creuse. The point of disappearance was
nearly over Tarbes, and the flight assigned by M. Le Verrier is forty miles
high above the Department of Gers. The following extract of a letter from

a resident at Pau to a relative in England, describes the character of the

meteor :

M--" Pau, 1864, October 6th. On Saturday, 24th September, the day before
I arrived here,  heard in the house, like many others, a loud report

(louder than any cannon). The report was so loud says another, sitting in

the English Club, that he thought the windows were smashed in. Another

eyewitness here at Pau says he observed a flash of light in a dark cloud, fol-

lowed immediately afterwards by a tremendous detonation. The enclosed

extract from the newspaper will give you the description of it as experienced
at Lembeye, twenty miles distant from this (see Catalogue). The detonation

was also heard startlingly loud at Orthez, twenty-four miles from this ; also

at Monein, twelve miles from this, and at Mont-de-Marsan. These places

are relatively situated thus (see fig.). At Monein they thought the houses

were coming down about their ears. I cannot discover that any meteorite

fell."

           (2.) 1864, August 10th, 6h p.m. Island of Milos (Cyclades).

  A detonating meteor appeared over Milos and the Cyclades thirteen minutes

before sunset, in full sunlight, leaving a cloud of smoke for more than a
quarter of an hour. The meteor was seen at Athens, and the streak was
visible sixteen minutes. The heights at appearance and disappearance are
estimated by Dr. Julius Schmidt at twenty-five and twenty-three English
miles respectively, over iEgina and Paros. The direction was from Leo, and
the velocity about thirty miles per second. Stones are reported to have
fallen upon the island of Polinos, but their meteoric character is not con-
firmed. The detonation was heard at Milos, where the train of smoke was
visible more than a quarter of an hour.

        (3.) 1865, February 9th, 6h 50m p.m. Salem, Carnatic (S. India).

The following extract of a letter from an English gentleman residing at

Bangalore, situated on the high road from Bombay to Madras, was received

by Mr. Herschel from a relative in England, to whom the letter was

addressed.

We" Bangalore, 1865, February 10th.     have had a splendid meteor. I
H--was walking with
                         , and at first I thought it was a blue light. It came

perpendicularly down ; at first it was bright blue, then purple, and at last

deep red. It lit up all the country with just the same glare that a blue light

makes. Everything could be seen most distinctly. At Salem*, I read in a
newspaper it was accompanied by a noise equal to 100 cannons. You could

see the trace of it for nearly five minutes after. The moon was up, and

            * Salem, in the Carnatic, is eighty miles S.S.E. from Bangalore.

         IV. Meteorites, Siderites, Siderolites. (See also V. (5) to (8.))

           (1.) 1863, December 10th, 3L a.m. Trebizond (Asia Minor).

   Three days after the meteoric fall of Tourinnes-la-Grosse, and five days
after the largest meteor described in the Catalogue of the last Report, a de-
tonating meteor of very unusual character passed over Samoronitza, near
Trebizond. The meteor desoended with a report equal to a hundred cannons,
into a wood near Inly (twelve miles from Samaronitza), which it set on fire.

A thick fall of snow following, a few fragments, only, of doubtful meteoric

character, could be recovered on the 6th of March 1864. The real substance
of the meteorite appears to have eluded search, from its pulverulent or
otherwise easily destructible nature*. Large meteors on the 3rd, 9th, and
13th of December are described in the present Catalogue. They indicate a
return of this aerolitic period, rendered famous by the earlier falls of Benares,
Wold Cottage, and "Weston, and by the recent fall of Montrejeau, near Tou-
louse, on the 9th of December 1858.

   Incendiary meteors have twice been recorded to have taken place upon

--the 13th of November. The first instance is described in the ' Astronomische

Nachrichten ' (vol. viii. p. 107), a meteor which fell near Prague on the
13th of November 1829, and burned the surface of a field brick-red. The

second meteor set fire to a bam at Ain, in France, on the 13th of November

1835. The " phosphorescent lines of light " observed in great numbers in
the great November shower of 1833, are perhaps meteors of the same

description.

   Among the municipal records of the town of Ludlow, in Shropshire, there

is preserved, in vellum, a roll of bailiffs from the time of Queen Elizabeth.
Under the date 1594, occurs the following passage :

  A" greate barne in Lempster [Leominster, Hereford] fired by a comett, and

burned 15 dayes."
    The occurrence must have created considerable sensation at the time, or it

would not have been recorded in such a document ; and the writer of the
record certainly lived at the time, and in the neighbourhood.

             (2.) Siderites.

Two large blocks of iron at Western-port, near Melbourne (Victoria),

weighing 5 to 6 and 1| tons respectively, have been examined in situ by

Dr. Neumayer, who supposes them to be of meteoric origin. The larger is

Anow in the British Museum.  third, weighing \\ ton, has been transported

to Melbourne from the Dandenog hills, sixty miles east of Melbourne, and

some miles to the north of Western-port (Vienna Acad. Sitzungsber., 1861,

April 18, and June 6).

  A portion of metallic iron labelled " native iron " in the Museum at

Ziirich, has been recognized by Dr. Haidinger as a fragment of the meteoric

iron of Steinbach, in Saxony (Vienna Acad. Sitzungsber., 1864, April 28).

          (3.) Siderolites. (Vienna Acad. Sitzungsber., 1864, May 12.)

meteorite of Hainholtz, has been discovered near the Sierra de Chaco (Chili),

in the neighbourhood of the celebrated locality of meteoric iron of Atacama

(Comptes Bendus, 1864, Mar. 28).

  A new specimen of meteoric iron, weighing 20 cwt., is described at

Toconado, 120 miles north of the former locality of Atacama, where the iron

Ais exhausted.  breccia-like fragment of similar iron and stone, found at

Copiapo, 300 miles south of Atacama, has been examined by Dr. Haidinger.

The included minerals contain a larger proportion of nickel than the iron by

which they are surrounded.

                                                              (4.) Aerolites.

   M. Wohler, who in 1860 analyzed the aerolites of Cold-Bokkeveldt, and
Kaba (Vienna Acad. Sitzungsber., 1860, July 5), reports the analysis by M.

Clbez, of the meteorites of Orgueil. Besides the usual inorganic constituents,
they contain 6 per cent, of a black amorphous organic substance, composed
of the organic elements, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, in proportions quite
similar to those in which they occur in lignite and peat ; in other words, a

--veritable humus. M. Wohler infers from all the facts that wherever meteo-

rites originate, organic matter, and hence probably, also, organized matter
must have an existence.

   The meteorites in this Catalogue are described under a new system of ar-

rangement, based upon those of Shepard and Bose, and altered so as to
bring similar meteorites together by their resemblance to different terrestrial
minerals. Great uncertainties still exist in the classifications adopted by
Shepard, Bose, and Beichenbach, over which this natural system of arrange-

ment in many instances possesses an advantage.

Y. Papers bearing on Meteoric Astronomy.

                (1.) Cold days in February and May.

Brandes, at the beginning of the present century, first pointed out the

existence of a hesitation in the curve of temperature of the air about the

12th of February. Madler, in 1834, drew attention to a similar depression

of temperature about the 12th of May. Erman, in the year 1840, ascribed

these cold days of the year to the obscuration of the sun by the passage of

meteorites across its disk. At the opposite extremities of their orbits, one

ring of these meteorites furnishes us with the meteors of August, another

passes us in November. At these latter periods, M. Petit has shown that

the temperature of the air undergoes a small but appreciable elevation. In

support of Erman's theory, M. Ch. S. C. Deville cites the mean temperature

at Paris of the cold and warm days in question for fifty-seven years from

1806 to 1863 (Comptes Bendus, 1865, Mar. 27). M. Faye remarks upon this

mode of accounting for the anomalies in the temperature of the air, that the

Atheory must be received with caution.  slight glance at Mr. Glaisher's

Table, showing the adopted mean temperature of every day in the year, as

determined from aU the therm ometrical observations taken at the Boyal Ob-

servatory, Greenwich, in fifty years, from 1814 to 1863, is sufficient to show

that a great break in the continuity of the temperature-curve, perhaps the

most remarkable of any in the year, takes place at the end of November,
--130 KEPORT 1865.

causing a maximum of temperature on the 3rd of December, which cannot

be explained by any regular appearance of meteors at that date.
   M. Le Verrier communicates to the Academy of Paris the observation, at

Constantinople, of a black body seen to cross the disk of the sun in forty-six

minutes, between 9 h and 10h a.m. (local time), on the 8th of May 1865. The

observation adds interest to the former paper on the remarkable variations of

temperature in the months of spring (Comptes Eendus, 1865, May 29).

(2.) Heights, and Numbers of Meteors (Am. Journ. Sci. vol. xxxix. p. 193, and
                              Mem. Am. Acad. 1864, Aug. 6).

   From the table of heights of meteors contained in the Am. Journ. Sci. (vol.
xxxviii. p. 135*), Professor Newton estimates the mean height of the centre

of the paths of shooting-stars above the earth to be 95-55 kilometres, or not
quite sixty miles (see also ' Les Mondes,' vol. v. p. 756). Their distribution
at other altitudes above the earth's surface is plainly indicated by the

following Table :

From 19 to 38 miles ( 30 kilom. to 60).  Total 114 meteors.

94 ,, 112 ,, (150  ,, 180).

  A consideration of 1393 meteors (recorded by about forty observers) shows

that the whole number of meteors visible at one place is 50-35 times the

number visible within 10° of the zenith, and therefore 50-35 times the

mnumber of meteors occurring within this cone. If represents the hourly
Nnumber, the total number visible over the whole earth in the same time, it

is shown from the law of distribution in altitude, already stated, that

N=10,460xm.

   Thirty meteors per hour in all the sky, concluded from the careful obser-
vations of M. Pouvard (Comptes Eendus, xiii. p. 1029), is not too large for

the mean value of m. It may therefore be concluded that the average
number of meteors traversing the atmosphere daily, and large enough to be

seen with the naked eye on a dark clear night, is more than seven and a half

millions.

   The number of such meteors traversing a space equal to the sphere of the
earth (radius R), at any moment, with an average relative velocity (V), is

y116-2 x meteors, omitting the effect of the earth's attraction.

   The average length of flight of shooting-stars is 12°-6. The mean distance
of the centres from the observer is upwards of ninety miles, the average
length of path upwards of twenty-five miles, and the average velocity calcu-
lated from a mean duration of 0-45 second, is at least forty-eight miles per

second. If, however, the average velocity is only thirty miles per second, it
follows from this formula that in each volume of the size of the earth, on

the track of its orbit about the sun, there are as many as 13,000 meteoroids,

large enough to furnish shooting- stars visible to tbe naked eye.
    Of telescopic meteors, it is shown that their numbers are at least forty-fold

 as great.

            A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS. 131

    Their average velocity, greater than that of the earth, implies that the
meteoroids are not closely grouped about the earth's orbit. That they are
grouped according to some law is, however, altogether probable.

    1st. They may form a number of rings, like the August ring, cutting or
passing near the earth's orbit at many points along its track. The sporadic
shooting-stars may be outliers of such rings.

   2nd. They may form a disk in or near the plane of the orbits of the

planets.

   3rd. They may be distributed at random like the orbits of the comets.

    According to the first of these suppositions there should be a succession of
radiants corresponding to the several rings. Dr. Heis and Mr. B,. P. Gre<*
believe that they have detected such a series. Continued observation di-
rected to this end will probably decide whether the meteoroids belong entirely
or mostly to rings.

    The meteoroids neither belong exclusively, nor even largely to a disk, or to
a lenticular-shaped group about the sun, like that which the zodiacal light is
often supposed to indicate. The orbits of their rings are not in general cir-

cular, as may be inferred from their great velocity, but resemble more the

orbits of the comets. Finally, they cannot be regarded as the fragments of

former worlds, but may rather be described as the materials from which new

worlds are forming. (See pp. 135, 136).

     (3.) Streaks, Detonations, ifcc. of Meteors (Vienna Acad. Sitzungsber.,
                                       1864, November 10th).

   From a carefully revised catalogue of 2950 meteors in the northern hemi-
sphere, the percentages of detonating, caudate, and aerolitic meteors are sepa-
rately determined by Dr. Julius Schmidt for every month. The percentage
of detonating meteors in August is three times less than in March. The
greatest percentage of aerolitic meteors is observed in May, when the per-
centage of caudate meteors is the least. On the average of the whole year,

different coloured shooting-stars are observed in the following proportions :--

White          75-8 per cent.        Eed      5-7 per cent.

Yellow ..15-9 ,,                     Green ..2-6 ,,

The average durations in seconds, for the different colours, are as follows :

White meteors  0-775 sec.            Red meteors  1-905 see.

Yellow meteors ..0-921 ,,            Green meteors ..3-127 sees.

   If the meteor of the 18th of October 1863 is omitted from the thirty-
two green meteors, included in the last average, the average duration of the
remaining thirty-one green meteors is 2-584 sees.

   From the mean of 1428 meteors observed in 668 hours, in three years
l)r. Neumayer concludes the following hourly numbers of meteors at Mel-
bourne, in the different months :

It may be noticed that, at Melbourne, meteors at the latter end of July

are nearly as abundant as in August.

(5.) Inferences and Suggestions in Cosmical and Geological Philosophy. New
       Theory of the Origin and Formation of Meteorites. By Professor E. W.

         Brayley, E.E.S.

    Professor Brayley, a Member of the Committee, communicated to the Royal

Society on the 23rd of February last (1865), a paper entitled " Inferences and
Suggestions in Cosmical and Geological Philosophy," an abstract of which was
read on March 23rd, and appears in the ' Proceedings ' of the Society, No. 73,

vol. xiv. p. 120-129. In this paper a new theory of the origin and formation

of meteorites is enunciated.

    In the introductory section, the author calls attention to the fact that the
position, powers, and functions of the Sun, as the physical centre of the solar
system, are peculiar, and in fact unique. The " Primary Induction " from

--them, indicating, in his opinion, " the principle of philosophical investiga-
--tion " which should be applied to the Sun, is conceived by him to be " That

they imply a corresponding uniqueness and peculiarity in its constitution,

characterizing also the nature as well as the disposition of the substances of

which it essentially consists. But the particular density of the Sun indicates
that it actually consists both of ponderable and imponderable matter. The

nature of the former as constituting apparently its relatively exterior regions

[is] believed to be made known in part by Professor Kirchhoffs researches in
Prismatic Chemistry applied to the Sun, as showing that some of the ele-
mentary substances of the Earth exist also in the Sun"*.

    The author proceeds to state some of his reasons for believing " that, as a
class, the stars are the most ancient objects in the creation, and also (each in
its own sphere of action) the origins of the series of physical agencies and
processes by which the planets and other classes of heavenly bodies were
finally produced and are maintained." This being admitted, he infers that

--the original production of ponderable matter takes place in the stars, and in

our Sun as one of them a conception to which he had been led by the pre-
ceding and other considerations long before the application of prismatic che-

mistry to the Sun.

    The energy set free in the condensation within the Sun, of matter in its
highest and most elementary character, of course imponderable, which is
conceived by the author to be essential to it, into ponderable matter (an ex-
pression which is shown not to be a solecism) and eventually into the me-
tallic vapours which the observations of Kirchhoif and other spectroscopists
have discovered in the Sun and other stars, is inferred to be at once the ex-
clusive proximate source of the heat and light and other energies of the Sun,
and (in our solar system) the only and universal origin of ponderable matter,
the absolute synthesis of which, from its imponderable elements, is thus be-

lieved to take place in the Sun.

Solar spots" are considered. The energy arising from the transition from im-

ponderable into ponderable matter, will in part become, it is here said, the
centrifugal or projectile force by which the torrents of matter (finally assum-
ing the gaseous form) so produced, are impelled through the denser envelopes

of the Sun, causing the spots and the other phenomena of ebullition of which

the photosphere is the scene.

   The next subjects of discussion are

The Origin of Meteorites, Series of Physical Processes of which they are the
                            result, and their Functions in Nature.

The vapours of metallic and other elementary matter evolved or discharged in

the ebullition of the photosphere of the Sun, partly remain upon the Sun, consti-

tuting its atmospheres*, but are principally aggregated into masses of immense

magnitude (terrestrially speaking), of the nature of bubbles. Having undergone

a certain amount of condensation, these first become visible to us as those particles

the collective brighness of which reveals to us the existence of the zodiacal light,

and are, in fact, the matter separated from the Sun's equator by rotation. These

Jiarticles, termed by the author meteoritic masses, are projected from the zodiacal

ight by the force to which its variable extension is owing, and are further gradually

condensed during their passage through the interplanetary spaces into the liquid

and solid state, constituting eventually the nuclei of meteors, which are finally

precipitated upon the Earth (and doubtless upon the other planets) in the form of

Meteorites.

The sudden outburst of light over a solar spot, witnessed on September 1, 1859,

by Mr. Carrington and Mr. Hodgson, the author regards as a fact confirmatory of

this view, and as having been the consequence or accompaniment of the produc-

tion, and the transfer with immense rapidity from within to without some exterior

region of the Sun, of a meteoritic mass, or more probably of an immense congeries

of such masses, enabled by its consisting of ponderable matter to manifest the

higher temperature and consequent greater effulgence of the interior regions of the
luminary, whence it was originally derived. Certain phenomena before recorded

by astronomers, but not yet understood, are probably of the same nature.

   The structural characters of meteorites are those of bodies which have been origi-

--nally condensed from heterogeneous vapours the mingled vapours of uncombined

elementary substances variable in their nature, and requiring different temperatures

for their maintenance in the gaseous form, but all existing originally at a very high

temperature                                                           and  their  adequate  investigation  may  afford,  as  an experimentum

crucis, an independent confirmation of Kirchhoff's discovery, and of the truth of

the spectrum-analysis of the composition of bodies distant from us in space. They
consist, mineralogically, of two groups, meteoric iron and meteoric stones, forming,

however, by graduation into each other, as first pointed out by the author many
years since, one series of bodies \. The intermediate examples, and indeed most

of the stones, are aggregates of earthy matter partly in the crystalline and partly
(as Mr. H. G. Sorby has shown J) in the vitreous state, and distinct portions of
metallic iron alloyed with other metals. They are, in fact, always heterogeneous

aggregates, in conformity with the origin here assigned to them. While, as a

--class, meteorites are perfectly distinct from all terrestrial rocks the presence of

metallic iron as a mineral constituent imparting to them, indeed, a character which
is perfectly unique--some of their constituent minerals, and all the elementary
substances of which they are composed, are such as are found, but differently asso-

ciated, in the Earth's crust, although there are many other terrestrial elements

which have not yet been discovered in them.

"Ten, or perhaps more, of the elements of the solar atmosphere," according to

Kirchhoff and Angstrom, " are also those of meteorites-- iron, nickel, cobalt, chro-
mium, and magnesium being characteristically such. But the non-metallic base

silicon, which, in union with oxygen as silica, is an abundant and equally charac-

teristic element of meteorites, is absent in the Sun, according to our present know-

ledge, in which also other elements of meteorites, including oxygen itself, are not

known to be present"*. It cannot be doubted, however, that by the further pro-

secution of spectrum-analysis, other elements will be discovered in the Sun. It

must be remembered also that our knowledge of meteorites is confined to a few only

of those which have fallen upon the Earth, and that during a very small space of

time, physically speaking, not exceeding a few thousand years, or perhaps even not

many centuries ; while the synthesis of ponderable matter in the Sun may reason-

ably be supposed to vary from time to time as to the particular chemical elements

Aproduced.  remarkable and instructive fact, in the actual condition of science on

this subject, is that the metal iron is now known to be an abundant and character-

istic element of the Sun, of Meteorites, and of the Earth.

In harmony with these views on the origin of meteorites is a recorded, but per-

haps hitherto unpublished opinion of Sir H. Davy, that they originally consist of

the metallic and other combustible bases of the earths and alkalies of which me-

teoric stones are principally composed. But whether the oxidation of these bases

is effected in the Earth's atmosphere, as he also suggested, or whether in some cases,

though not in all, oxygen is present in the original assemblage of elementary

vapours, and combines with certain bases, and with portions of others, as the con-

densation proceeds, is a difficult question. The latter theory may be thought to

agree better with the entire series of phenomena presented by meteors, and with

the  constitution  of meteorites as a peculiar class  of  mineral  aggregates                                            but  some
                                                                                                                      ;

facts relating to either branch of the subject tend to support the former. Both

may be true to a certain extent. The facts, however, that scarcely any oxidation

of the iron meteorites has taken place, and that there are no meteorites which con-

sist principally of oxide of iron, while there are some in which metallic iron and

earthy matter (oxides) are present in nearly equal proportions, but that even in

these no excess of oxide of iron occurs, are opposed to the supposition that meteor-
ites have derived any considerable part of their oxygen from the atmosphere ; with
which also the existence of sidphide of calcium in certain meteorites is incon-

sistent.

   In what part of space between the zodiacal light and the Earth the final conden-
sation takes place is not at present determinable. It would seem that these masses
must retain much of their original heat, and therefore to a great extent an aeriform
or vaporous condition (though one of greater density than that in which they left
the Sun, or even the zodiacal light, and mingled with liquid or solid matter as just
suggested) in the interplanetary spaces where the ether alone exists, and that
their entire conversion into a liquid and finally a solid form may not occur imtil
their arrival in a region of positive cold in the vicinity of the Earth or other planets.
Mr. Sorby has lately inferred, from the equable manner in which mineral ingredients

greatly differing in specific gravity as well as fusibdity are mingled in meteorites,
that their formation must have taken place in some physical iocality where the
force of gravitation is small ; " that they come either from the outside of a very

small planet much less than the moon, or else from the interior of a larger planet
since broken up"f. The first inference is in perfect accordance with the theory of

meteorites announced in this paper ; for it is evident that the force of gravity in
the original meteoritic masses must be very small, quite inadequate to interfere with
the disposition within them, and among one another, of their proximate elements,

however discordant in fusibility or specific gravity. It will follow also that the

   t Letter to the author [dated July 29, 1864. At the Meeting of the British Association
in September 1864, Mr. Sorby stated his inference in a somewhat different form, suggesting
" that the fusion and cooling " of metallic meteorites (such as the Pallas Iron) " might have
taken place in the metallic centre of small independent bodies, where the specific gravity was

nil, the meteorites being fragments of such bodies entering subsequently within the earth's
attraction, or that each meteorite had been itself a separate small body cooled in space."

exactly the description of a meteoritic mass as contemplated in this paper. The equable

diffusion of proximate elements is equally characteristic of meteoric stones].

final condensation of these vaporous masses cannot take place either very near the

Sun or very near the Earth.
   According to observations of the author already published*, the iron meteorites,

if not certain single meteoric stones (and most probably also the entire nucleus,
which in some cases is broken up and falls as a shower of meteorites), have the
form (resembling that of the meteors themselves, which is nearly that of a flame)
of the solid of least resistance, or of one derived from it, and received in fact from

the resistance of a medium they have traversed, but having in general one termi-

nation, and sometimes the other also, truncated to a variable extent. This would

--seem to prove that they must once have been as individual masses, and not
--merely as portions of a body of which they originally formed part, nor as to their

preexisting materials only in a fluid or mobile condition. These and other sig-

nificant circumstances are adduced in the paper as tending to the discrimination of
the physical changes by which meteoritic masses are affected prior to their entering

--the Earth's atmosphere, from those which they afterwards undergo within it, and

from its action the conclusion arrived at being that the solid meteorite is finally left,
with a slight alteration in figure, and however greatly reduced in volume, in the

--approximate actual form that of a bubble elongated by being impelled in a certain
--direction through a resisting medium in which, when in a gaseous state, it left

the Sun.

   The phenomena of luminous meteors (shooting- stars and fireballs) more or less
examined by physicists from the latter part of the preceding century (the author
having himself endeavoured to elucidate certain characteristic phenomena of fire-

balls by applying to them the results of modem science t), but which, since the

appearance of the persistent meteor-shower in November 1833, have been so assi-
duously observed and discussed by meteorologists, especially in relation to the
periodicity they exhibit, are shown to be entirely conformable to the views of their
origin which are enunciated in this paper. The petrological characters of meteor-
ites themselves, as recently investigated by mineralogists J , together with others
before noticed by the author §, are also accounted for by these views, though, with
respect to the former, in a very different manner from that hitherto accepted.

   The long-continued study of meteorites and of the phenomena which attend

--their fall, affected by the consideration of the probable synthesis of ponderable

matter in the Sim, and since the conclusions of Kirchhoff have been announced
the special study of solar physics and chemistry, in connexion with both subjects,

--appear to the author to justify him in entertaining the hope that he may thus have

succeeded by means partly of a new deductive cosmical hypothesis submitted for

verification, and parti}- by uniting, and in some cases newly interpreting, preceding

--inductions on particular points of their physical history in effecting at least the

approximate solution of the problem of the origin and formation of meteorites,
which has been sought by philosophers from the time of the communication to the

Royal Society, now sixty-three years since, of Edward Howard's paper, demon-

strating their peculiar nature and establishing the reality of their fall||.

tion of the Planets," it is remarked that the only known phenomenon in which

the process of the formation of the Earth as a planet is actually observed, is

that of the fall of Meteorites upon it, by which its magnitude is augmented,
and that by the addition of materials homogeneous with those of its existing
elementary constitution, being chiefly "those chemical elements which are
present in the greatest quantity in the Earth's crust, and seem to be most
essential to its constitution. According to the principle of the adequacy of

Existing Causes, therefore, we must conclude that the fall of Meteorites is a

continuation or a residue of the process of formation of our planet, and that
the Earth was originally produced by the aggregation and coalescence of
Meteorites, or of greater masses into which they had previously coalesced.

   The " Theory of the Minor Planets " is briefly considered. All the pheno-
mena they present are regarded as supporting the conclusion that their pecu-
liar relations and community of character are not, as hitherto supposed,
effects of their having formerly constituted one heavenly body which has been
reduced to fragments, but of their being bodies intrinsically of the same
nature, meteoritic masses in fact, in an advanced intermediate state between
the condition of meteorites and that of true planets, in process of gradual
convergence towards each other, preparatory to their coalescence into one

greater planet.

(6.) On the Microscopical Structure of Crystals. By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S. &c.

                       (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xiv. pp. 453-500).

From the size of the vacuities seen by the aid of the microscope in certain

cavities contained in quartz, felspar, and other crystalline minerals, it is pos-
sible to calculate the circumstances of heat and pressure under which the

crystals were originally consolidated. On heating the crystals gradually, the

vacuous spaces gradually diminish and ultimately disappear. Their dimen-

sions in the natural state are therefore an exact measure of the contraction of

the incarcerated fluids in cooling down from the originally high temperature

of consolidation. Great liquid pressures at the time of consolidation tend to

diminish, and great temperatures to increase the size of the vacuous spaces

contained in the cavities in their ultimate or natural state. These fluid

cavities exist by millions in every specimen of ordinary quartz, and cause the

opacity of this (and the generality of other crystalline minerals) to the pas-

sage of the rays of light. Decrepitating crystals are familiar examples of

their occurrence among artificial products, such as those of salt, sulphate of

potash, nitre, &c. They are indeed of such universal occurrence in crystals,

as to form in mineralogy a microscopical test of crystalline aggregation.

  By alternate overgrowths and restorations of the     Fig. 2.

crystalline figure in deposition, minute cavities are

constantly formed, especially when the deposition

is rapid (fig. 2). In these cavities a portion of the
flux, or mother-liquor, becomes incarcerated. The

foreign substance by which the deposition is for a

moment arrested so as to form the cavity is also

frequently caught up and confined within the

cavity. The cavities are irregular in size, but

generally take their figure from the crystalline

figure of the mineral. After being cooled down

from the temperature of deposition, the cavities

exhibit a variety of solid, fluid, and gaseous con-

tents, as well as a vacuity due to the total con-

traction of the incarcerated fluid. Various examples of cavities in the crystals
       A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OP LUMINOUS METEORS.                137

of minerals are given in the figures at the end of this paper. These consist of,

fluid cavities, glass cavities, gas cavities, and stone cavities, according to the
different materials by which the cavities were filled in deposition. The

coexistence of all of these in the crystalline minerals of igneous rocks, is a

certain proof of the combined influence of igneous fusion, aqueous solutio n

and gaseous sublimation in the process of their consolidation. The fluid
commonly enclosed in mineral crystals is an aqueous solution of chlorides of

potassium and sodium, sulphates of potash, magnesia and lime, and free

hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. It forms in some specimens of quartz, fully

one per eent. of the total weight of the mineral.

If for various specific reasons a dull red heat (680° F.) is adopted as the

ordinary temperature of consolidation of the igneous rocks, lavas, trachytes,

and granites, a fluid pressure of 4000 feet of superincumbent rock would

exactly equipoise the vapour-tension at this temperature of the saline fluids.

If a greater liquid pressure prevailed than this, which would generally be

the case, no vacuity could be formed within the cavities, until by cooling

and contraction the liquid pressure within them should decrease so far as not

pto exceed the vapour-tension of the fluid. If be the excess of pressure at

the time of consolidation at a temperature of 680° F., measured in feet of

superincumbent rock, v the observed proportion of vacuity to liquid volume

derived from the best data of the elasticity of water, and of its vapour, in
combination with saline substances, is briefly

138 REPORT 1865.

The mean depth of consolidation of all the igneous or gneissoid rocks of the
Table is nearly 50,000 feet, and a rate of increase of 1° in 85 feet, according

to the information of Mr. R. Hunt, observed in descending to the bottom of the
deepest mines in England, would require a temperature of 680° F. (adopted in
calculating this Table) at a depth below the surface of 53,500 feet, very nearly
in accordance with the original supposition.

   The molten lava of Mount Teneriffe can hardly be supposed to have an
actual depth less than that of 30,000 feet. The height of the mountain
and the depth of the ocean near its western side, indeed, amount together to
28,000 feet, and if the lava have any lateral extension to a moderate distance
in the same direction, a few thousand feet of rock must necessarily intervene
between its surface and the ocean-bed. The igneous rocks, hitherto examined
in the microscope, appear therefore to have been consolidated at depths com-
 mensurate with those of modern lavas. In other words, granites, trachytes,
 and gneissoid rocks are unerupted lavas of older volcanoes, consolidated by
 loss of temperature, and variously protruded to the surface along with the

 superincumbent strata.

                               By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S., &c.

                    (From the Proceedings of the Royal Society, June 16th, 1864.)

   " For some time past I have endeavoured to apply to the study of meteorites the
principles I have made use of in the investigation of terrestrial rocks, as described

in my various papers, and especially in that on the microscopical structure of crystals

(Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. 1858, vol. xiv. p. 453. See the preceding Article). I
therein showed that the presence in crystals of ' fluid-, glass-, stone-, or gas-
cavities ' enables us to determine in a very- satisfactory manner under what con-
ditions the crystals were formed. There are also other methods of inquiry still

will occupy much time yet, not wishing to postpone the publication of certain

facte, I purpose now to give a short account of them, to be extended and completed

on a subsequent occasion*.

   "In the first place it is important to remark that the olivine of meteorites
contains most excellent 'glass-cavities,' similar to those in the olivine of
lavas, thus proving that the material was at one time in a state of igneous
fusion. The olivine also contains ' gas-cavities,' like those so common in volcanic
minerals, thus indicating the presence of some gas or vapour (Aussun, Parnallee).
To see these cavities distinctly, a carefully prepared thin section, and a magnify-
ing power of several hundreds are required. The vitreous substance found in the
cavities is also met with outside and amongst the crystals, in such a manner as to
show that it is the uncrystalline residue of the material in which they were

form id Mezo-Madaras, Parnallee). It is of a claret or brownish colour, and pos-
                                                                (

sesses the characteristic structure and optical properties of artificial glasses. Some

isolated portions of meteorites have also a structure very similar to that of stony
lavas, where the shape and mutual relations of the crystals to each other prove
that they were formed in situ, on solidification. Possibly some entire meteorites

should be considered to possess this peculiarity (Stannern, New Concord), but the

evidence is by no means conclusive, and what crystallization has taken place in situ
may have been a secondary result ; whilst in others the constituent particles have
all the characters of broken fragments (L'Aigle). This sometimes gives rise to a
structure remarkably like that of consolidated volcanic ashes, so much, indeed, that
I have specimens which, at first sight, might readily be mistaken for sections of
meteorites. It would therefore appear that, after the material of the meteorites
was melted, a considerable portion was broken up into small fragments, subsequently
collected together, and more or less consolidated by mechanical and chemical ac-
tions, amongst which must be classed a segregation of iron, either in the metallic
state or in combination with other substances. Apparently this breaking up oc-
curred in some cases when the melted matter had become crystalline, but in others

the forms of the particles lead me to conclude that it was broken up into detached

globules whilst still melted (Mezo-Madaras, Parnallee). This seems to have been
the origin of some of the round grains met with in meteorites ; for they occasion-
ally still contain a considerable amount of glass, and the crystals which have been
formed in it are arranged in groups, radiating from one or more points on the ex-
ternal surface, in such a manner as to indicate that they were developed after the
fraa-nients had acquired their present spheroidal shape (Aussun, &c). In this they
differ most characteristically from the general type of concretionary globules found
in terrestrial rocks, in which they radiate from the centre ; the only case that I

know at all analogous being that of certain oolitic grains in the Kelloways rock
at Scarborough, which have undergone a secondary crystallization. These facts

are all quite independent of the fused black crust.

to in proof of the various facts previously slated.

--140 REPORT 1865.

   " Some of the minerals in meteorites, usually considered to be the same as those

in volcanic rocks, have yet very characteristic differences in structure (Stannern),
 which I shall describe at greater length on a future occasion. I will then also
 give a full account of the microscopical structure of meteoric iron as compared
 with that produced by various artificial processes, showing that under certain con-

 ditions the latter may be obtained so as to resemble very closely some varieties of

 meteoric origin (Newstead, &c).
    " There are thus certain peculiarities in physical structure which connect meteo-

--rites with volcanic rocks, and at the same time others in which they differ most

 characteristically, facts which I think must be borne in mind, not only in forming
 a conclusion as to the origin of meteorites, but also in attempting to explain volcanic
 action in general. The discussion of such questions, however, sbould, I think, be
 deferred until a more complete account can be given of all the data on which these

 conclusions are founded."

     (8.) Note on the preceding Articles (5) and (7). By Professor Brayley.

   My friend Mr. Sorby, having resumed his microscopical investigation of the

 structure of meteorites, privately printed and circulated a note, dated July 1865,

 " On the Physical History of Meteorites," in which lie gives in a concise form what

 he terms " a provisional theory " of their formation, announcing also his intention
 to " describe the facts upon which it is founded," and discuss the " objections to

 this and other theories in a [future] communication to the Royal Society." The
 reception of an impression of this note from Mr. Sorby occasioned me to print, also

  for private circulation, a comparison of the physical history of meteorites as in-

 ferred in my own communication to the Royal Society, as above (p. 132), with that

 inferred by him from his new observations of their microscopical structure. This
  was placed in the hands of the officers of the Association, at the Meeting at Bir-
  mingham, but too late to allow of its being read at any of the sectional meetings.
 The present article is a brief abstract of it, with some additions.

     Of the two most important results relative to the origin and formation of
  meteorites obtained by Mr. Sorby, the first is stated, in his note, as follows :

    "A most careful study of their microscopical structure leads me to conclude that

  their constituents were originally at such a high temperature that they were in a

  state of vapour, like that in which many now occur in the atmosphere of the Sun,

  as proved by the black lines in the solar spectrum."

     As original induction from observed facts, this is in reality a verification, to an

  important extent, of the hypothesis of the origin and formation of meteorites an-

  nounced in my paper. But I had already arrived at, and made public in that paper,

  exactly the same conclusions, with the addition that this vapour had actually been a
  part of the same mass, and was identical in origin, with that forming the atmosphere

  of the Sim, constituted as we believe it to be, on the authority of Kirchhoff and the
  other spectroscopists who have continued and repeated his researches (p. 132).

     Some of Mr. Sorby's subsequent conclusions are also closely parallel to my own.
  " On cooling," he continues, " this vapour condensed into a sort of cometary cloud,

  which was in a state of great commotion." This "cometary cloud" is manifestly
  identical in nature with the bubbles or volumes of gaseous matter consisting of

  the vapours of metallic and other elementary substances, which, having undergone

  a certain amount of condensation, are conceived by me to be projected from the

   Sun and through the Zodiacal Light ; and their gaseous contents having constituted,

  according to my views, the torrents causing the phenomena termed the solar-

   spots, in the stupendous ebullition of the photosphere, they must necessarily be " in
   a state of great commotion," which would be retained long after their projection
   from the Sun.

       Mr. Sorby finally concludes " provisionally that meteorites are records of the

  existence in planetary space of physical conditions more or less similar to those now

   confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the Sun," at a remote cosmical period
   a conclusion which he identifies with " a modified nebular hypothesis."

      These physical conditions of planetary space at a former period are those which

   I attribute to the interior regions of the Zodiacal Light as existing now, and of the

  actual nature of which meteorites may be regarded as perpetual records. But I
. believe it may be shown, by a strict process of reasoning, that one of the necessary
                  A CATALOGUE OF OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.           141

results of the " uniqueness and peculiarity of the position, powers, and functions of

the Sun, as the physical centre of the solar system," is, that such conditions must in

the nature of things have heen from the beginning, and must ever be, confined to

it and its immediate vicinity ; that they never have existed, and cannot exist, any-

where else in the solar system, or in the space which it now occupies. Of the pre-

sence of the conditions requisite for the genesis of meteorites within, upon, and

immediately around the Sim, we have actual and ample evidence, quite independent

of that which may be derivable from meteorites themselves. But all that can be

said in support of the notion that such conditions could ever extend to distances

from the Sun comparable to those of the planets, is to adduce the very facts to

account for which that notion is brought forward, or refer to what are supposed to

be the probabilities of the "nebular hypothesis" hitherto unverified.

I deem myself justified in affirming that Mr. Sorby, by his microscopical obser-

vations of the structure of meteorites, has verified the hypothesis of their origin

--and formation which has been stated in my " Inferences and Suggestions " through

a great part of their genetic history, to the extent that is, of their condensation

from separate volumes or masses (believed to be originally solar bubbles) of aeriform

matter, consisting of the mingled vapours of their chemical elements, at a very high

temperature, in intense commotion, and existing, or having existed, in planetary

space somewhere between the Sun and the Earth*.

The second most important residt of Mr. Sorby's investigation, is that many

meteorites have been subjected to a metamorphic action.
   " The particles of the cometary cloud," he sajrs, " moving with great velocity,

were often broken by collision. After collecting together to form larger masses,

heat, generated by mutual impact, or that existing in other parts of space through

which they moved, gave rise to a sensible amount of metainorphism. In some few

cases, when the whole mass was fused, all evidence of a previous history has been

obliterated ; and on solidification a structure has been produced quite similar to

that of terrestrial volcanic rocks."

The basaltic character of meteoric stones which Dr. Haidinger and Mr. A. S. Her-

schel have adduced in support of their conclusion, that they must have been frag-
mentsof true planets previously existing, together with the mineral constitution which

has led the former inquirer as well as Mr. R. P. Greg to regard them as unerupled

lavas, are manifestly the results of the metamoi-phism which some have undergone,

for the discovery of which, thus annoimced, science is indebted to Mr. Sorby. That

while existing as meteoritic masses resulting from the condensation of solar bub-

bles and froth, and prior to their coalescence into planetary bodies, or becoming

the nuclei of meteors, meteorites had undergone metamorphism, or that any which

had actually fallen upon the Earth had suffered that process, had never occurred to

me                although  I  had  been  indebted to Mr. Sorby's  kindness  and liberality for an
               ;

opportunity of examining his series of sections of meteorites prepared for the mi-

croscope, before my paper was communicated to the Royal Society. This discovery

has removed an ambiguity, which from the time when the resemblance of certain

meteorites to volcanic rocks was distinctly recognized, has led to continued misap-

prehension of the nature of meteorites in general, and of their genetic history.

From this I had been myself preserved only by the conviction, that a group or

series of mineral aggregates possessing the unique character that nearly alf its

terms, even those principally composed of oxides, contained iron in the metallic

state, while some were entirely devoid of oxygen, consisting exclusively of iron

and other metals, together with uncombined "carbon, and also sidphur and phos-

phorus (if not silicon) united merely with portions of those metals, could not have

had the same origin with another group, volcanic rocks, which are character-

istically the results of oxidation, all their proximate constituents being oxides,

whether simple or compound. It was as evident at least that certain meteoric rocks

were genetically independent of the presence of oxygen, as that all volcanic rocks

were essentially due to its action ; while the meteorites devoid of oxygen were mani-

physical constitution and functions of the Sun, in the ' Companion to the Almanac ' for

1866, in sequence of two others contained in the same work for the two preceding years.

In the same article are some further considerations (also derived from my privately printed

paper) relative to the meteoritic constitution and physical circumstances of the Zodiacal

Light.
--142 report 1865.

festly as typically meteorites as those principally composed of oxides, and must have
originated in the same cosmical process. Metamorphosis alone, it is evident, could
not have converted meteorites devoid of oxygen into those which consist chiefly of
oxides, though a process of reduction resulting from the same cause, and going on

--at the same time, might have converted the latter class into bodies resembling the

former. But the two groups or rather the extreme terms of the series of Meteoric

--Rocks differ so greatly in their chemical composition, that the oxidation of the

unoxidated group would not result in the production of the oxidated, nor would
the reduction of the latter have produced the former. The meteoric irons must
have originated either from the condensation of vapour in which oxygen was not
present, or under conditions in which its activity was more or less controled. It
is highly probable, however, that the most perfectly stony meteorites, those most
nearly resembling Volcanic Rocks, and in which the smallest amount of metallic iron
occurs, have resulted from a combined process of metamorphosis and oxidation. All

this is perfectly consistent with my inference recently advanced, that the production

of terrestrial hypogene rocks " would be one of the final results of the Earth's for-
mation by the coalescence of meteoritic masses;" an inference which is I believe
original, and the announcement of which was made previously to Mr. Sorby's dis-
covery that some fallen meteorites have already undergone metamorphic action.

                  Report on Dredging the Coast of Aberdeenshire.

           By the Rev. Walter Gregor, and Robert Dawson.

The Committee appointed by the British Association for the Advancement

of Science, for dredging the coast of Aberdeenshire, having engaged a smack
belonging to Banff, left that port on Tuesday, the 4th of July. The voyage
was continued till they found themselves off Gixdleness, the southern point ox

the Aberdeenshire coast. On Wednesday evening the distance from land was
about forty miles, and the depth of water was thirty-eight fathoms, with a bot-
tom of shingle and broken shells. The vessel was on the bank known as " The
Long Forties." The dredgings from this spot yielded no Arctic fossil shells,

although they were found in abundance on a smaller bank, which lies nearer
the shore, and at a distance of from eight to fifteen miles from land. There

were, however, brought up, in a decayed state, the four most common littoral

species, viz. Littorina rudis, Purpura htpillus, Solen siliqua, and Mytilus
edulis, the last being, with one exception, the small shore variety.

    The Committee then sailed in and dredged in depths of forty fathoms with
a bottom of sand, forty-eight fathoms with a similar bottom, and fifty-seven
fathoms with a bottom of mud, shingle, and the concreted sand-tubes of a
species of Sabellaria, without finding any fossil shells. They continued their
course N.W. till they sighted the Buchanness Light-House on Thursday

evening. On Friday, when about ten miles from land, the dredges were put
out in fifty-four fathoms, with a bottom of mud and shells. The vessel was

then steered N. by E. for two hours. The dredges were again let down in
forty-five fathoms, when fossil shells came up in abundance. During the day
there was a thick fog, accompanied by torrents of rain. By evening it was
blowing a strong breeze, and the Committee were obliged to make for Peter-
head Bay. The weather continued unfavourable till Monday, when the Com-
mittee again sailed. It being almost a dead calm, little way was made, and
it was late in the afternoon before it was deemed expedient to throw the
 dredges. About seven miles from land the dredges were let down in forty
fathoms, when large quantities of fossil shells came up. During the night
 the vessel continued her course N. by E. from Buchanness, and by morning
 (Tuesday, 11th July) was twenty-five miles from land. Here the depth was

found to be 65 fathoms, and the bottom mud. Round this spot the dredging

was carried on for the day. During the afternoon a breeze sprang up, and

the working of the dredges became impossible. There was nothing for the

Committee but to return to Peterhead Bay.

The portion of the coast explored extends from Girdleness, the southern

extremity of Aberdeenshire, to a few miles north of Peterhead. There thus

remains -undredged a distance of rather more than ten miles on the east

coast, and of twelve miles on the north coast, at the entrance of the Moray

Firth, from Kinnaird to the Banffshire coast. The Committee regret that the

weather was not more favourable, as they have every reason to think they

would have been able to accomplish the dredging of the whole of the Aber-

deenshire  coast, and          thus  have  had  the  means  of  presenting  to  the Association
                            4

a much fuller report than the one now submitted.

   From the soundings, and the nature of the dredgings, the following con-

--clusions may be drawn : The sea gradually deepens for a distance of eight

to fifteen miles, when a bank covered with Arctic fossil shells occurs. The
depth again goes on increasing, till the bank called " The Long Forties " is

reached. From this bank no Arctic fossil shells were obtained but decayed

littoral species. The inner bank is, no doubt, composed of drift. It is

highly probable that the outer bank (" The Long Forties ") was at one period

an island, or the shore of a continent, which has since been submerged under

the sea.

   It may be remarked that, along with the littoral species dredged from
" The Long Forties," there came up a valve of the "West Indian shell, Lucina

pemylvanica

On referring to the Report of the Committee for dredging the North and

East Coasts of Scotland, laid before the meeting of the Association in 1862,

it will be found that the number of Mollusca collected by Mr. Dawson on the

Aberdeenshire coast amounted to 223 species, arranged as follows :

   Since that time 36 species have been added to the                        list, arranged    as

follows :                                                                        14

specimens), Odostomia pallida (1 specimen), Propilidium ancyloides, Am-

phisphyra, n. 8. (4 specimens), supposed to be the same species as that found

by Mr. Dawson in shell-sand from Unst, and noticed by Mr. Jeffreys in his

Report to the Meeting of the Association of last year, Montacuta Dawsoni,

described by Mr. Jeffreys in the second volume of his ' British Conchology,'

Pecten striatus, Panopea plicata, Tellina balaustina (a perfect specimen),

Crania anomala, and Argiope cistellula.

Of the Crustacea a full examination has not yet been made ; but what has

been done has brought to light several additions of interest and importance.

Of the Macroura only six species were obtained, viz., Stenorhynchus phalan-

gium and S. tenuirostris (many specimens), Inachus Dorsettenis (a few speci-

mens), Hyas coarctatus, Ebalia Cranchii (several specimens), and Atelecydus

heterodon (one small specimen). The total absence of any of the genus

Portunus, several of which are somewhat common in the Moray Firth, and

the extreme paucity of Atelecydus heterodon, plentiful on the Banffshire

coast, are worthy of notice. Of the Anomoura the Paguridas alone have

been fully examined, and they are as follows : Pagurus Bernhardus, P.

Cuanensis, P. Ulidianus (one specimen), P. Hyndmanni (several specimens),

and another small specimen, not yet identified. Of the Sessile-eyed Crus-

tacea the examination has not been completed ; but the following interesting

species have been obtained, viz., Cheirocratus mantis and Unciola planipes,

two species recently described by the Rev. A. M. Norman in the ' N. H.

Transactions of Northumberland and Durham'; two Ampeliscce, not yet an-

nounced as British, but described by Mr. Norman as A. laevigata and A.

tenuicornis ; Mysis spinifera, not yet recorded as British; and another well-
marked species, in all probability new. One specimen of Sipuneulus Bern-

hardus was got.

The Echinodermata yielded nothing remarkable, except one specimen of

Brissus lyrifer, which, it may be remarked, has also been found off the

Banffshire coast, and one of Psolus squamosus, rather common on the Banff-

shire coast. Besides these the following species were found : Ophiura tex-

turata, 0. albida, Ophiocoma bellis, 0. Ballii, O.gramdata, 0. rosida, Uraster

rubens ; Solaster papposa, Liudia fragilissima (1 specimen), Echinus sphcrra,

Edi inocyamus pusillus, Spatangus purpureus (many specimens), Amphidotus

cordatus, and A. roseus (a good many specimens). The absence of Palmipes

membranaceus and of Goniaster equestris, both rather plentiful on the Banffshire

coast, is worthy of notice.

In the examination of the Polyzoa and Hydrozoa little has been done.

Hornera borealis, a species not found before south of Shetland, was observed;

and two of the Leprcdia?. may turn out to be new.

Of the Actinozoa four species only were met with, at a depth of fifty-seven

fathoms, viz. Tealia crassicornis, Stomphia Churchice (5 specimens), Hor-

mathia Margarita, and Caryophyllia Smithii (a broken specimen). Of

Hormathia  Margarita}  the   disk  and  tentacles  only came  up                but these  agreed
                                                                             ;

in every respect with the description given in the ' Actinologia Britannica.'

The Hormathia lived for several days, expanding the tentacles, and doing its

best in the miserable circumstances to enjoy life (!). The smallness of the
number of the Actinozoa, when compared with the number of species found

on the Banffshire coast (about eighteen, including the littoral species), is

somewhat remarkable. One reason for the difference, no doubt, is the nature

of the sea-bottom, that of Banffshire being in many places rocky or, as it

is locally called, " hard."

The few Sponges that were got were sent to Dr. Bowerbank. They con-

sisted of Polymastia spinula, Hymeraphia stellifera, and a very young Hy-

meniacidon, which was too immature for satisfactory determination.

   It may be added that a small Lumpsucker, which the Committee have

been unable to identify either from Yarrell's or Couch's « British Fishes,'
was brought up.

   To complete the dredging of the coast, the Committee would ask a re-
newal of the grant. They would also suggest that it would be most de-

sirable that their researches should be extended along the coast of Banffshire,

which has already yielded so many species new to Britain and to science.

A supplementary Report will be laid before the next Meeting of the Asso-

 ciation.

   auspices of the Committee of the British Association for the Advance-

TnE Committee on Balloon Experiments was reappointed last year, chiefly

for the following purposes :

   1st. To examine the electrical condition of the air, if possible.

   2nd. To verify the law of the decrease of temperature as found from
summer-day observations, already made, with day observations at other

seasons of the year, but principally in the winter and adjacent months.
   3rd. It was understood that, in addition, magnetical experiments, when-

ever possible, were to be made in preference to all others ; observations by

the spectroscope (particularly on the solar spectrum), on the currents of the
atmosphere, on solar radiation at different heights, and hygrometical observa-
tions, though secondaiy, were to be held very important subjects of inves-
tigation, and to be followed as far as possible, according to circumstances.

   4th. To make arrangements for observations at night, and to make ob-

servations at night, if possible.

With respect to the first of these objects, no further progress has been
made
                     ;  the                    instrument  which  was  prepared    last  year, was  prepared     for  use

with an open-burning flame ; this is not admissible with gas in such close

proximity                                      and since  the last Meeting I have  been  in hopes   that Mr.  Fleeming
                                            ;

Jenkm, with Mr. Varley and Prof. Thomson, would be able to arrange an

apparatus that might with safety be used ; but, owing to engagements in

connexion with the Atlantic Telegraph Cable, these gentlemen have not yet

succeeded.

   With respect to the second and third objects of research, some progress

has been made, though not to the exteat contemplated at the beginning of

the year.

   With respect to the fourth object, having relation to night observations,
none have actually been made, but some arrangements have been completed,
of which I will say a few words.

--146 report 1865.

   To take observations in the air at night, it is imperatively necessary to
have some power of illumination, so that the instruments can be read.

   Very many suggestions have been made for the benefit of the occupants
of the car ; among them phosphorus and the use of glow-worms have been
mentioned. The latter I feared would lose their luminosity at a low tem-
perature. The best of all seemed, however, to be a well-made miners' Davy-

lamp ; and through the kindness of my friends T. Sopwith, Esq., F.R.S., and

E. Potter, Esq., of Tynemouth, two have been most carefully made by Mr.
H. "Watson, of Newcastle, of copper ; so that their presence near to magnets

is innocuous.
    These lamps, with their lights burning, have been placed in a volume of

gas, completely surrounded by it, without any bad effect following the im- '
mersion ; and what is more important, I have had one of these lamps burning
during an ascent made on the 27th of February of this year, coming down

--alight the only difference between with and without the light being that

in the latter case I had a source of heat to wann my cold fingers, which I

never had before.
    I corsider tliat at present all necessary arrangements have been made for

night observations, so far as light is concerned ; and I cannot but regard this
as an advance, although I have not any results to present of observations made

at night, and we therefore are still in utter ignorance, without a single obser-

vation of the processes in operation at night to guide us, at any distance from
the earth. Such a series of observations, even though only to the height of
half a mile, would be veiy valuable indeed.

                                § 1. Instruments and Apparatus.

   The instruments used were for the most part the same in construction as
those in the preceding year; in addition, however, to them, there was a
very fine spectroscope by Mr. Browning, and a delicately mounted magnet
lent by Capt. Evans, F.K.S.

                                  § 2. Observing-Arrangements.

   The instruments were in all cases placed on suitable framework attached
to the outside of the car, and were in this position easily read by myself
standing at the end of the car.

                Circumstances of the Ascents, and General Observations.

   Up to the last Meeting of the Association there had been 22 ascents, of

which 17 had been made in the months of June, July, August, and Septembe",
and 5 only in the other months of the year, viz. 1 in January, 1 in March,
2 in April, and 1 in October. Of those made in the summer months, one only
had been made in the morning, and 16 had been made in the afternoon or

evening, with a declining sun.
    Efforts were therefore directed to day experiments between the months of

October and April, it being considered that the day and high experiments in
summer already collected had better be brought together and discussed before
any more of such experiments were made, and that in future attention should
be directed to those points of research needing further elucidation.

   I therefore devoted myall leisure between the months of October and April

to securing as many ascents as I could between these times, and regret to

say that I succeeded in three only. The first of these "was on December 1st,
the second on December 30th, 1864, and the third on February 27th of the
present year. These three ascents were made from Woolwich Arsenal.

Although I have so few ascents to speak of, it must be borne in mind that

winter is the most difficult season of the year to pursue balloon experiments

yet as mountains are not climbed at this time of the year, and so few

experiments have hitherto been made by means of the balloon, we are in

almost entire ignorance of everything connected with the higher regions of

the atmosphere during this cold portion of our year, in respect to the pro-

gressive diminution of temperature with elevation, the diffusion of vapour

in the atmosphere, the density of clouds, their extent, and the currents in the

atmosphere.

It is therefore the most important season for experiments ; and these will

be exceeded in value only by night experiments.

 --Ascent from Woolwich Arsenal, December 1, 1864. The balloon left the

earth at 2h 37m p.m., the temperature of the air at the time being 48° ; and

this value remained almost unchanged till the height of 600 feet was passed
(increasing slightly in fact at first), and then very gradually declined to 31 1°

at about one mile in height.

 --Ascent from Woolwich Arsenal, December 30, 1864. The balloon left at

2h 13m p.m., with a temperature at the time of 42^° ; it declined 2° in the

first 500 feet ; at 1000 feet high it was 37°, or showing a decrease of 5|°

at 2000 feet it was 33|°, showing a further decline of 3|° in this 1000 feet.

At 2500 feet high we met with cloud ; the temperature was 31°. At 3300

feet, just  at  the upper      surface   of the    cloud, the  temperature  was  27°                 on
                                                                                                  ;

getting above the c^ud the temperature rose, and when 400 feet above it had

increased to 31 1°.                                                         left the earth

 --WeAscent from Woolwich Arsenal, on February 27, 1865.
at lh 58m p.m. ; the temperature of the air was 52°, declined gradually to 35°,

when cloud was reached, which proved to be 1000 feet in thickness ; during

the passage through it there was no change of temperature, but on passing

above it the temperature increased with the elevation.

   By comparing these results with those taken in the period of summer they

differ very greatly, and plainly show that the laws of temperature holding
good at one season are different from those at other seasons of the year.

   The balloon's courses in these three ascents were very nearly the same

after attaining a certain elevation. On the 1st of December, on reaching

1100 feet, the current of air changed from W. to S.W. ; at 2000 feet a

W.N.W. current was entered ; at 5000 feet the air was moving W.N.W.,

and we approached the sea, compelling us to descend near Rochester at

4U 25m p.m.

In the second ascent the wind was nearly south on the earth when the in-

flation began ; it changed to W. nearly, and pilot balloons at a moderate ele-

vation moved N,W. On leaving, the balloon first moved E.N.E. ; when 500

feet high we entered a W. current, and, as before, moved towards the sea. It

was at first intended to descend near the river Thames ; but on coming within

300 feet of the earth the wind changed and we went somewhat inland, and

descended,  at  3h  20  m      near  to  Stamford  Le  Hope.

                            ,

During the month of January, and the greater part of February, as far as

could be determined from daily observation from the Royal Observatory,

Greenwich, the general prevalence of the wind in the higher regions of the

ah- was W. and S.W. On February 27th the direction of the wind on the earth
--148 report 18G5.

was N., and apparently steady in that direction while the balloon was being
filled. On its completion the wind had changed to the S., and 4 or 5 hours'
observations were looked forward to.

   On reaching the height of 1500 feet, the balloon again fell in with the pre-
valent S.W. current, and at 3000 feet was in a nearly W. current, and again

passed over the like course, directly towards the sea. It was therefore not

deemed prudent to ascend very high. When above the lower clouds they

were seen moving at right angles to the balloon's motion. Approaching the
sea, it was necessary to descend ; and on again reaching the height of 3000
feet the balloon fell in with the S.W. current, at 1500 feet with the S. current,

and with this passed somewhat inland ; on again reaching 3000 feet, we
turned to move again directly towards the sea, and descended at South Han-

ningfield at 4h 1 M .
    After this I did not succeed in ascending, and since April I have mostly

been taking steps towards securing some night ascents.
    It is unfortunate, in one sense, that the wind on these occasions, not-

withstanding its direction on the land, was so constantly at certain eleva-
tions moving with a W., W.S.W. or S.W. current, because on all occasions
it so shortened the time of observation, and limited the elevation to such

heights only that we were certain of being able to descend before reaching

the sea.

   Yet the fact is important, and very much so, as proving the constancy of

the S.W. current during our winter months ; for the evidence of such cur-
rent is not merely confined to these three clays only, but a continued watch
was kept on the higher regions from the lloyal Observatory, and whenever
scud or cloud has been seen at the proper elevation, it has been found to be

moving in that direction. The high temperature we experience in winter
seems to be very much due to the prevalence of the warm current.

   In these three ascents, Frederick John Evans, Esq., Staff Commander E.N.,
F.R.S., Superintendent of the Compass Department of Her Majesty's Navy,
very kindly furnished me with a very delicate magnet, which he uses on board
of iron ships and in the Compass Department.

    This instrument vibrates in a little more than two seconds on the earth.
In the ascent on December 1, I was able to take ten sets of vibrations ; and
notwithstanding the lower temperature of the higher regions, the time of
vibration was lengthened.

   In the ascent on December 30, the balloon was in a constant state of rota-
tion, and I was unable to take any magnetic observations.

   In the ascent on February 27, the same needle vibrated in 2-001 seconds
on the earth, at the height of one mile vibrated in 2-277 seconds nearly.
These results were confirmed by another magnet, somewhat less delicately
mounted, its time of vibration being found to be longer at high elevations
than on the earth. These results agree with those found at other times of

the year.

                                  The Lines in the Solar Spectrum.

   At every opportunity I directed the spectroscope to the sun, and always
saw a very fine spectrum, with veiy many lines, far greater in number than
when viewed on the earth, and much better defined. The spectrum usually

Aextended from to far beyond H, the latter line being plainly made up of

fine lines. I have never seen the spectrum of the sun, when viewed on the

earth, nearly so brilliant as it always is on rising above the lower atmosphere,

although I have examined the solar spectrum many hundreds of times on the
finest days. The spectrum, when viewed from above, is perfect with a much

narrower opening of the slit than it is on the ground, and consequently lines
can be resolved clearly which cannot be seen from the earth.

  A very delicate blackencd-bulb thermometer, placed with its bulb near

to the carefully screened bulb for temperature of the air, in the first of these
three ascents, generally read the same as that for the temperature of the air,
occasionally read lower, and never during the ascent read more than 1° in

excess. The same results were observed in the ascent on December 30tb.
In the ascent on February 27 it generally read the same; but at times,
when the sun was shining the brightest, it read from 2° to 3° higher than its

shaded neighbour.

   No tinge of ozone was shown on any test-paper spread freely about on the

rigging in any of these journeys.

§ 3. Description of the Table of Observations.

All the meteorological observations taken during the ascents are contained

in Table I.

   Column 1 contains the times at which the observations were made. Column
2 contains observations of the siphon barometer corrected for temperature and
index error. Column 3 contains the readings of the thermometer attached
to the barometer. Column 4 contains the readings of an aneroid barometer.
Column 5 contains the height above the level of the sea, as reduced from the
barometric readings in column 2 on the days the siphon barometer was used,

and from column 4 on other days, by the formula of Baily, checked at inter-

--vals by that of Laplace, which is as follows :

^r«)z= 1,,g (i,) x6o 158 1+  (l+ ,,,o283rc,,s2 L)(1+ lg|l),

(

where Z is the height required, and h, Ji', t and t' the height of the barometer,

corrected for temperature, and the temperature of the air at the lower and

upper stations respectively, L the latitude. The temperature of the air for the

position of the balloon has been derived from the readings in column 10,
when such have been taken, otherwise from column 6. Columns 6 to 9
contain the observations with the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers free,
and the deduced dew-point. Column 10 contains the readings of a
gridiron thermometer. Columns 11 to 14 contain the observations with
the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers aspirated, and the deduced dew-
point. Columns 15 and 16 contain the direct dew-point observations with
Daniell's and Kcgnault's hygrometers. "When numbers are entered in
columns 15 and 16 with " no dew " affixed to them, it is meant that the
temperature of the hygrometer has been lowered to the degree stated, but that
no dew has been deposited. Column 17 contains the readings of a very de-
licate blackened-biub thermometer fully exposed to the sun's rays.

   The Astronomer Eoyal had observations made every ten minutes at the
Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, on the days of ascent, by Mr. Nash of the Mag-
netical and Meteorological Department.

    The height of Greenwich barometer- cistern above the mean sea-level is

159 feet.

   From all the observations of the temperature of the air, evaporation, and dew-point
in Table I., a determination was made of these elements, with the corresponding reading or
mean of readings of the barometer and heights, and then the next Table was formed.

   Every reading of temperature in the preceding Tables, or the means of
small groups of readings when observations have been taken in quick succes-
sion at about the same altitude, or when the Balloon has passed and re-

--passed through nearly the same space within a few minutes as, for example,
--on December 1st, between 3h 44m and 3h 49m it fell from 4464 feet to 3470

feet, and rose to 4170 feet these readings, or means of readings, were laid
down on diagrams, the points joined, and a curved lino made to pass through
or near them, so that the area of the spaces between the original and tbe
adopted lines on one side Avas equal to that of the spaces on the other side.
Thus treated, temperature decreased with increase of elevation on December

1st and 30th. On February 27th it was found to increase, after attaining
the altitude of 4647 feet. On descending, the temperature at first declined,
and at 4800 feet the reading was the same as at the same elevation on as-
cending ; then a warm current was met with, and the readings at the same
elevation were much higher than were noted in ascending, and continued so

through a space of 2800 feet, below which they were lower than on ascend-
ing ; in consequence of these differences no temperature has been adopted for
these, and another ascent and descent were made, for which temperatures
have been adopted.

   The numbers in the first column show the height in feet, beginning at the
groimd and increasing upwards ; the numbers in the second column show the
interval of time in ascending to the highest point; the notes in the third column
show the circumstances of the observations ; the numbers in the fourth and
fifth columns the observed and the approximate normal temperatures of the
air ; and those in the next column the difference between the two preceding
columns, or the most probable effect of the presence of cloud or mist on the

temperature, or other local disturbing causes.

   The next group of columns is arranged similarly for the descent, and the
other groups for succeeding ascents and descents.

200 feet up to 800 feet, where the temperature was 47° or 5°-3 lower than on
the ground : the decline was then less rapid, for on passing through the next
800 feet the whole decrease was 2°-l. The temperature then declined rather
more rapidly to 35°-l at 3400 feet high ; at 3600 feet it was 34f°, and varied but
little from this till 4000 feet had been passed ; it then decreased to 34° at 4600
feet, when it suddenly became warm, the temperature increasing to 38|° on
passing above 4S00 feet, and to 39^° nearly on reaching 5000 feet, the same
temperature having been passed at 2600 feet. The balloon then turned to de-
scend, the temperature at first decreasing to 3S°-4 at 4800 feet, being the same

as noted on ascending : here a warm current was met with, and the tempera-
ture increased rapidly ; when at 4200 feet it was 43°-3, being 9° warmer

than was noticed at the same elevation on ascending ; this excess gradually
diminished, till at about 2000 feet high the temperature observed during
the descent was very nearly the same as. noted, during the ascent; and below
this the temperatures were all lower by some -degrees than were recorded at
the same elevation during the ascent : these differences seem to be chiefly
owing to the presence of cloud situated between 3100 feet and 4100 feet
high, or 1000 feet in thickness passed through in ascending, and seen at the
same level, but not passed through in descending. The point where the tem-
peratures noted were the same ascending and descending was a little below
the cloud-plane ; at lower elevations, to the ground, the air was some degrees
warmer under the cloud, during the ascent, than in the absence of cloud
during the descent. The .effect of the presence of the cloud in this ascent
seems to have been to cool the air several degrees ; and this cooling influence
seems to have extended for nearly 1000 feet above the cloud, and for 500
or 600 feet below ; nearer the earth the presence of the cloud seems to
have exercised a warming influence. In the descent it will be seen that the
temperature differed very little from 43°, from 4200 feet high to 1000 feet
high, the depression' to 41°+ from 3000 feet to 2600 feet being evidently

influenced by the passage through the cloud-plane. On ascending again,

first haze was passed through, then cloud entered, giving readings differing

but little from those met with in the first ascent. On descending to the

earth, temperatures a little lower, owing apparently to the diurnal decrease

of temperature at these altitudes, were met with, thus far agreeing with those

during the first ascent ; and comparison with those during the first descent

through a large break in the clouds gives a great deal of information upon

the large influence exercised by the presence of cloud.

   In previous Reports a Table (No. IY.) was formed here, showing the
decrease of temperature in every 1000 feet ; as no additional information at
high elevations is given this year, this Table has not been formed. The

residts of Table V. of preceding years are included in Table III. of this year.

§ 6. Variation of the Hygrometric Condition op the Air "with Elevation.
   All the adopted readings of the temperature of the dew-point in Section 4

were laid down on diagrams, and joined by lines drawn from one to the other.
In the case of the temperature of the air, when thus joined, a curved line can
be drawn through them, giving equal weight to every observation ; but this

cannot be done with respect to the temperature of the dew-point, it being far
more variable than the temperature of the air ; and the numbers in the fol-
lowing Table are those read at every 200 feet, from the diagram formed
simply by joining the points of observation.

Interim Report of the Committee on the Transmission of Sound under
   Water, consisting of the Rev. Dr. Robinson, Prof. Wheatstone,
   Dr. Gladstone, and Prof. Hennessy.

When the Committee on. Fog-signals stated at the Meeting of the British

Association last year that no success had attended their efforts to induce the

Board of Trade to undertake experiments on the subject, it was thought

advisable to change the mode of procedure. The Parliamentary Committee

was requested to press on the Government the expediency of instituting such

experiments, while the Committee was reappointed for the purpose of making

--experiments on the transmission of sound under waer a line of inquiry

suggested by us in our memorial to the President of the Board of Trade,

June 18, 1803. The sum of =£30 was placed at our disposal, and to this the

Government-Grant Committee of the Royal Society have added £100.

The subject of the production of sound under water, and its transmission

through that medium, had previously engaged the attention of one of our

number, Professor Wheatstone, and we naturally wished to be guided in our

Afirst trials by his experience.  long and serious illness unfortunately

delayed the commencement of that gentleman's experiments ; but the inves-

tigation has been fairly begun this summer. The results hitherto arrived

at are instructive and promising, but they are not sufficiently precise to

Wewarrant their publication.    have therefore only to report progress, and

to ask the British Association to give us the opportunity of bringing our

results before them next year.

  On the Rainfall of the British Isles. By Gr. J. Symons, M.B.M.S.

myIn previous reports on the progress of rainfall-investigations I have

scarcely referred to what had been done before I undertook the collection and
organization to which 1 have now devoted nearly six years.

  --I purpose to supply the omission on this present occasion, and to divide my

Report into the following divisions :

      1. What had been done prior to 1860.
      2. What has been done since 1860.
      3. What remains to be done.

     A4. few particulars respecting the rainfall of the last fifty years, and

              the fall in 1864.

  --1. What had been done prior to 1860. Raving been almost wholly en-

gaged during the past year in clearing up arrears, and in thoroughly classifying

the materials hitherto collected, the imperative necessity of circulating
amongst engineers, meteorologists, and rainfall-observers a complete index of
the collected observations has been brought prominently before me. I have
therefore prepared such an index, and annexed it to this lleport. Besides its

general usefulness, it will be specially so in. two respects. (1) Every station,
whether discontinued or not, being entered, with the years between which
observations have been obtained, and with observer's name, and height above
sea-level, any one, whether engineer, agriculturist, or physicist, can ascer-
tain with the greatest ease exactly what observations have hitherto been col-
lected. In order to facilitate reference, the stations are arranged alphabetically
in counties; and there are also provided general indexes of England and
i&Jttport British Asrocia&on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       i

Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. (2) Those who are willing to help on the
completion of the collection will see at once what I have, and what I have not
and thereby they will be saved much needless copying and I much corre-

spondence.

A barren index, however, throws little light on the history of rainfall-in-

vestigations. Before entering on this I desire to meet at the very outset an

objection sometimes raised, viz., that we cannot trust very old observations,

and therefore 1 may be busy collecting useless materials. I maintain that

we can trust them, and have the pleasure of knowing that my friend Mr.

Glaisher fully agrees with me on this point. I think them far more reliable

than many modern                                             ones                           for in  the 17th  and early part of  the  18th century,
                                                                                         ;

to measure the fall of rain was esteemed a serious undertaking, only to be

accomplished by first-class men. The repeated reference to the height of

their gauges, their diameter, and the number of pounds and ounces troy cor-

responding to an inch of rain over the area of the " tunnel " of their gauges,

and the details frequently given, combine to render it certain that they took

every reasonable precaution to secure accuracy. The results they obtained,

and which they would hardly credit, we of the 19th century know to be just

--what was due to the situation of the gauges. Another point to be remem-

bered is this : it is not intended to use any old observations in determinino- the
absolute mean fall at any place, or, in other words, in determining the 'geo-

graphical distribution of rain ; that will be done from recent observations with

tested instruments. The old observations will only be used for determining

the existence or otherwise of secular variation, and for that purpose an in-

accurate gauge would do as well as a perfect one.

   The earliest observations I have yet obtained are those of Mr. Townley, of
Townley in Lancashire, extending (with two intervals) from a.d. 1677' to

1705, or twenty-eight years. Mr. Townley believed his to.be the first made
in England
                                                          ;  I do not  feel sure            that they were    so.  The- only other observer in

the 17th century whose observations have yet been obtained was the Rev. W.
Derham, of Upminster, near Romford in Essex, who began in March 1696^
and has left a series of yearly totals (months also for some years) for nine-

teen years.

    The longest and most perfect record at present obtained was kept by
Thomas Barker, Esq., of Lyndon in Rutland; it extends from 1736 to 1794

or fifty-nine years. It is doubtful if so long a record will ever again be kept
by one person, with one gauge, and without interruption.

   Erom Table I. it will readily be seen how sudden and great has been the

increase of observers during the last thirty years, and especially durino- tho
last five, in which one finds the results of the recent grants of this Associa-

tion. From 1677 to 1800 the returns never number more than twenty-six
per annum, and averaged only four ; and in subsequent ten-yearly periods the
numbers average, up to 1810, 15 ; to 1820, 21 ; to 1830, 40 ; to 1840, 103
to 18o0, 1/8; to 1860, 366; and at the present time the returns number
rather more than a thousand. It is right to mention that no records have vet
been obtained for 1687 and 1688, 1694 to 1696, 1717 to 1721, 1724 and
1 / 25, since which time there is no year without one or more complete registers ·
that is to say, rain-records go back complete 140 years, and with intervals
about fatty years more, or nearly 200 years altogether.

196 REPORT 1865.

   The collection of these records has heen spasmodically attempted hy several
persons, Dr. Dalton being among the earliest and most successful : he, in the
year 1799, submitted to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society
by far the best paper on rainfall published until many years after. Still,
owing probably to the absence of postal and other means of communication,
his paper by no means included all that had been done up to the time of his

writing it.

   The following list (Table II.) of old stations prior to 1800, is not only
handy as such, but also available as a check on the completeness of Dr.

Dalton's search, and of my own. The result appears to be that the Doctor,
who undoubtedly took great pains with his Table, and most truly described it

as " the most complete hitherto published," had not half of the records then

existing, and which I and my friends have hunted up. On the other

hand the Doctor has one station, " Crawshawbooth near Haslingden," of
which I can get no information.

   After Dr. Dalton's collection in 1799 there was a long interval in which,
though observations were steadily continued, no one seems to have thought of

collecting and discussing them. Dr. Dalton's averages were (and, I am s^rry
 --198 report 1865.

 to say, are still sometimes) constantly quoted, and no notice was taken o
 subsequent observations. This is the more to be regretted since some of the
 gauges quoted by Dr. Dalton were on roofs, others on the ground, and no dis-
 tinction was made between them.

    I am not at present aware of any extensive collection between 1799 and
 1840, or thereabouts, when Mr. Joseph Atkinson, of Harraby near Carlisle,
 published a rain-map of the British Isles : to my great vexation I cannot ob-

 tain a copy ; and there is not one in the British Museum. It only gives the
 mean fall, and contains only two or three places besides those I possess ; but
 it is provoking that a copy of so recent a publication (1841 or 1842) cannot
 be obtained. During the last ten or twenty years several collections have
 been made, those of Mr. Glaisher for the British, and Dr. Stark for the Scot-

 tish, Meteorological Society having been published, with other meteorological
 details, quarterly by the Registrars-General of the respective countries. The
 prize offered by the Marquis of Tweeddale for an essay on rainfall, and
 awarded to Mr. Jamieson, of Ellon, led to the collection of the yearly fall at about

 twenty British stations, and the collection in Mr. Beardmore's splendid ' Ma-

nual of Hydrology' completes the list of my precursors. The two last ha^e

 been published since 1860, but it seems appropriate to notice them here
 the most copious of these Tables, however, did not contain a tenth of the ex-

 istent observations.

    It is a singular fact, that, with the exception of the last two works, no notice

has ever been taken of the position of the gauges, on which so much depends

 that a West-country roof record will often be less than an Eastern -counties
 ground-record ; that is to say, the difference due to elevation is often greater
by far than that due to a hundred miles geographical distance. Paramount
as is the importance of distinct information on this point, it is never referred

to in any of the old or many modern Tables.
   This omission naturally leads me to refer to the variation in the amount

collected according to the height at which the gauge is placed above the sur-
face of the ground. This was first noticed in 1705 ; and in 1 766 Dr. Heberden,
F.R.S., placed a gauge on the square tower of Westminster Abbey, another on
the roof of an adjacent house, and a third in a garden, and found the fall to be,

--garden, 22-61 ; roof, 18-14; abbey-tower, 12-10. These experiments were

promptly repeated at "Bath, Liverpool, Middlcwich, and elsewhere;" but I
have not been able to find any notice beyond the simple fact that " the results

were similar to those at Westminster." (This shows how much is either still

buried, or lost altogether.) Shortly after this, the Hon. Daines Barrington

--erected two gauges in the vicinity of Bala, in North Wales one at Eennig,

--and one on the summit of Bochyraidr (1700 feet?) and ascertained therefrom

that the decrease did not depend on actual elevation, but on the height

above the surface of the ground. This subject, I need hardly remind mem-

bers of this Association, was carefully investigated by our esteemed President,
Professor Phillips, when living at York in 1832; in fact it was one of the
first subjects this Association took in hand.

   The heavy fall of rain in mountainous districts was noticed at a very
early period ; but very little was done, until a comparatively recent date,
towards systematic observation and the determination of the laws governing
the distribution of rain in mountainous districts. Mr. Bateman's observa-
tions in the Derbyshire and Yorkshire hills, followed as they were by the
elaborate investigations carried on by the late Dr. Miller in the Lake-dis-
trict, have left for future examination only the subsidiary and minor vari-
ations to which the laws they deduced are liable.
ON THE RAINFALL OF THE BRITISH ISLES.  199

  --2. What has been done since 1860. Having thus described what had been

done previously to 1860, I proceed to mention briefly what has been done
since then ; and if it seems that this portion is egotistical, I reply I cannot
help it : it would be strange indeed if the one person who has devoted him-
self solely to the subject were not mixed up with most of its ramifications.

    In the first place, then, it has already been stated that prior to 1860
there had been no general collection of all reliable rainfall-records ; this
was the primary object I had in view, knowing that without such a col-
lection it was impossible to determine, with any approach to accuracy,

either the geographical distribution or secular variation of British rainfall.

To what an enormous magnitude this collection has grown may be inferred

from the Tables attached to this Report ; but as a ready means of enabling
engineers and others to estimate the stores awaiting them, I may say that,
supposing the lists closed at once, I believe the publication of the monthly
values and discussion of the observations would fill two of the bulky annual
volumes of this Association. Of course bulk is a poor test of value ; but I
wished to give some better description than that of " twenty-three folio
volumes of MS.," which are already full. I should not omit to state whence
these observations have been copied. Most of them have been obtained from

the observers, many of whom have sent me registers of ten, twenty, thirty,

and even more years in length ; some are from privately printed papers,
others from magazines, scientific journals, and Transactions of the Royal and

other Societies. Particulars as to the position of the gauge are always care-
fully noted along with the observations, when they can be obtained. I had
not been at this work very long before I felt the desirability of publishing
some information of a reliable character, and at the close of 1860 I published
a Table giving the total depth in that year at 168 stations, being more than
double the number ever previously collected ; this Table has grown into an
annual volume, both by giving additional information on the undermentioned
and other subsidiary investigations, and by its increased body of contributors,

now numbering over 1000.
    Next to compiling the general Tables and annual reports, the most trouble-

some, but probably also the most important, work is the examination of the
gauges actually in use, both as to their own accuracy and also as to the suita-
bility of their position. I need not point out how necessary this is ; it must
be evident to everybody that until it is done there will be liability to all sorts
of errors in deducing results from observations with gauges either themselves
incorrect, or badly placed. I do not wish to be discursive ; or I coidd quote
man}- positions in which I have found gauges, nothing less than absurd. (Very
gross errors are now impossible, owing to the number of new tested gauges
interspersed among the old ones and available as checks upon them.) This
examination of the gauges in situ involves an amount of travelling which takes

far too much time and too much money for me to make any very great progress

with it. However, I have visited 113 ; and if this Association will find the
needful funds, I will endeavour to double the number before I draw up the
next annual Report.

   Next to personally visiting each gauge, the best plan is to test the gauges
before the opticians send them off to their destinations. Of the exact number
thus tested I have no record, but believe it to be about 300, a number easily
mentioned, but by no means so easily examined.

   At the outset of the investigation an attempt was made to collect returns
of the number of rainy days or days of rain ; but it was speedily found that
utter want of uniformity prevailed, and that it was useless to attempt to do
--200 report 1865.

anything with them. After consulting the observers, each of whom was

asked to send in his or her definition of a rainy day, the plan I recommended

was to count as a day of rain every one on which O01 inch fell. How this

will work remains to be seen ; but it is certainly a step in the right direction

that is to say, towards uniformity.
   Another point noticed at an early period was the unequal geographical

distribution of the stations, some parts of the country being amply provided,
while in others the gauges were fifty or sixty miles apart. Thanks to the

,£55 granted by this Association, this state of things no longer exists ; how it

has been removed may be learnt from my previous Reports, or from the

accompanying Map. Of course there are still great inequalities, but they are
as nothing compared with what existed in 1859.

    It remains to notice the series of experimental gauges which have been
recently started to settle various disputed points. Reference has already been
made to the decreased amount of rain caught in gauges placed on high build-
ings, and to the experiments of Dr. Heberden and Professor Phillips on the

subject. On finding that (owing to the previous absence of any rainfall
centre, if I may so term myself) the gauges throughout the kingdom were

at all sorts of elevations, from 90 feet downwards, it was evident that
some means must be devised for correcting these observations and redu-

cing them to what they would be if made at one uniform level. Many of

the gauges being elevated on pillars or pedestals, it was urged, and with
apparent reason, that as all previous elevation experiments had been made
upon, and in the vicinity of, buildings, the laws of decrease deduced there-
from were not, or at any rate might not, be applicable to gauges mounted
as above described. In order to test this point, Colonel Ward, of Calne,
kindly undertook the cost and trouble of mounting a set of gauges on part
of his lawn, a description of which I read to this Section at the Newcastle
Meeting ; they are now eleven in number, and at heights varying from level
with the ground to 20 feet above it. In order to check the applicability of
the Cable results to other localities, a similar but less extensive set of gauges
lias been established near Manchester by the Rev. J. Chadwick Bates.

    It was rather singular that, although, as before stated, rainfall has been
 measured in this country nearly two hundred years, there had been prior to
 1860 no published experiments on a comprehensive scale to determine the
 best size and form of gauge. It would be inappropriate here to enlarge to
 any extent upon the various theories put forth upon the subject ; and I will
 only remark that the gauges principally issued by the Scottish Meteoro-
 logical Society are but 2 or 3 inches in diameter, while a high Scottish
 authority '·' has no faith " in anything less than a foot in diameter. Mr.

 Olaisher's gauges, everybody knows, are 8 inches in diameter, Luke How-
 ard's 5 inches, and the Royal Engineers' are 1 foot square. An exhaustive

 set of experiments have therefore been undertaken on this point also, by

--Col. Ward and Mr. Bates, the gauges varying from 1 inch to 2 feet in dia-

 meter square gauges, turf-gauges, snow-gauges, &c, being also tried. Col.

 Ward has altogether 29 gauges at work ; and Mr. Bates has, I believe, 13,

 beside the thermo-rain-gauge mentioned below.

     Reference was made in the earlier part of this Report to the peculiarly
 heavy rainfall in mountainous districts, which had been carefully observed in
 Cumberland during the years 1844 to 1853. It was felt that it would be

 very interesting to ascertain if similar physical configuration received similar

 fall in other parts of the country, and that the district round Snowdon

 appeared very suitable for the experiments. Favoured by the assistance of my

 friend Mr. Rogers Field, of Hampstead, and that of Captain Mathew, of Wern,

Carnarvon (who really did most of the work), we now have returns from more

than thirty tested gauges in that district, at elevations varying from 15 feet
to 1100 feet. Simultaneously with the establishment of these, the Cumber-

land gauges have been reestablished by Mr. Isaac Fletcher, F.ll.S. ; so that we
now have for the first time full records from both districts. At present

the Welsh records are far below the Cumberland ones ; whether this is due to
the fact that the wet places in Snowdonia have yet to be found, or whether

the deficiency is due to the Cumberland gauges lying near the track of the

--centres of British cyclones, or to some other cause, has yet to be determined.
   3. What remains to be done. On this point it is not so easy to speak

clearly and decisively as on the preceding ones, because every one knows

that just as an investigation progresses so do new branches claim attention.
Some of the leading items may, however, be easily specified. In the first

place, the collection of old observations must be rendered as complete as
possible, by diligent search at the British Museum, in the libraries of the
various scientific societies, and elsewhere. As an illustration of the meaning

of that simple word " elsewhere," I may mention that on the day I was

writing this Keport I received a note from the Secretary to the Board of
Northern Lights, respecting the rain-records kept at their lighthouses, with

copies of the current returns of which I have been favoured during the past

three years. From this note I find that the returns have been kept ever

since 1813, but that they have never been tabulated or discussed. As far as

I can at present tell, there seems to be about fifty years' records of twenty-

=five stations ( 1250 yearly records) to copy out. This T have ordered to be

done                        but of  course  the  expense will fall upon  me.                             This however, is, only
                         ;

quoted as a specimen of the work to be done in collecting. After it, will

come the discussion, which will also occupy a considerable time. The current

returns for each year have of course to be examined and prepared for publi-

cation at its close (this takes two persons six weeks). About 900 gauges

remain to be visited ; and this involves perhaps 10,000 miles' travelling, much

of which must be on foot, and all of which involves a heavy expenditure of

time and money. I need not dwell on the testing of new gauges, since the

Atime so occupied is comparatively trivial.                         more serious item will be the

analysis and discussion of the experimental-gauge records of Col. Ward and

Mr. Bates, and the mountain gauges of Mr. Fletcher and Capt. Mathew. I

have                        been  already much helped by volunteer  labour                               perhaps  some  careful

person, who does not mind voluminous work, will relieve me of one or other

of these discussions.

  --In drawing this section of my report to a close, I may just mention a few

other matters I have in hand : The construction of a cheap and accurate

gauge for ordinary use : the one here shown is the last improvement and

most compact I have seen ; and the maker, Mr. Apps, of 433, Strand, under-

takes to supply them at 10s. M. each ; so I hope no one will say they use a

home-made gauge because the opticians charge so much. Mr. Apps is also
making a self-recording gauge, to show the exact duration and intensity of
each shower. The Kev. J. Chadwick Bates has at Castleton Moor started a
thcrmo-rain-gauge for ascertaining the temperature of falling rain, on which
the variation according to elevation is supposed to depend. Then I have on
hand some experiments suggested by Mr. Smith, of Jersey, for measuring, by

nitrate of silver, the percentage of sea spray mingled with rain-water at
West-country stations.

   I close this programme of work to be done, trusting that I have shown
that far more remains to be done than I have yet accomplished, and that, if

I am only efficiently supported, important points may be cleared up. Into

financial matters I believe I must not enter ; but there can be no harm in
stating that by what has been done I have lost over ,£300, and a lucrative
post ; and inasmuch as it is impossible for me to continue under such con-

ditions, the " work to be done " will not become " work done" unless I am

protected from further loss. The Royal Society have recently granted £50

towards the general expenses of the investigations ; the observers naturally
think that by observing they do their share, at the same time they have

subscribed about £150 ; but the total of £200 by no means meets the outlay
of so extensive a work as mine.

temporary investigation. I wish to emphasize that word temporary very

strongly, because one can never be sure that a partial investigation, based

on a few records, yields the same result as if all were combined, as I hope

eventually to have them, when, instead of discussing the variation in half a

century, we may hope to discuss the records of two centuries.

So much interest is now taken, both in and out of Parliament, in questions

of drainage, water-supply, and the condition of our rivers, and I am so con-

stantly urged to give some information on the point, that 1 rather feel as if

I was acting the part of the dog in the manger, in gathering volume after

Myvolume of rainfall-observations and yet deducing no results.        objection

has been, that though much has been collected, as much (or more) remains

to be done, and I have a great horror of incomplete work ; but not having

hitherto had the least assistance, and seeing no prospect of getting any except

the column, whether black or shaded, the difference being only made to show prominently

by paying clerks' salaries out of my own pocket, it will be some years before

the inquiry can be completed. Under these circumstances, it seemed un-

reasonable to persist in my refusal of an interim investigation, and I have

therefore drawn up the following statement.

  My object has been to determine (1) whether the decreased annual fall of

rain which has been observed at Greenwich is a local variation, or whether

it prevails  generally  throughout  the  country                                    (2) (having  ascertained that
                                                                                 ;

the present, temporary investigation shows it to be general) to ascertain in

what districts the decrease is most marked.

Unfortunately there are very few continuous records extending back

Amore than about thirty years.      few, however, are available and, having

carefully interpolated for one or two missing years, I have been able to form

--the following Table from the mean of ten widely separated stations one in

each of the following counties : Devon, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey, Essex,

Lincoln, Lancashire, York, Edinburgh, and Argyll.

It may be well to add that on carrying the examination back to 1800, the

fall seems to have been less than it was about 1815, when the following more

reliable Table commences.
204 report-- 1865.

   From these Tables we find that when, as in this case, local irregularities are

neutralized by the combination of observations from a large tract of country,

rainfall- records evince a regularity not before expected, the main and marked

feature being the drought in the years 1854 to 1858 ; omit these five years,

and the records run in five-year means without a single departure of an inch

from the average.                         But it  will  not  do  thus  to  omit  them                          they were excep-
                                                                                                            ;

tional, but are part and parcel of the whole, and must by no means be sepa-

rated, but the whole carefully examined. For several reasons it seems better

to take the ten-year means ; and from them we find that the annual fall in

each ten years from 1815 to 1854 was nearly equal, and always greater than

in the last ten years, 1855 to 1864, and, moreover, that the ten years 1845

to 1854 had a rainfall (28-61) nearly identical with the mean (28-60) of the

preceding thirty years, 1815 to 1844. Hence it is evident that at any

stations where observations have been made continuously from 1845 to 1864,
we may take the ten years 1845 to 1854 as representing the forty years,

1815 to 1854, and the difference between the first and last ten years as

representing approximately the decrease of rainfall at that place.

The results of this investigation are condensed in a Table, and laid

down on a map* (not printed), which shows the percentage by which the

=rainfall in the last ten years fell short of the mean of the previous ten ( 40)

years, the numbers being enclosed by a ring in those few cases where the fall

in the last ten exceeded the previous ten. It will, I trust, be evident to all,
that though there are some stations which yield discordant results, yet the

general harmony is quite equal to what could be expected of a preliminary

investigation. Still the results are only those of a partial examination of the

question, and of course may be proved fallacious by observations subse-

quently received. The leading features at present seem to be (1) a decrease
averaging 4 per cent, over the whole British Isles, but unequally distributed,

the decrease being exchanged for an increase in parts of Ireland and the
south of Scotland. (2) In England, although the amount of decrease varies

up to 18 per cent., it never falls below an excess (if the expression may be

allowed) of 2 per cent. (3) Although at first the figures seemed very dis-

cordant, yet on drawing the lines shown on the map referred to, someorder
seems to become evident, viz. that the maximum deficiency has existed along a

line running nearly S.W.-N.E. from Cornwall to the Wash. Proceeding north-
westward, the deficiency becomes less, until the parallel line running through
the centre of Ireland, and passing into the North Sea at Edinburgh, marks a
district in which no deficiency has existed, but, on the contrary, an excess of
nearly 10 per cent. The next districts follow nearer to each other, and seem
to involve the eventual adoption of W.-E. instead of S.W.-N.E.: possibly this

is not really the case, but due to errors of observation at the lighthouses,
whence most of the values herein assigned for Scotland are derived ; or it

may arise from the modifying influence of Ireland not being felt in those

higher latitudes. I might further point out that the deficiency seems in
some degree connected with the large drainage operations in the midland and

eastern counties of England; but until, either by my own efforts, or the

assistance of this Association, the observations are rendered more complete,

it is not safe to attempt to determine the causes of the recent fluctuations.

The next point (and one on which I reserve full particulars for the next

Report, so that 1864 and 1865 may be considered together) is the rainfall of

1864, which, as everybody knows, was far below the average in most parts of

England                                   and in the eastern counties scarcely half the usual quantity of rain
                                       ;

fell ; in Cornwall also, and in Devon, where ordinarily water in abundance
runs to waste, great inconvenience and loss arose from its deficiency. The
most singular case was that of the Pentland Hills and the south-east of Scot-
land generally, where the drought was equally severe, but in less than a
week the rivers rose from almost the lowest point previously known, to a

higher level than had been known for eighteen years. The Edinburgh
Water- works reservoirs had been so empty that the city was put on short
supply ; the floods of October 22-24 came and almost filled them ; the rivers
rose, and carried away farm-produce, buildings and bridges ; and the rain-
returns for that district eventually show a yearly total nearly as much above-

the average as our English returns are below it.

     Explanation of Arrangement ami Symbols used in the following List.

The stations are classed primarily into countries, secondarily into counties

(which are in alphabetical order) ; and in each county the stations are ar-

ranged alphabetically under their own name, if a well-known one, as " Want-

age ;" if the place is not one generally known, they are placed under that

Hof the nearest well-known name : for example, " Tiverton (Hayne)," ayne

being the absolute place of observation, and being near to Tiverton. When

a station is on the edge of a county, and the most prominent adjacent town

is in the next county, the station is classed under its own name, and that of

the  town  is                              in  brackets                                              thus,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         " Stotfold [Baldock]."

Mr. Symons before it was used ; a dagger (f), that it has been visited, tested,

supplied out of the grants made by the British Association. The column
headed " Observer" is added principally as a means of identifying the returns
when there are two or more in the same place. The column headed
" Period" states the years of which the monthly fall has been collected; the

           ON THE STRENGTH OF MATERIALS FOR IRON SHIPS.  213

On the Strength of Materials considered in relation to the Construction
   of Iron Ships. By William Fairbairn, LL.D., F.R.S., fyc, and
   Thomas Tate, Esq.*.

V. In the following investigation it will be assumed that, under the action of
equal forces, the extension of the fibres of a beam will be equal in amount to
their compression, and that the amount of the extension or compression, as

the case may be, is proportional to the magnitude of the force producing it

and in order to render this hypothesis more fully in accordance with the fact
that the ultimate resistances of the two forces of compression and extension
in a beam are in almost all cases different, it will be further assumed that the
material reaches its ultimate limit of resistance to the one force before it

reaches its ultimate limit of resistance to the other force.

           Section I.

On tlie Qualities of Iron hesl adapted for Iron Ships, especially Ships of War.

2. The work expended in the elongation or compression of a bar is equal

to one-half the force multiplied hy the corresponding elongation. Moreover,

for bars of the same material, the work varies as the solid content of the bar

that is,

           U=mKL,                                        (1)

K=where TJ-- the work of elongation,  the section of the bar in square

L=inches,  its length in feet, and u a constant for each class of material,

being the work done upon a bar .1 foot long and 1 square inch in section.

Hence

           u= mriKV                                      (2)

which determines the value of u from experimental data for different kinds
of material, where P is the strain in lbs., and I is the extension of the bar

corresponding to this strain.

   3. The value of u, determined for different kinds of material, gives us a
comparative measure of their powers of resistance to a strain of the nature of

impact, or of dynamic effect; hence the coefficient u may be called the

modulus of dynamic resistance, or, as Tredgold named it, the modulus of resi-
lience. It is presumed that the best kind of iron for resisting the impact of
shot or shell is that whose modulus of dynamic effect is greatest.

   4. The values of u, determined by Mr. Fairbairn's experiments for different
plates or bars of iron, show that the dynamic resistance of thick plates to
rupture is about twice and a half that of thin ones, that the resistance of

thick steel plates is about one-tenth greater than that of the Low Moor iron

plates A, and that the resistance of these latter plates is one-half greater than
that of the rolled plates D.

   5. Similarly the work expended in the deflection of a bar supported at its
extremities, by a force applied at its centre, is equal to one-half the pressure

multiplied by the corresponding deflection ; and, moreover, we also have

           U=mKL,                                        (3)

where u, the modulus of dynamic resistance, being constant for the same kind
of material, gives us a comparative measure of the resistance of different kinds
of material to a force of impact tending to produce transverse rupture.

  -- --* In this inquiry Mr. Tate has deduced useful formulae from Mr. Fairbairn's experi-

ments independent of other researches on the strength of iron ships.

                                                                                    s2

           Transverse Strains produced on a Ship under various conditions.

6. The value of M, or the strain tending to rupture a beam, depends on

the magnitude and the relative position of the pressures applied to the beam.

  When the pressure "W is applied at the middle of the beam A B, supported

at its extremities (fig. 1), the pressure                                                                                p- -i

Now this will become a maximum when AQ=AC; that is, the greatest

strain will take place at the centre of the beam, or at the point where the

weight is applied.

that is, the moment tending to rupture the beam at the centre is equal to the
load on one half of the ship multiplied by the distance of its centre of gravity

from the extremity.

   12. Now let us suppose that the ship is balanced upon its centre C (see

fig. 4) ; then, in this case, the greatest strain will obviously be at the point

of support C ; hence we have

Comparing this expression with equation (9), it will be observed that as the

    VTJien the depth and the amount of material in the transverse section are

given, to determine the distribution of the material so that the beam may have

the greatest strength.

   23. The first and most important condition of maximum strength is, that

the material should be accumulated, as far as practicable, at the upper and

lower edges of the beam.
    In tubular girders, where the material is accumulated at the upper and

lower edges of the girder, the sectional areas at these parts should be in the
inverse ratio of the ultimate resistances of the material in these parts re-»

 spectively.
          ON THE STRENGTH OF MATERIALS FOR IRON SHIPS.                                   255

The results of experiments closely confirm the truth of this deduction. In

wrought-iron girders, for example, the bottom section is about fths of the

top section ; and in cast-iron beams the section of the bottom flange is about

6| times that of the top flange, -which is approximately, in the case of cast
iron, the ratio of the resistance of compression to that of extension.

   The next condition of maximum strength determines generally the relative

amount of the material on each side of the neutral axis. The principle
upon which this distribution of material depends is this : when the material

at the upper edge of the beam is upon the point of yielding by compression,

the material at the lower edge must at the same time be upon the point of

yielding by extension ; hence

the upper deck (art. 22) so as to have a maximum strength with a given

amount of material.

The strains on a ship afloat are somewhat different from the strains on an

ordinary fixed girder ; for it is found that the upper part of the transverse

section of a ship when afloat is sometimes subjected to compression and at

other times to that of extension. But of these two strains the former is

generally the more violent. It will therefore be expedient, in calculating the

distribution of the material in the section of an iron ship, to regard the upper

portion of the section as that which is subjected to extension ; and therefore

in this case we should have

                               A= --T'

Substituting these values      equation (1), we find av or the area of the

upper deck, to exceed 300 square inches. Now in this iron ship the equivalent

area of the upper deck is only about 230 square inches ; hence it appears

that this portion of the ship should be about one-half stronger than it is, in

order to have a proper distribution of the material.

   It may not be practicable in all cases to construct iron ships with such a

large section of iron at the upper deck yet such should be the distribution of
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the material in the section in order to secure a maximum of strength with a

given amount of material.
   In the distribution of the material there is another consideration of some

importance ; and that is, that all bodies in the form of beams, whether hollow
or solid, follow the same law as regards a transverse strain, viz. that in a beam
uniformly loaded the strains are always greatest in the middle and progres-
sively diminish to the points of support at either end. These facts arc self-
evident, and show in the case of an iron ship that the same thickness of plates is

not required when working from the centre at midships to the stem and

stern. In fact, they should taper or be reduced in thickness according to
a certain ratio of their distances from the centre till they reach the extremes

at each end. Theoretically this is true ; but in practice we have to consider
how much the thickness can be reduced without danger to the structure, and
in general we may here observe that the reduction should not exceed one-third
between the centres and the two extremes. Or, in other words, if we assume

the strakes or sheathing plates of the bottom and round the bilge to the height
of the interior floor, or one-fifth of the depth, to be seven-eighths of an inch,

it then follows that their thicknesses may be safely and progressively reduced
to five-eighths thick towards the bow and stem. The same reduction to
five-eighths may be made from that point, one-fifth of the depth, to the
neutral axis of transverse strains, or about halfway up the ship's side, when

they shoidd again increase to seven-eighths thick for the top strakes at the
deck, on each side, where they have to perform the office of stringers and
columns under the action of the two forces of tension and compression.

   From these remarks it is obvious that a careful distribution of the material
is a consideration of great importance in ship-building ; and although it may
be necessary in some constructions to deviate somewhat from the absolute

rule, yet it is nevertheless essential that the law of strains should be carefully
observed, and weak parts sufficiently guarded against.

On the Penetration of Iron Armour-Plates by flat-faced tempered Steel Shot.

    25. The experiments conducted at Shoeburyness seem to warrant the con-
clusion that, in firing at strong armour-plates with cast or wrought-iron shot,
about one-half of the effect is lost in distorting or in breaking up the shot
itself, and, further, that with steel shot of tough temper nearly the whole
of the work stored in it is expended upon the plate.

    Mr. Fairbairn's experiments on punching led to the following general laws
relative to the resistance of iron plates to a force tending to rupture them :

    The diameter of the punch being constant, the pressure requisite to pro-

duce rupture varies, approximately, as the thickness of the plate.
    "When the thickness of the plate is constant, the pressure requisite to pro-

 duce rupture varies, approximately, as the diameter of the punch.
    And, generally, the pressure requisite to produce rupture varies as the

thickness of the plate multiplied by the diameter of the punch, or, what
 amounts to the same thing, as the area of the shearing surface abraded in
the process of punching ; that is,

                                                                  Vttrt,

where P is the ultimate pressure in lbs., (the thickness of the plate in inches,

 and r the radius of the end of the punch.

Now the work TJ expended in the penetration of a plate by a force vary-

ing as the depth of penetration is expressed by the formula

                         U=!Px TV;                                     (1)

where the work requisite to penetrate a plate varies as the square of its thickness

nmltiplied by the radius of the shot.

Substituting the value of the constant C, deduced from the experiments

with ordnance, we get

                                       U=24400jA                       (2)

   Hence we have for the depth of penetration by a shot with a given weight,

size, and velocity,

                       -v;24400?                                       (3)

   From this formula it follows that a 100 lb. steel shot of tough temper, 6

inches diameter, with the velocity of 1200 feet per second, will completely
perforate an armour-plate 5 inches in thickness. This result is fairly borne
out by the results of experiments with ordnance.

   If 3f inches be taken as the average radius of a shot, then formula. (3)

which may be regarded as a rough approximation of the damaging effect of

shot not differing widely from this dimension.

       --Maltese Caves. Report on Mnaidra Cave.

       By A. Leith Adams, M.A., M.B., F.G.S.

1. The strata composing the Maltese Islands belong to an early Miocene

period ; and attain a maximum height of about 720 feet above the sea-level.

They consist, from above downwards, of the Upper Limestone, underlaid by

beds of Sand, Marl, Calcareous Sandstone, and last of all, a rather compact

and durable rock called the Lower Limestone. The latter attains its greatest

height on the south and south-west coasts, reaching an elevation of 300 feet

above the sea-level. Several cliffs of this bed contain natural caves, one of

which, the subject of this Report, was discovered by me in 1863.

2. The Maltese strata are all more or less displaced by faults, whilst their

exposed surfaces well attest the denuding effects of bygone atmospheric and

aqueous agencies. This is very apparent in many situations ; indeed the

generally bare aspect of the islands, and the accumulations of soil and frag-

ments of rocks in the fissures and hollows, together with depressions existing

here and there, fully testify to the great changes which the area underwent

during and subsequently to the period or periods when the remains of its post-

tertiary fauna were being buried in those situations.

 --3. The alluvial deposits of the Maltese Islands consist 1st, of a calcareous

red clay, containing peroxide of iron, and similar to that of many of the other

islands and along the shores of the Mediterranean ; and 2ndly, a blue marl,

which is obtained from the degradation of the bed of that name, found in situ

1865.                                                               t
--258 report 1865.

in the higher parts of the islands. Intermediate varieties of both, consequent
on the destruction of the rock formations, are also common, but it is in the
deposits of one or other of the first two sorts that the remains of the extinct
fossil fauna are usually found. These are generally intermixed with angular
or rounded fragments of the rocks, forming compact breccias or conglome-
rates, which in the caves are often covered up by stalagmitic infiltrations and
red earth ; again, in fissures and hollows, large and loose accumulations of
red soil, stones, and animal remains, huddled together in great disorder, display
states of arrangement clearly referable to aqueous agency, and that of no

common order and intensity.
   4. Turning to the caverns, many may be said to be merely water-worn rents

or fissures hollowed out at some period anterior to the introduction of the

deposits and organic remains ; for in many I have examined there existed
communications with the surface by means of either perpendicular or lateral

rents, through which their contents might have been introduced, or at least
water in sufficient quantity to have rearranged any remains that were lying
on the floors of the caves.

   5. The subject of this Report I have named Mnaidra Cave*, after a re-
markable ruin of that name in the immediate vicinity (supposed to have been
constructed by the Phoenicians), and also to distinguish it from two other
caves close by, one of which, viz. the "Middle Cave," is situated on a terrace-
cliff within a few yards of the last and about 12 feet below it, whereas the
third, called the " Hippopotamus" " or Malak Cave," opens on the same ter-
race cliff with the " Middle Cave," and is 200 feet distant from the Mnaidra
Cave. The latter stands on the edge of "a steep declivity overlooking the sea
and above-mentioned terrace cliff, and is about 300 feet above the level of the

former. Perhaps none of these caves maintain their original dimensions ; for
although at the time of their discovery each opened independently of the
other, I have since been enabled, in the cases of both the " Malak " and
" Middle Cave," to trace their lower deposits outwards from their entrances
to the edge of the cliff, a distance of from 60 to 70 feet. It will be under-
stood, therefore, that all these caves were situated close together on the side
of a limestone cliff which faces the sea on the south-west coast of the island

of Malta.

   6. Nowhere in any of the islands forming the Maltese group is there a bet-
ter illustration of the disturbances that have brought about the present insular

condition of this area than at the point (represented in Plate II.) ; for along
the base of the cliff there runs a fault by which the Upper Limestone of the

series had been let down several hundred feet, and is now submerged, except-

ing a narrow belt that fringes the coast and spreads out into a stony flat west-
wards, whilst three miles out at sea the islet of Filfla forms its " outlier."

On the surface of the depressed fragment, and washed by the waves, are

masses of alluvial deposit and breccia formed of red earth, angular and par-
tially rounded stones, of not only the parent rock, but also the Calcareous
Sandstone and Lower Limestone, besides small portions of a black limestone
rock, nowhere found in situ in the islands. These superficial deposits run up
the incline towards the " fine of fault," and are to all appearance the " talus "

or washings of the slope above the caves. From among this mass of breccia

and loose red earth and stones, my learned friend Dr. Errington, Archbishop of
Trebizond, assisted me in removing the upper jaw and teeth of the " Pigmy

    * 'Mnaidra' in Arabic means a "sheepfold," from the fancied resemblance this mega-
lithic circle presents to a " sheep or cattle pen."
MALTESE CAVES.  259

Elephant" (Elephas melitensis), which were found jammed between large

blocks of limestone ; their chipped and fractured condition, together with that
of subsequent teeth and bones found in the same situation, clearly testify to
the rough usage they had sustained from having been rolled along with stones
and earth. The point therefore where the above remains were discovered
was almost directly below the caves, and within a few feet of the sea-
level. It is apparent, moreover, that the remains were deposited at a time

when the depression was either taking place, or at least when it was below
the level of the caves, else how could the fragments of the Lower Limestone
have found their way into the deposit, seeing that the caves are situated at
or about the uppermost limit of the Lower Limestone bed ?

    7. Before proceeding to give an account of the deposits of the Mnaidra

Cave, it appears to me requisite that I should describe the chief particulars in

connexion with the contents of the two other caves in its immediate vicinity,

in order that the members of the Association may fully realize all the pheno-
mena presented by the former. This I shall now do as briefly as possible.

   8. The Malak Cave was discovered in 1858, but its outlet was destroyed
and deposits disturbed, and the greater portion of them removed before any

geologist examined it. The quarrymen who found it stated to me that it

formed a simple excavation of an oval shape, and had a small opening looking
on the afore-mentioned terrace-cliff. Its roof was seemingly entire (but that

has not been proved). On its floor there was a hard conglomerate formed of

light blue and red clays, intermixed with very rounded and water-worn stones,

belonging to the parent rock only. Throughout this deposit, in great disorder,
were strewn teeth and bones of two species of Hippopotamus, together with a
few bones of large birds. One solitary lower molar of the Pigmy Elephant

was found by me among the debris. It was very much worn, and adhered

to the rounded pebble with which it had doubtless been rolled. This is the

only instance I know where the Pigmy Elephant's remains have been found
in connexion with the Hippopotamus. Not allowing for wrhat had been re-
moved by visitors and lost or destroyed, I counted the straight tusks of no
less than thirty Hippopotami among the debris and in public and private
collections, all I may add, procured from a deposit not exceeding a few yards in
circumference, and certainly not more than three feet in thickness. No traces
of gnawing were noticed on any of the remains I have examined, but many
teeth and bones bore signal marks of having been much rolled. I may here
state that in another deposit of Hippopotamus remains, found many years since

at the entrance of the Melleha Valley, at the N.E. side of Malta (possibly
also in a cave), they presented the exact appearances disclosed by those from
Malak (t\ e. both as to the nature of the deposit and condition of the remains).

Upon the top of the Hippopotamus remains of the Malak was a stalagmite
sparsely mixed with red and blue clays, where abundant remains of the
Gigantic Dormouse (JMyoocus melitensis) had been gradually introduced during
the period that the cave was also being filled by calcareous drippings and soil.
The bones of this rodent were also much broken and mixed in great disorder;

teeth and jaws predominating, and just as I have seen the bones and teeth of
the Egyptian Jerboa strewing the bottoms of caves in that country, after

having been ejected in pellets from the craw of the Horned Owl (Stria: asca-
laphus). So much for the Malak Cave, which, as regards the order and nature

of its organic remains and deposits on its floor, differed entirely from the
Middle and Mnaidra Caves.

    9. The deposits of the Middle and also the Mnaidra Cave were very simi-

lar. On their floors at the entrances were found the usual white calcareous

                                                                               x2

dripping with a black seam on its top, resembling coffee-grounds, and pos-
sibly chiefly consisting of the droppings of Bats. Over this deposit there lay
three feet of a reddish black loam, much hardened here and there by stalag-
mitic infiltrations ; and over this a seam of yellow earth, from half an inch
to three inches in thickness, preceded* by a bed of a brick-red clay, averaging
from 3 to 4 feet, and also interspersed with shelves and hardened masses of

dripping.

    So far, as regards Mnaidra Cave, not a trace of organic remains was visible ;
and, excepting in the Middle Cave, two teeth (much worn) of the Miocene
Shark (Careharodon megalodon) (a fossil found in the calcareous sandstone
overlying that in which* the cave existed, and possibly washed out of it), also
in the brick-red clay a jaw of Armenia, closely allied, if not identical with,
A. pratmsis, and frog's bones, both caves seem so far to have been filled up
at the same time, and subjected to exactly the same influences. The Middle
Cave continued to receive red earth slowly until within 6 feet of its roof,
where a shelf of stalactite, containing abundance of recent land shells, bones,
and teeth of the Gigantic Dormouse, marked a period of prolonged tranquillity,
 which was again broken by an influx of red earth to within 3 feet of the
 roof, when the stalagmite filled it up. There was no appearance of fissure on
the roof of this cave, but it had many lateral rents ; I did not, however, pene-
 trate beyond a few yards on account of the great difficulty in working the
 deposits ; I could see, however, that at no period in the history of the filling
 up of this cave was there any evidence of a large body of water having

 passed down it.
    Turning back to Mnaidra Cave, it was now very clear that a decided

 change had taken place in the mode and nature of its deposits ; for on the
 afore-mentioned shelf of stalagmite, and about halfway up, were rounded
 water- worn pebbles, interspersed among the red earth and calcareous infil-
 trations. Here were found many fragments and a few entire teeth of the
 Elephant, together with abundant remains of birds' bones of large dimen-
 sions, and teeth and bones of Myoscus melitensis. As the adit was being
 pushed inwards the fossiliferous deposit increased from 4 to 6 feet in thick-
 ness, and ran along the eastern wall, where it changed to a blue and red clay
 in nodides, whilst here and there depended masses of stalactite and dripping,
 in which were also found many Elephant's teeth and bones, associated with
 land snails of such species as Helix aspersa, H. candidissima, H. vermimlata,
 H. aperta, Bulimus decollatus, Clausilia syracusana, &c. As the tunnelling
 proceeded inwards another yellow seam began to appear about 4 feet from
  the bottom of the fossiliferous stratum, and to increase in depth until at the
  distance of from about 45 feet from the entrance it suddenly deepened and
  ran towards a depression on each side, and near the roof of the cave, where
  it measured 4^ feet in thickness. It was composed entirely of the same
  ochre-yellow earth as the underlying stratum before mentioned, and like it
  was totally devoid of organic remains ; moreover, from the manner in which it
  rose towards the opening on the side, there can be little doubt that it had

  been either partially or wholly introduced into the cave through the above

  epening. Although no alluvial deposit of the same description now exists

  in the surrounding area, there is every likelihood that it was obtained from the
  breaking up of the yellow variety of the calcareous sandstone, which has been
  entirely denuded from the surfaces around the cave, and for a little distance

  inland. On this yellow band lay another black seam, which thinned out on

elevated parts of the floor, but was several inches in thickness in the hollows.
Large pillars of stalactite depended from the roof, and one central mass at
the furthest limits of the adit, with its lower end resting on the black seam,

seemed to divide the cave into two parts. On the eastern side of this pillar

there was a deposit of black earth lying on the seam, through which ran a
stratum of organic remains fully a foot in depth, rising upward towards the
above-mentioned gap on the side of the cave near the roof. In this corner,
and on a surface not 2 feet square, lay the left ramus of the lower jaw and
tooth of a young Pigmy Elephant with several detached teeth, one cervical
and six dorsal vertebrae of the animal, besides bats' bones, and bones and
skulls of large water birds, and a vast assemblage of the remains of the Dor-
mouse, together with very perfect specimens of land shells, all huddled toge-
ther among minute fragments and splinters of bones. Poth the deposit and
organic remains in this side of the cave showed clearly that they had been en-
veloped by the slow introduction of the black loam, which was soon hardened
by calcareous drippings, in fact that the pillar of stalactite here divided the

cave into a wet and dry side (Plate III. fig. 4). On the western or wet side

of the pillar very different causes had evidently been at work. The soil there
was loose and mixed with the rounded pebbles of calcareous sandstone, only
the latter were larger than any I had met with before, but like them they

were nearly all hardened by calcareous infiltrations. Among the stones and

clay numerous teeth and fragments of tusks and heads of bones of the Ele-
phant were found. The organic remains seemed most abundant near the
bottom of this fossiliferous deposit, which varied from 6 to 7 feet in thick-
ness, and from 5 to 6 feet in breadth ; but fragments of bones and plaits of
teeth were met with even on the upper limits of the stratum close to the
stalactite of the roof, which was upwards of 3 feet in thickness.

   Such was the sequence of the various deposits in the Mnaidra Cave from

below upwards, and for the distance of 54 feet inwards to the limits of my

excavations ; and how much further remains to be seen, as from the great

heat of the weather and the Association's grant being expended, I have
been obliged to defer any further researches until the return of the cold

months, when I propose tracing the fossiliferous stratum to its limits. The
Mnaidra Cave at its entrance measured 22 feet in height, and about 11 feet
in breadth, when it gradually expanded and contracted, expanding a second
time at the termination of the excavation, where its height was about the
same as at the entrance, and breadth fully 13 feet. The sides of the cave
were smooth, excepting where horizontal fissures formed gaping rents, into
which the fossiliferous deposits had been washed, and much water and the
finer portion of the clay introduced. The entire roof of this cave had evi-
dently been cleared away from the entrance to the limits of the explorations,
leaving merely the stalactite, and here and there a portion of the parent

rock, the interstices being filled with soil drifted from the slope above,
and composed of red earth and disintegrated fragments of the rock surfaces
around. In this deposit I found remains of the great Dormouse, which I had
previously met with in the stalactite on the roofs of other caves and superfi-
cial deposits in other situations in the island, all leading towards the belief

that the above-named rodent may have lived on the area up to comparatively

modern times.
    10. With reference to the organic remains in this cave, it will readily be

surmised, from what has been already stated, that the most prominent be-
longed to Elephas melitensis and Myoxus melitensis, just as the Hippopotamus
262 report--1865.

and the latter predominated in the neighbouring cave, with this exception, that
in no instance were the remains of the rodent found in connexion with the
Hippopotamus, whereas they were always intimately associated with bones
and teeth of the Proboscidian, and not only in this cave, but in several other

localities in the island.

   11. Of tbe teeth of the Pigmy Elephant, either entire or in fragments, and
guessing what were destroyed by the workmen to be equal to one half, I
surmise that the remains of upwards of fifty old and young Elephants were
brought to light during the late excavations in Mnaidra Cave. They include

individuals of all ages, from the calf to the adult. Many teeth were in
good states of preservation, others were much decayed and broken, especially

the " true molars." The large bones were nearly all reduced to fragments

but vertebra? and feet bones were usually entire. Many articulating sur-

faces of bones had their outer tables removed, and were firmly encrusted
with stalactite, especially the specimens lying on a black seam and among
the rounded freestones. It was clear, however, that they could not have
been conveyed for any very long distance, as will appear from the specimens
I have forwarded for the inspection of the members of the Association.

Among the remains were found certain foot bones not referable, apparently,

to this species, and at present undetermined ; these I forwarded in another

collection, now, I believe, in Mr. Busk's charge*.
    12. The remains next in the order of frequency, and even, perhaps, more

abundant than the last, were those of the Gigantic Dormouse (Myoxus Meli-
tensis). The number of bones of this rodent brought to light during our ex-
cavations was almost beyond conception. They embraced all ages, and were
strewn about in great disorder, but were far more entire than any of the others,
or than those I have referred to in connexion with the Malak Cave ; so much
was this the case that I had seldom much difficulty in removing the greater

part of skeletons, which enabled me to determine the relative dimensions of

the animal with accuracy. Eor example, the total length of the skull, taken
from many specimens, averaged in the adult from 2 - 3 to 2-5 inches ; length
of the humerus 1-6 inches; length of femur 2-2. The hind foot from the
extremity of the calcaneum to the tip of the last phalanx of the middle toe

measured 0-7 inch.
    13. The avifauna of this cave embraced numerous remains of birds of

various species, differing considerably in dimensions. Some of very large size
were evidently water-birds. The collection I have forwarded for studyf.

    14. The Mollusca include the majority of the land-shells at present met
with in the islands. The following have been identified by the late lamented

Mr. S. P. Woodward :--

Helix aspersa.        Helix striata.
    ,, vermiculata.
                      Pmlimus acutus.
    ,, candidissima.
                      Cyclostoma       ?
   ,, aperta.
                      Clausilia syracusana.

   The shells were found in such excellent states of preservation in the " Mid-
dle Cave," and with the rodent's remains in the " Malak," also with the jaw

   * [So far as I have been able to determine these bones, they all appear to belong to one

  f [These bones have been subjected to the inspection of Mr. W. E. Parker, who has

and bones of the Elephant in the corner east of the pillar of stalactite in
" Mnaidra Cave," as to lead to a belief that they had crawled in and had

been enveloped during the gradual filling up of the caves.

15. From the evidences here adduced and other proofs too lengthy in

detail for this Report, it would appear that the lowermost deposits and organic

remains of the Malak Cave were not deposited at exactly the same time

with those of the other two in the vicinity. Its clayey bottom and conglo-

merate, formed solely of water-worn portions of the parent rock, seemed

to indicate that the cave had at one time opened on the side of a river or lake,

which occasionally washed its floor, whereas the lower deposits of both the

Middle and Mnaidra caves show clearly that they were gradually filled by red

earth and dripping from the roofs and sides, until some change in the phy-

sical condition of the surrounding area caused the roof of the Mnaidra Cave

to be in great part removed, when bodies of water either swept the organic

remains into the cave, and beyond it into the breccias and deposits, forming

below on the sinking portion, or else disturbed and rearranged whatever

remains may have been lying on the floor of the cave on the western side of

the pillar of stalactite, leaving the remains on the east side unaffected. This,

however, will become more evident when the fossiliferous deposit has

been worked out, which I am of opinion ought to be done, not only with

the view of ascertaining that point, but in hopes of finding new forms, and

especially remains of the carnivorous quadrupeds which undoubtedly roamed

over the area at the same period with the River-horse and Elephant, as the

bones found by Captain Spratt and others in the cave of Zebbug clearly

show. Every relic, of course, with reference to this point must be in-

teresting                                        I therefore take  the liberty of forwarding  the  lower jaw, femur,
                                              ;

and tibia, appearing to belong to the " Common Weasel " (Mustela vulgaris),

removed by me from a mass of clay that had been excavated from the deposit

on the floor of the Zebbug Cave, where abundant remains of Elephas meli-

tensis, &c, were discovered by Captain Spratt in 1859. It is the same

locality described by that gentleman and the late Dr. Falconer at the Cam-

bridge Meeting of the British Association in 1862.

16. Taking into consideration all the facts and probabilities furnished by

careful examination of the Maltese caves, fissures and alluvial deposits, and

the physical aspects of the various localities, I think there can be little doubt

that at a late geological epoch in the history of the Maltese islands large

bodies of water flowed over, at least, the greater part of the island of Malta,

washing whatever soil or organic remains then happened to be lying on the

surface into gaps, hollows, and depressions. No sea-shells have hitherto been

met with in the soils and superficial deposits to indicate that the islands had

been submerged and reelevated ; on the contrary, from all appearances the

last movement to which these islands were subject was a downward one.
Unless, therefore, we suppose the giving way of lake barriers, divergence of

rivers or streams, or the agencies of violent floods and freshets during

changes consequent on oscillations of level, I see no other way of accounting

for the phenomena represented by the above deposits and the fossil remains.

In fact, I opine much the same conditions existed in Malta during the

period of the fossiliferous deposits in Mnaidra Cave and others as obtained

at Gibraltar when the " Genista " Cave was receiving its Pachydermata and

other quadrupeds.

After the report presented by this Committee at the Newcastle Meeting
two years ago, the British Association, through a deputation headed by

General Sabine, drew the attention of the Minister for War to the probable

usefulness of Gun-cotton. In January 1864, the Government appointed a
Committee to investigate the subject in all its bearings. This Committee
consists of General Sabine as President, General Hay, Captain Brandreth,
B.N., Commander Liddell, B.N., Colonel Boxer, E.A.., Colonel Lovell, R.E.,

F. A. Abel, Esq., T. Sopwith, Esq., Professor W. A. Miller, Professor G. G.

Stokes, and Dr. J. H. Gladstone, with Major Miller, R.A., as Secretary;
representing thus the army, the navy, military and civil engineering, as well
as chemical and physical science, and comprising three of the members of
the British Association Gun-cotton Committee. Experiments on an exten-
sive scale, and in a systematic manner, have been carried on by this Govern-
ment Committee, and are still in progress ; but no report has yet been published.
Until that report is made, your Committee have suspended their labours.

On the Horary and Diurnal Variations in the Direction and Motion
   of the Air at Wrottesley, Liverpool, and Birmingham. By A.

    Follett Osler, F.R.S.

                    [A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.]

Anemometkical observations having been taken hourly with considerable
accuracy for several years, and those at Wrottesley, Liverpool, and Bir-
mingham having been recorded on exactly the same principle (originally
commenced by Mr. Hartnup in 1852), I was desirous of tabulating the
results from those stations on a plan which I thought might prove of some
value in extending our knowledge of the motion of the air in these latitudes,
and possibly of developing some further laws bearing on that subject.
Having observed that the hourly records of certain currents obtained from
the integrating anemometer seemed to exhibit some peculiar features different
from those I had obtained from the registration of the force of the wind, I
wished, in the first place, to carry out some investigations on the horary
variations by taking out the amount of horizontal motion instead of the
force ; the records of Dr. Kobinson's integrating instrument have therefore
been arranged in conjunction with those of time and direction, these
registers being peculiarly suited for accurate tabulation, much more so than
those of the force, which are most available for examining storms and sudden
changes and marked variations in the aerial currents.

    Besides these hourly results, I desired to investigate the records of the
daily variations in the atmospheric currents throughout the year, with a view
of ascertaining whether indications of any laws could be detected respecting
their periodicity and amount.

   Accordingly I applied to Lord Wrottesley, who most kindly placed the

whole of the valuable anemometrical records taken at his observatory at my
A3J ]U,

 disposal ; my friend Mr. Hartnup did the same, and furthermore aided me

 very greatly by allowing his assistants to tabidate, in the manner I required,
 the observations of the direction and horizontal motion of the air as recorded
 at the Liverpool observatory. I have worked out the Birmingham observa-
 tions on the same plan.

    To commence with the horary variations. These extend over a period of
 nearly eight years at Wrottesley and thirteen years at Liverpool. The
 amount of motion of each wind for each of sixteen points of the compass is
 taken note of for every hour, from the daily records, and tabulated for every
 month. Commencing with the N.N.E. wind, the number of miles of air
 from this point that passed between midnight and one o'clock in the morn-
 ing during the month of January in each year is tabulated ; next between
 one and two o'clock, aud so on through the twenty-four hours of the day.
 February is then treated in the same way, and thus through every month
 in the year, for each of the sixteen points of the compass, as shown in
 Table L, which is given as an example, exhibiting the amount of motion and
 duration of the south wind during each hour in December for each year.

    From the mean of the seven years thus obtained, the monthly curves of

 horizontal motion for each hour at Wrottesley are projected. See Plate IV.
 The means of the separate months are also combined so as to obtain averages
 for the seasons and the whole year. In Table II. an example of this is given
 in the horary variations in the S.E. wind at Liverpool.

    Plate V. exhibits the curves projected from tables so arranged for Wrot-
 tesley, and Plate VI. for Liverpool.

    Beginning with the N.N.E. (Plate IV.), and proceeding through the
 easterly points to S.E., the curves present no very striking features ; in some
months they approach that of temperature, as the N.E. in April, the E.N.E.
in February, May, and October, also the E. in February, May, June, Octo-
ber, and November. The prevalence of winds having an easterly or north-
easterly bearing during the spring and early summer is also seen, but their
particular periods and amount are more perfectly shown in the diagrams of
"Diurnal Variations" than in those which are prepared for exhibiting the
horary variations.

    The S., S.S.W. and S.W. currents, or anti-trade-winds, are the next in
order, and exhibit some remarkable features. Independently of the great
and sudden increase in the amount of these, especially of the south, when
compared with any of those from the east, it will be observed that they

exhibit a striking peculiarity in the horary curves ; for while the greatest

amount of air passes from the south before noon, diminishing rapidly for
several hours after noon, with the S.W. the reverse of this takes place, the

--greatest quantity passing after noon and the least before the intermediate

wind, namely, the S.S.W. showing the most in the middle of the day. It
will be observed that the winds on either side of these three, namely,
the S.S.E. and W.S.W., partake of the same peculiarity, but in a less degree,

the former having its maximum in the morning, and the latter in the

afternoon.

    The west and north-westerly currents present variations that show the
greatest difference between the amount of air that passes by day when com-
pared with the night, and correspond most nearly with the curve of tempera-
ture. The N.N.W. winds in the summer months, and especially in June
and July, show the greatest extreme, while the winter months indicate the
least difference between the day and night.

         ON VARIATIONS IN DIRECTION AND MOTION OP THE AIR. 267

On reference to the diagrams of the Liverpool horary variations (Plate

VI.), it will be observed that the same general character of curves exists as at
"Wrottesley, though the amount of air indicated as passing from the various

points differs considerably. The amount of east and north-easterly winds re-

corded is, however, much less, owing to the observatory being somewhat shel-

tered on that side by the town. The peculiar horary variations which at Wrot-

tesley are exhibited in the S. and S.W. winds, extend at Liverpool from the

S.E. to the W.S.W., the former showing the greatest amount in the morning,

the latter in the afternoon. The extension of these variations over so
many points of the compass forms one of the most striking differences

between the observations taken at this station and those at Wrottesley.

~No doubt the course and valley of the river Mersey lying in a S.E. direc-

tion, also the town of Liverpool situated to the N.W., would have a consi-

derable influence in deflecting these south and south-westerly currents, and

in giving them a more easterly bearing ; though probably there are other

causes in action yet to be discovered.

The west and north-westerly currents show the same peculiarities as to

the difference between the amount of motion in the day and night as at

Wrottesley, and at this station exceed that of any other wind.

The integrating registers for Birmingham having been taken for only

three years and a half, have not been engraved; they present much the

same features in their horary variations as the observations taken at Wrot-

tesley, the only difference worth mentioning being in the great S.W. or

anti-trade-current, which has a rather more westerly bearing at Bir-

mingham than at Wrottesley.

The curves that have been obtained by projecting these integrating re-

cords of horary variations, especially those of the south and south-westerly

winds, differ much from those of force or velocity as given by me in former
papers to this Association, when it was shown that the latter nearly

coincide with the curves of temperature, the greatest force occurring at or

shortly  after  noon                         but by subjecting the present observations to  the  test of
                                          ;

velocity by dividing the number of miles of air that pass during each hour

of the day throughout the year, by the number of hours occupied in passing

(see Table II.) it will be found that the law as. to the period of greatest

force or velocity is still correct, notwithstanding that some of the curves
show a larger amount in other parts of the day. These curves are there-

fore interesting and important, as showing that the different currents have

forces acting on them producing horary variations, besides those of acce-
leration from increase of temperature. In the last row of diagrams. Plates
V. and VI., curves are projected on an enlarged scale, showing the horary

variations in the velocity of the air at Wrottesley and Liverpool.

   The next series of observations have reference to the amount and direction

of the various winds throughout the year. In tabulating these, it was neces-
sary that each day should be recorded separately, for by throwing together

an arbitrary term of days, as a month or even a week, many important facts
would be lost. The records have therefore been tabulated so as to give the

direction, duration, and amount of horizontal motion of the air for every day
in the year for seven years, referred to sixteen points of the compass. Com-
mencing with the 1st of January in each year, the number of hours that
each current has lasted, and its amount of horizontal motion during the day,
are obtained from the diaries in which the indications registered by the instru-
ments are recorded, and this is repeated in rotation for every day during seven
268           REPORT 1865.

years, thus sorting, as it were, all the winds. The mean amount of these is

then taken for each day, as represented in Table III., showing the daily

amount and duration of south wind during the month of January.

   From these Tables diagrams are drawn (see Plates VII. & VIII. ), repre-

senting to a scale the comparative number of miles of air that passed from
each point of the compass for every day in the year, taken from a mean of

seven years, the length of the line being in proportion to the length of the

current from each point on each particular day. An approximate meteor-

ological division of the year is thus obtained, having reference to the currents

that pass each station.

   When examining these diagrams it is important not to be misled by the

extent of a current that was due to one or two years being mistaken for the

Atype of a period of years.  space is therefore allotted under each day,

which is divided into seven parts, representing the seven years. One of these

divisions is then marked to indicate the year in which each wind occurred,

the size of the mark having reference to its duration on its particular year.

By these means the prevalence or otherwise of any wind at any period of the

year is at once rendered conspicuous.

The diagrams explain this mode of illustration. Thus at Wrottesley

(Plate VII.*), commencing with the north-easterly and easterly winds, a re-

markable cessation is observable towards the end of January and beginning

of February, again at the end of June, also at the beginning of August and

September, and in the early part of December, while the amount towards

the end of February, and the prevalence in April, and more particularly in

May, often extending to the early part of June, is very clearly shown.

  WThe S. to the .S.W. winds have their maximum in January, increasing

greatly towards the end of the month. They also prevail in the early part

of April, during the latter half of July, and through the month of August,

and more than any other current in September.

   The winds from the W. and N.W. prevail in March, towards the end of
May and in June, especially in the latter half of that month. During the

last four months of the year currents from these points are exceptional.

On reference to the diagram representing the diurnal variations of the

wind at Liverpool (Plate VIII.), it will be observed that there is the same

cessation of the easterly and north-easterly winds at the end of January and

beginning of February as at Wrottesley, also at the end of June, &c. The

times of prevalence also occur about the same periods. The S.E. and S.S.E.

winds, however, correspond to the periods of the S. and S.S.W. at Wrot-

tesley, and the S.S.W. and S.W. at Birmingham.

   The W. and W.N.W. winds prevail with considerable regularity in March,

also at the end of April and beginning of May, again at the end of May, and

particularly at the end of June, extending into the early part of July, and

at the end of August and first portion of September. The diagrams show

better than any written description the features of each current.

  The last row of diagrams in each of the Plates VII. & VIII. represents

the mean amount of horizontal motion of the air, without reference to direc-

--tion, for every day in the year projected on the same scale as the separate

tion takes place throughout the year, and that no period can he regarded

as calm. The early part of January is, however, much calmer than might
he expected, while the latter portion of that month and beginning of
February are just the reverse, as is also March. The great increase ob-

servable in the portion of the diagram that shows the amount of motion of
the air that passes Liverpool at the end of June and beginning of July, is
due to the very strong W., W.N.W., and north-westerly currents at that
period of the year. At Wrottesley the same currents exist, and at the same
period, but their violence is so much diminished as not to disturb the general

averages.

    These observations seem to indicate, both from the diagrams of each day
as well as from those exhibiting the horary variations, that there are three

principal currents or groups of winds that may be classed together. First

the north-easterly, prevailing mostly in the spring, and also appearing in

the autumn. Whether they may be regarded as a temporary extension of

the trade-winds will require further observations to determine. They possess
some of the characteristics of that wind.

   The next group is the great south and south-westerly current, or anti-
trade-wind, the peculiar horary variations of which and periods of greatest
motion have already been referred to.

   The currents from the N.W., including those from "W. to N.N.W., form

the last group.

   Although the north-west and south-west groups are in many respects
distinct from one another, yet they often blend so much that it is not pos-

sible to draw a definite line between them.

Further observations on a more extended scale are required to define with

accuracy the periods of prevalence or otherwise of the various currents, and

to determine many interesting points regarding their course and action,

which can now be only dimly shadowed forth. It is, however, hoped that

what has here been done will aid in showing the importance of keeping a

constant record of the movements of the air over as large an area of the

earth's surface as can with convenience be arranged. The geologist, whose

researches also extend over the whole earth, finds in the great globe itself a

vast registering instrument, where the changes that he is studying have been

permanently written, enabling him at his leisure to examine its records, and

refer to periods so immeasurably distant that he may, by reversing his train of

thought, have glimpses of eternity. The meteorologist, on the contrary, finds

himself lost by reason of the ephemeral nature of the forces and conditions

which he has to deal with ; he requires all the artificial appliances that can

help him, to take note of and record the various changes that occur ; but of

all the conditions, there are none more important than those of the great cur-

Arents of the atmosphere.  knowledge of the quarter from which the air

arrives at given points on the earth's surface, and the duration of the current,

will be a key to its various conditions of temperature, humidity, weight, and

all the other features it may possess ; while to trace it onward, over a large

area, will materially aid in unravelling the secrets of the producing causes,

and the laws that determine its course.

 Second Report on the Physiological Action of certain of the Amy I Com-
   pounds. By Benjamin W. Richardson, M.A.,M.D., F.R.C.P.

 At the last Meeting of the Association, I read before the Physiological Section
 a " Report on the Physiological Action of Nitrite of Amyl." On that occa-
 sion the members were good enough to express a wish that I should continue
 the inquiry. The present Report is the result.

     In accordance with the desire of the Committee, I have in this Report
 carried out a more general enquiry. Instead of confining myself to one spe-
 cial body in the amyl series, I have taken several of them, viz. amylene or
 valerene as one of the simplest of the type, amylic alcohol, acetate of amyl,
 and iodide of amyl.

     I hope, from the researches I have made, to leave in the hands of the
 Association a fair history of the physiological value of all these compounds.

    Before proceeding further, permit me to invite the attention of the Section
 to a very brief summary of the facts brought forward at our last Meeting,

 in 1864, respecting the nitrite of amyl. I showed then that nitrite of amyl
 was

    1. The most powerful excitant of vascular action known.
     2. That in animals whose bodies admit of its spontaneous evaporation,
 the nitrite suspends animation ; and that in animals of higher organization

 it induces a condition resembling cataleptic insensibility.
     3. That it is not an anaesthetic.
     4. That the effects produced by it are developed on the motive powers of

 the organism, which it first vehemently excites, and then paralyses.
     5. That it arrests the process of oxidation.
     I shall not trouble the Section with further observations in detail on this

 compound, inasmuch as the report upon it, as a whole, is published in the
 Transactions of the Association. I pass therefore at once to the other
 compounds of the amyl series.

                                                    Amylene.

    The substance called amylene was first separated by Balard, of Paris,
 twenty-one years ago. It attracted but little attention until 1856, when
Dr. Snow having read of it, and learned theoretically its composition and
 physical characteristics, came to the conclusion, on theoretical grounds only,
 that it was possessed of anaesthetic properties. In process of time he ob-
 tained some of the fluid ; he found that his theory proved correct in prac-
tice, and he was so satisfied with the action of the substance, that he em-
 ployed it as an anaesthetic in 238 cases. M. Giraldis, of Paris, also em-
 ployed it in seventy-nine cases. I used it myself in connexion with Snow
in three cases, and many other physicians and surgeons' used it also. For a
 time, indeed, it seemed that amylene would in the end take the place of
 chloroform, but the promised success was marred by the occurrence of two
fatal cases, from its inhalation, in the hands of Snow himself.

     Since that period, (July 30, 1857, date of the second fatal case,) amylene

has fallen into entire disuse. Snow during the last year of his useful life

'returned to chloroform, and I have occasion to know, from my intimate

friendship with him, that the occurrence of the fatal accidents caused him
 as much anxiety as surprise. It has been suggested since Snow's- death
 that the specimen of amylene which he used was not pure, but was in fact a
compound of various substances. This may be true, but it is certain that
he had used the same specimen successfully in other cases, and I have experi-
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OP CERTAIN AMYL COMPOUNDS. 273

mented on animals with a little that remained from the same store, without

producing any dangerous symptoms.

I introduce amylene to notice in this place, because it not only links itself

naturally with the series, but is, in fact, a proper body of the series from

which to date observations as to variation of action.

   Amylene is made by acting on pure fusel oil or amylic alcohol with

chloride of ziuc ; it has also been obtained, together with hydruret of amyl,
by the action of zinc on iodide of amyl. In the distillation of the amylene

other products are almost certain to pass over, and I think I am right in

saying that the substance has never been obtained actually pure for physio-

logical purposes. It ought, -when quite pure, to be neutral to potassium,

and to preserve that element from oxidation ; but, as far as I am aware, this

degree of purity has not been secured. The liquid has an oily character,

and an odour compared by most persons to raw whiskey. It boils at the

temperature of the blood, 98° Fahr. ; it is soluble in alcohol and ether to any

degree, it is soluble in water to the extent only of one part in 9319, and the

specific gravity of its vapour, according to Snow, is as low as 2--I5. As a

Hfluid it is nearly colourless.
              It is composed of two elements, C                                                                         10 .
                                                                                                                    10
--Antiseptic Properties. Like the nitrite of amyl, amylene is antiseptic ; if

dead tissue be placed in the pure vapour of amylene securely it remains un-

changed, but the great difficulty consists in retaining the vapour in the

· vessel. If 60 grains of amylene be placed in a jar having a cubic capacity

of 80 inches, the ox-ganic substance to be preserved being previously put into

the jar, sufficient amylene may be diffused by the warmth of the hand to

enable the specimen to be kept in preservation. Animal tissues in amylene-
vapour do not gelatinize as in ammonia ; they become soft, evidently from
the action of water retained in them, but not offensive. Decomposed animal

tissue placed in vapour of amylene does not become less offensive, although

the process of putrefaction is for a time arrested.

Amylene preserves blood from putrefaction so long as it is present in the

mass. During the past weeks of extreme heat I have retained blood un-

changed in my laboratory by simply treating it, from time to time, with

sufficient amylene to render the odour of the substance detectable. After it

has been for a time in contact with blood in a closed bottle, the odour evolved

resembles rosemary so closely as not to be distinguished from it.

 --Effects on Flowers. Amylene prevents the decomposition of fresh flowers,

but it is not applicable as a preservative, owing to the change it produces in

colour. The leaves pass from green to a dirty brown, the yellow colour

grows slightly dingy, and the red fades. The colour least influenced is

yellow.

 --Physiological Effects on Living Organisms. Amylene does not in any de-

gree irritate either the skin or mucous membrane ; it acts feebly when exhi-

bited by the mouth or by injection under the skin. It is by inhalation only

that we can bring out its actual properties.

I have administered amylene in vapour to dogs, cats, guineapigs, and

men. The symptoms presented in all are in the main the same. There

is not the terrific excitement of the circulation which is seen when the

nitrite of amyl is used, but there is some excitement, and there is quick

inebriation.

This is followed by powerlessness of the limbs, and sudden collapse and

coma, with total insensibility to pain, but not always, and indeed rarely,

with an equivalent loss of consciousness. In one case I saw a person who

was under amvlene, and entirely senseless to a severe surgical operation,

1865.                                                                                                                   v

talking with considerable correctness on the topics of the day, seizing ob-
jects with precision, and showing scarcely a perceptible gradation during re-
covery from mental inebriation to perfect and sober consciousness. In a psy-
chological point of view this fact is doubly interesting, for the expression of
consciousness is but a semblance. The person on recovery does not remember
the period when, to the bystander, he seemed as wide awake as one unaf-
fected. To test this phenomenon I myself inhaled amylene alone, and, before

inhaling it, made up my mind that I would test for sensibility by pinching
my hand. I inhaled, sitting in an arm-chair, 10 grains of amylene from a jar

holding 100 cubic inches of air ; the air was thus charged with rather more
than 13 per cent, of amylene-vapour ; this quantity is small, except it be
inhaled backwards and forwards in the manner I then followed, when the
action is quickly decisive. Soon after inhaling I forgot myself altogether,
but four minutes from the time I took up the jar I was quite conscious again,

waking as if with a start. Ah ! I thought, this experiment will not do ; the
amylene acts so quickly that there is no interval during which a man may test
his own sensibility ; but turning now to my wrist, I found I was wrong in

this suspicion, for there were deep marks of pinches in several places ; and
further, the bottle containing the amylene-vapour had been replaced on the
table with the stopper firmly adjusted, as I had intended. Thus I had, in
fact, been performing acts of consciousness preconceived and carefully carried
out without remembering any single fact connected with the process.

   I have seen a phenomenon nearly similar under chloroform, but never so
marked as under amylene-. Snow had an experience of the same in kind.
During a severe operation on a child under the influence of amylene, the
child was playing with a ball, throwing it into the air, catching it with pre-
cision, and talking and laughing the while.

    I presume that there is not one hearer present who, quite irrespectively of
the special subject of this report, will not, on contemplating the pheno-
menon just cited, be struck with the facts adduced. It is clear that the

human mind, through its manifestations, may exhibit a mere objective con-

sciousness apart from the ordinary subjective consciousness of daily life. It

may exhibit a consciousness of which it is itself unconscious, and this under
the mere influence of a volatile liquid obtained from common potato-starch,

and which mixes so indifferently with blood at 96° Fahr., that one part only

will combine with 10,550 parts of blood.

   Have we any analogous phenomena apart from experiment, and spon-
taneous or natural like this ? You will all anticipate me when I say yes,

there is the very counterpart in somnambulism. The somnambulist is in pre-
cisely the same state as the experimentalist under this amyl-compound : he
pursues acts of consciousness of which he is not self-conscious ; he presents to

us, i. c, mere objective consciousness. Have we not here a key to the hitherto

mastery of sleep-walking and acting ? I will not say it is certain, but the

evidence is as clear as inferential evidence can ever be, that persons who are

subjects of somnambulistic movements do, through some abnormal process of

digestion or respiration of the starchy elements of food, produce in their

own organisms by their own organic chemistry, an agent which, like amy-
lene, destroys remembrance, and perhaps judgment and reason, but which

leaves the brain still able to act and to direct the limbs to do things which
they could not do better in the most wakeful hour.

    One might linger long on this subject, but I must leave it after noticing
yet one other peculiarity of what may be called amylene dreaming. It is
this, that during the period of insensibility the mind is capable of carrying on
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF CERTAIN AMYL COMPOTJNDS. 275

Wecertain proceedings upon winch it was predetermined.  have a similar

phenomenon to this in our daily range of experience, in the fact that we can

under pressure go to sleep determining that we will wake at a certain time,

and do so almost to the minute. In both these cases it seems as though

the dark sleep were pierced by one pervading conscious gleam of light

which obeys the orders it has received, and watching the slumbering spirits

around it, calls them forth into activity at the proper time, and then itself

dies away.

The insensibility produced by amylene is very complete but exceedingly

transient ; recovery after the vapour is withdrawn is sudden, and it is

therefore necessary to keep up the effect by constant inhalation of large

quantities of the vapour. Between the period of full sensibility and com-

plete insensibility there are three well-marked stages. The first is one of

mild excitement, during which the face becomes red and injected; then a

period of staggering inebriation ; and thirdly, a period of collapse and insen-

sibility. Snow added a fourth stage of entire muscular relaxation, but I

have myself not been able to follow it. During narcotism from this agent there

is no convulsion, but not unfrequently there is a peculiar tremor of the muscles

very general, but, if I may use the term, minute. Carried to an extreme,

the vapour kills animals. The only structural peculiarity found after death,

is engorgement of the right side of the heart. The lungs are healthy, and

the blood is unchanged in its general physical properties. I would dwell

on this last fact with emphasis in order to correct an error made by the

reporter on amylene to the Academy of Medicine of Paris, to the effect that

amylene removed the red colour from arterial blood, whereas chloroform does

not. This is a mistake, founded obviously on an inference derived from imper-

fect observation. When amylene is added in quantity to arterial blood drawn

from the body, it does unquestionably produce darkness of coloiir ; but in the
living animal, during its exhibition by inhalation, no such event occurs ; for

I have taken the blood from artery and vein, and have compared the specimens.

The colour of both bloods is normal, the period of coagulation is natural, and

the corpuscles are unchanged.

Owing to the fact that amylene is feebly soluble in water, and therefore

feebly soluble in serum of blood, a very large percentage of it requires to be

inhaled before any effect is produced. Snow estimated that the air must be

charged with 40 per cent, in order to produce entire insensibility, and in

fact he under- estimated the quantity by working on water at a temperature

of 56° instead of 96° Fahr. I find that, instead of 40, 50 per cent, of the

vapour actually is required. But as the blood at its ordinary temperature

can only absorb ju-jjy-g-th part of the vapour of amylene, it cannot, even in

an adult man, receive at any time more than from 4| to 5 grains. It is

clear, too, from the rapidity with which recovery takes place, that the fluids

of the tissues receive but feeble impregnation.

In order to institute a physiological comparison, I tried the effect of the

analogue of amylene defiant gas. Olefiant gas is the hydruret of acetyle,

but, like amylene, it is a pure hydrocarbon ; its composition is different only

in one respect, viz. that it is composed of four equivalents of carbon and

four of hydrogen. As I had anticipated, the action was nearly the same

to produce perfect insensibility, 50 per cent, of the gas was required in inha-
lation. The effects also were transient.

   The effect of amylene on the muscular tissue was studied in various
ways. As will already have been gathered, it reduces the muscular power,

but the effect is not abiding. In fact amylene approaches the class of

                                                                        v2
--276 report 18G5.

negative narcotics, and enters into no chemical combination with the tissues.

This fact led Dr. Snow to say that in action it almost resembled nitrogen.

I should myself rather compare it to carbonic oxide ; only that carbonic
oxide produces convulsive movements and vomiting, which amylene rarely

does.

   When an animal has died from amylene, the peculiar odour of the sub-
stance may be detected in the tissues for many days. This circumstance
may seem at first sight to be opposed to the statements already made re-

specting the feeble absorption of tbe vapour by the blood. However, there
is no contradiction ; the phenomenon is due to the circumstance that amy-

lene possesses the power of charging water with its own odour and taste
when in extreme division. This fact was observed by Snow with his usual
precision. "Amylene," he says, "requires 9319 parts of water for its

solution ;" and, he adds, " the water which has dissolved this small quantity
of amylene tastes as distinctly of it as amylene itself." I notice this pecu-
liarity, as it might happen some day to be of service in medico-legal inves-

 tigations.

                               Ajitiic Alcohol.

Amylic alcohol, the hydrated oxide of amyl, is obtained in the fermenta-

tion of potato-starch or starch of grain. It is an almost colourless fluid,

and boils at 270° ; its density is 0-818. Its smell is sweet, nauseous, and

heavy.  In  composition it difiei's                                                       from amylene in            that it contains  oxygen
                                                                                                                                                                        ;
Hits chemical composition is C

same as amylene.

In action it resembles amylene in being antiseptic, and in changing the

colour of flowers and plants. It acts on the body, whether administered by

the mouth or by inhalation, but it is most effective when inhaled in minute

subdivision from an atomizer.

Administered by inhalation in small quantities, it produces in the first

instance signs of irritation of the nostril and then of drowsiness, but there

is no anaesthesia ; if the inhalation be continued, and the quantity increased,
the symptoms of coma or sleep are more fully developed, but without any

insensibility, and with almost immediate recovery on the animal being re-

moved. Pushed further still, the animal sinks on its side and loses the use

of the limbs. At last the coma becomes very profound, and it may be intensi-

fied up to the point of insensibility. At this stage of the process, and some-

times a little before it, a peculiar symptom is developed, viz. a universal

tremor, accompanied with a very deep inspiration. There is no spasm, no

pain, no rigidity, but in medical language rigors of an intense kiud. These

rigors ai~e soon established in regular rhythm, and by maintaining the expe-

riment cautiously, they may be kept up for several hours. I have seen them

for one hour at the rate of sixteen in a minute as regularly as possible, and

by reduction of the agent have lowered them to twelve, eight, and four per

minute. All through the breathing is tranquil and the action of the heart

good. The rigor occurs spontaneously in this manner, but it can be excited
at any moment by touching the animal or blowing upon it, or even by a

sharp noise, such as the snap of the finger. When the animal is reduced to

entire insensibility, if it be laid in the open air, it begins to recover its sensi-

bility at once, but the power to move is suspended for two or three hours,

and the rigors also continue, but with decreasing force and frequency.

Ultimately the animal recovers thoroughly, and is always very eager for food.

When these urgent and, as they would seem, extreme symptoms are carried

to their full extent, even an experienced observer would think that recovery
were impossible ; but in truth the animal cannot be killed by any fair play
with this vapour. In order actually to kill, it is necessary to complicate the
experiment by actual reduction of air, or by closing the chamber and retain-
ing the carbonic acid of the breath. Aniylic alcohol produces a crenate and
slightly shrunken condition of the blood-corpuscles, and the red blood is
slightly darkened by it, but no change is produced in the property of coagu-

lation. The odour of the substance remains for many hours in the tissues.
The oxide has little action on the skin.

                              Acetate op Amyl.

   The acetate of amyl is made by distilling together 1 part of potato oil, 2 of
acetate of potassa, and 1 of concentrated sidphuric acid. The distilled fluid is

washed with alkali, and distilled from chloride of calcium. It boils at 272°.

HIts composition is C     .
                    4 33

Acetate of oxide of amyl is a compound of oxide of amyl with acetic acid.

It is a clear fragrant fluid, and is sold for flavouring purposes under the name

of essence of pears. It acts like the other preparations in preserving organic

substances.

Physiologically the effects of the acetate of amyl may be induced feebly by

subcutaneous injection, or by administration by the mouth, but best by inha-

lation from the atomizer. It is very pleasant to inhale, and produces scarcely

any irritation. "When inhaled by an animal, it produces the very same sym-

ptoms as amylic alcohol ; indeed these are so closely alike, that I could not by

mere observation of the symptoms tell which agent was being employed. It

is quite possible to induce perfect insensibility to pain by this agent. The

rigors, so remarkable as regards their regularity of occurrence, are presented

in marked degree ; a touch or noise calls them into action, and the paralysis

of the voluntary muscular system is complete ; but by itself the acetate does
not destroy, and I have held an animal under its influence for ten hours with

perfect recovery afterwards.

I have inhaled the vapour myself in proportions varying from fifteen to

twenty-five per cent, without any unpleasant symptom. It slightly quickens

the action of the heart, and it produces a little irritation of the throat, such

as follows the inhalation of vapour of vinegar, but, on the whole, the effect

is pleasant. After a short time there is a gentle sensation of drowsiness, but

no loss of sensation nor of consciousness, no faintness, no nausea, but a slight

tremulousness of the muscles, the same unquestionably as the tremor which is

seen in the more determinate manner in the lower animals.

The acetate of amyl does not interfere with the process of coagulation of

the blood, but it renders the blood darker in colour, and the corpuscles are
made irregular and crenate. The odour of it does not remain long in the
tissues. The acetate exerts a feeble action upon the skin, causing some vas-

cularity and soreness when long applied.

                              Iodide of Amyl.

The iodide is made by distilling together 15 parts of potato oil, 1 of phos-

phorus, and 8 of iodine. It volatizes, without being decomposed, at 294°.

The iodide of amyl is a compound of amyl with iodine. Its composition

It is a slightly pinkish liquid, the odour is less agreeable than that of the

acetate of amyl, but is more pleasant than that of amylic alcohol. It rapidly

278 report--1865.

when brought into contact with dead organic material, it is much less activo

in this respect than any of the compounds which have up to this time been

before us.

   The physiological action of the iodide of amyl is well illustrated when
the substance is administered with the atomizer, but it may be admi-
nistered by direct inhalation. The symptoms induced are peculiar, being a
mixture of those brought out by the nitrite of amyl, the hydrated oxide and

the acetate. In the first stage of inhalation there is a profuse flow of
tears and increase of saliva, followed by rapid breathing and vehement action
of the heart. In the second stage there is prostration of the muscular
system with commencing rigors ; in the third stage there is entire prostra-
tion, and precisely as with the oxide and acetate, there are regular series
of general tremulous movements which can be excited at any moment by
touching or by a sharp noise. During the tremor the limbs are agitated in
movements which are so rapid that they cannot be counted. Pushed to
a fourth degree, the breathing becomes paralysed, and the action of the heart

intermittent and at last prolonged. But at this last degree, when extinction
of life is within a second, there is no insensibility to pain. The merest prick
causes expression of consciousness. Removed from the vapour, even when

the existence of life is almost doubtful, recovery, if there be the faintest de-
tectable action of the heart, is certain, and not only so, but it is rapid also.
In the course of recovery the tremors quickly subside, but a special and

curious phenomenon is commonly presented, consisting of a series of revolu-
tions of the body in a circle. At first the animal moves round almost on its
own axis ; as it regains power, it makes a little circuit, and then a wider
one ; at length it moves less methodically in jerks, and last of all attains the
straight line. It seems at no time to suffer anything, and yet always to be
alive to what is passing. It eats food voraciously on recovery. I shordd
add that during the whole process there is copious elimination of water from
the lungs, skin, and indeed all the cniunctory organs.

    If the blood be examined microscopically before, during, and after the in-
halation, several changes are observed. The colour of the blood is not
darkened, but tbe fibrine appears to imdergo entire solution, while the blood-
corpuscles in greater part retain their natural characteristic form. The

dissolved condition of the fibrine lasts many hours, and if the skin be pricked
the blood flows for an unusual time, but it is bright red in colour. When
added to drawn blood, the iodide renders the coagulation loose and feeble, but

does not stop the process altogether, possibly because its molecules do not

come into such minute contact with the blood as when they are brought into
union with the blood in the lungs. The upper surface of blood charged
with the iodide becomes oxidized quickly in the air, and exhibits a bright

red layer very deep and regular. '
   The iodide causes little irritability of skin or of mucous membrane. It is

not disagreeable to inhale, but it excites secretion of saliva. It also produces
vascular redness of the extremities during its inhalation.

    In regard to the whole of the amyl-compounds, the properties of which

I have investigated, I may state that, while they destroy the voluntary power
of the muscles, they seem in no way to destroy the muscular irritability, the
vis insita of Haller. This is proved by the facts that when the animal lies

most prostrate any muscle or any group of muscles can be called into brisk
action by the application of the galvanic stimulus, and that when an animal
is actually destroyed by them, the muscular irritability remains for many

hoiu-s after death. When the nitrite is employed as the destructive agent,
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF CERTAIN AMYL COMPOUNDS. 279

the muscular irritability of the heart is retained in some cases for so long a
period as eighteen hours; hence I think it follows conclusively that the
influence of the poison is exerted mainly on the nervous centres, and that the
stimulus to muscular action or the tension of force derived from those" centres
is simply reduced or withdrawn. I conceive also it is another fair inference
to suppose that the compounds exert their influence first on those portions
of the nervous organism from which the motor power, as apart from the sen-

sory and conscious, is derived.

myBefore closing this descriptive section of  report, I would add that, in

the experiments to which attention has been drawn, dogs, rabbits, and guinea-

pigs were the animals subjected to observation. To make the experiments

strictly fair, to forbid any suspicion to the effect that the differences or even

the analogies observed were due to peculiarities of the animals, one animal,
a strong guineapig, was subjected at intervals of ten days to the extreme
action, short of actual death, of the various compounds submitted to exami-

nation.

                                            Practical Conclusions.

   It remains for me now, in a few short paragraphs, to sum up the lessons

which are taught by these experiences.

 --I. In the first place, something is added to our knowledge of therapeutics

or rational principles of remedies. This is hardly perhaps the place to descant
on special remedies for the treatment of disease, and I shall forbear on this

point ; but I may state generally that, according to present knowledge, none

of the amyl-compounds can be said to replace either ether or chloroform as

anaesthetics : amylene, the best of the series, is known not to be free of

danger, and it is less manageable than chloroform without being devoid of any
of the objections of chloroform, except the one, that it does not so often
produce vomiting. This advantage, though most important, is after all insuf-
ficient as a single favourable recommendation.

   But there is one direction towards which our minds cannot fail to be di-

--rected, and following which we may expect useful results in a therapeutical

inquiry, I refer to the application of these substances as remedies in certain

convulsive and spasmodic diseases, in which the symptoms are obviously in-
duced by morbid sensibility or excitability of the motor tracts and centres of
the nervous system. "When we know that in these agents we possess reme-
dies which produce lessened action of the motor force resident in nervous
matter, but which at the same time affect the consciousness in a secondary-
degree only, and do not affect the muscular irratibility at all, we cannot but
be impressed with the feeling that they would largely control the nervous
excitation in cases where that is dangerously and fatally called forth. I
refer more particularly to cases of tetanus or locked jaw. Here I think it
would be rational to bring these agents into requisition as remedies, and
comparing the agents one by one, and after studying carefully their effects, I
should conclude that the iodide of amyl would on the whole be most pro-
mising. It has the advantge of being readily administered by inhalation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

it produces less muscular excitement than the nitrite, and it is, I believe,
chemically a safer preparation ; it does not so determinately check oxidation
as the rest ; it promotes secretion ; it is more permanent in its effects than
amylene, and it is less persistent than either the acetate or the amylic alcohol.
In a case of hopeless tetanus I should have no hesitation in administering
iodide of amyl until decided reduction of nervous excitability was indicated,
--280 report 1865.

nor do I doubt the possibility of sustaining such reduction of irritability for

several hours.

   The iodide of aniyl might possibly also be found useful as a means for
bringing forth the medicinal virtues of iodine itself in the many cases for
which that element is now, under other forms, so usefully employed. It
would make, for example, an excellent embrocation for glandular enlarge-
ments, and would come in efficiently in other ways, as will occur to every
medical practitioner. It is unnecessary, however, to dwell on these matters;
having pointed out the physiological bearings of the question and framed the

institute, I leave the practice to experience.

  --II. In the second place, a lesson is taught by these researches relative to

the possible cause, or to some allied cause, of certain diseases as yet most
obscure in reference to their causation. I showed last year that the nitrite of
amyl produced a condition of system closely allied to the disorder known as

catalepsy. On this occasion I have indicated that another of these compounds
produces symptoms analogoiis to those which characterize the disease known
as sleep-walking or somnambulism. But it will further occur to the mind

of the philosophical pathologist that hysteria and certain sudden and as yet
unexplored forms of paralysis of voluntary muscular power, following peculiar
dyspeptic derangements, admit of explanation on the hypothesis of a perverted
animal chemistry, and the formation in the organism itself of a substance
made from the same organic material and approaching in character one of

these amyl-compounds. If, as we know is the fact, a peculiar fermentative

process of amylaceous material out of the body leads to the production of the
base of the amyl series, it is hard to avoid the thought that in the body,
where the zymosis of amylaceous matter is a constant process, no similar per-

version should occur.

--III. The last lesson suggested by this research relates to the modifications

of action exhibited in animals by charging them with the same chemical base

Abut with diverse compounds of the base.  very shrewd and profound

question was asked me last year by Dr. Heaton of Leeds, when my report on

--the nitrite of amyl was read, to this effect : Is the action of the compound

due to the base, or to the compound' as a whole ? I was unable then to

answer that question properly. Now I can answer it; and I do so by

saying, that in the midst of the phenomena observed the base amyl is, if I

may use such an expression, the key-note, but variations are introduced as

Vonew elements are added. The order of variation is most interesting.

take a simple hydrocarbon, the hydruret of amyl, and we have an almost ne-

gative body acting not unlike nitrogen and destroying motor force and con-

sciousness partly but no more. AVe introduce the element oxygen into the

inquiry by using the hydrated oxide of amyl or the acetate, and there is

added to the above-named phenomena violent and persistent tremor. AVe

move from this to another compound, and bring iodine into the field, and the

phenomena now embrace free elimination of fluid from the body, vascularity

of the extreme parts with increased action of the heart and of respiration.

We change the combination once more to bring nitrogen and oxygen into

operation with the base, and the vascular action is raised beyond what is

seen from any other known substance, to be followed by a prostration so pro-

found that the still living animal might for a time pass for dead.

It seems to me, but I put out the thought with the profoundest sub-

mission, that in these experimental truths, so simple and yet so striking,
ON THE LINGULA-FLAGS OF SOUTH WALES.  281

we have presented to our minds a new line of therapeutical inquiry run-

 ning somewhat parallel with that line of inquiry so prominent amongst our
learned and more exact brethren of the Chemical Section, which they follow

--under the term " the law of substitution." I would ask, Is there not a

physiological law to be worked out similar in character ? and might we not by

 looking into it become more sure and determinate in our knowledge and
 application of medicinal remedies ? "What if, after having learned the exact

action on the economy of the organic bases, we followed the chemist, and
by taking the compounds moulded on those bases, we learned their true phy-
siological vahies '? Surely, if we did this, long though the labour should be,
we might in time venture to lay down.

                                                                  " This osier cage of ours

                              With baleful weeds and precious juiced flowers"

and without forgetting the words of that wise friar, whom we of physic still

so blindly follow,

                           " Oh rnickle is the powerful grace, that lies

                                  In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities,"

might begin to approach to that accuracy of knowledge, the absence of which
makes us so weak and the charlatan so presumptuous ; the possession of
which makes the other physical philosophers so proof against presumption
and so proudly certain in their stupendous knowledge.

    In conclusion, were I a youth, just entering one of the best professions, I

should be glad to devote my first years simply and solely to the branch of

therapeutical research which I have here so faintly sketched out. As it is,
I can but feel fortunate in that, supported by the fostering care of this Asso-

--ciation, I have been enabled to do even so much as turn the first sod in this

great and novel field of labour, I mean the investigation, physiologically, of
the organic chemical compounds on a plan that aims at least at a principle in
science, however obscurely it may have been propounded. To say I shall be
happy to do more, and again to lay what I may have done before this Section,

is to say the least I can in return for the kind consideration I have received
at your hands.

Report on further Researches in the Lingula-flags of South Wales.

   By Henry Hicks. With some Notes on the Sections and Fossils,
   by J. W. Salter, F.G.S., A.L.S.

The district to which the following Eeport refers, and for the examination of
which a grant was made at the Meeting of the British Association last year,
is in the N.W. of Pembrokeshire, and in the immediate neighbourhood of
the city of St. David's. The principal section occurs to the S. and S.E. of

St. David's, along the north coast of St. Bride's Bay. It is, moreover,

bounded by two well-marked faults, which run up in a JsT.-westerly direc-
tion, and which serve rather to isolate it. One only of these faults is marked

on the Survey Map, that forming its eastern boundary, and which may be
seen running up almost immediately behind the now well-known creek of

Porth-y-rhaw, and which cuts off the upper and principal part of the Middle
Lingula-flags, leaving only a few hundred feet to rest conformably upon the
Lower Lingula-flags. The western fault occurs directly to the south of
St. David's, at a place called Nun's Well, and just at the spot where the
Conglomerate and lowest Cambrian beds are exposed on the coast line, so
--282 report 1865.

that within the boundary of these two faults we have an exposed section of
all the Lower Cambrian beds, the whole of the Lower Lingula-flags, and a

part of the Middle Lingula-flags, following one another in true succession.
   I have taken three parallel sections across the hue of strike, as follows :
   1st. Caerbwddy section, to the west of Porth-y-rhaw, including nearly the

whole of the Lower Cambrian beds exposed in this neighbourhood, and above
400 feet of the Lower Lingiila-flags.

   2nd. Porth-y-rhaw section runs along the east side of that creek, and in-
cludes the uppermost beds of the Lower Cambrians, and nearly the whole of

the Lower Lingula-flags.
   3rd, or Cradle Rock section, includes the remaining beds of the Lower Lin-

gula-flags, and the Middle Lingula-flags as far as they are exposed here in

--true succession. It extends from a point inland of Porth-y-rhaw to the

Cradle Rock the latter an islet about midway from Porth-y-rhaw to the
mouth of Solva Harbour. The first, or Caerbwddy section, cuts across the
beds in a direction from N."W. by N. to S.E. by S., and includes about 1980

--feet of conformable strata, comprising, in ascending order,

   The lowest third, or base of the fossilifcrous scries, is especially worth

notice, as resembling very nearly in lithological character the immediately

underlying Lower Cambrian beds, and distinguished from them only by the
absence of the purple bands. It must be understood also that the absence
of these bands by no means contradicts us in assigning these fossiliferous
beds (No. 5 a) to the upper portion of the true Lower Cambrian or " Harlech
Grit" series, since many beds of the immediately underlying series are as free
from purple colour as are any of these. Purple and red beds, moreover, are
not found to be favourable for the exhibition of organic traces. In the true
purple beds (No. 3), and, indeed, in the whole of the Lower Cambrians of this

district, worm tracks only have as yet been found, though it is to be hoped

that the presence and true position of the Ohlhamia will also be determined

here ere long.

   As we ascend from the coarse-grained compact beds already mentioned,

the beds gradually become darker in appearance, of a finer grain, and more
flag-like ; the dip is very high, and often vertical.

    The 2nd, or Porth-y-rhaw section, extends along the east side of that
creek, in a direction from N. by E. to S. by W., includes about 700 feet of
strata, nearly all fossiliferous, and shows the most perfect section of the Lower

Lingula-flags anywhere exposed in this neighbourhood.
    It begins in the Grey grit, or lowest fossiliferous beds (5 a), and upon
                                                              ON THE LINGULA-FLAGS OF SOUTH WALES.                                                         283

these, in ascending order, lie the Grey flag with black bands, and the true

black beds (5 b), all well marked, and easily traced through their transitional
states into one another. The passage, moreover, is quite perfect. The upper

--part of this section contains a thick bed or two of trap, a circumstance com-

mon throughout the Lingula-flags in this district, as also occasionally in the

Upper Grey series of the Lower Cambrian, though I have never seen it occur
lower down. Mr. Salter has found it abundantly in the same beds in North

Wales.

   The 3rd, or Cradle Bock section, is a continuation of the second. The first

beds in this section are the thick sandstone ones which terminated section 2;

and upon these we have thin alternating beds of sandstone and shale of a

dark grey colour, fossiliferous, and occupying a thickness of about 250 ft.

next, a series of beds still dipping in the same direction for about 450 ft., and
composed of grey flaggy sandstone in thin beds, alternating at first with dark
grey or black shale, and afterwards -with yellowish shale. These last are

evidently the base of the Middle Lingula-flags. After this the beds curve into
a synclinal, which is again repeated about 600 ft. further on, so that but a
portion only of the Middle Lingula series is in consequence exposed here.
The general section thus sketched includes about 3000 ft. of conformable

strata, and may well be looked upon as the typical section. Several other

sections are also exposed inland, and along the coast, but in no case do we

find one so continuous or uninterrupted by faults. Again, all others that I

have examined, and which I may say include all the chief Cambrian masses
exposed in N.W. Pembrokeshire, tend in every case to prove the facts exhi-

bited clearly in this one. In most cases I have found the lithological charac-

ters of the beds, the thicknesses of the various series, and the fossils, when

present, to tally in every particular with this section.

In section 2, or that of the east side of Porth-y-rhaw Creek, we meet with

all the principal fossil types. By means of a fault, the purple-stained beds

(4) are immediately followed by a set of beds, excepting in colour, appa-

rently identical with them, hard Grey grit (5 a) in thick compact beds, which,

as in the first section named, appear to be the top of the Lower Cambrian.

and JIurodiscus. Unfortunately the first two are very fragmentary as yet,

but there is quite enough to pronounce them new ; and the Paradoxides is a

very peculiar species. Fragments of these lowest fossils are also found in the

creek to the west of Porth-y-rhaw, and through which I have taken section 1 ;
and at two or three other places, where they hold exactly the same relation

to the underlying purple beds, and to the series above. Though the purple

band series have not yet yielded any definite traces of these higher forms of

fossils, we arc scarcely, I think, warranted in looking upon that as proof of

their absence                                                 neither  is  it, I think, likely that                                   so    rich,  though  limited, a

fauna should come so suddenly into existence. About half a dozen only of

the lowest beds are distinctly fossiliferous, the succeeding 150 ft. having

yielded scarcely any traces as yet, though we may expect to find them.

These last beds are much lighter in colour, being a grey grit, and having

only a few narrow dark bands. Rather abruptly the beds now become darker

in colour and of a finer grain,--a dark-grey flag. In these we meet with
Parad. Hiclcsii, not a new species, but one described already as P. Forchham-

meri, from some unknown locality in North Wales, according to the testimony

of my colleague, Mr. Salter, who has been trying for the last twenty years to

find out the true position and locality of this fossil. Associated with this
second species of Paradoxides are three or four other trilohites, two or three

shells, &c.

From this point the beds become still darker in colour, black, flag-like,

Aand slaty beds, full of fossils.  small cavern marks a good line for these

highly fossiliferous beds, and here we meet with numerous new species, and

even genera, which are not found elsewhere. The beds between the cavern

and the traps are the chief repository of our species ; and I will mention

more particularly as occurring there two or three new species of Sponge, a

Cystidean or two of undescribed form, several minute Braehiopoda, which

range through a considerable space, and a host of trilobites, of which the

more conspicuous genera are Agnostus, Microdiscus, Conocoryplie of four or

five species,'a new genus tEvinnys, allied to Harpides, a new genus Holo-
cephalina, and last of all, the great Parad. Davidis, already well known to

British geologists. It sometimes attains the length of 18 inches.

   The genus Theea here, as elsewhere, accompanies the primordial fossils ; it
is in considerable abundance, and of two or more species.

   Prom a Table which contains the distribution of the fossils in these beds,
and which has been carefully drawn up according to observations made by
Mr. Salter and myself during the last three years, we are enabled to observe
how that many of these species were very short-lived, whilst others on the

contrary ranged through considerable spaces, more particularly the smaller

species, such as Agnostus, Microdiscus, Lingulella, Obolella, &c. This Table
also shows altogether 6 or 7 new geneva of trilobites and about 16 species,
and with brachiopod and pteropod shells, Cystideae and Sponges, an addition

within the last three years to British palaeontology of about 33 new species.

Notes on the Sections and Fossils. By J. W. Saltek, A.L.S.,F.G.S.

myI find but little to say regarding the fossils,  friend and colleague having

forestalled me, and completed in a masterly way the section I roughly

sketched out in 1862. The district around St. David's will soon become

popular, as it exhibits the most accessible section of the Cambrian rocks,

Lower and Upper, to be seen anywhere in "Wales. Those in the estuary of

the Ffestiniog valley are perhaps more complete, but are not seen, except

partially, in coast sections ; and nowhere in one continuous series. More-

over, lying at lower angles of dip, they are extended over a much greater

space.

   Of the following list of 33 species--an ample fauna for the purpose
I may say at once, there are none common to other horizons of the palaeozoic
group, and as the thickness of the series is considerable, 3000 or 4000 feet,
we only follow the precedent of older and better geologists by proposing a
new name. The classic name of the district is Menevia, and we propose
that the term ' Menevian' should stand for the Lower, as the ' Ffestiniog' of
Prof. Sedgwick already stands for the middle and upper groups of the Lin-

gula-flags. The 'Menevian' group, therefore, rests immediately on the
'Harlech' or Bangor group of Prof. Sedgwick, and passes imperceptibly

into it.

The Cambrian groups will then stand as follows :

                ( Tremadoc group (Upper and Lower).

Upper Cambrian (Lingula-flags) < Ffestiniog group (Lingula-flags).

                 Menevian group (Lower Lingula-flags).

"We have here a larger proportion of blind Trilobites, and those without

facial sutures, than in higher formations. Agnostus, Microdisms, and Erin-

nys are destitute of facial suture, and probably of eyes. HolocepTudina seems

to have been furnished with very minute eyes, so far out as nearly to be lost.

And Anopolenus, while it has immense eyes, has a most singular restriction

in the development of the free cheeks, and is in many respects abnormal.

The Braehiopods are such as we were led to expect. Minute and almost

rudimentary forms of Lirigulce and Discince, with some kindred genera, form,

with Theca, the whole of the shells. The Sponge seems to be a peculiar form
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

yet not so different from the Silurian ones as at first supposed. The fibres are
very rudimentary in structure. The Cystidean is as yet imperfectly known.

Perhaps the most curious point about this fauna is the greater resemblance

it bears to the Bohemian primordial group than is borne by any other
member of the Lingula-flag. Tbe Paradoxides which mark several distinct
horizons here, are not known in the Upper Lingula-flag. The species of
Conoeoryplie resemble Bohemian and Spanish types. Erinnys or Harpides
is like the Bohemian species. Holocepludina resembles Arionellus, &c.

   If from such scanty indications we may judge anything, it would be that

the Bohemian primordial group represents our Lower, and not our Upper

Lingula-flags. These last are rich in (Menus, a genus absent altogether from

Bohemia, but abundant in Northern Europe. It is accompanied, according

to Angelin, by Paradoxides in Sweden. But with us, the genera follow a

very regular order. Paradoxides appears first, Anopolenus second, and then

various species of Olenus last.

Several of the forms above catalogued (Microdiscus, Erinnys, &c.) are

found in beds' of the same age near Ffestiniog in North Wales ; and the great

Paradoxides Davidis occurs in black slates on the same horizon at the gold-

mines of Dolgelly, North "Wales (see Decades, Geol. Survey, No. 11, PI. 10).

 We have included in our list those species found in the uppermost grey beds

of the Lower Cambrian                                                                                                                   but all may for the present be included provisionally

Report of the Lunar Committee for Mapping the Surface of the Moon.

   By W. R. Birt, at the request of the Committee, consisting of James

   Glaisher, F.R.S., Lord Rosse, F.R.S., Sir John Herschel, Bart.,

   F.R.S., Professor Phillips, F.R.S., Warren de la Rue, F.R.S.,

The first object of the Committee appointed at Bath in the year 1864 was to

prepare forms suitable for the registration of lunar objects, for recording

original observations, for facilitating the formation of a catalogue, and for
computing the coordinates of the positions of objects. The results of the

labours of the Committee are now presented to the Association in the shape
of Form No. 1, for recording observations ; Form No. 2, for facilitating the
arrangement of objects in a catalogue ; Form No. 3, for recording the posi-

tions, extents, heights and depths, brightness and alignments of lunar objects,

with descriptions, synonyms and references to existing authorities ; and Form
No. 4, for computing positions of the second order. The annexed form is

that for recording general observations of the moon.

   By this arrangement objects situated in any area of 5° of longitude and 5°
of latitude may be readily designated, and very readily so after a little prac-
tice, every space on the moon being thus classified and designated by a Roman

Capital with a small Greek character as the index : thus an object situated

between 40° and 45° of longitude and 25° and 30° of latitude will be desig-

nated by F"5, while another situated between 20° and 25° of longitude and

A20° and 25° of latitude will be designated by without the Greek index. It

is intended to distinguish the separate objects by the Arabic numerals, thus,

A* 6.

 --It is intended to collect in Tables various information appertaining to each

object as its selenographical coordinates, degree of reflective power, height

or depth as the case may be, accompanied by references to more detailed

descriptions, previous notices, drawings, and maps, including photographs,

each separate Table being headed with one of the symbols in the annexed
Table. Thus the Table which is intended to include all objects between 5°

and 10° of longitude and 10° and 15° of latitude in Quadrant I. will be headed

I. Am ;  in  Quadrant II.,  II. Am ;  in  Quadrant III.,  III.  Am             and in  Quadrant
                                                                            ;

IV., IV. Am.

When a sufficient number of objects are entered in the above-mentioned

Tables, it is intended to arrange them in zones of 5° of latitude, each zone

consisting of two parts, west and east, the dividing line being the central
meridian, 0° of longitude, mean libration. The zones are arranged as in the

preceding Table; in which the numerals indicating zones I. and II., each from
0° to 5° of latitude north and south of the equator ; III. and IV., each from
5° to 10° of latitude also north and south of the equator, and so on, to zones

XXXV. and XXXVL, are placed over the respective latitudes which deter-

mine them. By this arrangement zones I., III., V., VII., &c. belong to the

north part of the moon's visible hemisphere in Quadrants I. and II., and
zones II., IV., VI., VIII., &c, to the south part of the moon's visible hemi-
sphere in the Quadrants IV. and III.

In those instances in which the longitudes of objects exceed 90°, being

brought into view by changes of libration, the nomenclature is carried on

for example, an object having 93° W. longitude and 3° N. latitude is desig-

Dnated by the symbol I.     s
                               .

   In respect to the use of this Form, the Mare Orisium may be adduced as
an example of employing the symbols for designating objects. The surface
of this Mare is extended upon twelve areas, as follows :

   The following Table exhibits the mode in which the existence of an object,
when once ascertained, may be readily recorded, and the object itself so
designated that very little, if any, difficulty may be experienced by future

observers in identifying it. It is intended that the symbols appropriated to

the objects described shall be unalterable, I CA1 , for example, always pointing
out the crater Picard. The forty-nine objects symbolized in the Table have

In order to arrange the objects seen on the moon's surface in a systematic

and orderly manner, with a view to the formation of a catalogue, we must in

the first instance adopt some means by which we may so fix an object
observed that it may ever after in all time be sufficiently identified by all

future observers. Hevelius laid the foundation of this process, although the

nomenclature of his successor, Riccioli, has been grasped firmly by the astro-

nomical mind, so that the larger features and craters are now so readily

recognized, and in one way or another brought before the attention of astro-

nomers, that we should as soon expect to lose sight of Sirius, Lyra, Arcturus,

Capella, Regulus, or any of the brighter stars, as to experience any difficulty

in identifying Copernicus, Tycho, Plato, Hipparchus, Ptolemaeus, Gassendi,

the Mare Crisium, the Mare Nectaris, or any of the more conspicuous craters

and regions of the moon ; but as there are smaller stars in the heavens

requiring the aid of catalogues for their exact identification, especially when

used as comparison stars in the observations of small planets, comets, &c,

so in several questions connected with lunar physics, there are small objects,

forming in many instances portions of the larger features, that require to be
particularly specified, especially when questions of sujiposed change obtrude

themselves and claim a hearing, a small crater or apparently insignificant

mountain being adduced as evidence. In the present state of selenography

we cannot say positively of any object " it is new." All questions of this

kind that may be raised must be left in doubt. Astronomical juries cannot
A --agree on their verdicts.
                great authority thus expressed himself: " Al-

though not in a position myself, after twenty-five years' close observations of

this kind, to bring forward even one certain example of new formation, when
the question is confined to crater forms, yet I am far from disputing the fact

of the existence of new formations on the moon" *. Close and systematic

record, as well as close and unremitting observation, is necessary to be able

to settle a question of this kind, and the record shoxdd embrace the results of

the observations of all observers. The symbols alluded to under the head of
Form No. 2, to be inserted in column 2 of Form No. 3 (see page 296), appear

to be suitable for accomplishing this object; more than 1000 lunar objects

being absolutely fixed as to all future identification by their means, provided

certain elements, hereafter to be named, are ascertained.

The next step in the formation of a catalogue is the determination of the

exact positions of the objects symbolized. This has been done with more

or less accuracy in numerous instances,'the coordinates (latitudes and longi-

tudes) of many objects having been settled from observation, nevertheless

these  already  settled points will  not  appear  numerous                                              as  the  process  of
                                                                                                     ;

symbolizing proceeds, they will be found on the 1440 sheets of Form No. 3

requisite for drawing out the catalogue, few and far between ; and in order to

increase them, the use of the micrometer, or of a meridional instrument, will

be essential. There are three methods by which these points may be fixed.

First, by differences of right ascension and declination between the preceding

or following, and upper or lower limbs of the moon and the object, the lati-

tude and longitude of which is to be determined. This method was em-

ployed by M. Bouvard at the Eoyal Observatory of Paris in 1808 to 1810.
From a series of 124 such differences in each direction, M. Nicollet deter-

mined the selenographical latitude and longitude of the crater Manilius, and

also the amount of the moon's libration. Second, by measures taken with

the micrometer between the apparent east and west and north or south limbs

of the moon and the object. This method, proposed by Encke, has been
employed by Lohrmann and Beer and Madler. Third, by measuring the

lengths and position-angles of two lines on the moon's surface ; one joining

two objects, the coordinates of which have been already determined by one

of the'methods above mentioned; the other joining one of the same two ob-
jects, and a third, the position of which is to be determined. The difference
of the position-angles will give the angle between the two lines from which,

with the lengths of the two lines, the position of the third object may be

known. Beer and Madler employed this method for the determination of

positions of the second order.

   The latitudes and longitudes of lunar objects require to be expressed by

X Ythe rectangular coordinates and in parts of the moon's semidiameter,

which is regarded as unity. This is for the purpose of properly inserting

them in a map on the orthographical projection. The latitude of an object,
Xwhich we may call /3, being its distance from the moon's equator,
                                                                    is

Xequal to the sine of the latitude or ft, and the expression for  becomes

X=sin /3. The longitude of an object, which is designated \, is its distance

east or west from the moon's central meridian on the same projection, which

is proportional to multiplying the sine of the longitude into the co-

sine of the latitude ; for on the equator the longitudes are simply pro-
portional to the sines, the distance of an object 30° E. longitude, for

example, from the centre of the moon's disk on the equator is equal to the
natural sine of 30° or 0-5 ; but at 10° of latitude and 30° of longitude, an

object is nearer the moon's central meridian in the above-named proportion,

Yand the expression for becomes Y=sin \ cos (3, which, when computed,

gives 0-49240, and we have X=0-17365, Y=0-49240. In Form No. 3 pro-

vided by the Committee the column (2) for the reception of the symbols is

followed by four (3/4, 5, and 6), for inserting the values of the coordinates

X and Y, and the latitudes and longitudes.

   Next to position comes size or extent of lunar objects, which may be

expressed in two ways, and for which the Committee has provided two

columns, one (7) headed " Mag.," a contraction for magnitude, the other (8)
" Miles," in which it is intended to enter the values of the diameters of

lunar craters in English miles, and also, as suggested by W. De la Rue, Esq.,

in French kilometres. As both these elements, magnitude and diameters in

--miles, must be ascertained by measurement estimation being altogether too

--rough a word or two on the method of effecting it may be acceptable. It

is intended to express the magnitude by a number showing the ratio as to
size which the crater, mountain, or spot, dark or light as it may be, bears to

--one chosen as a standard (Dionysius for example) ; any given measure of the

standard, which may be called " s" however the* measures may vary from

time to time, arising from differences of distance, effect of libration, dif-

--ferences in the Hues measured, and other circumstances is considered equal

to unity, and if the measures of any other spots, made on the same evening,

mbe designated a, b, c, d, &c, the magnitude of each will be determined by

the simple formula ?n="> m'=_' m" =.1, and so on.

ss                              s

For the cohimn (8) headed "Miles," it is necessary to measure across the

crater, but as it has been assumed that most of the lunar craters are strictly

circular, and the experience which has been gained relative to the standard

Dionysius, appears to point, in this instance at least, to some irregularity of

form, the determinations of the extent in miles can only be considered as

approximate. Beer and Madler give a list of 149 objects, the diameters of

the presence of colour is immistakeable, from a deep blackish grey to an

almost dazzling whiteness, but also with a gradation of brilliancy, some
spots sinning with a vividness far exceeding others, which, although they

may be regarded as " bright," are yet dull as compared with those that are
more vivid. Some of these spots are supposed to vary in intensity of
brightness, while others may be regarded as tolerably steady; and if some
amount of interest attaches to the smaller features of the moon's surface as

bearing upon the subject or question of change, no less amount of interest
will be found to characterize the range of brilliancy, especially when changes
which cannot altogether be referred to an alteration in the direction of the

incident rays, obtrude themselves on our notice. In the time of Schroter, if

not earlier, an attempt was made to chronicle these gradations of brilliancy
by adopting a decimal scale, in which the absolute absence of light was
regarded as zero, and the brightest spot on the moon's surface was denomi-
nated 10°. Schroter, Lohrmann, and Beer and Madler adopted this nota-
tion, and the first column, under the general heading " Brightness," is

intended to receive the results of a careful examination of all their estima-

tions, as well as the results of future eye-estimations of the brightness of
lunar objects.

It is quite evident that estimations of any element can never command

that reception which instrumental determinations are able to do. With this

view a column has been inserted for receiving the measures of brightness or

reflective power, and it was thought that, by means of an instrument such

as that described by Mr. Dawes at the Meeting of the Eoyal Astronomical

Society, June 9, 1865 (see Monthly Notices, vol. xxv. p. 229), the gradations

of brightness might be measured with facility. The use of the instrument, as

recommended by Mr. Dawes, requires that the feature under examination

should be isolated by means of the solar eyepiece, thus shutting out all rays

from surrounding objects. Doubtless a graduated series of brightnesses may

be obtained in this way which would possess a great amount of value ; but
one feature has presented itself in some trials which were made to asee'rtain

the deepest tint that would quite obscure the brightest spot " Aristarchus."

It was obscured, and perfectly invisible, upon a ground of which the collective
power of reflexion was able to pierce the dark-tinted glass, and not only to

pierce it as a dull light, but also to show the outlines (somewhat indistinctly)

of the brighter and darker spaces on which the brighter spots then visible

were situated                (not  unlike  the  appearance of the  night-side  of the  moon

                          _

illuminated by earth-shine a few days before and after change), the larger

darker spaces coming out with the same intensity as the larger brighter spaces,
so that upon settling the zero-point, the brighter spaces would be positive

and the darker negative ; thus while a zero might be obtained for a collective

reflective power, it would be diflicult to express by the same notation the

absolute brightness of the smaller brighter spots, or the absolute darkness of
the smaller darker spots. This being the case, it is possible a modification of

the homochromascope may be employed with advantage. (See Monthly
Notices of the Eoyal Astronomical Society, vol. xxii. p. 11.)
One very important circumstance that may present itseif to the observer
and one that will assume a much greater degree of importance in the estima-

tion of the selenographer, engaged in symbolizing and cataloguing objects is
the unmistakeahle identification of the smaller features, such as minute craters
Amountains, rills, soft ridges, &c.
                                                simple mode of recognition and identifi-

cation presents itself in the alignment of objects, and for this two objects one
on each side of the object to be identified, will suffice. If, however, it should
298 report-- 1865.

so happen that one on each side cannot be conveniently chosen, three objects
(including the one to be identified) in a line will contribute perhaps quite as

much to finding the object sought. The column (13) in Form No. 3, headed

Alignment, is intended to receive three symbolical references, one being the
object catalogued under the symbol heading the sheet with the Arabic

numeral at the commencement of the line, for example ; II                 : HE""4 :

HE*IIEP , in which              -

                                   represents the crater Piazzi Smyth, and this aligns

with  HE"-1                           2

             andllE* .

The wide column (14) headed "Description" scarcely needs a remark.

The descriptions of objects are intended to be as brief as possible, noting

principally their relative positions, &c. with regard to other objects.

In order that a catalogue, such as the one now in progress, should be per-

fectly efficient and accomplish the object intended, it is manifest that nothing

should be omitted, nor should it be compiled hastily ; the labours of all pre-

vious selenographers should find a place, all synonyms should be inserted,

and references made to existing maps and drawings. With this view a por-

tion of each symbolic sheet of Form No. 3 is devoted to the reception of such

synonyms and references ; the first column (15) being intended for references,

in Roman numerals, to a special catalogue of objects, the descriptions of

which have been drawn up from careful observation with the telescope.

The second column (lfi) in this department of Form No. 3 is intended to

receive an appropriate symbol, which at once indicates whether the object

be a crater, mountain, mountain-chain, rill, low ridge, lucid streak, or other

feature. For this purpose the following symbols are employed :

Craters and depressions are indicated by a small italic character, with an

index number, both inclosed in parentheses thus, (b 1 ).

Confluent    craters            are      thus  shown,         1  :    2

                                                       (c           c ).

Ancient     rings    thus,      (e       5
                                           ).

Valleys     thus,            1

                     all .

Mountains are indicated by a small Roman character, with an index num-

ber, both inclosed in parentheses thus, (a 1 ).

Mountain-chains are indicated in the same way, with a dash under tho

letter thus, (a2 ).

These letters are not to be applied arbitrarily. To each zone of latitude

of 5° a character, Roman or Italic, is especially appropriated. One of these

letters (Italic) is printed at the foot of each column of symbols, under the

head of " Zones and limiting latitudes" in Form No. 2, ranging from a to s,

--they are to be used tlras : If a mountain be found in zone XV. or XVI., viz.,

35° to 40° N. or S. latitude in any quadrant, the symbol pointing it out to be

a mountain is (h), the numbering being consecutive, a catalogue of moun-

tains will ultimately be formed; the same may be said of craters or any

other feature.

   Low ridges are indicated by an Arabic numeral, inclosed in brackets,

thus [2].

   Lucid streaks in the same way with a dash under, thus [6].

   Lucid spots by a number with a cipher below, thus [8 ].
   Dark streaks are shown by the number having two dashes, one above, the

other below, thus [4].

   Dark spots are shown by the addition of a cipher to the left and above,

thus [°6].

Hills are indicated by the symbol 1 .

   It is expected that by the employment of these symbols the distinguishing

character of the feature catalogued may be seen at a glance. It is intended

that the numboring shoidd proceed consecutively, as objects are added to the

separate catalogue in which Eoman Numerals are employed to enumerate

the features observed.

   The communication of J. F. Julius Schmidt, Director of the Observatory at
Athens, to the 'Astronomische Nachrichten' bears so greatly on the subject

of observing the smaller features, that I am induced to give in cvtenso the
translation of it, by W. T. Lynn, B.A., F.B.A.S., of the Royal Observatory,

Greenwich.

" Of late years, several observers in England have occupied themselves

very perseveringly with the special study of the moon's surface, and have

occasionally arrived at conclusions leading to the belief that newly formed

mountain ranges are now being discovered upon the moon. Although not

in a position myself, after twenty-five years' close observations of the kind,

to bring forward even one certain example of new formation, when the

question is confined to crater-forms, yet I am far from disputing the fact of

the existence of new formations upon the moon. I do not, however, seek

them so much amongst the craters, of which thousands of smaller ones,

wanting in Lohemann and Madler, are now from time to time being de-

mytected, but have for about fifteen years past directed          attention especially

to the rills, of which I have newly discovered a very great number, and

amongst these several of remarkable form, easy to be recognized, which

have not been seen since the time of Schroter. With regard to the craters

noticed by Messrs. Webb and Birt, in Marius, in Mersenius, near Delisle, b,
&c, I have known these since the year 1846, and am in possession of

various drawings of them. As importance is being attached to these in-

dividual isolated craters (for which there are indeed good grounds), it may

be here mentioned that I detected on the 2nd and 4th of January in the

Apresent year, in the inner surface of Picard {Mare Orisium), a small

crater, which, together with two others in the northern wall, has escaped

all the observers up to this time, although in a region frequently and par-

ticularly scanned both by Schroter and myself.

" As objects repaying careful investigation, I recommend the extremely

remarkable rill-systems near Eamsden, and a little westerly of Aristarchus,

discovered by me on January 4, 1849, at Bonn, and on May 10, 1862, at
Athens. Any one experienced in this department of observation -who will

consider, under favourable circumstances, the twelve or thirteen extraordi-

nary rills and crater furrows, will perceive for himself how small is the pro-

bability that phenomena so remarkable should for so many years have

escaped the notice of practised observers, merely on account of external

circumstances.

" Athens, Jan. 5, 1865."                 (Signed)          " J. F. Julius Schmidt."

The indefatigable Schroter accumulated a large amount of information

relative to the moon's surface, which he published in two quarto volumes,

entitled " Selenotopographische Fragmente." It is principally arranged as topo-

graphical notices, including, as we have before remarked, numerous measure-

ments of mountains, craters, &c, with estimations of brightness, and accom-

panied with numerous engravings of the sketches and drawings which he
made from time to time. Every conspicuous object, and in many cases very

small objects in peculiar situations, have upon the engravings letters refer-

ring  to a          description  of the  objects  in  the  text.  These delineations and

                 _

descriptions are increasing daily in value, and it is easy to see that labours

such as those of Schmidt, recorded in the above article, are themselves
300 REPORT 1865.

increased in value by the existence of records such as Schroter's, Lohrmann's,
and Beer and Madler's. Lohrmann's sections, with the text, may be placed
in the same category as Schroter's, and his map, with 500 reference-numbers,
but no text, including a very large amount of detail, furnishes material by

which the selenographer may confirm his observations, or by means of it,
objects may be indicated that may have been overlooked, or possibly may
even be new. Beer and Madler's large map is of the same character as
Lohrmann's, but with this advantage, notices of the features on the map (to

which reference-letters, Roman, Italic, or Greek, are attached) are to be
found in the text, affording, with the results of previous labours in the same
field, a large amount of existing material to catalogue ; for it is evident that
features found on the maps and drawings, and referred to in the text, had a
bond fide existence, and were subjects of observation at the three several

epochs. The later and smaller map of Madler is also valuable for reference.

In order to ensure the insertion of these objects in the catalogue, four
columns (17, 18, 19> and 20), having suitable headings, are appropriated
to references to these authorities, the reference-letters and figures being

given when available ; and in other instances, where the objects are found in
the maps or engravings, but without any reference-letters or figures, a dash

--( ) is inserted, the absence of a dash against any object indicating that it is

not to be found in the records of the selenographer whose name is at the head

of the column.

   Of all the aids that we possess to the attainment of a valuable and exten-

sive knowledge of the moon's surface, none are calculated to afford such accu-
rate results, so far as mapping, symbolizing and cataloguing are concerned,

as photography. The large number of negatives produced by Warren De la
Rue, Esq. and the enlargement of them both on glass and paper, must
become of much valuable assistance in the progress of this work. The true

relative positions of objects are capable of being very readily determined,

--and when reference is made to the normal position of mean libration, the
--photograph taken on October 4, 1865, at 9h m 4s mean time, at Cranford

being a standard in this respect, the photographs will contribute in no small
degree to accurate mapping and symbolizing ; other important data are also
obtainable by their means. In order to ensure a careful comparison of all
existing records with the results of photography, a column (21) is inserted,

and headed " De la Rue," in which every object found on the photographs is

--indicated by a dash ( ).

In consequence of the greater foreshortening of the lunar features in pro-

portion as they may be removed from the middle of the disk towards tbc

limb than as represented in the true orthographical projection, Beer and

Miidler considered it necessary to limit the points to be determined by mea-

surements of the second order to such as lie near the sides of their measured

triangles, of which they give the sides and angles in ' Der Mond,' pp. 78-83.

These measured triangles amount to 176. They also considered it important,

both for convenience and accuracy, that the angle \p should be small ; and if

ACit were necessary to include a larger angle, the distance                                                    should be

shorter than if the angle were smaller. It would appear from the example

given on p. 87 of ' Der Mond,' that their measurements were effected on the

Aline AB, from the point

Dtowards B as far as                                    (see                       Fig. 2.

The Committee has not only given a considerable share of its attention to

the preparation of Forms Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, but also to the subject matter

to be entered in them. The resolution appointing the Committee states,

on the moon's surface." At the time of the appointment of the Committee,
I had made 291 series of observations, which were commenced as early as

January 6, 1860.

   During the year, between the Meetings of the Association at Bath and
Birmingham, I have lost no opportunity of increasing the number of observa-

tions, and have made 124 series, which are equivalent to 124 nights of

observation. These observations amounted to 416 series at the time of the

Meeting  at  Birmingham                                                     and,  with  33  made    since,  now  amount  to  449.
                                                                     ;

The whole are of various kinds, including physical examinations of several

portions of the moon's surface, particularly of the crater "Plato," every

crater, mountain, ridge, plain, or other feature that had been the subject of

observation being distinctly specified in the observations. Numerous micro-

metrical measurements for the magnitudes and positions of objects are also
included. The whole of these observations are in process of being examined,

reduced, and classified, and the results entered in Form No. 3.

   The series of observations between January 5, 1860, and September 22,
1863, amounting to 176, were made with two telescopes. The one most
extensively used in London was the Sheepshank's Telescope No. 5, lent by
the Council of the Koyal Astronomical Society expressly for the purpose of
lunar researches. The diameter of the object glass is 2-75 inches. It is

furnished with three powers, is mounted on a tripod, and has vertical and

horizontal motions in altitude and azimuth. The observations not made
with this instrument were made during various visits to Hartwell with the

Equatorial of 5-9 inches aperture.

   Early in January 1863, the Council of the Royal Society voted a sum of
money for the construction of a telescope with an object glass of 4| inches
diameter, under the superintendence of Warren De la Rue, Esq., suitable
for the work in which I was then and am still engaged. This was completed

in September 1863, and has since been employed in the observations, stated

visits during the period that has elapsed between June 1863 and September
1865 having been made to Hartwell, at Dr. Lee's request, for the purpose of
continuing the observations with the Hartwell Equatorial.

.At the time of the appointment of this Committee, I had drawn up preli-

minary forms for the insertion of various data appertaining to objects on the

moon's surface, a large amount being scattered over the works of Schroter,

Lohrmann, and Beer and Madler.                                                    myIt was then, and still is,   intention to

increase these data by observation, and enter them in Form No. 3, each

object, as before mentioned, being designated by a symbol. When the Asso-

ciation met at Bath in 1864, 386 separate objects had been entered in the

preliminary Forms                                                           62 of these have since  been transferred to Form No. 3,
                                                                         j

which, with 399 entered independently, make 461 objects entered in Form

No. 3, the total number of objects now catalogued being 785*.

    Early in December 1863 I conceived the idea of forming a catalogue of
lunar objects, as I had met with considerable difiiculty in recording many,

especially the smaller features, in such a way as readily to identify them
afterwards. At that time I had accumulated a number of observations* first,

of the crater ' Plato ' and its immediate neighbourhood, and afterwards of the
N.W. portion of the Mare Imbrium, including all the mountains which are
scattered over its surface, which have been named the * Teneriffe' Mountains,
to commemorate « an astronomer's experiment,' as recorded in Professor Piazzi
Smyth's work entitled < Teneriffe.'

In the course of my observations several remarkable features of the moon's

                                                                            * Now augmented to 1002.
--304 report 1865.

surface have been presented to my notice ; and here I would remark that

observations of this kind differ considerably from ordinary astronomical

observations ; many of the features appear to be exceedingly evanescent, and

can only be detected on rare occasions, and these at considerable intervals,
the one from the other ; a very slight alteration in the direction of the inci-
dent or reflected ray suffices to render an object in-visible which a few hours
before might have been seen with distinctness, and good measures of it ob-

tained. Webb has alluded to this where he says, in his ' Celestial Objects for
common Telescopes,' p. 54, " As the angle of illumination increases, a fresh
aspect of things creeps in, and this aspect is such that we may sometimes
catch the whole, sometimes a portion, sometimes nothing of many a familiar
feature." It is therefore important to seize the opportunity when presented

for examining carefully a district the illumination of which is such as to
bring out in strong relief the most minute features discernible. During a
period of nearly seven years' observations, there are some features that I have
seen only four or five times, and some only once. The rill-system on the
S.W. of Triesnecker I have seen favourably only on one occasion, nearly

twelve months since, and that after waiting many months to obtain it. After

carefully scanning the surface of the moon, should an opportunity of the kind

now alluded to be presented, no time should be lost, nor trouble spared in

obtaining as correct a record as possible of the details visible. The following
are a few of the instances in which remarkable features have been brought
out with extraordinary distinctness, so much so as to mark out distinctly the

--boundaries of individual regions.
   The Plain of Dionj/sius. " On the morning of January 18, 1865, between

5 and 7 a.m., the subject of observation was the great Rill of Ariadanis dis-
covered by Schroter, and described, under this head, by Beer and Madler.
It was well situated, both as regarded visual and illuminating angles ; and I
noticed that south of the rill, between Ariadseus and Silberschlag, the surface,
which forms a somewhat extensive plain, is slightly depressed, much in the

--same way as the surface on one side of the Straight Wall is lower than the

other, with this difference the rill of Ariadaeus appears to have resulted
from a crack ; and throughout the length above specified the depth of the
rill is plainly perceptible by its shadow. The depressed plain south of the
rill is extensive ; the four portions of it are symbolized, and in progress of

--entry in Form No. 3.
    The Valley J. J. Cassini. " In the course of Mr. Webb's correspondence,
that gentleman has communicated an account of the recoveiy of one of
Schroter's valleys, named by him J. J. Cassini, which, although appearing on
Beer and Madler's map, does not bear the name appropriated by Schroter.

   On the morning of the 9th of February, 1865, I had an opportunity of
comparing Schroter's drawing of J. J. Cassini with the moon ; and although
the weather prevented that full examination which I desired to make of the

region, yet the general accuracy of Schroter's drawing was unmistakeable.
The state of libration was such as to bring the objects into full view with
less foreshortening ; and although the form of the valley J. J. Cassini was not
precisely as Schroter has given it, yet the general outline and the neighbour-
ing craters fix Schroter's drawing to the part of the moon which he describes
in his text; accordingly Beer and Madler's statement, to the effect that
Schroter's drawing is irreconcileable with the surface of the moon, appears

to be without foundation *.

   * This statement of Beer and Madler appears to have originated from Schroter mis-
naming some craters in the neighbourhood.
       ON MAPPING THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.     305

  -- --The Table Land Terra Photographica. A few months ago Warren De

la Kue, Esq., presented to the Committee an enlarged photograph of the

moon (in four compartments), taken a few days after the first quarter, and
directed the attention of Dr. Lee and myself to an elevated tract surrounded
by the craters Cysatus, Curtius, Zach*, DeLuc, Maginus, and Clavius, which

he had discovered during the progress of his photographic experiments . . .

It is proposed, in accordance with Mr. De la Rue's suggestion, to designate
this Table Land ' Terra Photographica' (De la Rue). I have carefully com-

pared the region with Lohrmanu's and Beer and Madler's maps, and find a
portion of it very imperfectly represented by Beer and Miidler, with some of
the coordinates apparently misplaced. I have also obtained two series of
observations of its physical character. Under ordinary states of the atmo-
sphere, a few craters appear on its surface ; but on August 1, 1865, at Hart-
well, the surface of the plain was seen to be pitted with numerous small

craters ; and at a still later period I found that it consisted of a depressed
basin, with highly elevated rugged land abutting on Clavius, and an interest-
ing mountain-chain. Beer and Madler describe another mountain-chain,

--which I have not seen, nor does it appear prominently on the photograph.
   The great Rill of Ariadceus. -The Rev. T. W. Webb refers in his work on

Celestial Objects to a minute prolongation of this rill through the portion of

the Mare Tranquillitatis near Sabine and Ritter, detected by Gruithuisen
and Kunowsky ; a small portion only was seen by Beer and Madler. I
succeeded in observing it on October 20, 1864, and have seen it since. It
has also been seen on two or three occasions since October 1864 by Mr.
Freeman at Mentone, in the Alpes Maritimes. Mr. Freeman has traced it to

the group Ritter, Sabine, &c.

   Among the observations of an instrumental character, I may mention some

" that are differential of the second order, and which have reference to five

groups now under systematic observation, both physically and instrumentally,
as the state of illumination and other circumstances may allow, viz., the

Picard group, the Posidonius group, the Dionysius group, the Gassendi group,
and the Triesnecker group, each crater (or in some cases mountains within
them) forming a central point ; the angles and distances of each measured
object being referred to a standard line, the coordinates of the two extremi-

ties having been determined by Beer and Madler.

       APPENDIX.

   Translation of a Letter from the Director of the Observatory at Athens,

                  J. E. Julius Schmidt, to Mr. W. R. Birt, London.

   Your favour of the 23rd of September with which you honoured me is in

my possession, t beg leave to answer your inquiry at once and in general,
partly to show a mark of my sympathy for the interest you take concerning

the topography of the moon, partly to make known to you and others the
limits within which I have been occupied on the same object during a quarter

of a century.

   Passing over in silence my observations before the year 1842, I allude

only to those which afford a topographical interest, and that are at present of
some utility to me. Since June 1842 I could employ more powerful tele-

scopes, and the sketches of detailed landscapes of the moon were obtained

A* crater between Zach and De Luc, perfectly visible in the photograph, but not on

Beer and Madler's map, forms part of the boundary of the "Terra Photographica." It

is proposed to name it " Pollock, C.B."

partly at Hohenfeld, near Hamburg, and partly with the instruments of the

observatory in that town. In the year 1845 I observed the moon but seldom,

at the observatory at Bilk, near Dusseldorf. From 1846 to 1853 I have
obtained at Bonn, and from 1853 to 1858 at Olmutz, many sketches ; and with

the refractor of the observatory at Olmutz I made and reduced 4000 micro-

metrical measures of the altitudes of the mountains of the moon. In the

interim I was twice so fortunate as to be able to apply refractors of the first

class to the moon, by the kindness of Encke and Bruhns in Berlin (1849),

and by the favour of Secchi in Rome (1855). Since 1860 I have con-

tinued these labours at Athens, partly because the very defective condition

of this observatory is such that I could not participate in greater researches,

or in those which appear more important at the present day. Perceiving, in

January 1865, that I coidd not with satisfaction continue to neglect the mass

myof accumulated material, I considered it necessaiy to unite all  sketches

in one great picture or plan ; and I resolved at once to undertake that labo-

rious work, without contemplating any publication. I selected a scale double

that of the charts of Lohrmann and Madler, giving my general chart, consist-

ing of four folios, a radius of 3 feet, or about '2 metres diameter. This is now,

with the assistance of my original sketches (nearly 1000), so far accomplished

that the positions of the principal objects are laid down ; and even in the

landscapes near the limb but little is wanting. The chart exhibits already

a considerable progression, and will probably be completed in two or three

years. I chose the method of those authors, and took for points of the first

and second order the data of Madler and Lohrmann. ' The whole detail is

based upon my own observations only.

The edition of Lohrmann's works was transferred to me from the pub-

lishers in Leipzig iu the year 1854. The copper plates of all the twenty-five

sections, with the exception of part of the shading, are completed, and I

possess already a perfect copy. In the text to this chart I shall give a

critical comparison with Madler. Both in their way form well-executed

charts for the selenographical local determinations, the proper and true basis

of the more modern selenography of which Tobias Mayer laid the first foun-

dation. Let us continue in trying, by the aid of more powerful telescopes,

to represent the topography of the yet undelineated details of the surface of

the moon, without, however (so far from setting a determinate limit), being

able to see the end of such a work ; it is as if from the ordinary determina-

tions of place of the brighter stars down to the eighth magnitude one passed

on to that of the stars in the Milky Way.

The study of the rills has particularly occupied me during the last fifteen

years. The resemblance of numerous transformations and combinations of

the rills and craters, has led me to the opinion that all rills present only

volcanic phenomena, like all the rest of the moon. The study of the topo-

graphy of our satellite will at onee become very important for our geology.

But it is a great error to believe that a survey once or twice of a mountain

of the moon would entitle us to make certain comparisons or to arrive at

certain conclusions. I find, after many years' minute observations, that at

present it is prudent to avoid all speculations, and at first and before all

things to establish an extended topography in conformity with our present

means, free from contracted views, and so far exact and searching that we
may hope thereby to give satisfaction to a remote posterity. That was
also the opinion of Alexander von Humboldt, with whom I had often, from

1853 to 1856, communications on the subject. I myself have never been in

possession of sufficient means to produce anything important for selenography,
/

and have been obliged to content myself with small contributions ; but I
abandon not the hope that I shall yet be enabled to make observations with

great instruments.

   Respecting the rills, I have now ready for printing a small pamphlet, in
which are classified, up to February 1865, all those known to me. I hope

to get it published in Leipzig. It contains 425, and these are divided in the

following order :

        From 1787 to 1801 Schrbter discovered 11 rills.

        ,, 1823 ,, 1827 Lohrmann ,,  75 ,,

        ,, 1832 ,, 1841 Madler   ,, 55 ,,

        ,, 1847 ,, 1848 Kinau    ,, 6,,

        ,, 1842 ,, 1865 Schmidt  ,, 278 ,,

Since that time I have discovered thirty or forty new rills. I point out as

particularly remarkable the systems I observed in 1849-1862 near Rams-
den and Aristarchus. The rills near the southern capes of the Apennines,

Hyginus, Ariadseus, and Sabine, are in connexion with that of Goclenius, as

rills are existing in the plain near Torricelli; I enclose only a few slight

sketches of remarkable rills, which, in case they should not yet be known to
English astronomers, may give occasion to future researches. Those who are
in possession of large telescopes should not neglect to make drawings of

craters of the most minute kind, which are visible even in very small and

well-limited regions, as the craters in Plato, Archimedes, Hevelius, Gassendi,

Mersenius, Marius, ike.

    Less important appears to me the study of such disturbed formations as
Maginus and Longomontanus, because here we may never arrive at certain

 conclusions, for all the territory appears to consist only of craters of the

smallest kind. As other objects of a rigorous and searching examination,
I mention those little craters, crater-rows, crater-rills, that, situated in the

interior of the ring mountains, form the limits of the plain and the be-
ginning of the wall mountain. Here the eruptive forms have issued, as it

were, out of cracks, and in parts of considerable and high mountains, where
two mountain-masses, approaching each other, form a narrow valley, or a sharp

corner. Just as important is the parallelism of many little craters, where
they, as on Etna, cover .the exterior of the walls of the mountains. Among

such forms, spoken of to the fullest extent of the word, I class such bodies as

Copernicus, with his many hundred neighbouring craters. But in a more

limited sense, however, I comprehend examples, such as the craters outside
of the north wall of Newton, where the wall mountains, covered with

craters, slope against the south-east wall of Moretus. But everywhere a
keen and unprejudiced course of observation will indicate that rills are only
crater-rows in a particular modification, as the innumerable transformation
forms prove, and as Madler first pointed out.

In the climate of Hellas (still more so in that of the more southern isles),

so favourable for astronomical observations of every kind, many of the most

important problems would in a short time be solved, if a practised . observer,

completely free from hypothetical views, were furnished with the necessary

means.                                                   e

 --Postscript. Since the above Report was drawn up, an outline Map of the

Moon, of 100 inches in diameter, has been commenced, and is now in pro-

gress. Tbe positions of 105 points of the first order, as given in Beer and
Madler's ' Der Mond,' pp. 77, 78, form the basis of measurement for all the
features discernible upon the photograph taken by Warren De la Rue, Esq.,
on October 4th, 1865, a short time before contact with the Earth's shadow,
and when the apparent disk was not far from a state of mean libration. In

this Map every important feature of the Full Moon will be laid down from

measurements on the photograph referred to the equator and central meri-

dian.

      Report of the Committee on Standards of Electrical Resistance,

The Committee consists of Professor Williamson, Professor Wheatstone, Pro-

      fessor W. Thomson, Professor Miller, Dr. A. Matthiessen, Mr. Fleeming
      Jenkin, Sir Charles Bright, Professor Maxwell, Mr. C. W. Siemens,

       Mr. Balfour Stewart, Dr. Joule, and Mr. C. F. Varley.

The Committee has the pleasure of reporting that the object for which they
were first appointed has now been accomplished.

    The unit of electrical resistance has been chosen and determined by fresh
experiments; the standards have been prepared, and copies of these standards
have been made with the same care as was employed in adjusting the stan-
dards themselves; seventeen of these copies have been given away, and

                                                                                                                                                                                         L

sixteen have been sold.
    The chief work of the Committee this year has been done by Dr. A. Mat-

thiessen. Last year's Report announced the completion of the experiments
determining the resistance in absolute measure of a certain coil of German-
silver wire. Taking this coil as the basis, Dr. Matthiessen, assisted by Mr. C.
Hockin, prepared ten standards, each expressing the British Association unit
of electrical resistance ; two of these standards are coils of platinum wire,
two are coils of wire drawn from a gold-silver alloy, two are coils of wire
drawn from a platinum-iridium alloy, and the remaining two are tubes of
 mercury.

    The wires employed in the coils are from 0'5 millini. to 0-8 millim. dia-
 meter, and range from one to two metres in length. They are insidated with
 white silk, and are wound round a long hollow bobbin of brass. The wires
 are imbedded in solid paraffin, and enclosed in a thin brass case, which allows

 the coils to be plunged in a bath of water by which their temperature may
 be conveniently regulated and observed. Two short copper terminals project
 from the case and are forked at their ends, so that they may be connected
 with the Wheatstonc's balance in the manner recommended by Professor W.

 Thomson, avoiding the error due to the possible resistance of connexions.
 The mercury standards consist of two glass tubes about three-quarters of a
 metre in length.

     These ten standards are equal to one another and to the British Association
 unit, at some temperature stated on the coil or tube, and lying between 14°-5
 andl6°-5C.

    None of them, when correct, differ more than 0-03 per cent, from their

 value at 15°-5 C.

     In the choice of the material, of which the standards are constructed, the

Committee have been. much assisted by the experiments on permanency made

by Dr. Matthiessen.

Silver and copper were found to alter in their resistance simvly by age.

German silver was also found to alter in some cases.

These materials had therefore to be rejected. Gold appears constant, but

owing to its low specific resistance a considerable length would have been

required, unless a wire had been adopted of very small diameter. This was

not thought desirable, for several reasons ; any slight decay or injury in the

surface of a small wire woidd cause much greater alteration in the resistance

Athan the same injury to a large wire.  small wire would be more liable to

mechanical injury, and would be much more rapidly heated by the passage

of currents. The Committee having rejected small wires for these reasons,
thought it unnecessary to incur the expense of a large and thick gold wire.

The great change of resistance caused by a change of temperature furnished
another reason for rejecting gold and other pure metals. One pair of

standards was, however, made of platinum, which appeared the most suitable
of all the pure metals. Platinum and the three alloys named appear all to
be very constant, that is to say, their resistance is not altered by age, or

even by being subjected to considerable heat and recooled.

These materials also possess considerable mechanical strength ; they are

not easily injured by chemical action, they have considerable specific resist-

ance, and that resistance, in the case of the three alloys, changes little with

a change of temperature.

It is of course impossible to say with certainty that their resistance will net

vary with time, but it is most unlikely that the resistance of all will vary in
the same ratio. If, therefore, as is hoped, the eight coils made of such

different materials retain their relative values, some confidence may be felt

in the permanence of the unit.

Some additional security is given by the power of reproducing the unit, if lost,

by chemical means, or by fresh experiments on absolute electro-magnetic mea-

sure, although neither of these means at present appear to give such pei feet

accuracy as would be secured by the permanency of a material standard. Fresh

absolute experiments of the kind described in previous Reports would hardly re-

produce the same value much within one part in a thousand, and Dr. Mattbies-

sen,as appears from last year's Report, is not veiy sanguine of obtaining a better

result than tins by chemical means. Thus a difference exists in Dr. Siemens'

and Dr. Matthiessen's reproduction of a unit by means of merctuy, as

pointed out in last year's Report. It is of course probable that differences of

this kind will in time disappear, and Mr. Siemens fairly points out that the

discrepancy mentioned in last year's Report, between coils made from a very

old and those made from a new determination of the mercury unit, affords
no criterion of the accuracy w7ith which mercury can now be used as a means
of reproduction. Dr. Siemens was the first person who produced numerous

sets of coils accurately adjusted ; and although unable to recommend the

adoption of his unit of resistance, the Committee once more take an oppor-

tunity of expressing their sense of the high value of Dr. Siemens's researches

on the reproduction of units by means of mercury. Dr. Siemens is confident

that a unit can be and has been reproduced by means of mercury with an

accuracy of 0-05 per cent. ; but meanwhile, the chief security for the per-
manency of the unit consists in the preservation of standards constructed in

various ways and of various materials.

AThe mercury tubes furnish an additional security.          molecular change

may occur in the wires, that is to say, they may become of harder or softer
310 REPORT--1865.

temper, they may be injured chemically in course of time by some action on
their surface ; it is just possible that the repeated passage of currents may
alter them in some way, although we have no reason as yet to expect such

an alteration.
    Mercury is free from all these objections. Its temper cannot vary, and as

it would be purified afresh on each occasion, it will be chemically uninjured.

   On the other hand, some fresh dangers may occur in its use. The tubes
themselves may alter in time, or the mercury may not always be absolutely

pure. Absolute security cannot be had, but the choice of a variety of
materials will probably prevent any serious alteration from occurring without

detection.

    The copies which have been issued are similar in form to the standard

coils, but the terminals are simple thick copper rods, intended to be dipped

in mercury cups. The security given by this mode of connexion is sufficient
for all ordinary purposes, and it was feared that the use of the double termi-
nals might not be everywhere understood. The platinum- silver alloy has
been used in all the copies. Wire made of this alloy is very strong and
ductile. It can, for instance, be drawn down to a diameter of 0-0002 inch. Its
resistance is not permanently altered even by a great change of temperature,
and even annealing hardly affects it. Moreover, the change in its resistance
due to a variation of 1° Centigrade is at ordinary temperature only 0-032 per
cent., being less than that of any other alloy tested. It is also a commercial
alloy, which has been long used by dentists ; and Dr. Matthiessen points out, as
a curious coincidence, that many commercial alloys coincide with proportions
indicating peculiar electrical properties. Vide Appendix A.

   The copies of the standard have been supplied for £2 : 10s. in boxes with

small mercury cups for the connexion, and with a printed direction for use
inside the box, stating the temperature at which that particular coil is equal
to 1 B.A. unit.

  A satisfactory proof of the accuracy with which these coils have been pre-

pared was given by four independent observations, by practical electricians
not belonging to the Committee, of the relative value of four distinct B.A. coils,
and four independent standards issued by Dr. Siemens.

   These four observations gave of 10456, 10455, 10456 and 10457 as the
measure of Siemens's standard, in terms of the B.A. units, proving the accuracy
both of Dr. Siemens's work and that of the Committee.

   Twenty coils were to be distributed gratis, and seventeen have actually

--been given away to the following recipients :

   The Directors of Public Telegraphs in

France.      Spain.  Prussia.

Austria.  Italy.     Sweden and Norway.

Belgium.  Portugal.  Russia

India.               Victoria.
Queensland.
                     New South Wales.

Also to Professor Kirchhoff, Dr. Joule, Professor Neumann, and Professor
Weber.

    Three remain for distribution. Sixteen have been sold. Dr. Faraday, on
behalf of the Royal Institution, was the first purchaser.

   In distributing the coils, it was thought best not to give them to institu-
tions, where they woidd probably have laid on a shelf useless and unknown,
but rather to distribute them widely, where they might become available to

practical electricians.
ON STANDARDS OF ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE.                             311

   The new unit has been actually employed to express the tests of the

Atlantic Telegraph Cable. Mr. Varley promises that the unit shall in future
be the basis of the coils used by the Electric and International Company.

    Sir Charles Bright promises that the unit shall be exclusively used by the
British and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company.

  A standard has been supplied to the Boyal Engineers at their request. The

head of the Telegraph Department in India has introduced the unit, and
there is little doubt that the British Colonies generally will adopt it.

   More time will certainly be required to introduce it on the Continent. The
Erench Government has taken no steps to ensure its introduction, but
M. Blavier, the official editor of the ' Annales Telegraphiques,' has promised
his cordial support to the Committee. The Austrian Government has pro-

mised to use the coils experimentally, and the German gentlemen to whom

coils were given have promised to give their best assistance.
   Coils "have also been bought by the managers of two large telegraphic

establishments in Switzerland, at Neuchatel, and Zurich. There is there-

fore reason to hope that the unit may come into extensive use.

    "When standard galvanometers, Lcyden jars, and electrometers are issued,
all forming part of one coherent and necessary system, it is probable that the
B.A. unit will be found so much more useful than any other as to supplant
them entirely. Until these further issues take place, it will only be adopted

either by men who can understand the advantage given by it in calculation, or
by electricians who feel confidence in the recommendations of your Committee.

   With a view to experiments which will allow of these further issues of
electrical units, a large electrodynamometer has been designed, and is nearly
complete. Graduated Leyden jars, with air as the only dielectric, have also

been designed and are nearly ready for use. An apparatus for the determi-

nation of the quantity called v in Appendix C of the 1363 Keport is in the
same condition. Prof. W. Thomson has for some time had ready apparatus

for absolute measiu-ements of electrical effects, but his connexion with the
Atlantic Cable has suspended his work. Dr. Joule promises fresh measure-
ments of the mechanical coefficient of heat, and has only been delayed by
the want of experiments which other members of the Committee must pre-

viously complete.

   In conclusion, the Committee are at last able to report one positive result,

but they feel that much more remains to be done.

A.--Appendix  On the Construction of the Copies of the B.A. Unit.

Bij A. Matthiessex, F.B.S., and Mr. Charles Hockin.

The standard coil used in the experiments at King's College, described in the
Report of your Committee for 1864, was put into our hands about last

Christmas, in order that unit-coils representing a resistance equal to ten

million metres per second in Weber's electro-magnetic system might be made

from it.
   Since that time several unit-coils have been made and issued.

  We propose to state the method by which these coils were made, and the

reasons for choosing the particidar alloy which has been adopted for the con-
ductor. The alloy referred to is composed of 66 per cent, of silver and 33

of platinum.

   This alloy possesses many properties which fit it for the use to which it has

been put.

  --As to its electrical properties :
                                                             --:

--312 repokt 1865.

   I. It alters less in electrical resistance with changes of temperature than

any other known alloy.
   The importance of this point needs hardly to be enforced on any one who

has used resistance-coils.

   The increment in the resistance of the alloy due to a change of tempera-
ture from 0° to 100° C. is only 3-2 per cent.

   II. The conducting-power of the alloy is very low, and is about one-half
that of German silver.

   III. The conducting-power of the alloy is not altered by baking, that is
by exposing it to a temperature of about 100° C. for several days.

    This is a property of great importance, for it has been observed that those
conductors which do not alter by baking, do not alter by age either. The
experiments by which this has been established have been published in for-

mer Reports.
   IV. The conducting-power of a wire of the alloy is little altered by

annealing.

Further, the alloy does not oxidize by exposure to the air ; it does not readily

alloy with mercury ; it makes a sufficiently pliable wire, and can be drawn to

a very great degree of fineness. Dentists have made considerable rise of it

in consequence of its good chemical and mechanical properties*. Of this

alloy, twenty unit-coils have been made and sent to several leading electri-

cians at home and abroad. The form of bobbin adopted for putting up the

wire, and shown in Plate X. fig. 1, has been found very convenient, as it can

be immersed in water during an observation. The wire is twice coated with

silk, and protected by being imbedded in solid paraffin.

   Besides the coils already mentioned, ten unit-coils have been made, which

will be deposited at the Kew Observatory.

Any one possessing a copy of the B.A. unit may have it compared at any

future time against one of these coils for a small payment.

Of the coils to be sent to Kew, two are of the platinum-silver alloy,

two of the gold-silver alloy, two of a platinum-indium alloy, and two of

commercially pure platinum. Two mercury units have also been prepared.

With so many coils for reference, made of such different metals, it appears

quite improbable that the unit now proposed should be lost.

Along Avith the above-mentioned coils will be preserved the standard coil

used in the experiments first referred to, the coil used in the similar experi-

ments made by your Committee in 1863, and several copies of these coils.

Of the coil called "June 4th" in the Report of your Committee for 1863, two

German-silver copies have been made. Of the other coil used in 1864, two

German-silver, two gold-silver, and one platinum-silver copy have been made.

These coils have twice been recompared together at intervals of three

months, and will be again compared, and if they are still found not to have

Kewaltered, will be deposited at the  Observatory for reference, their values

being engraved on them.

   The method adopted to obtain the unit from the standard which had at a
certain temperature a resistance of 4-6677 B.A. units was this :

   Coils were made with the following approximate resistances, viz.

Two coils nearly equal to one-half a unit, called ^(a) and g(b).

               ,,  ,, one unit          ,, 1 (a) ,, 1 (b).

twenty years.

duction of a unit by chemical means in the Report of your Committee for

1864.

--314 report 1865.

 Bath, appointing a committee, my own name standing as the first member,

 · for the purpose of communicating to the Russian Government the opinion of
 the British Association, that the establishment of magnetical observations on

 the Kew system at the Observatory of Tiflis, by Professor Moritz of that

 place, would largely conduce to the furtherance of magnetical science.'

    "A communication to a foreign Government is a serious and somewhat

 delicate matter. The communication must necessarily pass, I believe, either
 through our own Government, or through the Russian Ambassador in London
 and must in either case, I apprehend, be made by the President of the Asso-
 ciation. The duty of the Committee is therefore to supply the President with

 such information, if they can obtain it themselves, as may enable him to fulfil

 in the best manner the wishes of the General Committee.
     " Not having been present myself at the Bath Meeting, I have no knowledge

 of the discussion, either at the Section which originated the resolution, or in
 the Committee of Recommendation which adopted and recommended it, which
 doubtless preceded and influenced its adoption. I wish, therefore, to seek
 through you for information on some points on which more knowledge than I

 possess is desirable.

    " Professor Moritz is, I believe, and has been for some years past, Director
 of an Observatory at Tiflis, which is one of several observatories established
in different parts of the Russian empire, acting under and in concert with
 the ' Observatoire Central Physique de la Russie' at St. Petersburg, receiving
instruments and instructions from the Central Observatory, reporting to and
transmitting their observations in MSB. to M. Kupffer, the Director-General

of the Magnetical and Meteorological Observatories in Russia, by whom the

whole of the observations so transmitted arc published annually in the well-

known work ' Annales,' &c, according to a uniform pattern. The purpose

of the resolution, if I understand it correctly, is, that the instruments and
system of observation hitherto pursued at Tiflis should be changed by the
addition of magnetical instruments on the pattern of those at Kew, compre-
hending the tabulation from the photograms, the reduction of the observations,
and their application to theoretical conclusions. Of course I do not entertain
the slightest doubt of the advantage that might be expected to result to
magnetical science if tho recommendation were acceded to and perseve-
ringly and faithfully carried out ; but in respect to the probability of its being
received with favour by the Russian Government, and acceded to, it is mate-
rial to inquire whether Professor Moritz's application for the interference of
the British Association on behalf of the Tiflis Observatory was made with tho
knowledge and concurrence of the head of the department under which he
acts. It is unnecessary to dwell on the very different aspect which the whole
matter would assume according as the reply to this question be in the affirma-

tive or in the negative.

   " The University of Kasan, a station of peculiar magnetical importance in
theoretical respects, but which is not one of the stations of the Russian system,
being desirous of forming such an establishment, sent its professor of mathe-
matics, Professor Bolzani, to England in 1862 to examine and report on the
magnetical instruments employed in England. Professor Bolzani strongly
recommended the adoption of instruments similar to those at Kew, with
which, and the modes of reduction of the results and their theoretical appli-
cations, he made himself fully conversant by attendance at Kew. Whereupon
the University addressed a Memorial to the Russian Government, offering, on
being supplied with instruments similar to those at Kew, to be at the whole
expense themselves of the locale, the staff for observation and for reduction,
IN FAVOUR OF MAGNETICAL OBSERVATIONS AT TIFLIS.                                                                                                                                                                    315

and of publication. The reply was, not a refusal, but a postponement of the

consideration of the Memorial until the Russian finances should have recovered

from the heavy expenditure of the Crimean war. How far this decision was

influenced by the spirit of centralization, which is very strong in Russia, and

causes all such applications to be referred in the first instance for a report

from the central head, cannot of course be known ; but it is worthy of remark

that it was immediately followed by an application from M. Xupffer for a

complete set of instruments similar to those at Kew for the Central Observa-

tory at St. Petersburg. These have been furnished, and I have very recently

learnt from M. Kupffer that they have arrived, and have been established in

the Observatory. The observations have not yet commenced, because the

Mygas-pipes leading to the observatory are not yet quite finished.                                                                                                                                                 impres-

sion is, though I can only speak of it as an impression, that M. Kupffer pur-

poses to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the instruments by using

them under his own eye ; and if he approves of them, to have others made

like them at St. Petersburg (or to procure them from England as he may

deem best) for those observatories under his direction to which they may

appear most suitable, and for which the Government is willing to supply the

necessary funds. It may be hoped that the observations at such observatories

will be reduced and applied to theoretical deductions, which has not been the

case hitherto in the Russian observatories. The publication of the crude

observations is comparatively of little value ; but the labour of the reduction

adds veiy considerably to the cost.

"And this brings me to a second inquiry, which may be very important in

contributing to the success or otherwise of the recommendation contemplated

by the resolution adopted by the General Committee. "Was it understood from

Professor Moritz that there existed at Tiflis a separate fund by which, if the

instruments were supplied by the Russian Government, the current cost of

the locale, the staff for observation and reduction, and for publication, might

be defrayed ?  This was the proposition from Kasan                                                                                                                                                         and if  made on behalf
                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

of Tiflis, might entitle Tiflis to be placed in the same category of independence

of the Central authority.

 --" The object sought by the resolution of the General Committee is clearly

denned the establishment of magnetical observations on the Kew system at

the Observatory of Tiflis by Professor Moritz. It is a perplexing circum-

stance, however, that I received from Professor Moritz a letter dated the

27th of September, viz. a few days after the Bath Meeting, desiring an inter-

view to discuss his project, ' d'un leve niagnetique, qu'on se propose d'executer

au Caucase.' His letter neither names or refers in any way to ' magnetical

observations on the Kew system at Tiflis.' The two projects are incompatible

if they are to be conducted by the same person. Is it possible that there may

have been some misunderstanding between the Professor and the gentlemen

who brought forward the Resolution, as to which project is uppermost in the

AProfessor's mind?  * Leve magnetique' in the Caucasus is a far less costly

affair than such an observatory as is contemplated at Tiflis. There would

be a degree of awkwardness if Professor Moritz's desire to be employed in a

magnetic survey of the Caucasus were brought before the Russian Govern-
ment at the same time with the recommendation of the British Association

that he shoidd be employed in a work which would require his whole time

and thoughts at Tiflis for some years to come. It is a point which I should

think Sir Charles Lyell would desire to be cleared up before he should make

his communication to the Russian Government. The President of the Section

which originated the proposition, or the officers of the Association Avho were
316 report--1865.

present at the discussions in the Committee of Eecommendations, may be able

to throw some light on which of the two projects M. Moritz is himself most
desirous of pressing. I may at the same time remark that the Committee

appointed to aid in the observatory project can take no official cognizance of

the survey in the Caucasus.

  My" object in addressing this letter to you is to obtain either from your-

self, or through your intermediation from other Officers of the Association, or

from the President of the Section by whom the recommendation was brought

forward, any information which they can furnish which may be useful to Sir

C. Lyell in the communication he will have to make with the Eussian Govern-

ment. It is important to keep in view that, whilst we desire to give every

proper aid to Professor Moritz's wishes, we should have at the same time a clear

understanding of the recommendation we are making in all the rights in which
it may be viewed. Will you therefore kindly return me this letter, after you
have communicated its contents to any person who you think may throw light

on any of the points touched upon, and accompanied by any documents

referring to the recommendation which may be in the hands of the officers,
or which they may be able to procure ? I will then communicate with the

other members of the Committee.

                                                   " Sincerely yours,

" William Hopkins, Esq.,                               '· Edward Sabine."

At the time when my letter reached Mr. Hopkins he was already suffering

from the illness which has since obliged him (to the general regret) to resign

Mythe Secretaryship.  letter was, however, immediately sent to Mr. Galton,

associated with Mr. Hopkins in the duties of the Secretary's office, who most

readily and promptly undertook to communicate with Professor Moritz him-

self, who had returned to the continent ; and also to make my letter known
to Sir Charles Lyell, tho President of the Association, by whom any direct

application, either to the llussian Government or to our own, should such an

application to either Government be deemed expedient, would have to be

made.

   Mr. Galton' s letter to myself, of Feb. 27 (marked No. 2), states the result
of his communication with Professor Moritz, and was as follows :

                                 No. 2.

                                         " 42 Rutland Gate, W., Feb. 27, 1865.

" My dear General,--I have at length received a letter from Professor

Moritz, dated Feb. 5 (? old style), which I enclose. It is not satisfactory, for

myit does not reply to all  questions ; nevertheless you may possibly find it

sufficient to afford a basis to some limited action.

"1. Professor Kupffer is stated to approve of Professor Moritz's scheme,

and of the resolution of the British Association.

" 2. The funds to carry the scheme into effect would be supplied, if at all,

by the Russian ('? Imperial) Government, through the Grand Duke Michael,

Lieut, of the Emperor in the Caucasus. His decision is final, and to him the

resolution of the British Association would be most properly addressed.

    " 3. Professor Moritz wishes to obtain a self-registering apparatus of the

Kew pattern, partly to afford comparative observations with those he proposes

to make (by means of portable instruments) at the chief geodetical stations

of the Caucasus survey. He also wants the self-registering instruments for

regular work at Tiflis, where he deplores the insufficiency of assistants capa-

ble of making two hourly observations.

" 4. . He does not say whence he proposes to obtain the above mentioned

portable instruments, nor does he say anything concerning the tabulation of

the photograms of the self- registering instruments ; nor of the reduction of

the observations, nor of their application to theoretical conclusions. Neither

does Professor Moritz give cause to believe that he has had, as yet, the neces-

sary experience to enable him to establish a regular magnetical observatory.

(I pointedly made inquiries of him on this very subject in my second letter,

dated Feb. 3.)

   " The final paragraph of Professor Moritz's letter is his own version of what

took place at the Bath Meeting, and for that he is alone responsible. It appa-

rently has formed part of some report he has made to the Grand Duke, who

commissioned him to attend the Meeting.
   " I herewith return your letter of Nov. 9, addressed to the General Secretary.

It has formed the basis of both my letters to Professor Moritz.

   On the receipt of Mr. Galton's letter of Feb. 7 I wrote to M. Kupffer,

then at St. Petersburg, referring to the resolution passed at Bath, and to
Professor Moritz's communication with Mr. Galton, and expressing a desire

to be guided by his advice in any further step which it might be advisable to

It had been previously arranged between M. Kupffer and myself that he

shoidd be in London in April or May of this year, for the purpose of discuss-

ing many questions bearing on magnetical and meteorological observations.

In reply to my letter he referred to his proposed visit to London as a

suitable time to discuss fully the subject of Professor Moritz's wisbes, at

which discussion it was my intention to have asked Mr. Galton and the

members of the Committee joined with myself in the resolution of the General

Committee to be present. But in May I received the intelligence of M.

Kupffer's unexpected death, and I have not yet learnt who has been, or is to

be; appointed bis successor.       Edward Sabine.

Appendix to Report of the Committee on the Distribution of the Verte-

   brate Remains from the North Staffordshire Coal Field. By John

   Young, M.D., F.R.S. Edinb.

In the large series of specimens obtained by Mr. Molyneux, the genus

Palceoniscus is numerically the most important. The vast majority of the

specimens are referable to two species, P. ornatissimus and P. Egertoni. The

variations in the proportions of the body and sculpture of the scales admit of

a series being established so gradual that at no point can a sharp distinction

be drawn between the two species. The occurrence on individuals in this

series, of scales identical with those of P. monensis, renders it probable that the

last-named species, founded on isolated scales from Anglesea, is only a variety

of the North Staffordshire forms, the difference in conjectured bulk being

Aperhaps due to local conditions.  small number of specimens belong to

P. striolatus or P. Robisoni. The comparison of these specimens, and others

elsewhere, with the types in the Royal Society's collection at Edinburgh, raise

doubts iu the writer's mind as to the distinctness of the two species. In
--318 report 1865.

these, as in the foregoing species, the comparison of many individuals from

beds of the same general age occurring in the same district, illustrates the

wide range of variation which accompanies great fertility. Similarly, the

many specimens of the Mansfeldt species in the Royal College of Surgeons,
in the British Museum, in Sir P. Egerton's Cabinet, and in Edinburgh,

confirm the hesitation with which Geinitz enumerates them, and justify the

reduction of their specific differences within very narrow limits. The figures

of the same species given by him, by Agassiz, and by Xing, differ in general

proportions and the position of the fins, as markedly as do the Burdie House

forms, and in this respect fairly parallel the variations in the more limited
area of North Staffordshire. The comparison of individuals belonging to

prolific living species, as the Herring, Salmon, Trout, yields similar results.
The writer drew attention to the American specimens in the Geological
Society's collection. The species representing those of the English Carboni-

ferous series are associated with forms allied to those of Mansfeldt, whose

coexistence in Staffordshire has been asserted, but is not yet certain.

   Of the genus Rhizodopsis, established provisionally by Prof. Huxley/or the
reception of certain specimens whose cranial and dental characters approached

those of Rkizodus, Ow., while the scales, not yet found in unquestionable

relation to the crania on which the older genus was founded, belong to the

cycloidal section of the Glyptodipterini, several good examples occur. None

of the individuals reach the size of MTiizodus, with which they are coextensive
in distribution in the English and Scottish Coal-fields. The facial bones are
not determinable. The strong conical teeth with plicate bases are of two

sizes ; the larger, slightly incurved at the apex, want the lateral compression
which marks the laniaries of Bhizodus. Only two pairs of jugular jnates seem

to have existed. The pectoral fins are lobate ; the two dorsals, the ventral

and anal, opposite each other respectively, are placed in the posterior half

of the body. The vertebral rings are thin, shallow. The scales are cordate,

but vary in the proportions of their measurements at different parts of the

body. Their ornament consists of concentric and radiating ridges, the for-

mer entire on the sides, but interrupted at either extremity by the latter

Athe concentric ridges of the free area are robust.  subcentral boss on the

lower surface, nearer the anterior margin, corresponds to the point of radia-

tion on the upper aspect. The amount of overlap is uniform, extending to

one-third of the surface. These are the chief points in which this genus

differs from other Glyptodipterines. The character of the larger teeth justifies

its retention as distinct from Bhizodus. Reliable specific differences are

wanting ; the greater flexibility of the scales in specimens from shale than in

those from the ironstones, is due perhaps as much to the nature of the matrix

as to different stages of growth ; while greater and smaller size are not accom-
panied by other noticeable variations.

   Certain cycloidal scales were determined by Prof. Huxley in 1863 to belong
to a new genus which he named Cycloptychius. His description of the genus

was not then published, though read at the British Association. Several

excellent examples have since been found ; their structure is in abstract as

follows.

Body : average length 5 inches, slender, tapering to a finely pointed caudal

extremity ; covered with thin scales, cycloid anteriorly, pointed posteriori}',

marked with well-defined concentric ridges. Head nearly one-fifth of length

of body, compressed ; muzzle rounded. Orbits far forward, bounded by large

supraorbitals, prefrontals, and inferiorly by a long suborbital bar. Praj-

maxilla large, its anterior margin prolonged laterally. Maxilla in one piece,
NORTH STAFFORDSHIRE COAL-FIELD ORGANIC REMAINS.  319

curved slightly upwards anteriorly, posteriorly descending more abruptly.

Mandible in one piece, tapering to a slender, slightly upcurved, symphysial
extremity. Both jaws beset with fine conical smooth teeth of two sizes,

the larger about three times that of the smaller, among which they are
set at regular intervals, and from which they are distinguished only by
size. Operculars narrow, elongate ; suboperculars small, square. No trace

of inter-operculars. Branchiostegal rays numerous, flattened, enamelled.
The sculpture of the cranial and facial bones consists of close-set tubercles,
sometimes confluent into short ridges. The occipital bones are perhaps

represented by large scale-like plates occurring close to the head. Pectoral
arch weak ; scapulars flat, articulated, not coalescent with the truncated

 coracoids. Pectoral fins small, not lobate. Ventrals small, at middle of body.
Dorsal and anal small, triangular, equal, opposite ; intermediate between
ventrals and caudal. Tail markedly heterocercal ; upper lobe slender ; its

short rays entirely beneath the prolonged axis of the body. The rays of
 the lower lobe increase in length up to the fifth or sixth, which exceed
the anal fin ; and thence diminish till they meet those of upper lobe at an
 angle of 35°. The dorsal fin is preceded by a few, the upper caudal lobe is
covered by many fulcra! scales. The thin enamelled scales, disposed in oblique

series, are similar over the body, those of the upper and lower margin being
sbghtly smaller than those on flanks. The obliquity of their axis from the
production of the posterior inferior angle, gives them in situ a rhomboidal
appearance. The ridges are more numerous on the lower than the upper
half, and are not continuous across.

    This very elegant genus is nearly allied to Palceoniscus and Catopterus,
'Eenf., and ranks therefore with them among the Lepidosteidce. It has as yet
been found only in Staffordshire. Species unica Cycloptychius carbonarius,
Huxley.

    Specimens of a tooth, named Strepsodus, in the Jermyn Street Collection
and Catalogue, are frequent. This tooth, figured as Holoptyehius sauroides

 in the Tyneside Natural History Club's Beports, has also been referred to
Megalichthys, but is generically distinct. It varies from three-eighths to one
inch in length, and is distinguished by its bayonet form, a knee-bend occurring
at the commencement of its distal fourth ; it is slightly curved backwards, the
 convex surface being smooth, the concave traversed by fine parallel, longi-
tudinal, discontinuous ridges, which die out as they curve outwards towards
the anterior aspect. The pulp occupies three-fourths of the base, but is re-
 duced to a point near the knee-bend. Seven such teeth are preserved, with
a fragment of a jaw, in Mr. Ward's Cabinet at Longton : the implanted equals

the exserted portion in length. On the same slab a scale with radial furrows

occurs. Teeth of the same kind are associated on a block of shale in the
Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, with cycloidal scales, whose free surface is
traversed by radiating broad grooves, large vertebral rings whose central
space is one-third to one-fifth of the whole diameter, flattened neural spines
and rounded bony spiciila, which are probably fin-rays. The form and
 sculpture of this tooth are amphibian rather than piscine ; while neither order
offers any good analogy to its mode of occurrence in the jaw above men-
tioned. Several doubtful fragments and a deep amphiccelous vertebra suggest
the presence of Amphibia in the Longton district.

   A quadrilateral scale, with rounded angles, provisionally named Bhombo-

ptychius, HnxL, is found near Longton ; one specimen measures two square
 inches, but is exceptionally large. The posterior smaller portion, marked off
 by two oblique shallow grooves, is ornamented with coarse concentric ridges
--320 report 1865.

the anterior with very fine striae crossed at the margins by equally fine radii.
The fine pores between, but not on the coarse ridges, are wanted on the
anterior surface. The scale seems to belong to some large Glyptodipterine,
and merits description from its occurrence in the same shales with the tooth

last described.

   The large transversely oval scale, named Dendroptych'ms, belongs to the
same groiip ; its anterior half is finely tubercular by the intersection of con-

centric and radial stria? ; the distant, rudely parallel, vermicular, frequently
bifurcated ridges of the posterior do not radiate from a centre, but pass from
the whole transverse diameter. The determination of this, like the preceding
from the same locality, awaits further discoveries.

   The Acanthodian remains are abundant and well preserved.
    Scales of two species of Gyrolepis occur along with those of Palceoniscus.
Amblypterus is represented by a few scales.
   The Plagiostomous remains are numerous and varied ; among them occur

Orodus, Helodas, Cladodus, and Ctenodus. Among them, as among the

numerous spines, are several forms which are yet under investigation.
    Of the genus Platysomus, one species, P.parvulus, and a variety unnamed,

are found; the scale ornament of the one is tubercular*, of the other striated.
P. striatus, obtained in Berbyshire, is wanting in this coal-field.

   The list both of genera and species will doubtless be augmented when the
large mass of materials, collected by Mr. Molyneux and others, shall have
been more fully investigated.

First Report on the Structure and Classification of the Fossil

              Crustacea. By Henry Woodward, F.G.S.

A grant having been made in September last at Bath (1864) in aid of my

researches into the structure and classification of the Fossil Crustacea, for

which the Earl of Enniskillen, Professor Phillips, and Mr. C. Spence Bate

were appointed a Committee, I beg to submit my first Beport.

The first portion of my investigation relates to the Crustacea of the Devo-

nian and Upper Silurian formations belonging to the order Eurypterida.

These are now elaborated, and will be published in a Monograph, with

plates   and  woodcuts  of  all the  species,  by  the  Paheontographical  Society

        .

during the ensuing year.

The following is an abridged list of the genera :

              1. Eurypterus                    9 species examined.
              2. Pterygotus

                                               5? 1 ,,

and includes three genera defined, viz. :

   JSlimoniaf, Stylonurusi, and Hemias2)is§ ; and also six new species added

   * Anew genus, Amphicentrum, has been founded by the writer upon certain fossils bearing

certain strong anatomical resemblances to Platysomus, wliile the dentition indicates affinities

with the Pycnodonts. The description of this genus, with a review of its relations, will

shortly appear elsewhere.

to the list, including the great Stylonurus Scoticus*, nearly 4 feet in

length.

   Of the other species we now possess much more ample material than was
at the disposal of Messrs. Huxley and Salter in 1859, when their Monograph
appeared, and many important details in the structure and position of the
parts and their mutual relations are now elaborated.

   In addition to the Devonian localities of Herefordshire, Forfar, Arbroath,
and Dundee, the Upper Silurian of Lanark, and the Lower Ludlow of Leint-

wardine, Shropshire, all of which have yielded new and characteristic forms
(several of them described by me during the past year), I have lately obtained

from the "Wenlock Limestone and Shale, Dudley, good evidence that in this

locality also species of Pterygotus occur.

   Until June 1865, the oldest known Cirripede was the Pollicipes Shceticus
from the Ehsetic beds of Somersetshire ; but I have just described f a new

Cirripede with intersecting rows of plates (similar to the Cretaceous genus
Loricula), from the Wenlock Limestone and shale of Dudley, figures of which
are addedj.

Figs, a, b, c represent the three forms of plates of which the several rows are composed

in figs. 1-3, which bear the corresponding letters. The opercular valves are not known.

   Another Cirripede of the genus Pyrgoma, occurring recent on the south
coast of England and Ireland, living in deep water attached to the edge of

the cup of Caryojohyllia, and fossil in the Coralline Crag of Suffolk, has now
been detected by me in the Upper Chalk of Norwich. As this is a new
species I have named it Pyrgoma cretacea. It is interesting to find it asso-

ciated with the same genus of corals (Caryophyllia) both in the Chalk and in

recent seas.

   I have examined and determined six genera, and am preparing descriptions
of about sixteen new species of Liassic Crustacea.

Among the new genera are

                  1. Palinurina                .- 2 species

                  5. Scapheus                       1,,

besides the genus Eryon, to which two or three new species have to be added.

    I have likewise detected a minute species of Squilla. All these seven
genera (save one) characterize also the Solenhofen limestone of Bavaria*
(Upper White Jura).

   I have now to notice a remarkable burrowing Crustacean of the family

Thalassince (a genus of which (Callianassa) occurs in the uppermost bed of
the Cretaceous series at Maestricht), as occurring in our Hempstead series
(Upper Eocene) in the Isle of "Wight, and another species in the Greensand

formation of Colin Glen, Belfast.

  The death of my brother and colleague Dr. Samuel P. Woodward (my

best scientific adviser during the past eight years), has materially retarded

my accustomed work ; I beg therefore to be allowed to speak of this as my

first report only, and that I may be permitted next year to oifer a more com-

plete and detailed statement of my researches in this interesting group.

-- --124. Application of the Theory of Elliptic Functions to Quadratic Forms.
    The Theta Functions of Jacobi. It will be for the convenience of the reader
to give in this place a brief statement of a few principles and results which

belong to the theory of elliptic functions, and to which we shall have occasion

to refer in the following articles.

   The Theta functions of Jacobi are defined by the equation

                               TO=-f0Q         r *1                       "1

or if g«TM=2, by the equation

                  e*v («,«)= 2 (-i)»»v

                             m= -- oo

In these equations, p and v are given integral numbers ; w is an imaginary

constant, having for the coefficient of i in its imaginary part a quantity dif-

ferent from zero and positive ; so that the analytical modulus of q is inferior

to unity, and the series defining the Theta functions is convergent for all va-

lues of x real or imaginary ; lastly, a is a constant at present undetermined,

but to which we shall hereafter assign a particular value depending on that

of hj. When it is not necessary to specify the value of to, we shall write

e        v  (#)>  instead  of  M> ,, {x, ui).  The following equations are immediate con-
    i*,

sequences of the definition of the Theta functions :

   These converse propositions may he demonstrated by means of the differ-
ential equations satisfied by the elliptic functions : by a similar process we

obtain the following equally important theorem :

  A" If is any quantity, real or imaginary, other than zero or positive unity,

there exist values of w, having the coefficient of i in their imaginary parts
different from zero and positive, which satisfy the equation <p8(o>)=A."

   When n is an uneven integer other than 1, the formula of transformation

is

confine ourselves to the consideration of the modulus and multiplier alone.

divisors of n, and h representing any term of a complete system of residues,

mod y. It is thus sufficient to consider a system of <b(n) transformations of

order n, since all others arise from compounding transformations of the first

order with the transformations of that system. If we take, in particular, the

w=system of transformations,           --- , corresponding to the matrices

                 fi

residues, mod y, of which every term is divisible by 16), we have for the

determination of the transformed modulus, the fundamental theorem *,

" The quantities ( - Ws2)=( - \ <j> y                                                           ,  ) are the roots of an equation

of order 4>(n), in which the first coefficient is unity, and the other coeffi-
cients are rational and integral functions of <j>(J) having integral coeffi-

cients."

   This equation is termed the modular equation of the transformations of the

--nth order ; designating f(w) by u, and (-\ $ |2^iZ_ j by v, we shall re-

present it by f(n, u, v)=0, or more simply by f(u, v)=0. The function
f(u, v) is characterized by the following, among many other properties,

multiplication of the argument is " Given an integral number n, to express

the Theta functions of nx and w by means of the Theta functions of 00 and w."

The solution of this problem may be made to depend on that of the addition

of arguments ; for to add n equal arguments is to multiply the argument by n.

The transformations derived from different values of n, or from different re-

presentations of the same value, are all different ; and every transformation

of order n which does not alter the value of to, is derived from some repre-
sentation of d2n by (1, 0, A) ; so that the transformations and representations

correspond to one another one by one, and are equal in number. It will be

observed that the multiplier corresponding to any of these transformations is

Va complex factor (composed with --A) of the number expressing the order

of the transformation ; so that the transformation is equivalent to a complex

multiplication of the argument. And the Theta functions containing to do, or

do not, admit of complex multiplication, according as to is or is not a quadratic

discussion shows that the number of subclasses is six (corresponding to the

six types of binary matrices for the modulus 2) ; except in the two cases just

referred to, when the number of subclasses is reduced to 3 and 2 respectively,

owing to the existence in those two cases of automorphics which are not of

the type 0,1 , mod 2. Thus the whole number of values of ^8(w) is 6G(A),

--G(A) representing the number of classes of det. A, counted in the manner

stated above*. It will be seen that the six values of <pa(w) corresponding to the

--forms
of  the  same class  are  of the     type                           2

                                                                  k,

(being in fact related to one another as the six anharmonic ratios of four

-- --points). The three values corresponding to the forms of det. 1 are 1, 2, i ;
-- --and the two values corresponding to the improperly primitive forms of det.

    3 are the imaginary cube roots of 1.

   It is an important theorem (to which we shall again refer) that the 6G(A)

values of <£8 (aj) satisfy an equation of that order, of which the coefficients are
integral numbers (but the first coefficient not, in general, unity).

   The whole number of values of <p(u), corresponding to the forms of deter-

minant --A, is 48G(A). For if a be the value of 0(w) corresponding to any

form of a given subclass, and -q be any eighth root of unity, r\a will be a
value of ^»(w) corresponding to another form of the same subclass.

    (7) The number of representations of any uneven number as a sum of eight

squares is sixteen times the sum of the cubes of its divisors ; for an even num-

ber it is sixteen times the excess of the cubes of the even divisors above the

cubes of the uneven divisors."

    (8). " If N is any number whatever, the number of compositions of 8N by

the addition of eight uneven squares is equal to the sum of the cubes of those

Ndivisors of whose conjugates are uneven."

    In counting the number of compositions by addition of squares, two com-

positions are to be considered as different if, and only if, the same places in

each are not occupied by the same squares ; but in counting the number of

representations we have to attend also to the signs of the roots of the squares.

Thus each composition by the addition of four squares, none of which is zero,

is equivalent to sixteen representations. Only one or two of the preceding

theorems are enunciated in the published writings of Jacobi : see Crelle's

Journal, vol. iii. p. 191 ; vol. xii. p. 167. Some of the others have been

given by Eisenstein (Crelle, vol. xxxv. p. 135), who had also obtained purely

theorems are proved by purely arithmetical considerations, and appear as

special cases of more   general                       theorems                                         at the same time we        see why these

number of indeterminates for which only one class of forms, represented by

--a sum of squares, appertains to the determinant 1."

    In the second of the notes to which we have just referred (Crelle, vol. xii.

p. 167), Jacobi has given an arithmetical demonstration of the theorem (4).
It consists in a kind of translation of the analytical proof into an arithme-

tical one ; and is of great interest and importance, as the first example of a

new method, and as having suggested important researches to MM. Liouville

and Kronecker (see Liouville's                        NewJournal,                                           Series, vol. vii. p.  48 ;  M. Kro-

   Thus by a purely analytical process we deduce from an equation which ex-

hibits the number of compositions of the double of an uneven number by the

addition of two uneven squares, an equation exhibiting the number of com-

positions of the quadruple of an uneven number by the addition of four

uneven squares. This analysis Jacobi has expressed arithmetically as follows.

Representing by N an uneven number, by [4N] the number of compositions

of 4N by the addition of four uneven squares, we resolve 4N in every possible

2^way into two unevenly even numbers                             and    2N          and                                                            each    of  these  in  every

 --128. Theorems of Jacobi on Simultaneous Quadratic Forms. In an elabo-

rate memoir " On Series whose Exponents are of two Quadratic Porms " *,

Jacobi has established a great number of elliptic formulae, which are the ana-

lytical expression of theorems relating to the representation of numbers by

Acertain quadratic forms.  comparison of the two criteria of Gauss for the

p +biquadratic character of 2 with respect to a prime of the linear form 8& 1,

leads to a result which will serve as an example of these theorems. By the

first criterion, 2 is or is not a biquadratic residue of a prime p of the form

p= + +8&+1 according as a is even or uneven in the equation

   We thus arrive at an analytical proof of Jacobi's theorem, including, as a

" Though these arithmetical demonstrations of results obtained analytically

present no essential difficulty, yet they are sometimes of a complicated cha-

racter, and require peculiar classifications of numbers which perhaps may be

Weof use in other researches.                      have here a certain amount of freedom in the

choice of methods, so that the proofs can easily be varied" f. Probably one

of these methods was that employed by Dirichlet in his earliest arithmetical

memoir, to which Jacobi expressly refers. In this memoir J (written when

only the enunciations of Gauss's criteria for the biquadratic character of 2 had

been published) Dirichlet gives a demonstration of the first criterion, which

   From the nature of the identity (2) it is evident that we may substitute

any function whatever (which renders the two series convergent) for the
exponential of q. Thus, for example, we find

   It would seem that the method of Dirichlet which we have here described

maybe employed to prove all the theorems of Jacobi's memoir in which the

two forms compared have different determinants. Those in which the two

forms compared have the same determinant, or determinants differing only

by a square factor, are of a more elementary character, and are capable of
immediate verification. But Dirichlet's method may also be extended to cases
in which one or both of the forms compared bas a positive determinant. One

+ + +example will suffice. If P=(2a l) 2 862 =(2a l) 2 -8/3 2, we have

      S (_l)'Y[(2m + l) 2 + 8^] = S(-l) m+>[(2m + l) 2 -8H2],

   Any infinite product of cither of the types occurring in these equations he

calls an elliptic product ; and every infinite product which can be formed in
more ways than one by the multiplication of two elliptic products, leads
directly to one of his special formula?. The five following elliptic products
are of great importance in the theory ; they correspond to the suppositions

the first two are the equations (19) and (20) of art. 124; the last is a cele-

brated formula due to Eider.

The infinite products in the numerators and denominators of the fractions

equal to u and u' (equations 27 and 28, art. 125) are all elliptic products of
--one or other
         of  these         five      types,         in    some        cases  with     2  or                                     a  or   q substi-

tuted for q, Hence a comparison of any two of the fractions equal to u or

to u' gives immediately one of Jacobi's special formulas. The demonstration

of the formula (2) in art. 128 will serve as an example of this process.

Again, Jacobi has shown that the Eulcrian product (art. 124, E.)

which, however, is only a particular case of the general formula (A).
   The Eulerian product is also of importance in the theory of the partition

of numbers. If it be developed in a series proceeding by powers of q, the
coefficient C(m) of the mth power of </ in the development, expresses the number

mof ways in which can be composed by the addition of unequal numbers, or

by the addition of equal or unequal uneven numbers. Euler observed that his
fractional expression of the product furnishes a recurring formula for the
calculation of C(m), and the same thing is true of each of Jacobi's fractions

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the simplest of the seven recurring formulas being that arising from the

fraction (D), viz.,

the summation extending to all positive or negative values of s for which

m -- m3s2 is not negative, and e representing 1, or 0, according as is or is not

ducing Euler's proof of the analytical formula.

This equation (in which all the exponents have the same quadratic form)
admits of immediate verification, elementary considerations sufficing to show

                                                 ft-i

-- --that the sum S( 1) 2 ( - \b(a2 b2 ) extended to every solution of the equa-

N=a +tion
           3 362 , is zero. Jacobi thus obtains a direct arithmetical proof of

the formula (F). (Crelle, vol. xxi. p. 15-18.)

The square and the cube of the Eulerian product can also each of them be

represented in two different ways as the quotient of two elliptic products.

Other formulae of Jacobi's are inferred from the fundamental equation (7)

in a somewhat more complicated way. Replacing v in that equation by certain

roots of unity, and multiplying two or more of the results together, Jacobi

obtains products winch can be expressed in more than one way by means of

elliptic products ; the formulas thus deduced are remarkable chiefly because

they lead to equations, not between two, but between three or more series,

the exponents of which have certain quadratic forms.

Lastly, a few additional equalities are derived not from the fundamental

equation, but from the modular equations of the third and seventh orders.

The modular equation of the third order was brought by Legendre into the

   The equation of the seventh order, in the form in which it has been put by
M. Gutzlaff*,

admits of similar treatment, and furnishes as many as seven formulae on

account of the variety of expressions which the equations (27) and (28) allow

+us to substitute for f and ^ in the equation 0(a>)<p(7w) i£(w)^(7u>)=l. It

similarly for <p(7w) and ^(7u/), expressions having the same denominator.

At the beginning of his memoir Jacobi says that the formulae to which it

relates are probably finite in number. It would seem that when he expressed

himself thus, he had not yet found his three general formulae, each of which

contains an infinite number of equations between series having their exponents

contained in the same quadratic form. But it is certainly very unlikely that

equations between series whose exponents are contained in different quadratic

forms, exist for any but a few of the simplest forms, or for them in infinite

number.
--We130. The Formula of M. Kronecker.
                                                now come to an important series

of results, discovered within the last few years by M. Kronecker, which form

a memorable accession to our knowledge of quadratic forms, and which have

opened an entirely new field of arithmetical inquiry. Their demonstration

requires considerations of a very complicated kind ; and as they are certainly

among the most interesting, so also they must be reckoned among the most

abstruse of arithmetical truths. Unfortunately, in the brief notices* which

M. Kronecker has given of his investigations, his methods are indicated only

in a very general manner ; and, notwithstanding the light which has been

thrown on them in the subsequent memoirs of MM. Hermite and Joubertt,

it is occasionally difficult to rediscover them. Nevertheless, as a mere enu-

meration of formulae, unaccompanied by any explanation of the methods by

which they have been obtained, would be of little use to the reader, we shall

attempt in the next article a complete demonstration of one or two of them,

which may serve as specimens of the rest.

The following (with an unimportant change in the notation) are the eight

equations  given  by M. Kronecker (Crelle, vol. lvii. p.    248                Liouville,       New

The arithmetical functions F(») and G(«) satisfy the cquationsF(4n)=2F(«);

n=7, mod 8 ; G(»)=fF(»), if n=3, mod 8. With the help of these rela-

tions (which may be demonstrated by elementary considerations [see art. 113

of tins Report], but which may also be inferred from the theory of elliptic

functions) the formula; I.-VIII. may be transformed and combined in various

ways, so as to afford new and interesting results. Of these derived formula?

M. Kronecker has given two,

IX. F(n) + F(n-1 . 2) + F(«-2 . 3) + F(n-3 . 4)+ .

                      =1*(4h+1),

X. E(n) + 2E(ii-l 2) + 2E(»-22 ) + 2E()i-32)+ . .

                        =£[2+(-l)«]X(»),

where n represents any positive integer, X(«) the sum of its uneven divisors,

and E(»=2F(?*)-- G(»), so that E(«) is a function satisfying the equations

E(4n) = E(»); E(n)=0, if »=7, mod 8; E(ji)=fF(n), if n=3, mod 8.

The first of these formula; is obtained by subtracting VI. from V. ; for

-- ++F(»-- le Jc+l)=±T(4n1                      2                                                                                                  The other, if n is uneven, coincides
                                    [21-
                                          1] ).

   * The right-hand members, of the formulae I.-VIII. are rendered simpler by this con-

-- --ventional estimation of a class of det. 1 as f, and of an improperly primitive class of det. 3
Weas ^.  have already seen that this convention is a natural one (art. 126, note) ; it is,
--however, less easy to interpret the assumption G(0)= ^g . M. Kronecker has given his
formulae in their complete expression when these conventional estimations are disregarded ;

in his subsequent notes, however, he seems to prefer the simpler form, which we have

adopted in the text.

--with [V.] j[IV.]; and with II. if n is unevenly even. If n is the qua-

druple of an uneven number, its left-hand member may be written in the

form

the sum of the first of these series is §X( t)=|X(h) ; the second series,

coinciding with f[I.]~|[V.], has for its sum fX(») ; the two series together

are therefore equal to 2X(«). Lastly, the formula, if true for any even

number, is also true for its quadruple ; for if n=0, mod 8,

                 E(») + 2E(>j-12)+2E(h-22) + . .

              = [E@ + 2E(«-r) +2E(L'- 2=) + ...]

¥Of the preceding formulae those which contain the functions and W, are

to be regarded as of a more abstruse character than those which only contain

X, 4>, and $'. The latter, in fact, are deducible from known theorems of

arithmetic. Thus if we multiply the formula X. by 12, the right-hand

+ --member becomes 8[2 ( l)"]X(?i), or the number of representations of n

as a sum of four squares (see art. 127). Consequently 12E(m) is the number

of representations of n as a sum of three squares ; for, assuming that this is

so for 1, 2, 3 ... «--l, we may infer from the formula X. that it is so for n.

Thus the celebrated theorem of Gauss*, which connects the number of re-

presentations of a number n as a sum of three squares, with the number of

--classes of quadratic forms of det. n, is contained in the formula X.; and

conversely, that formula is itself deducible from the theorem of Gauss com-

bined with the other and more elementary theorem, which connects the

number of representations of n as a siun of four squares with the sum of the

uneven divisors of n.

already referred (art. 130).
    It appears from the equations (A) and (B) that the generating functions of

F(m) and E(«) are elliptic series; and M. Hennite, in two important memoirs

(Comptes Bendus, Aug. 5, 18(31, or Liouville, New Series, vol. vii. p. 25, and

Comptes Bendus, July 7, 1862) suggested, as it would seem, by these equations,
has succeeded in deducing the second of them, and others of the same character,

from the general expansions of elliptic functions, without having occasion to

consider the special modules which admit of complex multiplication. He has

thus discovered a new and comparatively elementary method of arriving at the
formulae of M. Kroneckcr ; to whom indeed this method was already known, as

his expressions of the generating functions of E(h) and F(«) indicate, and as

he has himself expressly stated in a note published after the appearance of

M. Hermite's first memoir (Monatsberichte, May 2G, 1802, pp. 307, 308). M.

Hermite's method is an extension of that employed by Jacobi (see art. 127),

and depends on the developments of doubly periodic functions in series pro-

ceeding by sines or cosines of the multiples of the argument. To this set of

developments, however, M. Hermite adds a second obtained by dividing the

Aproduct of two Theta functions by a third.     series of the first set, and one

of the second (both alike containing only sines, or only cosines, and only even,

or only uneven multiples of the argument), are then multiplied together. The

non-periodic part of the product (or its integral, taken from the limit to tt)

is a function of q only, and if the product can be formed in more than one

way, we obtain different expressions of this function, a comparison of which

Wesupplies in each ease an arithmetical formula.     take the following example

from M. Hermite's first memoir ; and, with him, we write for brevity, 0, 9,,

H^),H, Hl for e(^), e/^f), H(?^),                    and 6, Bv Vl for 0(0),

mations from the single equation

   135. M. Kronecker asserts that the formula) I. -VIII. are independent, i. e.,

that none of them can be deduced from the others by means of the elementary

GFequations satisfied by the functions and ; and that all the similar relations,

which are supplied by the theory of complex multiplication, may be obtained,

with the help of those elementary equations, by combining the eight formula?.

And it is certain that the system of the eight formulas does, in this sense, ex-

plicitly contain all the relations of similar form, which have been subsequently

given by M3I. Hermite and Joubert. Thus, many of these relations are par-

XL +ticular cases of the formulas
                        and XII., or of the combinations (XL) (XII.)

(in M. Joubert' s memoir, the formulas 1, 2, 3, those of page 28, and the first

of page 29 ; also the first two formulas in M. Hermite's memoir (Liouville,

new series, vol. vii. p. 25) are of this land) ; others, again, are immediately

deducible from the two formulae

     =4F(«) + 8F(h-42 ) + 8F(m-82) + ...=<J>(«), « 3, mod 8,

    8F(«-22) + 8F(n-62 )+8F(«-102) + . . .=*(«), n=7, mod 8,

combined by addition or subtraction with V., VI., and VII. But each of

these two formulas results from the combination f(V.) + |(VI.)--2(IV.), sim-
plified by means of the elementary equations satisfied by F and G. In this
way the formulas 4--9 of M. Joubert's memoir, and the third formula in M.

Hermite's memoir (Liouville, ibid, p. 36), may be obtained. Lastly, the

equation

       (^) (^-) =6G + 6G + · · . |(3*(»)-*(»))

                      =n 1, mod 4

(M. Joubert, p. 30) arises from the combination (IV.)-- |(V.).
   M. Joubert's formulas, however, as they are given in his memoir, are not

immediately comparable to those of M. Kronecker. He rejects from the

modular equation of the uneven order n, the factors due to the square divisors
of n (see art. 125 of this report), and, in consequence, those derived classes

whose coefficients have any common divisor with n are excluded from his
enumerations. At the same time, the numerical functions, depending on the

divisors of n, which occur in the right-hand members of his formulas, are ren-
dered somewhat more complicated than those of M. Kronecker. It is always
possible to pass from one of M. Joubert's formula) to the corresponding for-
mula of M. Kronecker, by an elementary process, of which M. Joubert has
himself given an example (at p. 25 of his memoir).

   One formula, however, has been obtained by M. Herinitc from his investi-
gation of the discriminant of the modular equation, which is entirely distinct
in form, and as it would seem in substance, from those of M. Kronecker.
Taking a modular equation of a prime order n, M. Hermite shows that its
discriminant is of the form

thus possible, by a method of which we have already given examples, to assign

a system of quadratic equations (or quadratic forms) having integral coeffi-

Equating the number of these quadratic forms to the index of the polynomial

when n is a prime, and which, translated into the notation of M. Kronecker,

is as follows,

in M. Kronecker's formula?, is very remarkable.

  --136. Arithmetical Demonstrations of the Formula? of M. Kronecker. M. Kro-

necker informs us that, when he had connected his formula?, in the manner

already described, with the expansions of certain elliptic functions, he directed
his attention to the process (art. 127) by which Jacobi transformed the ana-
lytical proof of the 'theorem of four squares' into an arithmetical one*.

remarkable theorem which appears (as he observes) to contain the germ of

another, and very different, arithmetical demonstration of his formula?. He

has enunciated the theorem for prime numbers only, remarking, however,

that it admits of extension to composite numbers also. The result is simplest

   As it appears from the formula V. that the number of these congruence-

showing that the contrary supposition is inconsistent with the inequalities

pformula V., that every residue of is a root of one of the congruences, would

of course supply a direct arithmetical proof of that formula, for the case in

   Arithmetical demonstrations of the formulae of M. Kronecker have also

been obtained by M. Liouville. These demonstrations depend on the prin-
ciples introduced by him into arithmetic in the series of memoirs " Sur quel-
quesformules generates qui peuvent etre utiles dans latheorie des nombres"*,

and originally suggested (as he himself informs us) by Jacobi's arithmetical
proof of the theorem of four squares. M. Liouville has given, as an example

of his method, a proof of the equation (XI.)-(XIL), or

4F(n-l2) + 4F(«-32)+4F(»i-5*) + . . =A(n)-l\n)-T'(n),

for the two cases in which n is unevenly, and evenly, event. "We shall con-
fine our attention to the latter and somewhat simpler case. It requires two
preliminary Lemmas, both included as very particidar cases in M. Liouville's

general formulae.

being positive and uneven, and two solutions of either equation being re-

garded as different, unless the indeterminates of the two solutions are the

same and in the same order.

is the equation satisfied by the multipliers appertaining to the transformations

of order n.

But M. Kronecker has shown that ^(n, x) admits of a more profound de-

composition, when n is a composite number. In fact, if v is the number of

p p ^the primes 1 lha · · dividing n,                 {n, x) can           be     resolved into     2"      factors,

*/p3 , ... If n=3, mod 4, the order of each factor is precisely equal to the

number of classes in a properly primitive genus of det.-- n; and the roots of

each factor are the values of 8 (w) corresponding to forms of a determinate
n=genus. If
                 1, mod 4, instead of the equation ^(n, x)=0, we consider the

equation, of which the roots are the h(n) quantities x(l--x) ; this equation

can, as before, be resolved into 2" generic factors, each corresponding to a

determinate genus. In either case the factors only differ from one another

pin respect of the signs of the radicals *Jpl} *J                      2,  .  .    , and  these     signs   are  de-

                                                                                  .

termined for each factor by the characters of the corresponding genus with

p prespect to the primes lt 2, . . . For an account of the method by which this

resolution into generic factors is obtained, we must refer to the original note
of M. Kronecker (Monatsberichte, June 26, 1862, p. 370).

   In one of Abel's memoirs ((Euvres Completes, vol. i. p. 272) we find the

theorem that the modules which admit of complex multiplication are capable

of expression by radicals. At an earlier period Abel had doubted of the truth of

this result, and he has given no indication of the method by which he obtained

it. JM. Kronecker' s researches on complex multiplication were originally sug-

gested by Abel's theorem ; and they have led him to a complete demonstration

n=3,of it. Let       mod 4, and let                  w8         8 (w2), ... be the roots of one of the
                                                      ( i)>

generic equations into which ^(x, n)=0 is resolved, the imaginaries

wu w2, . . . being determined by the equations

                 Ax + 28^ + 0^=0, +C+2BA2 2u,2 2wt=0, ...

--so                                             3,             belong        to  the  same         genus.  If the

determinant n is regular (art. 117), it can be proved by the theory of com-

Bposition, that it is possible so to select the representative forms (Au C1} 2 ),

       2,

uneven number prime to n, or indeed a prime not dividing n. We may

    We have for brevity confined ourselves to the case of properly primitive

forms of an even determinant ; but the values of fj>"(to) corresponding to the

--improperly primitive classes of a determinant of the form (4?n-f3), or to

the properly primitive classes of even determinants, are also the roots of arith-

Ametical equations possessing analogous properties.                                                                     method for the forma-

tion of these equations, different from that of M. Kronecker, and not requiring

the use of the equation of the multiplier, has been given by M. Hermite

(Theorie des Equations Modulaires, p. 44) ; but this method does not supply

the ulterior decomposition of the equations into their generic factors.

into its factors implies the possibility of expressing certain solutions (though
not necessarily the least solution) of the Pellian equation by means of the

modules which admit of complex multiplication. For the case when D=^5,
mod 8, he has given the singularly elegant formula

At the Meeting of the British Association, held in Newcastle in 1863, a

Committee was appointed to report on the best means of providing for a

uniformity of weights and measures, with reference to the interests of science,

and a report embodying certain recommendations was presented by the Com-

mittee to the British Association, at its last Meeting at Bath, which was

received and adopted after considerable discussion in Section F, the Chemical

and Mechanical Sections having also had the subject under consideration.

The substance of these recommendations was the adoption of a decimal sys-

tem of weights and measures, and the choice of the metric system on account

of its scientific capabilities ; the use of such metric system, as far possible,

in statistical documents and scientific communications ; the placing of metric

standards in our public and frequented buildings ; the teaching of the system

in schools                                           and the use of it at the Custom House  and Post Office.  On the
                                                  ;

recommendation of the Section the Committee was then reappointed, and a

grant was made to it of .£20.
--376 report 1865.

In furtherance of the object remitted to it, the Committee met and passed

resolutions recommending the preparation of a small book for elementary

instruction in the metric system, and the appointment of a Deputation to

the President of the Board of Trade, for tbe purpose of representing to Her

Majesty's Government the advantages of reducing the Tariff in the terms of

the metric system, allowing importers of goods from countries using that

system to pay duties calculated by the same ; and also a Deputation to the

President of the Committee of Council on Education, recommending the

teaching of the metric system in schools supported by the State. It has been

suggested, however, that tbe Committee had no power to do more than to

report again on the subject to the Association, since the report of its Com-

mittee was only discussed and adopted in Section F, and not by the General

Committee, and therefore it was deemed best to seek from the Association

more definite power on the subject.

The Committee has pleasure in reporting that the necessity of introduc-

ing uniformity in weights and measures throughout the country is generally

admitted, and that there is little or no difference of opinion as to the superior

merits of the metric system, in the choice of which lies the only method

for obtaining not only a thorough reform in our weights and measures, but

also the great desideratum of international uniformity. By the Act of Par-

liament passed in 18(34, the rise of the metric system in this country was

legalized, and thenceforth a contract has become equally enforceable whether

in the terms of the metric system or in the terms of the imperial standards.

Since, however, the use of the same is at present optional only, and not

compulsory, much remains to be done, not only in recommending the prac-

tical use of the metric system in the different branches of business and

industry, but also in disseminating the necessary teaching of the same, espe-

cially in schools and colleges, with a view to its more general adoption.

   The Committee has learnt that the metric system is already in use in
many great establishments. Those especially which supply macbinery to the

Continent of Europe are under the necessity of using the metric measurement

ill fulfilling their orders, and it does not appear that the workmen in such

establishments have any difficulty in understanding the system, and in using

it with as much readiness as the imperial scale. Since the last Meeting of

the British Association, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, at their

meeting in Birmingham, had a favourable opportunity for discussing the

question, a paper having been prepared for them by Mr. John Femic, a member,

on the relative advantages of the inch and the metre as the unit of a decimal

line or measure. On that occasion, Sir "William Armstrong, Mr. C. "W. Siemens,

F.H.S., and Mr. Eobinson of the Atlas Works, all practically acquainted

with both  systems,  recorded their opinion  decidedly in favour  to  the  metre
                                                                                                   ;

and though in accordance with the rules of that Institution no resolution

was passed, there is reason to believe that a large number of members were

of opinion that the metric system was in every way preferable. Another

important testimony in favour of that system was also given by a Committee

of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, especially appointed on the decima-

lization of coins, weights, and measures. That Chamber, in common with
many other Chambers of Commerce, petitioned Parliament in favour of the Bill

since passed into law ; and now, after mature inquiry, we find a Committee

of that Chamber recommending the ultimate adoption, and at no distant

mperiod, of the metric system of weights and measures as the sole legal systt

in tJiis country. The teachers are also moving. At a meeting of Professors,
Teachers, and others interested in education held in Birmingham, on Wed-
UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.  377

nesday, the 15th of March, 18G5, Rev. Charles Evans, M.A., Head Master
of King Edward's Grammar School, in the chair, it was unanimously decided,
" That, having regard to the merits of the metric system of measures and
weights now Legalized in this countiy hy Act of Parliament, to the facility
with which it may he learnt and afterwards retained in the memory, to the

great saving of time which would thereby he gained in education, to the

convenience it offers for the largest as well as the most minute calculation,

and to the decided advantages of the decimal method in any arithmetical

system, this meeting is of opinion that the metric system of measures and

weights should he introduced as a branch of instruction in the schools of

the United Kingdom." At a meeting of British teachers connected with the

British and Foreign School Society in the Borough Boad, London, the same

question was discussed, and there is no doubt that the teachers see the

importance of giving instruction in a system which will speedily replace the

present uncouth practice. What is now wanted for the purpose of educa-

tion is a book sufficiently elementary yet complete in itself, likely to be used

as a text book in all schools and colleges. Several books on arithmetic

already give considerable prominence to the decimal and metric system.

More especially we may mention the treatises on Arithmetic by the Bev.
Barnard Smith, Mr. Dowling's Comparative Tables, and also the useful Beady
Beckoner published in this town by Mr. Bickard, the able teacher in King
Edward's School. In Continental schools M. Carpentier's " Nc'cessairc
Metrique," which is a smaU cabinet containing samples of all the smaller

weights and measures, the cubes, &c., is largely used, and there is no doubt

that the children on the Continent obtain much more early in life an accu-

rate knowledge of numbers, their properties, and their combinations, with
the metric system than the English boys do with the imperial scale.

   Nowhere could we see more clearly the need of altering the present practice
than in the practical routine work in railway management. With the enor-
mous traffic of our railway companies, the inconvenience of the present sub-

division of weights produces a decided appreciable loss to the income of the

shareholders. Eor example, the London and North-Westem Bailway Com-
pany, whose annual income equals the entire revenue of the majority of Euro-
pean states, carries to every station in the Empire some thousands of packages
of all sizes, many exceedingly small, and nearly all having fractions of weights.
At the head station in Camden Town nearly 1200 entries are made of such
packages eveiy day, which are sent to the station in the course of the day, and
despatched on the same evening. Before they are sent, however, such pack-
ages must nearly all be weighed or measured, and taxed at a great variety of
rates. But great is the liability to error arising from our cumbrous system, when

the calculations are to be performed in a hurried manner. It is in fact calcu-
lated that, on an average, the clerks commit one error in every 500 items ; and

the consequence is that the London and North- Western Company are under
the necessity of nearly doubling the number of clerks. For every 100 clerks
employed in weighing, or measuring and taxing packages, nearly another 100
are wanted to correct the errors committed. But with a decimal and metric
system this liability to error is immensely reduced, and therefore a practical
economic benefit would certainly arise from the adoption of that system in

railway traffic. A Boyal Commission has been recently appointed on railway

management, and they are to inquire into the more economic arrangements
for the working of railways, so as to make a considerable reduction in the cost
of conveyance. This is a favourable opportunity for calling attention to the
question, and the Committee is pleased to find that the Council of the Inter-
--378 report 1865.

national Decimal Association has offered to give evidence before the Com-

mission on the subject.

   As a practical mode for diffusing information on the metric system, it has
been suggested to fix the metric standards in one or more frequented places
in the leading commercial cities of the empire. Tbe Act for rendering per-

missive the use of the metric system did not provide for the introduction
of standards, but only furnished a table of equivalents of the metric and
imperial systems. It would, however, be highly desirable to furnish the
people with tbe means of ascertaining the accuracy of the metric weights and
measures used by comparison with certain authorized standards. The great

want seems to be a Weights and Measures' Department connected with
Government, as was recommended by the Committee of the House of Com-
mons, whose duty it should be to procure such standards, and to super-
intend the necessary arrangements for the security of trade and tbe
diffusion of sound information on the subject. Till recently the control
of the imperial standards was in the hands of the Comptroller of the
Exchequer, but since that office has been abolished and incorporated with
the Audit Office, it has become almost imperative to establish such a
department. It would be desirable that such a department shoidd super-
vise the examination and comparison of the weights and measures in use

throughout the country, superintend the Inspectors now appointed by the

municipal councils of each town, and more especially issue such tables,
books, and specimens of the metric system as will diffuse information of the
same throughout the country. This is the plan which has been adopted

with great success wherever the metric system has been established. And
we are glad to find that the Committee of the Liverpool Chamber of Com-

--merce has recommended the same course in the following resolution : " That

a Department of Government of weights and measures should be established,

subordinate to the Government and responsible to Parliament, to whom

should be entrusted the conservation and verification of the standards, the
superintendence of inspectors, and the general duties incidental to such

department. That these duties should especially include the use of all
means for promoting the use and extending the knowledge of the metric
system among the people."

   The Committee has observed with much pleasure, that in several scien-
tific communications in the Transactions of the Royal Society, and some
official documents issued by the Government, metric weights and measures
are given side by side with the imperial. In many cases, indeed, a decided

preference seems to be given to the former, especially in papers on chemical
science. It is greatly to be lamented that the Pharmaceutical Society did

not adopt the metric system, the same not being then legal, when settling a
new Pharmacopoeia ; the mixed system they have adopted was far from
meeting general approbation, and they will be under the necessity of
making a new change.

   In foreign countries the principal movement in favour of the metric
system is in Germany. For some time past the different German States have
been labouring towards the attainment of greater national unity ; and,
after having come to an agreement about the coinage, they have given
their attention to the state of weights and measures in use in the different
States. In 1862 a conference was held at Frankfort for the purpose of
concerting as to the choice of one common system, when official delegates
were present from nearly all the principal states except Prussia, and after
much discussion they recommended the adoption of the metric system.
ON THE BED OF THE OCEAN.  379

Since then the International Statistical Congress having heen held at Berlin,
their proceedings regarding international units, had due influence on the
Prussian Government, and it is expected that the opposition of that Govern-

ment may have thereby been overcome. Another meeting of the same
Congress of delegates from German States has just been held at Frankfort,
with the presence of Prussian delegates, and we trust to hear speedily of

the unanimous resolution in favour of the adoption of the metric system.
   Though the instructions of this Committee are confined to weights and

measures, and do not include coins, the Committee are convinced that the
advantage of the metric and decimal system will not be fully realized until
the coins also and mode of accountancy are decimalized.

   In conclusion, the Committee would recommend the reappointment of this
Committee with power to use such measures as it may deem expedient for
promoting the extensive use of the metric system in scientific and official
documents, in the Custom House and Post Office, as well as the teaching of
the system in schools and colleges ; with instructions also, as regards the
coinage, to represent to Her Majesty's Government the expediency of the
early adoption of such a system of decimalization as will the more effec-
tively facilitate the social and commercial transactions of the country, and at
the same time advance the great purpose of international exchanges, and
especially to urge upon Her Majesty's Government the great benefit that
would arise from the early assembling of an international monetary conven-

        On the Bed of the Ocean. By A. G. Findlay, F.R.G.S.

The progress which has been made of late years in deep-sea sounding,

chiefly in connexion with the selection of a route for the Atlantic
Telegraph Cable, and the curious results it has developed, led to the
desire, at the Bath Meeting, that a wider and more systematic survey
of the ocean bed should be carried on, and for this purpose the General
Committee appointed Sir H. Murchison, Rear-Admiral Collinson, and
Mr. A. G. Pindlay, to endeavour to promote this object.

   Up to the present time we know less of ocean physics than of almost

any branch of science. The volume, depth, circulation, temperature,
&c. of the waters of our globe are only vaguely to be surmised from
isolated and imperfect experiments yet it has · an influence on phy-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

sical geography second only to that of the atmosphere.
   The fact of animal life existing at the greatest depths, and of exactly

the same nature, under every variety of surface climate, has only lately
been satisfactoinly determined.

   The wide range of speculation which the late accessions to our know-
ledge as to the perpetual interchange and circulation of the Avhole of the
ocean water, from the surface to the bed, from the equator to the poles,
by which it would seem that the universal identity of its nature and
composition could be maintained, the wide area over whicli species of
animal life arc found, the formation and composition of the sedimentary
and oolitic rocks now in progress, are of apparently the same character

as our older geologic strata.

   The state of our knowledge of the - whole is detailed by Dr. "Wallich
--380 report 1865.

in his work oil the Atlantic sea-bed, and lie will lay before this Meet-
ing a description of the mode of sounding.

   From the nature of the work to be done, it is manifest that individual
efforts cannot be made available. The apparatus is both cumbersome
and costly, and it requires a small steam-engine to use it. It must there-

fore be left to Government.
    Perhaps the best form of apparatus, and the relation of the sounding

lines to it, have not yet been determined ; but it is believed that, when
these preliminary matters are fully adjusted, the work could be carried
out with celerity and certainty ; and if the services of some of the ves-
sels of Her Majesty's !Navy could be impressed, we should soon have an
accumulation of data whereon a satisfactory system of ocean physics might

be raised.

   For the. direct benefit of seamen also, we should have the means of

proving, or, what is better, of disproving the existence of the great
number of reported shoals and dangers which embarrass navigation.

   In furtherance of the views of the Committee of Eecommendation,

Admiral Collinson has conferred with several officers since the last

Meeting.

   There may be some difficulties as to the mode of carrying out the

plan desired by the Committee in its full extent ; but the recent adop-
tion of steam launches in the navy might give the necessary steam power,

and some form of apparatus will have to be adapted to the special cases
of those vessels not otherwise properly fitted. But the subject has made
some progress. Commander C. Bullock, R.N., the Oriental Surveyor,
son of Bear-Admiral Bullock, has been supplied with apparatus for H.M.S.
' Sphinx,' under his command, and he will doubtless send home good

accounts of it in his progress toward the Indian Archipelago, and in the

seas north of Australia, to which his expedition is bound.

The first instalment of the observations has not yet arrived, but is

Weexpected shortly.  therefore hope that by the next Meeting some

considerable advances will have been made in this interesting subject, and

which, as far as possible, will be laid before the Meeting.

On the Composition of the Gases evolved by the Bath spring called

   King's Bath. By Prof. A. W. Williamson, University College,

    London.

It was at the suggestion of Dr. Daubeny, who examined the gases from the

Bath water in 1832, and measured the quantity evolved per hour, that the

Association did me the honour to request me to undertake an analysis of the
gas, and to make arrangements for its careful collection. I understood that

one reason for desiring these experiments to be made, was the possibility that
variations might have occurred in the rate of their evolution since the time

of Dr. Daubeny's analysis.

   On inquiring of the authorities in Bath, I learned that there are in that

city no less than four hot springs, each of which continually evolves gas
simultaneously with hot water. These springs supply respectively the King's
Bath, the royal private bath in Hot Bath-street, the Cross Baths, and the

Kingston Baths.
ON THE COMPOSITION OF GASES EVOLVED BY KING'S BATH. 381

    The arrangements for conducting the hot water from the three last-named

of these springs to their respective baths are, however, so unfavourable to the
accurate collection of the gas, that no means suggested themselves of attaining
the desired object in any of those cases without incurring far greater expense

than was authorized by the Association. Under these circumstances I have

confined my attention for the time to the gases from the Kings Bath, and

have had the less regret at doing so from the circumstance that Dr. Daubeny's

observations were, if I am rightly informed, also limited to the gases from

the King's Bath.

    It will be seen from the accompanying section of the shaft supplying the
water of the King's Bath, that several pipes project into it with their open
mouths downwards, and that some of the gas in rising up through the water

is liable to enter these pipes. By far the greater part of the gas rises to a

grating through which it issues to the floor of the bath together with hot
water. The central grating is surrounded by several smaller openings, but all
the gas escaping from these gratings could be collected by a funnel of 3 ft, 9 in.

diameter. All other openings were closed at the times of collection, partly
by stones and cement, partly by corks. Little more than 3 feet of water
were in the bath at the time of collection.

    Well-stoppered Winchester quarts were employed for collecting the gas
Each stopper was coated with paraffine of such melting-point as to be semi-
fluid at the temperature of the bath, and, carefully enveloped in paper was
attached to the neck of the bottle to which it belonged. Each bottle was
numbered, and all were packed in a box with cellular divisions, well lined
with a springy material. It was arranged that each bottle should be par-
tially filled with gas, about one quarter of its space remaining filled with hot
water, and that it should then be closed while still under water by its greased
stopper, and packed mouth downwards with water over the stopper. This
arrangement appears to have been effectual.

   I have been indebted to Dr. Falconer, the Chairman of the Committee of
Baths, for valuable information and assistance in the course of the necessary
arrangements. Mr. John Cooke of the Mineral Water Hospital, Bath, was
good enough to undertake the operation of collecting and sending off the gas,
and ho has been aided by Mr. Tyler of Bath in his labours.

The specimens of gas were measured and analyzed by Mr. Bowrey in the
laboratory of University College, with the aid of the apparatus described some
time ago by Dr. Russell and myself. Each bottle of gas, when received, con-
tained some water, and as it was required to measure the

quantity of the gas, the  following method was adopted                                                                                                                                                           the

Dfitted loosely the pieces of glass rod, D' ; before the cork
Cwas placed in the neck of the bottle, the caoutchouc tubes C
Dwere closed by wiring the rods D', and the tubes B B' filled

with mercury.

The bottle was then placed in the retort stand as shown
below, and the tube E connected with the caoutchouc tube
C at E. This tube, F, was then filled with water, care being

taken to remove all air from the bend. The wire was then

Hof the water at and I was about the same. The

whole affair was then left for an hour or two, so that

it might become of the same temperature as the air of

the room. When the temperature had become the

same as that of the room, the water in the tube was

levelled with that in the bottle (exactness being

obtained by the use of a telescope moving in a hori-

zontal plane). The bottle was then marked in three

places at the level of the water, and when the gas

had been used, its amount was found by filling the

bottle to these marks (placing it so that the water

poured in was level with all three marks at the same

time), and measuring the quantity of water.

   To transfer the gas to the eudiometer for analysis,

the tube F was removed after the wire round the

rod D' had been tightened, and the bottle placed

CCupright ; the portions E E' of the caoutchouc tubes                      were filled with

Kmercury, and the tube of the tube and fun-

Knel L connected at E' ; mercuiy was then

Npoured into L, the tap being open, when a

few taps caused the air in the tube to be

displaced by mercury, and on the wire at D'

being loosened, mercury flowed into the bottle

some little quantity was allowed to enter, and

then the wire at D' was tightened, and the

Ktube and funnel removed. To the caout-

chouc tube C at E, a capillary tube P was

fitted, this tube being full of mercury, which

was kept in by a caoutchouc cap at S, and as

the gas was under pressure, on loosening the

Dwire at it issued from the tube P.

As soon as enough had come out, the wire

was tightened, and the bottle placed with its

mouth downwards so as to form a water joint.

In each case of explosion with oxyhydrogcn

gas, from 30 to 40 measures of the detonating

gas were added to 100 measures of the gas, or

mixture of air and gas.

As each bottle was opened, from 200 to 300 cub. centims. of water entered.

   The bottle is to be left over the funnel until f or | of the 'water is driven out
of it by the gas, and the assistant being warned that the time for stopping

the collection is approaching, the bottle is to be lifted off the funnel at the
instant that the assistant calls out that the seconds' hand of the watch bas
arrived at the point marked o on the circle, so that it has completed an entire

number of revolutions since the collection of gas commenced.
   The exact time at which the collection began is to be written down by

the assistant while the operator is collecting, and
in the line marked with the number of the bottle,
and the time at which the collection ceases to be
written down by the assistant in the same table

when the operation of collecting is complete.
    The stopper is to be immersed, held by its

handle, in the water of the bath for some minutes
before the collection is complete, and pressed
firmly into the mouth of the bottle while that
mouth is under water and held downwards.

    The stopper is then to be firmly tied down into the neck of the bottle, the
bottle returned to its place in the box, and the box locked up again till next

period of collecting.

       MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

Address of W. Spottiswoode, F.R.S., President of the Section.

The great range of subjects comprised in this section, and the multiplicity of papers

mysubmitted to it, have doubtless contributed to deter  predecessors in this chair

from preparing addresses so elaborate and comprehensive as those delivered to other
sections. The custom, however, of prefacing the business proper by a short sum-

mary of subjects which have engaged the attention of philosophers during the past

year, and which may therefore be expected to come before us during our present
sittings, appears to be sanctioned by the wishes of our members, and may perhaps

be followed without materially departing from that brevity which is here both

customary and desirable. Foremost among the astronomical subjects in which we
may hope to receive communications are the researches of Messrs. Be la Rue,
Stewart, and Loewy, in solar physics. Without attempting to anticipate what they
may have to state, it may be as well to remind the section that it seems now to be

established that solar spots are at a lower level than the penumbrre, the facuhe at a

higher ; that the photosphere is gaseous ; and that the behaviour of the spots, as to
appearance and disappearance, is connected with the position of the planets, and

principally with that of Venus. The objection to this view of the nature of sun-

spots which has been raised on the ground of the unbroken curvature of the sun's

limb, notwithstanding the elevation of the faculre and depression of the spots, has
been answered by Professor Phillips in a paper read before the Royal Society. That

the central mass is of less brilliancy than the photosphere is also ascertained ; but
whether this arises from solid matter at a lower temperature, or otherwise, is still a

question. M. Faye, in an elaborate memoir presented to the French Academy,

suggests that it may consist of transparent gas.

The moon continues to be the subject ot careful investigation, both theoretical

and observational. M. Delaunay explains that the delay in completing the second

part of his lunar theory arises from his having to carry his developments beyond

--the order originally contemplated, viz. the seventh in some cases as far as the

ninth. M. Allegret states that the terms involving the cube of the time became im-

portant when determining the secular variations. Under this head mention must

not be omitted of Professor Cayley's valuable contributions to the lunar theory.

The Lunar Committee of this Association have been most actively engaged

during the past year, and will state the results of their labours in their report.

The planet Mars has been the object of much telescopic research on the part of

our President, Messrs. Dawes, Lockyer, and others. The supposition that the

2 REPORT 1865.

redder parts of its disk are land, and the greyer parts sea, appears to be verified
recent observations also confirm the view that snow is visible in its polar regions.

Comparing the latitudes of arctic climates on Mars with those on the earth, it bar?
been concluded that the temperature on the two planets is not very different. The

solar radiation in the two cases is, of course, very disproportionate ; but the expla-
nation of the result is to be sought in the action of a dense atmosphere, which, as
Professor Tyndall has shown, serves to retain large quantities of heat which would

otherwise radiate into space.

   Mr. Lassell has communicated to the Royal Astronomical Society an ephemeris

of the satellites of Saturn, now finally reduced to four.
   The number of the minor planets continues to increase. M. Serret has presented

to the Academy of Paris a theory of the movement of Pallas, complete as regards

the perturbations of the principal planets. He promises a second part, discussing

the influence of the minor planets, in which he states that he has arrived at some

curious and unexpected results.

   Although the subject of auroras more properly belongs to that of terrestrial mag-
netism, it may here be mentioned that the height of these phenomena has been

determined to be from 35 to 290 miles. Meteors and falling stars, whose periodic

visits in August and November are well known, have both, by the labours of

Alex. Herschel, Quetelet, and Secchi, been shown to be minute planetary bodies,

Whendiffering only in size.       visible, they pass at a height of from fifty-two

to seventy-three miles above the surface of the earth. M. Deville has even at-

tempted to account for the known depression of temperature in February and May,

and the elevation in August and November, by their position intercepting the heat

of the sun during the former periods, and preventing the heat from the earth radi-

ating into space during the latter.

Before leaving our solar system, we must notice the discussion which has arisen

respecting an expedition to the Antarctic regions to reconnoitre for practicable

stations for the observation of the transit of Venus in 1882. It is unnecessary to

remind this section that upon accurate observations of this phenomenon, at proper

points upon the earth's surface, will depend a verification or otherwise of M. Fou-
cault's correction of the sun's distance, due to his new measurements of the velocity

of light. The question of the expedition, however, will doubtless be fully discussed

in the geographical section.

  A celestial atlas, just published by M. Dien, promises to surpass all its prede-

cessors in accuracy of detail. The difference of longitude between points on the

-- --great arc of parallel Bonn, Nieuport, and Haverfordwest has been carefully ob-

served                            so has the longitude of the observatory at Glasgow.
                               ;

The usual amount of attention has been paid by observers and calculators to the

subject of comets and their orbits. But, besides this, M. Hock, in a paper presented

to the Royal Astronomical Society, has argued in considerable detail in favour of

--his view that comets move in parabolic and hyperbolic orbits, not in ellipses tbat

they are not isolated bodies, but consist of groups of fragments of bodies broken

up by the sun or planets.

Passing to the more remote celestial objects, Mr. Iluggins has been continuing

his observations on, and has determined, the spectra of the fixed stars and nebula',

of which we may hope to hear some further particulars. In the meantime, I will
notice only one point, but that a very curious one. Lord Rosse and Professor Bond

find, by telescopic observations, that the brighter portions of the great nebula in

Orion are apparently resoluble into stars. Mr. Huggms's analysis, on the other hand,

gives a spectrum consisting of three bright lines only, indicating a gaseous condition.

An explanation of this apparent contradiction is perhaps to be found in the sugges-

tion that the bright points shown by the telescope are not stars in the ordinary

sense of the term, but condensed parts of the nebulous fluid. Imagination would

lead us to suppose that we have here before us a stage of cosmical process interme-

--diate between nebula and stars the formation of a sun ; but strict science forbids

us as yet to' adopt this as an ascertained conclusion.

   Spectrum analysis continues to receive further additions at the hands of the chair-

man of our Kew Committee, Mr. Gassiot, who has carried the question so far as to

construct an apparatus for determining whether the so-called fixed lines of the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  6

 solar spectrum undergo any displacement through the variation of gravity, in passing

 from one latitude to another on the earth's surface.

    The operations at the Kew Observatory in terrestrial magnetism, and with the

 pendulum apparatus recently erected there, will form the subject of a separate re-
 port. In the former department the observations at Stonyhurst give, as the annual

--' secular decrease of dip for the mean epoch of 1861-69, 2''614 a result not very dif-

 ferent from that determined by General Sabine for London, viz. 2'-69. From the
 same quarter we are informed that the annual increase of total force is -0030 British
 unit. Although this requires observations continued over a longer period, it may

 still be regarded as confirmatory of the fact that the total force is increasing.

    To Professor Tyndall's researches in radiant heat allusion has beeu already made.
 From himself, however, we hope to receive a communication on his more recent
 experiments, whereby he has been enabled entirely to cut oil' the luminous from
 the calorific rays, and to produce not only combustion in an absolutely dark focus,
 but also the incandescence of platinum by non-luminous rays.

   Among the experimental improvements in subjects kindred to this may be men-
 tioned M. Marcus's new thermo-electric battery, an invention likely to render this

 kind of battery far more generally serviceable than has hitherto been practicable.
 Like many other inventions, this has not been without some kind of anticipation, in
 a suggestion by Mr. Yv heatstone in ' The Philosophical Magazine ' as long ago as

 1837.

   We should also notice a suggestion by M. Carlier, for dispensing with the covering

 of the wire in electric coils. It is said that this has been carried out with such
 success as to produce an increase rather than diminution of power. M. Richer also
 suggests the use of sulphur plates instead of glass in electrical machines. Mr. Beale

 has succeeded in using object-glasses for the microscope of much higher power
 (VB in.) than heretofore ; and I must not omit to mention that an essential part of

    From the Committee on Electrical Resistance we shall doubtless receive a fur-
 ther report. But the gigantic experiment to which the whole subject has recently

--been subjected an experiment which, notwithstanding its present interruption, we
--may still call a great scientific success will doubtless give an additional interest

 to anything that the members of the committee who accompanied the Atlantic
 expedition may have to communicate.

    Side by side with these experimental researches, the mathematical theories of
 molecular physics have been advanced in several directions. Professor Maxwell, in
 this country, and M. Renard in France, have each contributed a nienioir on electro-

 dynamics and the latter has deduced his fundamental formulae from the hypothesis
                                                         ;

 of a single fluid. M. Corun, by a happy application of M. Chasles's principle of
 homographic planes, has deduced from MacCullagh's theory some propositions
 relating to crystalline reflexion and refraction. These have the remarkable property
 of being independent of the wave-surface, and therefore may be said to rest upon a
 simpler frame of hypothesis. M. Corun is preparing some apparatus for the experi-
 mental verification of his method. M. Boussinecq also has presented to the Academy
 of Sciences a memoir on the theory of light, in which he has taken into account
 terms of the second degree in the displacements. It would seem that the paper

 contains generalizations comprising the theories of Fresnel, MacCullagh, and

 Neumann. Lastly in this connexion may be mentioned the writings of M. Saint

 Yenant on the vis viva of elastic systems, and his extension of the investigations of

 Narvier and Poncelet on the resistance of elastic bars, rods, &c.
     In each of the main branches of pure mathematics, geometry and analysis, a

 modern school has arisen. The former, originating with Carnot, Dupin, Poncelet,

 and others, dates from the early part of the present century ; the latter, due in the

 first instance to Cayley, Boole, and Sylvester, belongs wholly to the present gene-
 ration. Both schools have this in common, that figures in the one case, and forms

 in the other, are considered not merely as isolated individuals, but as associated
 with other concomitant forms which characterize their various properties.

    In pure geometry we have the principle of projection, whereby any plane figure

 is considered in connexion with all or any other plane figure lving on the same
                                                                                                          1*
4 REPORT 1865.

cone, in such a way that a theorem relating to one figure frequently establishes a
corresponding theorem relating- to the other. Thus many properties of conies in

general arc at once suggested and proved by reference to the circle.

Again, the theory of reciprocal polars, or rather the principle of duality, which

enables us to see points and straight lines in a condition of interdependence such

that theorems relating to points (e. g. positions or curves, intersections of lines, &c.)

at once give rise to corresponding theorems relating to straight lines (tangents, rec-

tilinear loci, &c). Under the head of modern geometrical methods falls also the

theory of pencils of rays and transversals ; straight lines radiating from a point and

cutting another line, straight or curved. This again suggests the idea ot relations

between the segments of the transversal (when straight) or between the angles
made inter se by the radiating lines. The most fruitful conception of this kind lias

been that of the auharmonic ratio of four points or rays. This peculiar ratio re-

mains unchanged under such a variety of circumstances, that it has arisen to an

almost independent principle in geometry ; and upon it M. Chasles may be said to

have founded, to a very great extent, his ' Geometric Superieure ' and his new

work on conic sections, the first volume of which has recently appeared. Before

quitting this part of the subject, it should not be omitted that a great part of these

theories have their application to figures in space as well as to those in piano.

The second volume of M. Chaales's work will contain a full exposition of his recent

most important contribution to the theory of conies. lie has found that the properties

of a system of conies satisfying any four conditions whatever may be most naturally

--expressed in terms of two elements or characteristics namely, the number of such

conies which pass through any point, and the number which touch any line.

Starting from this fruitful notion, he has, by a process which may be termed geo-

metrical substitution, been able to express, in a single symmetrical formula, the

Wenumber of conies which satisfy any five conditions whatever.        may almost say

that he has condensed into this formula the whole theory of conies.

 --Again, connected with this is the principle of deformation another method of

considering one figure in relation to another, the points of the one being connected

by a definite construction with those of the other. By this, and in particular by a

most happy extension of it by Professor Hirst, theorems and properties of curves of

higher degrees are demonstrated through those of lower, e.g. curves of the fourth

and fifth degrees by conies.

Passing to analysis, we have in the first place the analogues of the geometrical

theories above mentioned. To the method of projection corresponds (in one of its

interpretations at least) the method of linear transformation ; to that of deformation,

non-linear transformations. The method of transversals as well as those of auhar-

monic ratio and geometrical involution admit of a concise analytical statement

but they cannot be called methods even in analytical geometry, still less in analysis

proper. The principle of duality, however, as treated by Pliicker, may claim an

analytical with as good a right as a geometrical basis.

Before quitting this part of the subject, mention should be made of two impor-

tant and original contributions to analytical geometry in space. One, by Professor

( Jayley, is directed to the representation of curves in space ( by means of cones having

variable vertices), a method free from the extraneous branches sometimes intro-

duced by the ordinary conception of the complete intersection of two surfaces ; of
the other, by Professor Pliicker, we have at present only the abstract in the pro-

ceedings of the Royal Society; it promises, however, to abound in processes of

great power and originality.

But the greatest acquisition to modern analysis is what is now generally termed

the new algebra. This calculus, which originated in this country, and from the

first received wide developments at the hand of its founders, Boole, Cayley, and

Sylvester, has, during the last few years, found numerous cultivators both amongst

ourselves and on the Continent. The main problem proposed for solution is the

investigation of tin 1 properties of rational homogeneous algebraical functions of any

number of variables, the forms to which they are capable of being reduced, the

subsidiary expressions to which they give rise or with which they may be asso-

ciated, and the bearing of the latter upon the former. Investigations so general,

so abstract, and so apparently removed from any practical application could not

fail to be regarded coldly by many whose attention bad been principally directed
to special problems in physics. And one at least of my hearers will doubtless, with

myself, recollect the unrestrained censure which, in the midst of a most hearty

greeting, the late astronomer of Turin would pour upon the labours of any disciple

of the modern school who chanced to visit him. The promoters, however, of this

science, sure of their footing, and confident that nothing which could lead to results

of such a remarkable character or of such great generality, that nothing which

could unite, correlate, and simplify the apprehension of such numberless disjecta

very short time has justified their firmness, by witnessing the new algebra reaching

out and indissolubly connecting itself each year with fresh branches of mathematics.

The theory of equations has almost become new through it ; algebraic geometry

has been transfigured in its light ; the calculus of variations, molecular physics, and

mechanics have all felt its influence.

The memoirs of Cayley on quantics, those of Sylvester on the calculus of forms,

have become classical. Intimately connected with this subject is the theory of

numbers, which, at the hands of some leading analysts, principally German mid

French, has recently received such large extension. One peculiarity, but that of a

very general character, which distinguishes some of the modern from the older

--methods, consists in the introduction of variable quantities into the expressions in

other words, in bringing the processes of continuous to bear upon the properties of

discrete quantity. Bat into this it is unnecessary to enter in any detail, as we

have already in our volumes the very able and comprehensive reports by Professor

WeSmith, of Oxford.  are now anxiously expecting his final communication, not

only because we shall then have before us a survey of the whole subject brought

down to the present time, but still more because we trust that the author may then

find leisure to complete the original work upon the theory of numbers upon which

it is understood that he has been engaged for many years, and to which the reports

in question form only a prelude.

The tendency which is here exhibited of some common principle running through

various subjects, and bringing them into connexion, reappears in the differential

resolvents of Cockle, Ilarley, and others, and in the transcendental solution of

equations which has been effected on the Continent. In both eases a relation is

--established between ordinary algebraic equations and the differential calculus in

the one with linear differential equations, in the other with a simple integration.

Some future developments will, perhaps, throw further light upon the ultimate issue

of these processes.

The calculus of operations, or of symbols, as it has been also called, whereby the

symbols of operation are separated from those of quantity, has for some years been

in use among analysts in this country. And although no very remarkable step has

recently been made, or is perhaps to be expected, in this field, still some consider-

able progress has been effected towards completing the algebra, or laws of combi-

nation, of these non-commutative symbols.

It would occupy too much time to touch upon the many more subjects which

suggest themselves, but it would be impossible to pass over without mention tin;

important contributions to the theory of differential equations, and in particular of

those which occur in mechanics, by the late Professors Jacobi and Boole (in

whose deaths mathematical science has sustained so great losses), and, secondly,

the extension which the theories of elliptic and Abelian functions have received at

the hands of Riemann, Hermite, Weierstrasse, Clebsch, and others. The last-men-

tioned mathematician has brought the subject of Abelian functions to bear in a
most remarkable and unexpected manner upon algebraic geometry.

 --I will allude to only one more instance of modern generalizations namely, the

conception of imaginary quantities introduced alike into geometry and algebra,

one of the most fertile sources of new and important theorems. The funeral on

--this very day of one of our most profound mathematicians Sir "W. R. Hamilton

aspect on the present occasion. And here I must bring this brief and imperfect

On the Theory of Differential Resolvents. By the Rev. 11. Haeley, F.ll.S.

    The theory of differential resolvents owes its origin to the discovery that, from

any algebraic equation of the degree n, whereof the coefficients arc functions

«--of a variable, there may be derived a linear differential equation of the order                                                            1,

which will be satisfied by any one of the roots of the given algebraic equation.

These differential equations are now known by the name " differential resolvents."

The author explained how they are formed, and pointed out their connexion with

the theory of algebraic equations.

   One of the most important of his recent results is the following :

    If u represent the with power of any root of the algebraic equation

                                n  -m/ "-  r  +(n-l).r                                        =  0.

                              y

then u, considered as a function of x, satisfies the linear differential equation

    m-Fn--r d m~\*--r r rf"l' , i\T« d                                                               -,"1"
                                                                                                                                           .

in which the usual factorial notation

                        [«]»=(«) (a-l)...(«-&+l)

is adopted.  And the complete integral of this differential equation is

                           = C +w 1?/,- <', //./<<... +C,,y,,<<<,

y v ji,, . . . y n being the n roots of the given algebraic equation. From this theorem,
which is an extension of one given by the late Prof. Boole in the Philosophical

Transactions for 1804, p. 735, all the differential resolvents of algebraic equations of

the above trinomial form may be readily deduced, by making m=l, in which ease

u=y, and depressing the differential equation by immediate integration.

 On Chasles's Method of Characteristics. By Professor T. A. Hirst, F.li.S.

   Alter briefly explaining the nature and scope of this important method, by which

the theory of conic sections has now been completed, the author communicated a

few of the results of Professor Chasles's most recent researches on the properties of
cnnics in space, which satisfy one less than the number (eight) of conditions neces-

sary to determine them. These results were communicated to the Academy of
Sciences, on September 4, 1865, and*appear in the ' Comptes Rendus ' of that date.

   The object of the paper was to establish new properties of two figures (in one and
the same plane) so related to one another that to a point in one figure corresponds

but one point in the other, and rice rcrxa, whilst to a right line in the one figure

corresponds a, conic section in the other. Among these properties were several

            On the Calculation of the Potential of the Figure of the Earth.

                                 By W. H. L. Russell.

   The object of this paper was to simplify and render symmetrical certain portions
of Professor O'Brien's investigations on the figure of the earth. In that paper the
reduction of the expression for the potential to a convenient form is effected by the
introduction of a discontinuous quantity ; the author of the present paper has
found that the required form is obtained much more shortly by dividing the original
definite integral into two parts, and then expanding separately.

On the application of D'Alembcrt's Principle to the Rotation of a Rigid 3/ass.

                                     By Dr. Steyelly.

    The author explained that the present method of applying D'Alembert's prin-
ciple to the investigation of the spontaneous axis assumed by a free, rigid mass,
under the action of force, in all the works he was acquainted with, led to what he
showed to be a false conclusion, viz. that that axis must be a principal axis of the

rigid mass. He showed how the error arose from neglecting, in applying the prin-

 ciple of D'Alembert, to take into account not only that part of the motion of each
 elementary part of the body which related to the magnitude of its motion, but also
 that part which relates to its direction, and from which its centrifugal endeavour
 at each instant arises. But if the force impressed tend to pi'oduce rotatory motion

round an unstable spontaneous axis, how can the present mode of applying
D'Alembert's principle lead to a true conclusion, when it proceeds on the method

 of bringing the body into such a state that the equations of equilibrium (that is, of
no after-change) shall give the direction-courses of the axis ?

           On a Special Glass of Questions on the Theory of Provabilities.

                             By Professor Sylvester, F.R.S.

     After referring to the nature of geometrical or local probability in general, the
 author of the paper drew attention to a particular class of questions partaking of

 that character in which the condition whose probability is to be ascertained is one
 of pure form. The chance of three points within a circle or sphere being apices of
 an acute or obtuse-angled triangle, or of the quadrilateral formed by joining four
 points, taken arbitrarily within any assigned boundary, constituting a reentrant or
 convex quadrilateral, will serve as types of the class of questions in new. The
 general problem is that of determining the chance that a system of points, each

 with its own specific range, shall satisfy any prescribed condition of form. For
 instance, we may suppose two pairs of points to be limited respectively to segments

 of the same indefinite straight line: the chance of their anharmonic ratio being
 under cr over any prescribed limit will belong to this category of questions, to
 which, provisionally, the author proposed to attach the name of form-probability.
 In questions of form-probability, in which all the ranges are either collinear seg-

 ments or coplanar areas, or defined portions of space, rules may be given for trans-
 forming the data, so as to make the required probability depend on one or more

 probabilities of a simpler kind, leading to summations of an order inferior by two
  degrees to those required by the methods in ordinary use. Thus Mr. Woolhouse's
  question relating to the chance of a triangle within a circle or sphere being acute
 can be made to depend upon an easy simple integration, the solutions heretofore
  given of this problem involving complicated triple integrals. It was shown, as a
  further illustration, that the form -probability of a group of points all ranging over
 the same triangle remains unaltered when the range of one of them is limited to
  any side of the triangle chosen at will, and, again, (for convenience of expression
  distinguishing the contour into a base and two sides) will be the mean of the two
  probabilities resulting from limiting one point to range over either side with uni-
  form probability, and simultaneously therewith a second point of the group over
  the base, with a probability varying as its distance from that end of the base in

 which it is met by the side. An analogous rule can be given for transforming the

  form-probability of a group limited to any the same parallelogram. So again for
  a group of points ranging over a plane figure bounded by any curvilinear contour.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            9

The problem may be transformed by supposing two of the points of the group to
range on the contour itself, according to a law which may be expressed by saying

that the probability of their being found on any arc shall vary as the product of
the segment included between the arc and its chord, multiplied by the time of

--describing the arc about any centre of force arbitrarily chosen within or upon the

contour, a theorem which, accepting the idea of negative probability, admits also

of extension to the case of a centre of force exterior to the contour.

  Among other problems which the author readily resolves by aid of his principle
of transformation, may be mentioned that of determining the mean value of a

triangle whose angles are taken at random anywhere within a given triangle,

parallelogram, ellipse, or ellipsoid. In this description of questions a peculiar
difficulty arises, from the fact that the figure which is to be integrated in order to

determine the numerator of the fraction which gives its mean value must always be

taken positive, whereas its algebraical expression will repeatedly change its sign,
·according to a more or less complicated law. This quality of the analytical expo-

nent of the arithmetical value of the figure constitutes, in fact, a sort of polarization

which has to be got rid of; and the depolarizing process is effected with great ease
by virtue of the simplified form impressed upon the data by the method set forth

in the paper.

   The author further took occasion briefly to allude to the form in which his own

problem of four and Mr. Woolhouse's problem of three points were originally pro-
posed, viz. in each case without a specified boundary, and to express his opinion
that the principle which had been applied to them, and in which he had formerly
.acquiesced, was erroneous, as it could be made to lead to contradictory conclusions,

and must be abandoned. He was strongly inclined to believe that, under their

original form, these questions do not admit of a determinate solution.

On Moving PJiotographic Figures, illustrating some Phenomena of Vision con-
   nected with the Combination of the Stereoscope and the Phcnalistoscope by
   means of Photography. By A. Clafdet, F.lt.S.

  From the beginning of photography it must have struck those who were ac-

quainted with the phenakistoscope, invented by Plateau, that photography could
produce with advantage series of pictures for that instrument with greater accu-
racy than any made by hand. M. Duboscq made some ingenious attempts in this
direction, but not entirely satisfactory. The author had also turned his attention
towards the subject, and had practically experienced the difficulty of obtaining

together the phenakistoscopic and stereoscopic effects. He desired to lay before the
Association an attempt he had made some years ago, illustrated by an instrument

--showing how easy it was to obtain the illusion of moving figures, but without

stereoscopic effect, two pictures of different positions being sufficient to elicit the
phenomenon, although the illusion suffers from the deficiency of intermediate posi-
tions. Nothing, however, is easier than to employ eight different pictures in as ninny
different stages of the action, and the effect will be sufficiently complete. Fortius,
Mr. Claudet, having placed in his stereoscope two separate cubic frames, has only to
fix on their four sides, at right angles, two sets of four pictures, which are made to
pass in consecutive order before the lenses, and the figure assumes consecutively
eight different stages of the whole action. The instrument with only two pictures
will suffice to illustrate the principle, and, at the same time, elicit some curious
phenomena of the perception of vision. The author has constructed his instrument
in such a manner that by means of a slide with one hole he can, by moving it

rapidly in a reciprocating horizontal direction, shut one lens while the other remains
open ; and in continuing that motion, while one eye sees one of the two pictures,
10 REPORT 1865.

the second eye cannot see the other picture. If, before the sensation of one eye

exhausted, the slid j shuts the first lens and opens the other, a new impression ispro-

duced, and we have an uninterrupted sensation of vision as if the object had moved

before as ; and if a sufficient number of pictures represent that object in the various

consecutive positions it has assumed during the several stages of its motion, we expe-

rience the sensations we hare when we see the object while moving; and although

the pictures in their limited number do not show all the intermediate positions,

still the mind has the power of filling up the deficiency, as it does if, when looking

at a real object in motion, we accidentally wink the eyelids, or an obstacle happens

to pass between us and the object. To exemplify this, Mr. Claudet has employed

two photographic pictures, one representing the beginning of an action, the other

the end. By moving the slide one way, the right eye can see the picture repre-

senting the figure in one position, while the picture showing the other is invisible

to the left eye ; then by moving the slide the other way, the left eye sees the figure

in the second position, and the first picture is invisible to the right eye. Although

we have really only seen the figure in two extreme positions, still we have the illu-

--sion of having observed the intermediate positions as, for example, in a slide

exhibited having one picture of a boxer with his arm close to his side as preparing

to hit, and another with the arm extended delivering the blow. Here, although all

the intermediate positions are omitted which must have been assumed during the

act, the miud completes the action. Another curious phenomenon of this alternate

vision  is,  that  one  cannot  distinguish  which  eye  the  object  is  seen  by               for  although
                                                                                              ;

the vision is transferred alternately from one eye to the other, we are not conscious

of the act; and during the change of pictures which has taken place in the mean*

time, we have had a uniform and uninterrupted sensation, and consequently it has

appeared as if the object were moving.

On Spectacles for Divers, and on the Vision of Amphibious Animals.

                                By F. Galton, F.B.S., F'.G.S.

Bathers who have surmounted the very natural repugnance, felt by beginners, to

open then.' eyes when they dive, find when they look about them under water that

nothing is to be seen with distinctness. They perceive little more than a haze of

diffused light ; for their eyes are thoroughly out of focus in a water medium. "When

a man under water holds his hands at a little distance from his face, so great is the
confusion of outline, that he cannot discover the spaces between his fingers even when

he has separated them as widely as possible. The appearance is a formless blurr of

Nowwhite.          what is the precise cause of this indistinctness of vision ? By what

optical arrangement can it be overcome':" And how do amphibious animals accom-

modate their sight to the requirements both of air and of water P Suppose a tube,

with a flat bottom of glass, tilled with water ; when the surface is perfectly still,
and we look down the tube, we see objects lying in the water and others in the air
below the glass bottom, with perfect distinctness. But if we bend the head down

to the tube, the instant the eye touches the water all distinctness of vision ceases.

The convex surface of the eyeball has indented the plain surface of the water and

thereby turned the tube into a concavo-plane water-lens. The convexity of the

eyeball is very great ; according to physiologists, the radius of its curvature is only

0'31 of an inch ; the effect of the concave lens which it stamps on the surface of

the water must be proportionately large ; and if it be desired to counteract its in-

fluence, a convex lens must be used of such high power that, when immersed in

Awater, its effect shall be equal and opposite to that of the concave water-lens.
Asimple calculation shows the description of lens required.
                                                                          double-convex lens of

dint glass, each of whose surfaces has a radius of 0'48, is the equivalent. It would

exactly neutralize the effect of the concave water-lens, if it were held close to the

eyeball. This curvature of the lens would require to be somewhat modified accord-

ing to the convexity of each individual eye, and to the refractive power of different

Whenkinds of tlint glass."      held at the usual distance of an eye-glass from the eye,

a lens of more moderate power, such as a radius of OGO, or even 070, is found

sufficient. Furnished with eye-glasses containing suitable lenses, we might expect

that the vision of a diver would be rend* red as (dear under water as in air, that its

range wotdd be limited only by the turbidity of the water, and that it would not be

affected by indistinctness due to the disordered focus. But the author had found

that the eye, when looking through a lens of this description under water, has

not much power of accommodating itself to                                                                                                                                                              different distances                                                                                                         and with the best

· of those the author had as yet constructed, the limit of distinct vision appeared

practically restricted to a range of about eight feet. The attempt, however, was

only provisional : his experiments had but very recently been commenced. It must
be distinctly understood that men in diving-machines or helmets do not require such

lenses; for their eyeballs are separated from the water by the apparatus iu which

they are cooped up. All that is needed by such persons is to have ordinary windows

of stout plate glass through which they can look: out into the medium which sur-

rounds them. The author's contrivance refers to the wants of divers in pearl- and
sponge-fisheries, to sailors who have occasion to examine the bottoms of their ships,
to persons who have dropped something in the water which they wish to recover,
and to bathers generally. To those who can swim, the author promises a material

addition to their enjoyment, in the possession of these eye-glasses or spectacles. It

is no slight pleasure to live in some degree the life of a mermaid, keeping below

water for a minute at a time, and seeing everything in one's immediate neighbour-

hood as clearly as it could be seen by leaning over the gunwale of a boat on a still
day, when the glare from the water was perfectly shaded. There are many amphi-

bious animals that see as well under water as in air. Amongst these are seals,

otters, hippopotami, water-rats, and diving birds of man}' descriptions. The cornea

of the seal is flattened, but that of the other animals appears to be 88 convex as in

man. By what means these other animals are able to adjust their eyes to the re-

quirements of water and of air indifferently, is wholly unexplained. Physiologists

do not seem to have been aware of the vast powers of optical adjustment which

the habits of these animals necessitate.

The Refraction Equivalent of Carbon. By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.R.S.

The refractive index of a substance, minus unity, divided by the specific gravity, is

termed its specific refractive energy                                                                                                                                                                  and this  multiplied  by the                                                                                                chemical equiva-

lent has been termed, by Landolt, its refraction equivalent. The present commu-

nication was intended to show that carbon, whether as the pure element, or as a

part of solid, liquid, or gaseous compounds, has the same refraction equivalent, viz.

5, or a little more. Diamond gives 5; carbonic acid, 5*08j bisulphide of carbon,

about 4-8 ; while Landolt, from the refraction equivalents of compounds differing

by one equivalent of carbon, determined the number 5. In some highly dispersive

substances a higher number was arrived at by calculation.

   The superiority of this instrument, as compared with that first proposed by the
author, consists in the employment of a compound direct-vision prism over the
eye-piece. The slit is fixed in the focus of the upper lens of the eye-piece, which
is made achromatic, so that all parts of the spectrum may be distinctly seen at the

same time. By using a binocular microscope, the inclined tube can be employed

as a finder ; and on arranging so that a minute object is in the centre of the field,

it will be directly in front of the slit fixed in the eye-piece of the other tube. On

looking through this eye-piece it is easy to see that the object is properly placed
in front of the slit ; and then, on placing the prism on the eye-piece, as if it were
a Nicol's prism, the spectrum of the object can be seen to great advantage. This
compound analyzing prism consists of two right-angled prisms of flint glass, between
which is a rectangular prism of crown glass, and at each end a crown-glass prism
of about 75°, all cemented together with Canada balsam. Arrangements are also

made in the instrument, by means of a reflecting prism covering half the slit, so
that the spectrum of a minute object placed on the stage may be compared with

that of a larger object placed mi a stage attached to the side of the eye-piece, and

thus their difference or identity may be seen at a glance. It is thus easy to compare

tlie spectra of minute crystals and of their solutions, to study Hie Bpectra of small
coloured blowpipe beads, and, in fact, accurately examine the nature of the light

transmitted through any minute coloured substances. By using a parabolic reflector
attached to the object-glass, opaque bodies maybe examined by reflected light;
and, as a curious test-object, it may be mentioned that, by this means, a speck of

blood on white paper, which would not weigh more than one-millionth of a grain,
will show a perfectly characteristic spectrum.

Experimental Inquiry into the Laws of the Conduction of Heat in Barn, and

 into the Conducting -Power of Wrought Iron. By Principal Forbes, F.R.S.

   The experiments described in this paper were all made in 1850 and 1851, upon
a plan which was fully explained by the author in letters to Mr. Airy and Pro-
fessor Kelland in the former year. Some notice of them appeared in the British
Association Reports for 1851 and 1852, .and the apparatus was supplied by a grant

from the Association.
    In previous inquiries into the thermal condition of a long conducting bar heated

at one end, two assumptions have always been made .--first, that the flux of heat

across any transverse section of the bar is proportional throughout to the rapidity

of the decrement of temperature reckoned along the axis of the bar (or to -=-, where

v represents the temperature, above that of surrounding space, of any point of the

axis of the bar at a distance x from the origin ) : secondly, that the loss of heat

by radiation and convection from the surface of the bar is at every point propor-

tional to the same temperature n. By assuming these principles (the last of which

is certainly more or less inexact), the well-known solution of the problem of the

heated bar is, that the temperatures (or excesses of temperature) diminish in a

geometrical progression from the origin, and finally, of course, become insensible.

Previous experimenters have confined themselves to finding the constants of the

logarithmic curve for different substances, and thence their relative (not absolute)

conducting-powers.

In the experiments now described, neither of the above-mentioned principles is

assumed. The external loss of heat is directly ascertained by experiment, and the

admissibility or otherwise of the first of the two assumptions is also directly tested.

--That                                             F  =  ft-- , where F is the flux of heat

across unit of section, k the conducting-power for the substance employed, and v

and x have the same signification as before.

I. In the first instance, a bar of iron 8 feet long and \\ inch in diameter, was

heated at one end by means of a crucible containing melted solder. Thermometers

were inserted at various points of its length. The results, v in terms of x,

were projected in a curve (approximately a logarithmic), and the values of j-

were found by projection or calculation, or both.

II. Next, a short bar (20 inches long), perfectly similar in section and condition

of surface to the long bar, is heated to above 200° Cent, in a bath of fused metal,
and allowed to cool in free space, a thermometer being inserted at the centre of its

length. This gives us the rate at which such a bar is parting with its heat from all
causes whatever, in terms of the temperature shown by a thermometer in its axis.

   III. The losses of heat in unit of time (one minute) last found, may be taken as
representing the amount of heat dissipated from each elementary section of the

long bar in the statical experiment (I.), being given in terms of the temperature
Aproper to each point of such a bar.
                                      curve may thus be constructed, having for

its line of abscissa? the axis of the long bar, and for ordinates, the rate of dissipa-

tion of heat from each portion of its surface clue to both radiation and convection.

This curve is called by the author the statical curve of cooling.
   IV. If we can by mechanical quadrature, or otherwise, find the whole amount of

heat dissipated between any point of the long bar and its coolest extremity, we
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               13

have, in fact, the flux of heat passing from the hotter extremity of the body across
the particular section in question ; for the condition of permanence of the tempe-
rature of the bar arises from the equality of the heat supplied and dissipated. Hut

the whole heat dissipated in unit of time is the integral of the partial dissipations

represented by vertical ordinates of the last-named curve, taken between any as-

Fsumed point x and the furthest or cool end of the bar. This quantity, then, is

or the flux across unit of section at the point x.

  WeV. are now able to resolve the question whether or not the flux of heat is in

the given bar everywhere proportional to the rapidity with which the temperature

law would obviously follow from the supposition of any kind of molecular motion
whatsoever, and it therefore affords of itself no reason for preferring one supposi-
tion as to the kind of molecular motion which constitutes sensible heat to another.
But if there be molecular motions in bodies, it is certain that, although all of them
are capable of conversion into that which constitutes sensible heat, some of them
are not accompanied by sensible heat. For example, the motion, supposed to be
vibratory and wave-like, which constitutes radiance, whether visible or invisible,
is not accompanied by sensible heat, and only produces sensible heat by its absorp-
tion, that is, in the language of hypothesis, by its conversion into some other kind
of motion ; while, on the other hand, in the production of radiance sensible heat
disappears. The object of the paper, then, is to give an elementary proof of the
proposition (of which the author gave an intricate algebraical demonstration in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1851), that the second law of
thermodynamics follows from the supposition that sensible heat consists in any kind

of steady molecular motion within limited spaces. Steady motion may be defined

as motion in a set of streams of invariable figure. When steady motion takes place

in matter that is confined within a limited space, the streams in which the particles
move must necessarily return into themselves, and be circulating streams, being, in '
that respect, of the nature of whirls or vortices. Steady motion keeps unaltered
the distribution of the density of the moving matter; and it therefore keeps unaltered
the forces depending on such distribution whether of the nature of pressure or of
attraction. In this respect it differs from unsteady motion, such as vibratory and
wave-like motion. Supposing that the dimensions of the limited space in which
the moving matter is enclosed undergo an indefinitely small change by the appli-
cation of suitable forces, and that after that process the motion becomes steady as
it was before, then the dimensions and position of each circulating stream will have
been altered, and the work done in effecting that alteration will consist of energy
converted between the forms of potential energy of the applied forces and actual

--energy of the molecular motions that is, between the forms of mechanical energy

and heat. Prof. Rankine then works out the problem to this conclusion--that, if
sensible heat consists in any land of steady molecular motion within limited spaces,
the conversion of energy during any change in the dimensions of such spaces is the
product of the .absolute temperature into some function of that change and of the
sort and distribution of the matter. It is obvious that the steadiness of the sup-
posed molecular motion is the essential condition which makes the second law of
thermodynamics deducible from a mechanical hypothesis, and that no kind of un-
steady motion, such as vibratory or wave-like motion, would lead to the same
results. If then it be admitted as probable that the phenomena of heat are due to
unseen molecular motions, it must also be admitted that, while the motions which
constitute radiance are vibratory and wave-like, the motions which constitute sen-
sible or thermometric heat must be steady, and like those of circulating streams.
The function by which the absolute temperature is multiplied in calculating the
conversion of energy between the mechanical and the thermic forms is the variation
of what the author has called the "metamorphic function," being one term of the
differential of the "thermodynamic function," which corresponds to what Prof.
Clausius calls " entropy."

 On India -Ruhhcr and Gulta Pereha as Insulators for Submarine Telegraphic
                           Cables. By W. Fairbairn, F.B.S.

     Mr. Fairbairn stated as his opinion that gutta pereha, although not so perfect an
 insulator as india-rubber, was nevertheless preferable for deep-sea cables subjected

 to great pressure. He found by experiment' that the conductivity of the core was

 improved by gutta-percha insulation under severe pressure to a greater extent
 than by india-rubber or any other insulating material ; and he believed it was more
 durable and better calculated to resist the action of salt water at great depths.

   Out of a great number of specimens of different kinds of insulators, he found that
gutta percha, with the exception of Chatterton's compound, absorbed less water
under a pressure of 20,000 lbs. on the square inch than any of the others, and that
it closed much tighter upon the conducting wires than any of the other materials

experimented upon.

   As regards the ' Great Eastern' ship and the paying-out machinery, he went in her

from the Nore to Yalentia for the purpose of witnessing the behaviour of that vessel,
and nothing could be more satisfactory than the ' Great Eastern ' as a submerger.
Her smooth and easy motion at sea, and the efficiency of the paying-out machinery,
were in every respect calculated to ensure success; and it was much to be resetted
that this important enterprise had failed from causes over which the parties engaged
had probably no control.

On the Change of Form and Colour which the Stratified Discharge assumes
   when a Varied Resistance is introduced in the Circuit of an Extended Series

  of the Voltaic Battery. By J. P. Gassiot, V.P.R.S.

Some months since the author commenced the construction of a voltaic battery,

consisting of 4000 insidated glass cells, into each of which, in lieu of sulphate of

copper, as used by the late Prof. Daniell, about a tablespoouful of sulphate of
mercury is introduced ; the elements carbon and amalgamated zinc plates are then
inserted, and the cells filled with rain-water. In this form of battery the zinc
plates apparently remain free from local action, and are consequently not oxidized

or acted upon, except when the circuit is completed. When the, battery is in action,

sulphate of zinc is obtained in solution, and the mercury that is set free assists in
the amalgamation of the zinc plates : the water being so slightly acidulated, and

the resistance in the carbon plates being so much greater than if this element of
the battery had been a metal, the amount of chemical action, and that of the elec-

trical force, is proportionally less than that in  the nitric-acid battery                                                                                                        but the dis-

charge is constant and regular in a most remarkable degTee. For his researches

upon electric stratified discharges the author has now more than, four hundred

vacuum-tubes, some exhausted by himself, and others by Geissler, of Bonn. In

one of the latter he obtained certain phenomena which it was the more immediate

object of this communication to describe. The appearances in the tube, with

discharges from 1200 and 4000 series of the battery taking place, and when the

resistance of various lengths of a column of distilled water is introduced into the

circuit, were illustrated by diagrams. The water is contained in a tube half an

inch in diameter, and three feet long ; two wires are introduced into it, one being

connected with one terminal of the battery, and the other with the vacuum-tube

while by raising or lowering either of the wires the length of the column of water

remaining in the current is increased or diminished, and in this way the amount of

Whenresistance can be altered with great facility.  one wire is inserted in the

water, and the other touches the moistened surface of the glass, but is not in actual

contact with the water, a luminous discharge will be observed, filling the entire

tube, without any sign or appearance of stratification. On depressing the wire, and

thus bringing it into contact with the surface of the water, small crescent-shaped

disks of red light are observed to be rapidly produced in quick succession from the

positive pole. On shortening the resistance by farther depression of the wire, the
disks commence receding, one by one disappearing at the positive terminal, until
nineteen remain, much increased in brilliancy and definition. From this condition

of the discharge a remarkable change takes place on further depressing the wire and
reducing the resistance ; the two disks nearest the negative terminal join together,
assuming the form of a double-convex lens, the side facing the negative being of a

slightly blue tinge, that towards the positive of a reddish fawn, and the centre a bril-
liant red colour. At the instant this change of form and colour takes place in the two
disk's, another crescent-shaped disk sinmlfaneously appears at the positive terminal
and as the depression of the wire in the water is continued, each of the two disks

nearest the negative terminal will successively join, and assume the double-convex
form described, at every such change another crescent-shaped disk simultaneously

appearing. When the circuit is completed without any resistance of water being
16 REPORT 1805.

introduced in the current, all the nineteen striae assume the double-convex form,
the blue being far more intense or vivid, particularly in those nearest the negative,
the red line in the centre continuing in all. In this state of the discharge the
tube was placed between the poles of a very powerful electro-magnet ; and on
exciting the magnet the disks separated, precisely as if a resistance had been intro-
duced, but deflected to the upper or lower part of the tube, according to the

direction of the magnetic power. On the sides of the tube, where four or five of

the disks nearest the negative impinge, there at present remains a black deposit
similar to that deposited from the negative metallic wires by an induction-coil.

As much heat is evolved at the negative wire, and until the author obtains an-

other tube which will exhibit the same results be does not like to risk its destruc-
tion, he is thus prevented from continuing the experiment to the extent he desires :
but if it is found that a deposit can be obtained at defined portions of the

stratified discharge, it may probably assist in explaining phenomena which have

hitherto baffled the researches of every electrician.

On a New Method, introduced by Messrs. Siemens, for the Measurement of
                      Electrical Resistances. By 11. Sabine.

   The insulation of submarine-telegraph cables was, until the Red-Sea and Indian
lines were submerged, in 1859, determined qualitatively by the simple deflection of a
galvanometer-needle. The manufacture of the core of the Malta cable, with the

scrupulous surveillance of its electrical conditions, formed an era in cable-work
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and Messrs. Siemens, who were intrusted by the Government with the duties of
electricians to the cable, may be said to have then first established with success the

science of cable-testing. After various improved plans, the Messrs. Siemens intro-
duced, in 1860, for cable-work, a differential galvanometer with two coils, one of

which exerted two thousand times as much deflective force upon the needle as the
other. The cable and the measuring-battery were inserted in the circuit of the

larger helix, and a single element with a set of resistance-coils in that of the less
sensitive helix of the instrument. The resistance in the latter circuit was altered
until the magnetic forces of the two currents upon the needle were equal and oppo-
site and the pointer rested over the zero-line of the card. The manipulation was
simple, and the necessary calculations reduced to the mere multiplication of the
value of the resistance in the smaller circuit by the constant of sensibility and the

relation of the electromotive forces. On the fitting out of the Carthagena cable

it was considered desirable in measurements of insulation to dispense with mathe-
matical reductions, and to read off the resistances directly from the instrument. It

is easily understood that, to establish an equilibrium between the magnetic forces

of two coils of a differential galvanometer, it is not absolutely necessary to alter

the currents in either of the circuits ; the same may be attained by altering the re-

lative distances of the coils from the needle. This is the principle upon which the

new differential galvanometer, forming the subject of this communication, was

Abased. The mechanical construction of the instrument is very simple.  pair of

astatic needles are suspended by a fibre of unspun silk between about 10,000 turns

of a long, thin, well-insulated copper wire, their position being indicated by an

aluminium poiuter fixed across their axis, moving over a dial-card and observed

through a magnifying-glass. Outside the case of the instrument is a horizontal

metal stage, upon which a vertical coil of insulated copper wire is moved to and

from the instrument by means of a micrometer screw. The theory of the method

--of this instrument and its use in testing cable resistances is this : Two galvanic
-- --currents circulate in the two coils the stationary and the moveable in oppo-

site directions, and will oppose each other in their effects upon the needle, which
will take up a position at an angle less than that which it would if the stronger

coil were alone active. By altering the position of one of the coils a point is
reached where the deflective force of one coil is made to exactly counterbalance
the force of the other, and the needle returns to zero. To measure the resistance

of a cable with this instrument, then, nothing more is necessary than to put it in
the circuit of the larger coil aud to vary, by means of the micrometer-screw, the
position of the moveable coil until equilibrium is obtained. The distance is then

read off, and a table prepared beforehand supplies the corresponding resistance in
units. In this way, during the paying out of a cable, the state of the line can at

any time be known without expending time in calculating the observations.

   On some New Arrangements of the Poles of Magnets. By Capt. Selwtn.

   The author described a method by which magnets may be made of which botli

ends possess north polarity or south polarity at will ; aud under these circumstances
the place of both the south or both the north poles will be found in close juxtapo-
sition in the centre of the bar. The process by which these effects are produced
is to take out the temper of the bar, at any point where it is desired the two poles
shall be in proximity, by a rod of heated metal or by the blowpipe. This opera-
tion, while seemingly leaving the bar intact, has separated the two magnets,

though the ends will still be respectively north and south poles. If now the north
pole of a strong magnet be used and drawn from the centre of the bar towards the

north end of the prepared needle, the polarity of that half will be reversed without
affecting the other end, and by a series of careful touches both ends will become
equally balanced south poles, as in a specimen exhibited to the Section. If the bar

has been softened in more than one place, a series of magnets may be produced in

the same piece of steel with similar or dissimilar poles in juxtaposition.
   Capt. Selwyn also exhibited and described to the Section a new form of horizontal

galvanometer, compensated by the introduction of a natural fixed magnet, in addi-
tion to the moveable one which is deflected by the current of electricity in these
instruments. This is kept at zero by the attraction of the first, and its force is
exerted in opposition to that of the current of electricity, and in a similar ratio.

Remarks upon Aerial Navigation, suggested by Mr. Glaisher's late Balloon

                             Ascents. By F. W. Brearey.

   Mr. Brearey, alluding to the important observations of Mr. Glaisher, remarked

that he had only been creeping along the borders of a vast immensity of which we
know almost nothing.

  Now that public attention was directed to these scientific efforts, and that the

balloon was becoming more than a toy, he would at once propose the formation of
a society, to be supported by subscriptions and donations, by which experiments

could be conducted in its own grounds, and with its own apparatus, for the further-

ance of investigations in aerology and aerial locomotion.
   After pointing out the requirements of aeronauts for locomotive purposes,

Mr. Brearey suggested, with the object of saving gas and ballast, that a man might

raise himself iu the air by a mechanical appliance attached to a balloon inflated only
to such an extent as woidd give him buoyancy. The downward blow of paddles
made of bamboo and silk, if returning feathered for each succeeding stroke, would
enable him to effect this, and also to keep a low elevation, go with the wind,
ascend and descend at pleasure, find different currents, and save his gas for future

use.

   It would, moreover, comply with the conditions insisted upon by late writers on
aeronautics, viz. " that, to contend with the air, one must be specifically heavier
than the air."

different parts of her surface would not attain the same degree of heat. Nearly
two-thirds of the hemisphere turned towards us is honeycombed with gigantic

craters, and covered with the debris of stupendous volcanic eruptions, the region in
which Tycho is situated forming a principal part of the whole extent,_ and being
conspicuous to the naked eye from its superior brightness. That region should

therefore absorb less heat in proportion to its reflecting properties. On the other

hand, the dark surfaces of the moon would absorb and radiate heat in the inverse
ratio to their non-reflecting properties. The above facts must be borne in mind in
considering the question of the heat attained by the moon at the periods of oppo-
sition and quadrature. In addition to this, though the whole surface of the moon
is exposed in turn for from about thirteen to rather more than sixteen days to the
solar rays, in speaking of the heat which our satellite attains it must not be con-

sidered that equal surfaces illuminated-- e. r/., at the first and third quarters-- are

equally heated because so illuminated, or without reference to the duration of the sun's

radiation upon them. On the contrary, at the day of first quarter, the region of the
moon which has received the rays of the sun for a mean period of rather more than

four days, after being subjected* to the most intense cold during the moon's long

night, has been but very little warmed up to the completion of the first quarter

the region opposite the earth having received the heat of the sun's rays for only

about four-and-twenty hours--a period manifestly insufficient for any surplus heat

to have been absorbed, even if the region had been favourable for storing radiant

heat. At the period of last quarter, on the other hand, the surface illuminated

will have been heated thrice as long as at the first quarter, namely, for a mean

duration  of  eleven    days                          and not only so,  but at  the time when the moon com-
                                                   ;

pletes her third or "last quarter," a similar surface to that at first quarter will have

--received the heat of the sun's rays for 360 in place of 24 hours, with this additional

peculiarity, that the surface generally will be a good absorber of heat. The heat

of the moon at the last quarter might, on like grounds, be shown to be greater, or

certainly not less, than at the full. It will be sufficient, however, to point out that
the portion of the moon's fully-illuminated hemisphere opposite to us, and which

radiates heat directly towards the earth, is not heated so intensely at the full as at

the   last quarter, or  for  a                        day or so  after that phase                                                                                               the  ratio  in favour  of the

latter period being nearly two to one, whilst the ratio in favour of the last quarter,

compared with a corresponding region in the first quarter, is rather more than

fifteen to one ; the measure being the duration of solar radiation, without reference
to the dark or light surfaces on which it falls.

   The author exhibited a curve of the mean temperature at Greenwich for fifty

years*, showing that the period of the greatest heat of the lunar surface synchro-
iiized with the period of greatest [average] monthly cold in the terrestrial atmo-

sphere, and conversely.

      On the Self-Registering Barometer at the Liverpool Observatory.
                            By Alfeed King, M.I.C.E.

The increased attention given of late to meteorological observations has naturally

created a demand for instruments, which, by their own action, shall produce' a

permanent record of the various phenomena of our atmosphere. Photography

requires considerable skill in the manipulation, and a more direct and simple mode

of self-registration is therefore in some cases a desideratum. The instrument de-

scribed in this paper is & floating barometer, constructed by Mr. King, since the

exhibition of the first trial instrument at a former Meeting of the British Associa-

tion in 1854. In the ordinary barometer the variations in the atmospheric pres-

sure  are indicated by  the varying height                       of a column    of                                                                                              mercury within a tube in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

this floating barometer they are made evident by the movements of the tube itself,

which is counterpoised by a weight, say at 29 inches. If by the increase in atmo-

spheric pressure the length of the column of mercury in it is increased to 80

inches, it is evident the equilibrium will he destroyed, and the weight of the

additional inch of mercury will cause the tube to descend. If, on the other hand,

the pressure is reduced to 28 inches, one inch of mercury in the column will be lost,

and the tube will rise. The indications of the instrument being dependent on the
motion of the suspended tube, by the contrivance of a partially immersed annular
float surrounding its lower end, the displacement of a corresponding bulk of mer-
cury in the cistern compensates for the gain or loss of weight in the tube. The
range of the index is determined by the proportion which the area of this float
bears to that of the tube. The tube at the Observatory is 3 inches in diameter, and

the range 5^ times that of the ordinary barometer.

On an Anemometer for the Registration of Cyclones or other Tropical Hurri-
                       canes. By A. Follett Osler, F.R.S.

The anemometers erected in this country, though capable of registering the

storms of these latitudes, are not found equal to withstanding the force of a tropical

hurricane. To strengthen the parts sufficiently would cause them to be too ponderous

the momentum obtained by so much additional matter put in rapid motion would

produce fallacious results. In the instrument proposed, of which models of the

various parts were exhibited, the pressure-plate is not exposed to the direct action

of the wind, but is placed in a horizontal position in a circular box, somewhat re-

sembling- the form of a cheese, which being edgewise to the current offers much

Aless resistance to the force of the hurricane.  long Hat aperture near the bottom

of the box is kept facing the wind by means of a vane, and the horizontal pressure-

plate, which is carried by strong springs, has an air-tight diaphragm round it con-

necting it with the inside of the box ; the force of the air entering by the long aper-

t (ilea and thus impounded in the box, is measured by the amount of motion commu-

nicated to the plate, and is recorded by a simple contrivance which is connected by

a wire with the pressure-plate, and dots off the maximum and minimum force of each

gust either on plain paper or, as recommended by Mr. Osier, on double sheets with

carbon paper between, so as to obtain duplicate records, the paper being carried for-

ward in the usual way by means of a clock. The trouble and uncertainty of pencils

for recording- the force of the wind is, by this plan of dotting, entirely removed

the point which makes the dot moves without touching the paper, and is brought

down by a double knee-joint to make the dot only when the maximum or minimum

pressure has been attained.

The direction of the wind is at the same time recorded by connecting with the

vane two endless crank or bell chains, carried by two pulleys, the centres of which

are placed at a distance from one another equal to the range that may be desired

for making the record ; to these chains, which work parallel to one another, the

recording pencils or styles are attached : the movement is simple, and not easily

deranged. Mr. Osier also exhibited a model of a small portable observatory

arranged for this instrument ; it is circular, about seven feet high, and tapering

from three feet six inches in diameter at the bottom to three feet at the top, and

Adivided perpendicularly into four parts for portability.  strong iron hoop fits

over each end, to which iron rods are fixed as guys, stretching out in four directions

to iron or wood posts let firmly into the ground. The principal advantage of this

construction consists in its capability of being temporarily but securely fixed in any

situation that may be desirable for special anemometrical observations.

Description of the Magnetic Storm of the Beginning of August 1865, as re-

   corded by the Self-recording Magnetographs at the Kew and Lisbon Obser-
  vatories. Bg J. B. Capello and B. Stewart, F.R.S.

   The great magnetic storm which broke out about the beginning of August last
will be remembered as occurring at the time when anxiety began to be felt respect-
ing the fate of the Atlantic cable. The following are the general characteristics

of that storm, and apply both to Kew and Lisbon, since these two places were

similarly affected by the storm. It first commenced about 5.40 p.m. (G. M. T.) of
the 2nd of August ; but it broke out with great violence, and with those rapid
motions which form the mark of a large disturbance, about 5 a.m. of the 3rd of
August, and this outbreak lasted until midnight of that day or early morning of
the 4th of August. The disturbance then ceased for about twenty-four hours, re-
commencing a little before midnight of the 4th of August, and lasting till about

4 p.m. of the next day. There remained, however, traces of the disturbance for a
considerable time after this date. There were thus two great outbreaks forming
this storm, the first commencing on the 2nd of August at 5.40 p.m., or more notably
on the 3rd of August, at 5 a.m., and lasting till early morning of the 4th of August,
the second commencing about 11 p.m. of the 4th of August and lasting till 4 p.m.
of the 5th of August. With regard to the first of these two outbreaks, from about
5 a.m. until 11 a.m. on the 3rd of August the horizontal and vertical components of
the magnetic force were both considerably decreased by it, while in the afternoon of
the same day they were both, but especially the vertical-force component, consi-
derably increased. The westerly declination, on the other hand, was, on an average,
increased during the greater part of this outbreak, although towards the end it was

probably diminished. Broadly viewed, this disturbance may be said to have

begun with a tendency to diminish both components of the force and to increase
the westerly declination, and to have ended with a tendency to increase both com-

ponents, but especially the vertical force. On the whole, the effect of the dis-

turbance was, probably, to diminish both components of the force, and to increase
the declination. With regard to the second of the two outbreaks which together
constituted this storm, it began by diminishing both components of the force, if

we except a comparatively small increase of horizontal force at the very com-
mencement, and ended by slightly increasing both components at Kew. With

respect to the westerly declination, this element was at first somewhat diminished,
but it was ultimately increased by this disturbance. Broadly viewed, the charac-
teristics of this second outbreak were similar to those of the first, exhibiting a
tendency to diminish both components of force, and slightly to increase the decli-
nation. In comparing the storm with the greater one of August-September 1859,

--as registered at Kew, we find the following points of resemblance : 1. Both

storms consisted of two separate outbreaks, and both the outbreaks of both the
storms began during the hours of night or early morning. Thus we have

Storm of Aug.-Scpt. 1859.                                                                                                                                             Storm of August 18G5.

2. Both outbreaks of both storms tended at first to diminish both components

of the force, and to increase the westerly declination, but changed in the afternoon

of next day into forces tending rather to increase both components. This is a

very good instance of the influence (proved to exist by Gen. Sabine) of the hour

of the day upon the character of the disturbance. Thus we see that in all these
cases we have, in the early morning hours, a diminution of both components of the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  21

force, while in the afternoon hours we have an increase of those components.
3. Both outbreaks of both storms tended, on the whole, to diminish both com-

--ponents of the force, aud to increase the westerly declinatiou, a somewhat uncom-

mon type of disturbance. 4. Both these storms were accompanied by phenomena
on the surface of the sun which are worthy of notice. At the time of the occur-

rence of the great disturbance of August-September 1859, a very large spot might
have been observed on the disk of our luminary, and several of a size somewhat
smaller. Considerable changes were taking place in the appearance of these spots,
and, moreover, a luminous body was observed, by Carrington and Hodgson inde-

pendently, to move across the large spot at the very moment when the magnetic
disturbance broke out at Kew. On the 29th of July, 1865, there was no spot or
almost none on the sun's disc ; but on the 3rd of August there was a very consider-

Kewable spot on the right limb, nearly going off. The only pictures obtained at

were on these days, and it is clear from these that this spot must have rapidly
formed between July 29 and August 3, on the right half of the solar disk. It
would, of course, be premature to conclude that certain changes going on in the

sun cause, or even invariably accompany, terrestrial magnetic storms ; but there

can be no impropriety in stating facts which may possibly serve to establish some

future generalization.

   At the Newcastle Meeting of the Association, the author exhibited a Standard

Barometer combining the advantages of Fortiu's and Gay-Lussac's instruments.
The objection that the contraction and bending of the tube necessary in the
arrangement for making that instrument portable impaired its sensitiveness, has
been entirely removed in this improved one. The facility of reading is also in-

creased.

   In this paper the means adopted for levying the duty upon spirits in the Bevenue

tables. It was distinctly pointed out that the instrument and the tables had been

constructed upon different formula?, and were not in harmony, and that, further,
there were defects in the actual form of that hydrometer, causing considerable
amounts of error in the estimation of the strength of the spirits tested by it.

Address by Professor W. A. Miller, M.D., LL.D., Treas. 6r V.P.R.S., P.G.S.,

                                              President of the Section.

Interesting historical associations are naturally awakened in the mind of the
chemist as he enters upon the business of this section of our scientific gathering in
the town whose hospitalities we are now sharing ; for he is reminded that on the 1st
of August 1774, only ninety-one years ago, Priestley laid, at Birmingham, the
foundation of modern chemistry, by the discovery of Oxygen.

   Yet it seems difficult to realize the fact that there must be some still living, who
entered life when the chemical nature of the atmosphere was undiscovered, when
water was believed to be an elementary substance, when the composition of the
ordinary acids, nitric, hydrochloric, and acetic, was unknown, when the discoveries
of Galvani had not been made, and when the battery which perpetuates the name

of Yolta did not exist.

    It requires a considerable mental effort to estimate aright the extraordinary

progress which chemistry, both in its scientific and in its practical aspect, has made

since that day.

  --For example, the development of the laws of combination the determination of
--the equivalent proportions of the elementary bodies the art of chemical analysis
--the Atomic theory the isolation of potassium, with the consequent discovery of the
--compound nature of the alkalies and earths and the marvellous developments of

the organic department of chemistry, exhibit some of the most striking points in the

progress of the science ; whilst in the chemical arts we may mention gas-lighting

--the manufacture of stearic acid and other fatty acids for candles the industry of
-- --petroleum and paraffin the chemical process of bleaching by chlorine the prepara-

tion of carbonate of soda from common salt, and the extensive alkali trade. The

discovery of iodine and bromine, and their varied applications as remedial agents

-- --and otherwise the fascinating processes of photography the development of the
--trade in beet-root sugar the extraction of quinia, morphia, and all the vegetable
--bases, these and other processes of chemical manufacture too numerous to men-

tion are all subsequent to, and may be said to be in nearly every case consequent

 on, the great discovery of oxygen.

   Y, ell may we sympathize, now, in the sanguine anticipations of Priestley himself,
expressed in the preface to the volume in which this discovery is recorded, ' Ex-

--periments and Observations on different Kinds of Air,' vol. ii. p. vi'i : 'Tn reality, this

is not now a business of air only, as it was at the first ; but appears to be of "much
greater magnitude and extent, so as to diffuse light up >n the most generalprinciples of

natural knowledge, and especially those about which chemistry is particularly con-

versant. And it will not be now thought very assuming to say, that, by working
in a tub of water, or a basin of quicksilver, we may perhaps discover principles of
                            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                             23

more extensive influence than even that of gravity itself, the discovery of which, in
its full extent, contributed so much to immortalize the name of Newton."

   But it is not alone with the name of Priestley that we associate the progress of

chernistiy in Birmingham. Grouped around the father of pneumatic chemistry were

several remarkable men who then either resided at Birmingham or frequently met

there, including Matthew Boulton, James Keir, Dr. Withering, Dr. Darwin, and,

foremost of them all, James Watt, who here diversified his engineering labours with

his famous investigations into the composition of water. It was at the factory at

Soho, too, that Murdoch made the first great experiment on gas-lighting, at the

illuminations for the short-lived peace of Amiens ; aud it wa? in Birmingham

that Dr. Roebuck, in the middle of the last century, erected the first leaden cham-

ber for the making of sulphuric acid, and thereby inaugurated the most important

of the chemical manufactures of this country.

Nor has Birmingham failed in more modern times to maintain her reputation in

connexion with the chemical arts. Here, twenty-live years ago, Elkington founded

the first establishment, in this country, for carrying out the processes of electro-

plating and electro-gilding. Here Asian made the nickel of commerce, with its

--companion metal, cobalt, as oxide articles that might vie in purity with the pro-

ducts of the laboratory. Here Chance has established a manufactory of optical

glass, which specially calls for acknowledgment on the part of the student of

science ; and here Sturge and Albright have erected the only manufactory for red
phosphorus which the country contains.

Vast as is the modern development of experimental science, it yet cannot excite

much surprise that, with the exception of that portion which falls within the

domain of the mathematician, science until recently has been systematically ex-

cluded from the general course of education, and has been followed in the majority

of instances by those only who commenced its study for professional objects. Yet
can we wonder at this, when we remember that the science of chemistry and many

entire branches of experimental physics, including voltaic electricity, electro-

magnetism, thermo-electricity, the phenomena of polarized light, of photo-

chemical action, radiant heat, and others, are, as already stated, less than a century

old ? But the great strides that they have made in that interval, the social changes
that they have introduced, and the additional powers that they have conferred
upon man will vindicate their importance as necessary branches of knowledge to be
acquired ; whilst the more just appreciation of the methods of investigation which

they pursue will establish their claim to be regarded as instruments in training the

mind, and shaping the intellectual development of the future.

Those whose education was based upon the linguistic system almost exclu-

sively, as was the case both before and after Priestley's time, could not be ex-
pected to realize the magnitude and true bearing of the power of science,
and its educational value. Now, however, the case is altered; and it is a

subject for congratulation to reflecting men, that the introduction of the scien-

tific element into the ordinary course adopted at our public schools is at length
attracting serious attention, and that its importance has been insisted on in both

Houses of the Legislature. The practical instinct of the nation is becoming alive to
the necessity of making certain portions of the training of our youth consist in the

systematic  study  of  the  elementary  parts  of  properly  selected  branches   of  science
                                                                                                                    ;

and it behoves all who are themselves engaged in the pursuit of science to consider

in what way they can themselves aid in forwarding this object.

I need not here advert to the exploded notion, that the acquisition of the truths

of science can in anywise endanger those of revelation ; for truth is ever consistent.

But it may not be superfluous to reassure the minds of some who imagine that

science, like a fresh invasion of Vandals, will extinguish scholarship and classical

learning.   Language   must indeed  ever form the basis      of  our  system  of  education
                                                                                                                          ;

for it is the key that unlocks the stores of knowledge ; and no languages are so

fitting to form the groundwork as the tongues of ancient Greece and Pome,

irrespective of the treasures of philosophy, eloquence, poetry, and history which

they contain. They have that intellectual finish and completeness which belongs

Aonly partially to science.  moderate amount of classical knowledge can be, as

indeed it ought to be, attained by every so-called educated mind, while for him
--24 report 1865.

who would carry the critical faculty to a high state of cultivation, the study of

the classics affords the means. These tongues constitute the hasis of many of the

modern European languages ; and an acquaintance with their literature imparts a

cultivation and a polish that it is almost vain to seek from any other source. Just

as some minds seek to attain distinction in the wide domain of philology, other

minds, as vigorous, though differently constituted, delight in the study of natural

laws and affinities. It would he a hard thing to say that provision should not he

made in our schools for the latter, as wide and liberal as it has been for the former.

It is not to be supposed that, beetiu.se science is to form a part of the education

of every gentleman, therefore it will constitute the pursuit of his mature years.

What is needed is that he possess sufficient knowledge of its principles to qualify

him to appreciate the advances which science is making, and to enable him to con-

tribute intelligently towards its progress.

It is certain that if science is to form a useful portion of the education of a boy,

it must be undertaken with the determination to deal with it as a matter of study

the same pains must be taken to ascertain that each boy understands the principle,

for example, of the air-pump, or the meaniug of the thermometric scale, as that he

comprehends a rule in syntax or the analysis of a sentence. To do this, however, the

instruction given must not be limited to a dry lecture on the principles of some branch

of science once a week. These principles must be logically unfolded, and illustrated,
when necessary, by experiments, and the structure of machines and apparatus ex-

plained by suitable diagrams ; the boys must be taught to take notes of each lecture ;
and the ground covered must be made secure by following up the lectures with fre-

quent examinations, both oral and written. These are as necessary to the successful

study of a science as the writing of exercises, or the practice of construing, is to the

accurate study of a language. Science is not merely to supply her facts ; she is to
be employed to develope the powers of the mind, and to discipline them for action.

Hence it is of far more importance to instil principles, and to cultivate precision in

observation, in thought, and in description, than it is to load the memory with mere

facts, however valuable. In short, the system of cramming is to be eschewed, whilst

the formation of habits of comparing, reasoning, and judging is to be encouraged in

every way.

   It may at first be difficult to meet with well-trained and competent teachers ; but
when once the want of instruction in science is proclaimed, the teachers will soon

be forthcoming. Some years will, no doubt, elapse ere science is admitted to take

equal rank, as a means of education, with the study of classical literature. Still it

is but a question of time ; and we cannot but hope that our Universities, following
up the commencement which the youngest but not the least active amongst them,

--the University of London, has made in the establishment of Degrees in Science
   we cannot hut hope, I say, that the heads of our Universities will ere long feel it

to be their duty, as unquestionably it will be their wisdom, to place themselves at

the head of this new movement, which is destined to exercise so wide an influence
upon the education of our people.

But it is time that we proceed to take a rapid survey of some of the principal

points in the progress of chemistry during the last twelve months. The course of

chemical discovery since our Meeting last year, though not marked by any very

striking novelty, has nevertheless been steadily advancing. Ideas previously

thrown out have been discussed and developed ; and many of them are leading to
new discoveries, or are being applied to explain phenomena before wrapped in

obscurity.

Amongst the problems which have, for some time past, been engaging the minds

of philosophical chemists, few are of greater interest than those connected with the

idea of the atomicity of the elements. It is well known that chemists now

distinguish between the atomic weight and the equivalent of an element; also that,

owing to the labours of many distinguished men, amongst whom the names of

Williamson, Kekule, Odling, Cannizzaro, and Wurtz are the most prominent, a

classih" cation of the elements into families has been made ; and that this classification
rests upon what is known as the atomicity of the elements. One group of the ele-

ments, like potassium and chlorine, is regarded as monatmnic, or usually equivalent

in functions to one atom of hydrogen                                                                                                                                      a second, like oxygen and sulphurj is diatomic,
                                                                                                                                                                       ;
                                                                                                               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                       25

or equivalent in functions to two atoms of hydrogen ; a third group, like nitrogen,

phosphorus, and arsenic, is triatomic, or equivalent for the most part to three

atoms of hydrogen                                                                                           while  a fourth group, like carbon        and silicon, is tetratomic,  or
                                                                                                         ;

equivalent in functions to four atoms of hydrogen, and so on.

It would lead us too much into detail were I to attempt to show how this idea

of the atomicity of the elements has heen applied, and is still in process of applica-

tion, to the study of the formation of compounds in general, how it endeavours
to explain the existence of a limit to their numher, and how it even teaches us to

anticipate their possible varieties.

  Among the subjects connected with its development is its bearing upon isome-

rism, or the remarkable fact of the existence in many cases of two or more bodies of

different properties but yet composed of the same elements combined in identically
the same proportions. Upon this subject, which, at our last Meeting, was charac-

terized by Dr. Odling as the chemical problem of the day, a suggestive theoretical

paper was published, about twelve months ago, by Dr. Oram Brown whilst, in the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

same direction, Cahours, Kekule, Beilstein, Fittig, and several other chemists have

published valuable experimental researches. Inquiries of this kind are now

acquiring special importance from the numerous cases of the formation of such

isomeric bodies by the methods of synthesis and substitution, which are daily

multiplying.

Closely connected with the same subject are the investigations into the consti-

tution of the more complex organic acids, which have been prosecuted so actively

during the last live or six years, and which, in the hands of Kolbe, Frankland,

Perkin and Duppa, Kekule, Wurtz, and their pupils, have made such rapid

progress.

   During the past year Frankland and Duppa have especially signalized themselves

by their researches upon the lactic and the acrylic series. Two years ago, Frank-

land, commencing with oxalic ether, and acting upon it with zinc ethyl, obtained

from it leucic ether by substituting ethyl for a portion of the oxygen contained in

the oxalic ether; and afterwards, conjointly with his friend Duppa, he has genera-

lized this reaction. Still more recently, these chemists have traced the connexion

between the lactic and the acrylic or oleic series, by reactions in which the abstraction
of the elements of an atom of water from the basylous portion of a member of the
lactic group converts it into the corresponding member of the acrylic series. These

relations will be readily understood by representing the different compounds by

symbols, as follows :

   In these and kindred investigations, the necessity for the introduction of fixed

principles of nomenclature for regulating the construction of names for the recently
discovered compounds has been sensibly felt ; and indeed the changes in notation
rendered necessary by the alteration in the values assigned to the atomic weights
of many of the chemical elements have rendered a general revision of the system
of chemical nomenclature a matter of pressing importance. Probably few subjects
coidd more usefully occupy a portion of the time of this Section during the ensuing

week than a thoughtful consideration of the changes which it may be expedient to
introduce. The meeting of chemists from various parts of Furope with many from
distant parts of our own country affords an excellent opportunity for discussing a

subject of this kind, where any conclusions, to be practically effective, must secure

the concurrence of a majority of the active cultivators of the science.

   Did time permit, it would be easy to mention other investigations in the organic
department of chemistry, scarcely less interesting than those already alluded to,
such as those on the synthesis of the aromatic acids by Kekule, who has pre-
pared both benzoic and toluic acid by the graduated action of sodium on an
26 report--1865.

or such as those of Maxwell Simpson and of Baeyer on the artificial formation

of tribasic acids ; and, referring to methods of research, stress might be laid on the

important aid afforded by the extended use of the am tlgam of sodium as a redu-

cing agent, and on the similar but still more remarkable reducing-elfects of hy-

--driodic acid, processes, indeed, not new, but the value of which till quite recently
has only been partially recognized.

  Passing allusion only can now be made to some of the processes of mineral and

metallurgic chemistry, such as the improvements in the details of the process for

preparing magnesium., the comparative facility with which the recently discovered

metals thallium, rubidium, aud caesium and their compounds may be obtained,

and the application by Redtenbacher of his observation of the sparing solubilitj' of
their alums to the extraction of the new alkalies from the lithium residues of com-

merce. Of indium, too, the latest of the newly discovered metals revealed by the

spectrum, it must suffice to say that it has been obtained in quantity which places

myits existence as a distinct metal beyond question. I am indebted to  iriend

Professor Roscoe for the small specimens of the metal and its sulphide now upon

the table.

  An extensive branch of industry is now springing up in the improved methods of

voltaic deposition of the metals. Weil has, by the use of an alkaline solution of

tartrate of copper, contrived to coat iron and steel with a tough closely adherent

sheathing of copper, by simply suspending the articles to be coated by means of a

wire of zinc in the metallic bath. No battery is required. Lead and tin may in a

similar manner be deposited on copper, iron, or steel, if the oxide of tin or of lead

be dissolved in a bath of strong solution of caustic soda.

   I must, before I conclude, advert to one or two interesting additions to our

knowledge upon the side where chemistry and physics meet. Few results, perhaps,

were more unexpected than those obtained by Deville aud Troost upon the per-

meability to gases of certain dense metals at elevated temperatures. They have
proved that platinum andiron, when white-hot, become for the time porous, and are

rapidly permeated by hydrogen, which will even pass out under the pressure of the

atmosphere and leave a vacuum almost perfect within the tube, in one form of

these experiments, tubes of hammered and of cast platinum (which in one case was

as much as a twelfth of an inch in thickness) were fitted by means of corks into

the axis of a shorter and wider tube of glazed porcelain; a slow current of pure and

dry hydrogen was then maintained through the porcelain tube, whilst a current

of* dry air was transmitted through the platinum tube. At ordinary temperatures

Ano change was observed in either gas.  tire was then lighted around the outside

of the porcelain tube, and gradually raised until the heat became very intense.

At 2000° Fahr. the oxygen contained in the air had entirely disappeared; nothing

but nitrogen mixed with steam passed out of the platinum tube, hydrogen had

passed through the pores of the platinum and entered into combination with the

oxygen of the air within; whilst at still higher temperatures the moist nitrogen
became mixed with hydrogen. As the tube cooled, the same phenomena occurred

in the inverse order, till, when the ordinary temperature had been regained, no

diffusion of hydrogen was perceptible, and unaltered air was collected from the
platinum tube. Analogous results were obtained when a tube of soft cast steel was

substituted for that of platinum, though the thickness of the steel tube was an

eighth, or in some cases as much as a sixth of an inch.

From these experiments one practical conclusion deducible is, that air-pyrometers,

the bulbs of which are formed of iron or platinum, cannot be relied on when em-

ployed for measuring elevated temperatures glazed porcelain, however, was found
                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

to confine the gases completely.

Curious as these results are, they are but parenthetical in another series of more

general bearing, in which Deville has for some time teen engaged, viz. the pheno-
mena of dissociation, as he has termed the partial decomposition which com-

Apound gases experience under the influence of a temperature more or less elevated.

       very striking result was obtained by the use of an apparatus similar to that
employed in the experiments just described, but in which a brass or silvered tube

Awas substituted for the platinum or iron tube. rapid flow of water was maintained

through the metallic tube, so that it was kept quite cool, whilst the outer porcelain

tube was gradually raised to an intense heat as before. On transmitting a current

of pure and dry carbonic oxide through the porcelain tube, the lower part of the

surface of the cold metallic tube became covered with deposited carbon, whilst a
portion of the carbonic oxide, by combining with the oxygen previously united with
this carbon, became converted into carbonic anhydride.

Sulphurous anhydride was by similar treatment resolved into sulphur and

sulphuric anhydride; and even hydrochloric acid was partially separated into
hydrogen and chlorine. These experiments are intimately connected with the
attempts made to explain the cause of certain exceptions to Ampere's law, that

equal volumes of gases or vapours contain the same number of molecules of each.

Chemists now generally assume that the molecule, both of simple and of compound

bodies, forms two volumes of vapour, and consequently that the molecular weight
of any substance corresponds with the number which represents twice its density

when referred to the density of hydrogen, if this be taken as unity. But there are

exceptions to this law: pentachloride of phosphorus, hydrochloride of ammonia,

hydnodate of phosphuretted hydrogen, and various other bodies, instead of

forming two volumes when one molecule of each is converted into vapour, yield

four volumes.

   In order to explain these anomalies, Kopp and Cafinizzaro suppose that, at the
temperature at which the vapour-densities of these compounds are observed, the

bodies are temporarily decomposed, and, instead of forming one homogeneous

vapour, are at the time of the observation really composed of a mixture of vapours.

In certain cases this explanation is probably the true one; but its general accept-
ance has been disputed by Deville himself, though his results on dissociation seem,

to cursory observation, to be in its favour ; and it must be admitted that, up to the

present time, the arguments and experiments which he has brought forward in
opposition to the views of Kopp and Cannizzaro have not been satisfactorily

answered.

No sufficient proof, for example, has yet been adduced that the well-known

anomalous cases of nitric oxide, chlorous anhydride, hydrosulphide of ammonium,
cyanide of ammonium, and various other salts of ammonium and the volatile bases

are due to dissociation of their components.

This subject is one, however, too intimately connected with the molecular

Newtheories at present under discussion to remain long in its actual state.  ex-

periments and evidence will no doubt be forthcoming, which will throw further

light upon the cause of these outstanding exceptions.

  Notes on Compounds of Copper and Phosphorus. By F. A. Abel, F.R.S.

   Mr. Abel gave an account of experiments instituted by him a few years ago upon
the several combinations of phosphorus with copper, and upon the properties of
copper containing small proportions (from 0-3 to 4 per cent.) of phosphorus, with
special reference to their application to military and other purposes, as substitutes
for the copper and tin alloy Known as gam-metal.

   Mr. Abel's experiments confirmed H. Rose's statements with reprard to the for-

mation of the phosphides having the composition Cu P and Cu P, but showed
                                                                                                                                                                        B3

that the diphosphide of copper (Cu2P) could not be produced by the action of
hydrogen at a high temperature upon the diphosphate, as stated by Rose. The
product richest in phosphorus, obtained by this method, approached in composition

to the hexaphosphide, but, generally, the proportion of phosphorus found in the
products, after separation of the phosphoric acid produced, was between 3 and

8 per cent. The diphosphide of copper heated to redness, out of contact with
air, or in a current of hydrogen, was moreover found to be reduced to the hexa-

phosphide.
--28 report 1865.

In experiments upon the direct union of phosphorus with copper, the maximum

proportion of that element with which the metal would combine was found to be

about 12 per cent. In operating upon a large scale, the products were rarely so

rich in phosphorus; those most readily prepared contained from 3 to 5 per cent, of

that element.

   Phosphorized copper, containing not more than 0-5 per cent, of phosphorus, is

more fusible and flows much more readily than copper. When cast in iron moulds,

it contracts very considerably, and has, when cold, a very compact and uniform

structure. If cast in moulds of sand or loam, the phosphorized metal is always

open in structure. The shrinkage of the metal, when cast in chills, renders the pro-

duction    of any but very                                simple castings         difficult to accomplish                                                                       but when sound

castings are obtained, they exhibit great superiority over gun-metal castings in

point of tenacity. The average " breaking weight " of gun-metal being about

32,000 lbs. on the square inch, that of phosphorized copper, containing 0-5 per cent,

of phosphorus, was found to be 38,389 lbs. ; while the strain borne, up to frac-

ture, by metal containing 0-75 per cent., amounted to 45,500 lbs. The phosphorized

metal containing from 0*3 to 0'5 per cent, of phosphorus could not be rolled or

worked under the hammer when heated even below redness, and required careful
working when cold.

Some results of experiments on the influence exerted by the presence of iron, in

phosphorized copper, upon its composition and properties, were also described by

Mr. Abel.

Action of Acids on Metals and Alloys. By Dr. Crace-Calveet, F.R.S.

   The author, in the name of Eichard Johnson, F.C.S., and himself, communicated
to the members of the Section some of the leading facts that they had observed in
studying the action of acids on metals and alloys. As it was impossible to attempt
to go into details in the short space of time allowed him to bring the subject before
the Meeting (for their researches extended over twelve months, and contained two
or three hundred experiments), he would confine his observations to the action of
sulphuric acid upon zinc.

The first fact that he would bring before the notice of chemists was that, contrary

to the generally received opinion, sulphuric acid at the natural temperature did not

act upon pure zinc if the surface of the metai submitted to the action of the acid was
perfectly free from any trace of oxide, whilst if there was the slightest oxidation,

a slight action commenced, gradually increasing until in some instances it assumed
the appearance of ordinary zinc when acted upon by sulphuric acid, viz., a violent

action.

Another curious and interesting fact is, that mono- and bi-hydrated sulphuric

acids, besides having no action, as stated, at the natural temperature, exercise but
a limited action also at a temperature of 130° C. and 150° C. ; for in the space of two
hours sulphuric acid dissolved on 1 metre surface, with the mono-hydrated acid,
respectively 125 and 38G grammes, and with the bi-hydrated acid 23G and 575
grammes ; whilst if, on the contrary, sulphuric acid with 3 equivalents of water was
employed, the increased action was really remarkable, being more than twenty times

as great, for the respective quantities dissolved on a metre surface were 8193 and

9083  grammes                                        and  even with  sulphuric acid    containing 4, 5, and G equivalents
                                                  ;

  He did not doubt that these results would prove of great value to electricians iu

drawing their attention to the necessity of studying with care the strength of the

acid employed in their batteries.

The action of heated concentrated sulphuric acid on zinc appears to divide itself

into two distinct phases, in one of which sulphuric acid is decomposed, and sul-

phurous acid given oft'; and the other in which water is decomposed and sulphu-

retted hydrogen given oft'.

With mono-hydrated sulphuric acid only sulphurous acid is given off; with bi-

hydrated sulphuric acid, a large quantity of sulphurous acid is evolved, and only a

trace of sulphuretted hydrogen whilst with sulphuric acid containing 3 equivs. of
                                                                                                                                                                         ;

   On the Utilization of Blast- Furnace Slag. By Frederick George Finch,

              B.A., D.Sc. (Bond.), F.G.S., Assoc. Boy. School of Mines.
   In this paper the author, after referring to the various attempts that have been
made both in this country and abroad to utilize the slag from iron-smelting fur-
naces, described a method now adopted to effect this object at several ironworks in
France and Belgium. The slag is there allowed to run direct from the furnace into
pits about 8 or 9 feet in diameter at the top, with sides sloping inwards towards
the centre, where they are about 3 feet deep. The mass is left for eight or nine
days to cool, when a hard, compact crystalline stone is obtained, which is quarried
and used for building purposes, but chiefly for paving-stones. It is on this last
application that its commercial value seems principally to depend. These paving
stones are laid down iu several provincial towns in France and Belgium, and also
in some parts of Paris. They appear to wear exceedingly well, and are certainly
superior to the grits and sandstones generally used for that purpose in those

countries.

   This manufacture, besides being the means of getting rid of what has hitherto
been a useless and cumbersome material, is found at the above works to answer in
a pecuniary point of view. The large area required for the pits would prevent its
adoption at many ironworks in this country.

On some Minerals from South America. By David Forbes, F.R.S., Sfc.

The following minerals were exhibited, and the results of their chemical examina-

tion reported :

Taltalite, a black mineral from the desert of Atacama, much resembling shorl,

and which proved to be a silicate of copper and alumina with part of the alumina

replaced by sesquioxide of iron, Domeykite, algadonite, and Darwinite, all from

Chili, being three distinct basic arsenides of copper, represented respectively by the

formulae   Cu         As,  Cula  As,  and  Cu As.      The mineral Darwinite was proved iden-

which had been called Whitneyite. Telluriferous native bismuth, bismuth glance,
and Danaite from Sorata in Bolivia ; a new selenide of silver and nickel from near
Mendoza. Iodides, chlorobromides, and chlorides of silver, all crystallized from

near Copiapo in Chili, and au amorphous yellow mineral from the interior of the
desert of Atacama in Chili, which was an oxyiodochloride of lead. Three differ-

ently crystallized varieties of oxychloride of copper or Atacamite was shown from

the coast of Bolivia and Chile, along with several other rare or finely crystallized

minerals.
--30 REPORT 1865.

   Attention was directed to hexagonal crystals of metallic copper from the mines
of Corocoro in Bolivia, out of the red sandstones there ; these were regarded by the
author as pseudomorphs, after Arragonite, as although some of them were found to
consist of solid metallic copper, yet others on being sawn across were found to con-
tain a greater or less nucleus of white carbonate of lime. The formation of these
pseudomorphs was explained as having resulted from the action of a solution of
protosulphates of copper and iron produced by the oxidation of ordinary copper
pyrites on crystals of Arragonite or carbonate of lime.

   Synthetical experiments were related confirmatory of this view, as some crystals
of Iceland spar, on being kept some months in a stoppered bottle along with a
mixed solution of sulphate of copper and protosulphate of iron, were soon converted
superficially into carbonate of copper, which in turn was reduced to metallic cop-
per by the deoxidating action of the protosulphate of iron.

                  On the Colour of Gold as seen by transmitted Light.

                            By David Forbes, F.U.S., 6fc.

 The author found in several instances where solutions of gold had been precipitated
by oxalic acid, that an extremely thin film of gold adhered very pertinaciously to
the side of the glass vessel, and that this film, when looked at by transmitted light,
was quite blue, and did not at all present the green colour attributed to gold in a
fine state of division, as in the common experiments of holding up a thin gold-leaf
between the eye and the light.

   He concluded from this that the true colour of gold by transmitted light was

blue, and that the green colour usually observed was due to this blue colour being
mixed with yellow light reflected from the polished surface of the hammered gold-

leaf.

   A most conclusive experiment corroborated this view. In order to get a film of

gold infinitely finer than the thinnest gold-leaf, the author took a quantity of the
so-called ruby glass of commerce, the colour of which is due to a minute quantity
of gold which enters into its composition (amounting to a six-hundreth of a per-
centage only), and reduced the gold in this to its metallic state by heating it in an

atmosphere of carbonic oxide. The film of gold thus produced, when examined by

transmitted light, afforded a most beautiful and pure blue colour without any trace
of green whatever.

ByOn the Constitution of the Acids of the Acetic, Lactic, and Acrylic Scries.

   Dr. Fkankland, F.R.S., Professor of Chemist/-;/ in the Bayed Institution
    of Great Britain, and in the Royal School of Mines.
   In conjunction with Mr. Duppa, the author had for some time past been

engaged in investigating synthetically the constitution of the acids belonging to
the acetic, lactic, and acrylic series. They had succeeded in building up the
higher members of the acetic series from acetic acid itself, by the substitution of
hydrogen in that acid atom for atom, by the alcoholic radicals, methyl, ethyl, &c.

Numerous new members of the lactic series had been in like manner constructed

=from oxalic acid, by the substitution of one atom of oxygen (0 16) by two atoms of

the alcohol radicals, whilst several members of the acrylic series had been produced
from the lactic series by the abstraction of an atom of water from the latter.

   These investigations had led to the following conclusions :
   1. The acids of all three series are constructed upon the radical type. They are
all double radicals, composed of a chlorous and a basylous constituent.
   2. The chlorous constituent is the same in all, and consists of an atom of methyl,
in which two atoms of hydrogen are replaced by one of oxygen, and the remaining
atom of hvdrogen bv hydroxyl,

                                                  C ]0H.

It is this chlorous constituent which determines the basicity of these acids, and its
repetition twice or thrice in a molecule produces dibasic or tribasic acids.

   3. The basylous constituent is variable, both homologously and heterologously.

superphosphate, guano-superphosphate, sulphate of ammonia, and ground bones,
taken singly or mingled together in definite proportions. The manures were
analyzed so as to be certain of their exact composition. In each set of experiments
the various operations were conducted on the same day with the plots of ground
allotted to each manure. The soils on which the experiments were made were in

--part of a heavy nature, and in other parts of a light character the proportion of

each being equal. Each experiment was conducted on a quarter of an acre, and
the twelve experiments consequently required three acres on each farm. The crop
was turnips, and the yield or produce was weighed on the field. The results
obtained were various on the different farms, as the manures which gave the largest
returns on one farm did not yield the largest crop on another. These variations
are to be expected in all field experiments, and are due to the special circumstances
or conditions of each field where the trials are made. "Where only one set of ex-
periments are conducted on a single farm, the local influences may materially affect

the results ; but where, as in the present case, the field operations are conducted on

ten farms, and the mean produce of the ten trials is obtained, then the disturbing-
influences of one farm are counteracted or practically neutralized by those of the

other farms.

   The full extent of the differences in the yield of the various manurial mixtures
may be more readily comprehended from the following Table, which gives the
manures in the order of their fertilizing powers according to the mean of all the

experiments :

must he remembered that the season of 1864 was exceptionally dry, though the
drought was not so great in Scotland as it was in England. The results obtained,
however, are valuable as representing the produce obtainable in a dry season ; and
as a similar series of field experiments are being made this year in the same district,
an opportunity will be obtained for contrasting the results for both years.

On Esparto Fibre, or SpanisJi Grass, and its Employment in the Manufacture

          of Paper. By Dr. Stevenson Macadam, F.B.S.E., F.O.S.

   During the last three years large quantities of a grass obtained from Spain have
been employed in this country in the manufacture of paper. Delivered in Great

Britain, it costs about £5 10s! to £6 per ton. The recent high price of rags has
caused a demand for esparto fibre and should it continue, other countries, as Bar-

                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

--The chemical composition of an average sample is moisture, 9'62; oil, 1"23

albuminous compounds, 5-46; ligneous fibre, 56-28; starch, gum, and sugar,

22-37 ; ash, 504. In the manufacture into paper, the material, first carefully

cleaned, is subjected to the action of caustic soda. The fibre, however, is rather

short in nature, and hence paper entirely made of it is extremely liable to tear. It
is customary, therefore, to give strength by mixing the pulp from esparto fibre with
the pulp from rags, commonly in the proportion of equal parts. The paper so ma-

nufactured is largely employed as a printing paper, and the majority of the Scotch

newspapers are now printed on it. The spent soda liquor, being of a caustic na-

possesses the power of killing them within a few hours. Two plans have been

suggested and put in operation for the arrestment, more or less completely, of the

soda liquor. The first, the boiling down the ley, heating the residue with carbo-

naceous matter, such as fine coal or sawdust, and the recovery of the soda from

the calcined mass the second, the reception of the liquor in large open cesspools,

where it may percolate through the soil. Both plans have been successful.

On Crystals of Melaconite, and on Tenorite. By Professor Maskeltne, M.A.

   Professor Maskelyne described crystals of oxide of copper (melaconite) that had
recently been found by Mr. Tailing of Lostwithiel. They are brilliant in lustre
and of a dark steel-grey colour, and occur in a chloritic vein-stone. Their crystal-
lography presents considerable difficulty from the corrugated and uneven character
of certain of the faces, and the incompleteness of the crystals. But measurements
made on three or four selected crystals establish the oblique system as that of the

mineral.

   The planes met with are (100)«, (001)e, (0 1 1) (1 1 1) (1 1 1) (6 1) (6 1 1), and
the crystallographic constants of the mineral are given by the values of the para-

meters,                                                          a:b:c = 1-4902 : 1 : 1-3604,

and of the inclination of normals to c, a, viz. 001, 100 = 80° 28'.

The fracture is generally conchoidal, and cleavages exist parallel to (1 1 1) and

(001), the latter a facile one. The crystals are generally twinned ; one twin plane

is 100.

  =The hardness is a little above 4, the specific gravity 5-82527.

The mineral Tenorite, the form of cupric oxide, found in certain old lavas of

Vesuvius consists in fine ribbon-like fibres, transparent under the microscope, and

presenting feather-like twinned aggregates of laminated crystals. The individual

crystals cleave readily with an angle of a little more than 72°.

They present the interesting property of absorbing one of the polarized rays of a

beam of light traversing them, just as does a plate of tourmaline cut parallel to its

optic axis. It is not impossible that Tenorite may represent the melaconite crystal

in laminae parallel to 100.

On the Action of Light \ipon Sulphide of Lead, and its bearing upon the Pre-

servation of Paintings in Picture Galleries. By Dr. D. S. Price, F.C.S.

The author's attention was directed to this subject by observing that in the cases

in the Technological Museum under his charge at the Crystal Palace, which are

painted with white-lead, substances which emitted sulphurous vapours did not

cause a darkening of the surface of the case, excepting where it was protected from

Athe direct influence of light. number of experiments was then tried as to the action

of light upon sulphide of lead produced by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen on

Alead paint.  board painted white with white-lead was exposed for several hours

to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, untd the surface had acquired a uniform

brown colour. Plates of glass of different colours were then placed upon the painted

surface, one portion being at the same time covered with an opaque medium, and

another left entirely exposed. The board was then placed facing the light. The

glasses employed were red, blue, yellow (silver), violet, and smoke-colour glass. The

results exhibited were after an exposure of eight days, and showed that the parts of

the board directly exposed to light were bleached ; those protected by an opaque

medium were not acted upon, while with the glasses of different colours interme-

diate effects were produced, those of the blue glass being most decided. Drying-

oils in conjunction with light rapidly bleach sulphide of lead, and boiled oil effects

Whenthe bleaching still more rapidly.  water-colour is used bleaching takes place,

but much more slowly than in the case of oil. After quoting authorities, stating that

generally light was advantageous to\he preservation of pictures, Dr. Price showed a

Hestriking illustration of this fact.  had a picture painted, and then exposed it to

the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, until it became sadly discoloured, and to all

appearance destroyed. Some strips of paper were laid across the picture so as to

cover some parts. The picture, thus partially covered, was exposed to light for a

--long time. The result, as shown at the Meeting, was curious indeed the parts of the

picture exposed being perfectly restored, while those protected by the paper re-

mained still discoloured. From his experiments he came to the conclusion that it

was advantageous to have picture-galleries well lighted, especially where, as in

towns, the atmosphere was charged with sulphur compounds, and that it was quite

a mistake to have curtains placed in front of pictures with a, view to their protec-

tion. In the course of his communication, Dr. Price stated that it was curious to

observe in many parts of London the discoloration of houses painted with white

lead. He had frequently seen the lower portions completely coated with a metallic-

like surface of the sulphide, and had little doubt that the formation of this com-

pound wTould be found to be more frequent in winter than in summer, and more

prevalent on the shady than on the sunny side of a street.

and can be manipulated in almost every conceivable manner. The basis of the

material Parkesine is gun-cotton, but a variety of other materials are used. These

materials were exhibited : they consisted of various solvents, cotton waste, oils, &c.

Various articles, manufactured from Parkesine, were shown, and its various appli-

Acations thus proved.  cotton which is not readily explosive, is desirable in the

to the value of Parkesine as an insulating material for telegraphic purposes, con-

sidering it far superior to india-rubber and gutta-percha, or to any combination of

materials hitherto used. The strength of the material is considerable, a cable of it

being capable of supporting one mile in length of its own substance, whilst sound

joints can be made with the greatest facility.

On the Action of the Alkali Metals in determining the Explosion of Gun-Cotton.
                  By Wbntwokth L. Scott, F.C.S., F.A.S.L., 4'c

   The author stated that in the course of some experiments he accidentally dropped
a piece of potassium on some gun-cotton ; the gun-cotton immediately exploded.

He tben instituted a series of experiments, to ascertain what conditions were essen-

tial for explosion to take place, whether the explosion was due to moisture, whether

other metals would act similarly on the gun-cotton, &c. He found that by taking
precautions to prevent friction, the gun-cotton still exploded. When sodium was

used a like result was obtained, even though the gim-cotton was rendered perfectly
anhydrous. If an amalgam of potassium or sodium was used no result was obtained.
Various metals were tried, but decided effects were obtained only with the metals

of the alkalies, although finely-divided metallic arsenic has the property of increa-

sing the explosive powers of gun-cotton, the mixture readily exploding on percus-
sion, and the author thought the same might be usefully applied.

                  On a Method of estimating Carbonic Acid in the Air.

                               By Dr. Antgtjs Smith, F.B.S.

    The author explained a mode of analysis which he has called minimetric. The
idea, he said, might perhaps not be quite new, but it is well to give the method a
name. It is based mainly on the fact that we can retain in the memory with great

exactness the character of a precipitate of a given degree of translucency. For

carbonic acid, the author finds a precipitate of carbonate of baryta, formed in half

an ounce of baryta-water by 0-2515 cub. centim. of carbonic acid, or by nearly three
times that amount in lime-water, to be most easily remembered. If the carbonic
arid in air is sought, the air is made to act on the baryta-water until the desired

precipitate is obtained. In other words, we use the smallest measure of air which
will produce the precipitate. For this reason the name mvnirmetric is adopted. The
method may also be used for hydrochloric acid, sulphuric and sulphurous acids,
sulphuretted hydrogen, &c, and probably has been used frequently without being

brought forward as a method for accurate use.

   Two ways of using this method of analysis were described. The first was by the

use of a finger pump, an elastic ball with two valves, connected with a bottle con-

taining baryta-water. On pressing the ball the air in it is driven out, and on re-

moving the pressure-air is drawn in through the liquid. The air and liquid are
then shaken together, and the operation repeated until the precipitate is obtained.
For ordinary use a ball to contain two ounces is found most suitable ; the bottle

+should have the same capacity as the ball the space required for the liquid, so

that the air contained in the bottle at the commencement of the experiment may

coimt as one ballfull.

  A Table is constructed like the following, but of course it must be adapted to

the size of the ball.

                                                                                                        3*

  By this simple method the greatest refinement may he attained. Of course, care

must be taken to have the baryta- or lime-water perfectly clear to begin with.

On a Apparatus for the Determination of the Ozone in the Atmosphere, and
  Experiments made therewith by means of the Aspirator. By John Smyth,
   Jun., A.M., Mem. B.M.S.

The author being interested in linen bleaching, took daily meteorological obser-

vations for several years, in which be directed particular attention to ozone. He

found the usual methods of testing its presence in the atmosphere unsatisfactory,

and showed it is so by reference to a Diagram Chart of all the elements of the

weather in 1864, prepared by him. He was therefore led to devise an apparatus,

the principle of which is, by means of a large aspirator, to draw the air at a con-

siderable velocity through a small tube, so as to impinge at its opening into a tube

of larger diameter against an extended surface of test-paper. This ozonometer

consists of two brass or opaque glass tubes or boxes about 2 inches long and 2 inches

in external diameter, the smaller of which screws or fits tightly into the larger,

and is about £th of an inch shorter ; its extremity at the point of the screw is

grooved for an india-rubber band which holds the test-paper stretched across its
mouth. The entrance-tube, |th inch in diameter, is introduced into the centre of

the solid extremity of the larger box, |th of an inch from the centre of the test-
Apaper.
         small pipe from the solid extremity of the smaller box communicates

with the aspirator, which the author prefers should be made on the plan of Dr.

Andrews, of Queen's College, Belfast, viz., a gasometer of a capacity of about

80 gallons, connected by means of a cord to a clock in which an extra weight is

                          counterpoise is used to support the weight of the

gasometer. The author showed, from a table of experiments made by this im-

proved ozonometer, that there is not much difference in the quantity of sensible

ozone in two masses of air of equal volume, moving at different velocities, in differ-

ent directions, and under different hygrometrical conditions. Also that the test-

papers in the ordinary ozone-cage do not register high enough ; a more extended

series of experiments may, however, somewhat modify these views.

             On Phosphatic Deposits recently discovered in North Wales.

                                 By Dr. Aug. Voelcker.

   An extensive mine, containing several phosphatic minerals, was accidentally dis-

covered last year by Mr. Hope Jones, of Hooton, Cheshire, whilst he was searching
for other minerals in the neighbourhood of Cwmgynen, about sixteen miles from

Oswestry.

   The mine is continuous for more than nine miles, and occurs 12 feet under the

surface.

    It is not far from the clay-slate and lead-bearing district of Llangyno"-.
   The strata (slaty shale) contain several beds of contemporaneous* felspathic ash
and scoriae, and the usual fossils of the Llandeilo series are found, but not in great
numbers.

   The strata are vertical, and run east to west, or, more correctly speaking, 15
degrees north of west (magnetic).

  A true vein or fissure containing vein deposit, partially metallic, divides two

phosphatic deposits.

   One of them is nearly 3 yards in thickness, and embodies phosphatic limestone
beds, containing from 10 to upwards of 35 per cent, of phosphate of lime.

   The other and more valuable deposit is a yard and a half thick, and consists of
a black graphitic shale, largely impregnated with phosphate of lime.

   This deposit is free from carbonate of lime, and much richer in phosphate of

lime than the first-mentioned deposit.

    In specimens taken at a depth of about 12 feet from the surface, Dr. Voelcker
found from 54 to 56 per cent, of phosphate of lime in this phosphatic shale.

 - At a greater depth the shale becomes richer in phosphates, and consequently

more valuable ; for in the deeper specimens the proportion of phosphate of lime

amounted to 64| per cent.
   This phosphatic mine is readily accessible and naturally drainable to a depth of

about 500 feet, and contains many hundred thousand, if not millions of tons of

valuable phosphatic minerals.

  The following analyses may be given in illustration of the composition of the

limestone and the black shale deposits.

  A specimen of phosphatic limestone gave the following results :

           On the Composition of a Marine-Boiler Incrustation.
                                By Dr. Aug. Voblcker.

A marine-boiler incrustation, analyzed by Dr. Voelcker, jdelded the following

results :

This incrustation did not contain a trace of carbonate of lime or magnesia, two

constituents always present in ordinary boiler incrustations.
   Supposing the chlorine found to be present as chloride of sodium, and uniting

sulphuric acid with lime, we obtain the following results :

   The water of combination found in this analysis is just sufficient to form, with
the magnesia, hydrated oxide of magnesia ; for 16-72 of magnesia require 7'52 of
water, which agrees closely with 7 -48, the amount found in the analysis.

   It thus appears that this incrustation consists mainly of anhydrous sulphate of
lime and magnesia-hydrate.

        On the Possibility of Manufacturing Neroli in the British Colonies.

                                  By Dr. J. E. De Vbij.

   After his arrival in Java the author found there existed in Bandoug many

thousand shaddock trees {Citrus decumaiui).

   In higher localities like that of Bandoug, where the average temperature is much

lower than in Batavia, the fruit of the shaddock has only the size of an ordinary

orange, and is not eatable. As the many thousand shaddock trees growing in the
--40 KEFOET 1865.

neighbourhood of Bandoug were therefore almost useless, he thought it interesting
to make some experiments on the preparation of the essence of shaddock flowers.

   After a great many distillations of several hundred-weights of fresh flowers, the
result was that the average quantity of essence yielded by 1000 lbs. weight of fresh
flowers was 1 lb.

  --Having ascertained the amount of product, the following question arises : Is

the essence obtained by me from the petala of the shaddock trees identical with the
essence of orange flowers called neroli ? The result of his experiments in this

direction was, that the two essences are really identical, which conclusion was
afterwards confirmed upon his return to Em-ope, by the principal manufacturers of

perfumes whom he consulted on this subject, and who declared the essence of

--3haddock flowers prepared by him to be identical with first-rate quality of neroli.
   Another question of importance also arises: Would the manufacture of neroli

in the tropical countries pay ? This can only be answered by practical experience.
In Java, where the author made his experiments, the local circumstances are such
that the manufacture woidd certainly pay.

   But besides the neroli obtained by distillation of the flowers, there remains in
the still after the distillation a substance which deserves attention, if ever his plan

of preparing neroli in the tropical colonies should be carried out. If the residue
in the still is thrown, yet boiling, upon a cloth, the clear yellowish liquid which
passes through the cloth deposits after a few days a large amount of yellow crystals.

    His experiments with these crystals have proved that they are identical with the
substance discovered in 1828 by Lebreton in unripe bitter oranges, and called by
him " hesperidine." This hesperidine, which the author finds very widely spread
in the genus Citrus, is the pure, bitter substance contained also in orange peels.

As this hesperidine is a pure and quite innocent bitter substance, which can be

obtained easily, and in tolerably large quantities from shaddock flowers, it deserves,

perhaps, attention as a substitute for hops.

      On the Rotatory Power of several Essential Oils. By J. E. be Vkij.

   The author communicated the results of his experiments on the rotatory power

of more than ninety specimens of different essential oils. He observed them in a

tube of 100 millimetres length with Biot's polarizing apparatus, and although he
found a great discrepancy in the rotation of specimens of the same essential oil pre-
pared in different localities, he considers, nevertheless, the accurate determination
of this physical property of great importance for the study of these still very im-

perfectly known compounds. In observing, for instance, the rotation of seventeen

specimens of the essence of peppermint manufactured in England, France, Ger-
many, Holland, and America, by well-known manufacturers, he found thirteen
specimens showing a rotation to the left, varying between^-- 6° and --34°, three spe-

cimens showing a right rotation varying between +9° and +10o,5, and one speci-
men which showed no rotation at all. It appears therefore that the essence of

peppermint is a mixture of at least two essences, one of which has a right and the
other a left rotation, which explains the difference, and also the absence of rotatory
power in different specimens. In examining the rotatory power of French and
American essence of turpentine and of their compounds with hydrochloric gas, he
observed the singular fact that, though both the essences showed a left rotation, the
solid and liquid camphor obtained by hydrochloric gas from the American essence
showed a right rotation, whilst those compounds obtained from the French essence
retain the original left rotation of the essence from which they are prepared.

   Br. Wood said he wished to call the attention of the Section to a matter which

was giving to chemistry a repulsive aspect, and which rendered the passage even

of the outer gate difficult to those who wished to enter its domains ; namely, the

two systems of nomenclature at present in use amongst chemists.

 --He wished to call attention to a question of every day occurrence and of great

practical importance, namely what kind of chemical notation shall be taught to

hoys at school ? That since the requirements of the Chemical Examiners were not

Howalike, arose the question of not so much " What shall we teach p" as "                                     shall

we teach it? " He hoped that the discussion of these questions would lead to some

definite result ; which would he of great weight and value as hearing the sanction

--of the Chemical Section of the British Association, a result much to be desired,

as the inconvenience at present suffered by many teachers from the present unsatis-

factory state of things was very great.

He called attention to the inexpediency of printing any book, intended as a text-

book for beginners, with the old and new formulae side by side.

1st. He found by practice that the old formulae are more easily understood than

the new                                          and even when  a  student was  told  to  learn  only one/he  generally read
                                              ;

both, and frequently ended by understanding neither.

2nd. That it is difficult to teach the new formulae to students who know some-

thing of the old, especially if the text-book contains both ; and more so when the

student is not a constant attendant in a laboratorv.

   3rd. That in order to teach the new symbols successfully; sets of text-books con-
taining the new symbols only must be used, especially for school-boys.

   It is of great importance that those who have to teach in school's, should know
not merely what to teach, but have some general understanding or common consent

as to the terms and language in which their instruction is to be conveyed ; and
further, have some authoritative sanction for so strong a measure as the 'introduc-
tion of new symbols before their use is generally required. With this view the

following questions are submitted :

   1st. Are the new symbols really essential ? Are the advantages gained practi-
cally so great as to demand the sacrifices required by the change ?

   Physicians, tutors, and others not professed chemists' who have a respectable

knowledge of chemistry according to the old system, will find themselves unable
to comprehend and teach the new, without a fresh course of chemical study.

   2nd. If the new symbols are really necessary, they ought to be taught at once to

all persons beginning to learn chemistry ; above all, to boys.

   3rd. From what has been before stated, it follows that if the new formula? are

to be used in schools^ books written with the old formulas are useless as school-

books. This is a difficulty which may be overcome by the issue of new editions,

but publishers no doubt will look with suspicion on books treating of a science
which can deal with such wholesale reform, and writers with unsold editions
would be in an evil case.

   It will of course require some authoritative enunciation before people will quietly

turn aside from their books, old friends, the companions and assistants of years,

and see their places taken by younger and newer productions with which they feel
little in common ; and they will heave many a sigh to think that a change so small
in apparent good, should cause them so much trouble and annoyance. It will not

be at the desire of a single examiner or professor that a master will allow his pupils

to learn new symbols, or agree to banish the old class-books and order new ones.
There is therefore much to be considered in the proposed change.

knowing; how much our objects were advanced on both those occasions, it gave me

the sincerest pleasure to propose last year at Bath, that a meeting of the British

Association should be held, for a third time, in the town of Birmingham.

Intimately connected as I have been with the British Association since its

foundation in 1831, when, as the then President of the Geological Society, I

headed the small band of my London associates who assembled at York, you will

believe me when I say that it affords me the highest gratification in my old age

myto preside once more over  brother geologists, particularly in this nourishing-

town, so near some of the most instructive and attractive of the Silurian districts.

   It is now nineteen years since I presided over the British Association; and fifteen

years have elapsed since I occupied the geological chair ; for, although I have

not in the mean time ceased to use my hammer, and though I still cling aa

mykeenly as ever to this  own special science, I have, in what I consider its en-

larged sense, been led to endeavour to advance, in late years, by every means in

my power, the sister science of Geography. I have thus had the happiness to

see that, whilst the comparatively new Section of Geography and Ethnology has

become very popular, and is always crowded, at all our recent meetings Section C

treating, as it does, of the true foundation of geography, has been quite as well at-

tended as ever ; and I trust that on this occasion our room will be as well filled
as it has ever been in previous years, when this Section was presided over by a

Buckland, a Sedgwick, a Delabeche, a Lyell, and a Phillips.

Great indeed have been the advances made in geological science in the sixteen

years which have elapsed since our last meeting- in Birmingham. For although at

that time the bases of the classification of the older rocks were then firmly esta-

blished, still our knowledge of the correlations and contents of the several forma-

tions ascending- from the oldest stratified rocks in which we could distinguish the

remains of life has since been materially extended.

The lowest sedimentary rocks, which, with most g-eologists, I considered to be

azoic, or void of life, simply because at that time nothing' organic had been disco-

vered in them, have, through the labours and discoveries of Sir William Logan

and his associates in Canada, been found to contain a Zoophyte, which tiny

termed JEozoon Canadense. The rocks containing this fossil were named Lauren-

tian by Logan long before that fossil was detected in them, and simply because

they clearly underlie all the rocks of Cambrian and Silurian age. On the same

myprinciple of infraposition, it -was  good fortune to be able, in 1855, to point out

the existence of these same ancient rocks on a large scale in the north-west Iligh-

lnnds of Scotland : and though I at first termed them Fundamental Gneiss, as
soon as I heard of Logan's discovery in North America I adopted his name of

Laurentian.

In our islands, however, nothing' organic has been discovered as yet in these our

British fundamental rocks, though they are truly of Laurentian age. For although

it was supposed for a moment that the rocks of the Connemara district in the west

of Ireland were also of that high antiquity, because it was said that they contained

an JZozoon, I assert, from my own examination*, as well as from information

obtained during a recent visit by Professor Ilarkness, that the quartzose, gneissose,

and calcareo-serpentinous strata of the Bins of Connemara, in which the supposed
Eozomi was said to exist, are simply metamorphosed Lower Silurian strata. Pro-

fessor Haikness will explain this point to you, and will further, I believe, endea-

vour to convince you that there is no organic structure whatever in the serpen-

tinous rock of -Connemara. But, whatever may be the decision of microscopists,

I must, as a geologist, declare that, inasmuch as Zoophytes of a low order (Fora-

minifera) unquestionably occur in Laurentian rocks, so it was by no means im-
probable that the same group of low animals, having, as far as we can detect, no
antagonistic contemporaries, and having been, therefore, free from any " struggle

for existence," might have continued to be the inhabitants of sea-shores and cliit's

during the long succeeding epoch.

   The mere presence of an Eozoon is therefore no proof whatever that the rock in
which it occurred is of the " Fundamental " or " Laurentian" age, that point being

only capable of settlement by a clear infraposition of the rocks to well-known

and clearly defined Lower Palaeozoic deposits, in the lowest of which, or the

Camhrian of the Geological Survey, another form of low Zoophyte, and a few

worm-tracks have, as yet, alone been detected.

   In a word, this discovery of a Foraminifer in the very lowest known deposit, in-

stead of interfering with, sustains the truth of that doctrine which all my experience

as a geologist has confirmed, that the lowest animals alone occur in the earliest

zone of life, and that this beginning was followed through long periods by

creations of higher and higher animals successively. Thus, through the whole of

the vastly long Lower Silurian period, so rich in all the iower classes of marine

animals, whether Mollusks, Crustaceans, or Zoophytes, no one has yet detected a

vertebrated creature. Fishes first begin to appear in the latest Silurian deposit,

from which time to the present day they have never ceased to prevail ; and new

forms of Vertebrata, adapted to each succeeding period, have followed each other.

Every geologist knows how, in the overlying Secondary and Tertiary formations,

higher and higher grades of animals successively appear, and how the relics of

man or his works have been detected in the youngest only of the Tertiary deposits,

Wethough certainly at a period long anterior to all history.  now well know that

human beings) coexisted with quadrupeds which are extinct ; and we also know

that the physical configuration of the surface has undergone considerable changes

since such primeval men lived. This subject, opened out in France by M. Boucher

de Perthes, followed by some of his distinguished countrymen, has in our country

received much illustration at the hands of Prestwich, Lyell, Falconer, Lub-

bock, Evans, and others, and is now a well-established doctrine.

But the great feature at the other end of the geological series, to which I

revert, is the uncontradicted fact, which has been passed over by many writers, or

misrepresented by others, that there were enormously long periods, following that

of the primeval zoophytic deposits, during which the seas, though abounding in

all the other lower orders of animals, were not tenanted by Fishes.

As this is a fact which the researches, during thirty years, of many geologists,

amidst the Lower Silurian rocks in all parts of the world, have been unable to

invalidate, so it teaches us, in our appeal to the works of nature, that there was a

beginning as well as a progress of creation, and that those writers, however eminent,

who have announced that Fishes, Mollusks, and other Invertebrata appeared toge-

ther, have asserted that which is positively at variance with the residts of the

researches of this century. As I have in various works pointed out this great funda-

mental principle in the origin of successive faunre, and as at my age I may pro-

bably never again occupy a geological chair, I hope therefore to he excused for

looking back with some pride, now that I am on the eastern borders of my

Silurian region, to the period when, thirty years ago, I dwelt on the then novel

fact, never since contravened, that " the Fishes of the Upper Silurian rocks ap-

peared before naturalists as the most ancient beings of their class"*. Enormous

regions in Europe and America over which these Silurian rocks extend have, I
repeat, been long harried, with an intense desire on the part of many searchers to

find something which would gainsay the datum-line that marks the beginning of

vertebrated life ; and, as all these efforts have failed, I have some right to insist

upon the value of such a vast amount of what those who seek to oppose this view

still persist in calling negative evidence. The facts however remain, and on them

myI rest  belief.

In this short introductory Address I cannot attempt to present to you a sketch of

the general recent progress of geological science in other parts of Europe or in

America. This must be sought in the well-digested recent Address of the actual

President of the Geological Society, Mr. W. J. Hamilton. I must, for the most

mypart, confine    observations to certain British questions, the more so as I know

that our distinguished associates of other countries, who honour us by their pre-

sence on this occasion, come to us mainly for the purpose of ascertaining the pro-

gress we have made in our isles, and also with the -view of visiting those of our

typical localities of which they have read.

     * See ' Silurian System,' p. 605. Though the work was not published until 183S-30,

 the Silurian system and its characters were established by me in 1835 (see 'London,

. Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine,' 3rd series, vol. vii. p. 46, 1835).
--44 report 1865.

   Among those visitors from abroad, I must first allude to my eminent friend, M.

Henri von Dechen, the Nestor of living geologists in Prussia. In speaking of him,
I turn back to the year 1827 (four years before the foundation of the British Asso-

ciation), -when he and his associate Oeynhausen explored our islands, and when it
was the good fortome of Professor Sedgwick and myself to examine parts of the
Highlands of Scotland in company with those able young German geologists, who
have since risen to such high distinction. Of him who is now present I will only
say that the great geological map of the Rhine Provinces, of which he has been the
director, is a work of special value to English geologists. In this map are delineated

with precision the whole series of the stratified rocks on both banks of the Rhine,

from those Devonian limestones of the Eifel which were correlated with our own by

 Sedgwick and myself, to the Coal-measures and the several Tertiary and superficial

deposits, as well as all the rocks of igneous origin ; in it are also elaborated in the

most skilful manner all the numerous intermediate strata, of Devonian and Moun-
tain-limestone age, which are wanting in the immediate vicinity of Birmingham,
but which have to a great extent their equivalent representatives in other parts of
our islands. Whilst for the subordinate strata thus delineated M. von Dechen
and all Prussian geologists naturally employ local names, I am glad to find that

the general groups of Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous are thoroughly re-
cognized by him and his associates according to the divisions established in Bri-
tain, and of which our father William Smith set the first example, by his admirable

identification of the strata of the Secondary rocks by their fossils and order of super-

position.

   My veteran German friend is accompanied by another of his countrymen, Professor

Ferdinand Roemer, of Breslau, whose works have justly earned for him a very high

position, particularly in palreontology ; and whilst one of these is upon Texas, in the

United States of America, let me say how fortunate we are in having among us Prin-
cipal Dawson, of Montreal, in Canada, whose high merits are so well known to every

reader of the volumes of Lyell and the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of

London. There may indeed be present several distinguished visitors from distant
countries, with whose arrival or intention of coming hither I am unacquainted
whilst I write ; but in relation to our nearest neighbours, the French, it gave me
great pleasure when I learned that our younger Foreign Associates were to be led
by M. A. Gaudry, once President of the Geological Society of France. Now, all

these visitors will, I doubt not, rejoice in having the opportunity of studying the
varied relations of the sedimentary and eruptive rocks in the vicinity of this flourish-

ing hive of human industry. These and other foreign visitors, as well as our as-
sociates from different parts of the United Kingdom, will necessarily take a deep
interest in comparing the varied rocks and their fossils which are grouped around
our place of meeting, with the sedimentary and eruptive rocks of their own several

districts.

  Among the recent important additions to our knowledge of the geographical

distribution and characters of the Silurian rocks, I cannot but advert to the suc-

cessful labours of Professor Darkness. He had already shown in the clearest

manner, by the evidence of fossils and order of succession, that the lowest of the
strata in the Cumbrian district of the Lakes, the slates of Skiddaw, are truly of
Lower Silurian age, and not older than the Llandeilo group. Recently, in pursuing
his labours, he has detected fossils in the " green slates " or volcanic ashes and
porphyries which lie intermediate between the Skiddaw strata and the higher
Silurian; and he has further found others in the Coniston Flags, which he views
as equivalents of the upper part of the Caradoc formation. Further, Professor
Harkness has shown, for the first time, that the slaty rocks of Westmoreland,
which separate the Carboniferous limestone from the Permian of the Vale of the
Eden, contain Lower Silurian fossils similar to those of Cumberland. I hope also
to learn from him at this meeting what has been the effect of certain great faults
ranging from north to south, which have impressed a grand and picturesque
outline on that region, and upon the lines of which are situated the most striking of
the lakes of the north-west of England.

   Although no Lower Silurian rocks, properly so called, occur near Birminghntn,
one adjacent tract, the Lickey, offers a characteristic example of the lowest of the
                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                45

Upper Silurian rocks, in the form of quartz-rock ; whilst the limestones and shales

of Dudley, and their beautiful fossils, surmounted by those of Sedgeley, are very

rich, and characteristic of part of the overlying Ludlow and Aymestry series. I am

glad to find that the members of the Dudley and Midland Geological Society will

not only communicate to us papers on the different organic remains of these de-

posits, but will also point out the relations of these rocks to others in the west,

Wewhere the whole Silurian system is more fully developed.          shall also, I hope,

have fresh illustrations of the effect of the eruptions of the basaltic and igneous

rocks of the Rowley Hills, and other similar bosses, upon the Pakeozoic strata

which they penetrate.

   Above all, the mining public and proprietors in the Midland Counties will,

I am certain, be well instructed by the evening lecture to be given by my friend

and associate Professor Jukes, who so distinguished himself, by his descriptions

and maps of this his native district, as justly to entitle him to be placed at the

head of the Geological Survey of Ireland, which for many years he has con-
ducted with great ability. He can, no doubt, indicate to you the extent to which

profitable works in coal are likely to be carried out, by sinkings through that

Lower Red Sandstone of the central counties which is now termed Permian, a

name proposed by myself in 1841, as taken from a large province in Russia, be-

cause I there found sandstones and limestones of the same age, extending over a

region much larger than France. The sinkings, which were successfully made

through this deposit at Christchurch by the late Earl of Dartmouth, only four miles

to the west of Birmingham, induced me, twenty-seven years ago, to write thus :

" It is, indeed, impossible to mention this enterprise without congratulating geolo-

gists on the effects which their writings are now producing on the minds of practical

men, since it was entirely owing to inferences deduced from geological phenomena

that this work was commenced, whilst its success was derided by many of the miners

of the adjacent coal-field."

   If that enterprise has not been extensively followed, we must recollect that, to
sink shafts to depths of many hundred feet can in central England scarcely be pro-

fitable, so long as coal is found so much nearer the surface, as in the South Staf-

fordshire field yet, as that field is tending towards exhaustion, it is cheering to
                                                                  ;

know that extensive beds of coal will be worked in future ages under some of the red

lands of the Midland counties and the Magnesian Limestone of Nottinghamshire,

under which the great Derbyshire coal-field passes ; and hence all present estimates

of the duration of our coal-supply must be more or less fallacious, if such high pro-

babilities be left out of the estimate. At the same time it must be admitted that we

are consuming this staple of our national greatness at so rapidly increasing a ratio,

that the value of the warning voice of Sir William Armstrong at the Newcastle

Meeting of the Association, when he told us that, with a continued yearly increase

of two millions and three-quarters of tons, our coal-supply would in many tracts

be exhausted in little more than two centuries, is well sustained*. Now, when this

announcement was made, the average total annual produce, as ascertained by the

Mining Record Office of the Museum of Practical Geology, amounted to 86 millions

of tons ; but by the estimate of last year, as prepared by Mr. Robert Hunt, and to

which I have recently affixed my name, the produce has risen to the astounding

figure of 93 millions of tons. Such is our own natural industry and enterprise that

not more than 9^ per cent, of this enormous quantity is exported for the use of
foreign countries, among which France receives but 1,400,000 tons per annum.

   Passing from the consideration of these deep-seated subjects to the superficial

deposits of the country around Birminghain, I would advise any of my associates
who have not witnessed the phenomena to repair to the parishes of Trescott and

Trysull, and the adjacent hills to the west of "Wolverhampton, there to see a

quantity of blocks of granitic and other hard northern rocks, all foreign to the

district, which were evidently carried by icebergs floating in the sea which

covered this flat and undulating region in the heart of England during that

--glacial period when Scotland was what Greenland is now an ice-clad region,

* Mr. Edward Hull, of the Geological Survey, in his valuable work the ' Coal-fields of

Great Britain,' had previously developed the resources of those fields, and had replied to

Howthe oft-repeated question, "  long will our coal-fields last ?"
--46 report 1865.

 whence icebergs, transporting blocks of stone, were floated southwards* from great
. Scottish glaciers which protruded into the sea.

     Corning hither in ignorance of what the several associations of local geologists
  (which rival each other in their researches) have accomplished, I shall be happy to
 learn that some of them have detected, in this portion of the kingdom, any of those
 proofs of the existence of man at an early period, when large animals, now extinct,

 prevailed in our islands, in ages so remote that, since then, the physical configura-

 tion of the country has undergone considerable changes. This inference is, as I

 have said, founded upon irrefragable evidence collected in different parts of Europe,

 as well as in our own country. When, however, we come to consider the modus

 operandi by which these great physical changes have been brought about, geologists

 have different opinions. As one who holds to the beliefjthat in former periods the
 crust of the earth was from time to time affected by an agency much more power-

 ful than anything which has been experienced in the historic era, I do not believe
 that the wear and tear clue to atmospheric subaerial erosive agency could, even
 after operating for countless ages, have originated or even have deepened any of the

 valleys and gorges which occur in countries as flat as the tract in which we are now

 assembled.

   But whilst I adhere to my long-cherished opinion as to the great intensity of

 power employed in the production of dislocations of the crust of the earth, and

 though 1 cannot subscribe to the doctrine that the ordinary action of deep seas
 remote from coasts can adequately explain the denudation of the old surface, even
 by invoking any amount of time, I recognize with pleasure the ability displayed by

my able associates, Ramsay, Jukes, and Geikief, in sustaining views which are to
 a great extent opposed to my own in this department of Theoretical Geology.

   Admiring the Huttonian theory, as derived from reasoning upon my native

 mountainous country Scotland, and fully admitting that on adequate inclines ice and

wrater must, during long periods, have produced great denudation of the rocks, I

 maintain that such reasoning is quite inadequate to explain the manifest proofs
of convulsive agency which abound all over the crust of the earth, and even are to

 be seen in many of the mines in the very tract in which we are assembled. Thus,
 to brin"- such things to the mind's eye of persons who are acquainted with this
neighbourhood, I do not apprehend that those who have examined the tract of
 Coalbrook Dale will contend that the deep gorge in which the Severn there flows
 has been eaten out by the agency of that river, the more so when the deep fissure
is at once accounted for when we see the abrupt severance that has taken place

 between the rocks which occupy its opposite sides. In that part of Shropshire,
the Severn has not worn away the rocks during the historic era, nor has it pro-
 duced a deeper channel, whilst in its lower parts it has only deposited silt and mud,
 and increased the extent of land on its banks.

    Then, if we turn to the district in which we were last assembled, the valley at

Bath is known to be the seat of one of those disturbances to which my eminent

 friend Sir Charles Lyell candidly applied the term " convulsion "; the hot waters
 of that city having ever since flowed out of a deep-seated fissure, clearly marked
 by the strata on the one side of the valley having been upheaved to a height very
 different from that which they once occupied *n connexion with those of the other

side. When, indeed, we look to the lazy-flowing, mud-collecting Avon, which
 at Bath passes along that line of valley, how clearly do we see that it never
 scooped out its channel ; still more, when we follow it to Bristol, and observe it

 passing through the deep gorge of Mountain-limestone at Clifton, every one must
 then be convinced that it never coidd have produced such an excavation. In fact,

we know that, from the earliest periods of history, it has only accumulated mud,
 and has never worn away any portion of the hard rock.

    t See ' Silurian System,' p. 535.
    * The work of G-oikie, recently published, and entitled 'The Scenery of Scotland
 viewed in connexion with its Physical Geology,' is an admirable illustration of that

 author's descriptive powers. Though I am opposed to his view of the original formation

 of valleys and deep depressions by rivers and the atmosphere, I quite agree with him as
 to the great effect produced by glaciers when that moimtamous region was covered by snow

 and ice.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  47

   From such data I conclude that we cannot apply to flat regions, in which water

has no abrading power, the same influence which it exerts in mountainous coun-

tries ; whilst we are also compelled to admit that the convulsive dislocations of
former periods produced many of those gorges in which our present streams

flow. To pass, indeed, from the environs of Bath and Bristol, and even from the

less distant Coalbrook Dale, you have only to contemplate the tract which lies

between Birmingham and Dudley, and endeavour to satisfy the mind as to the
processes by which it has been planed down before the surface was covered by
the Northern Drift ; for the great dislocations which this tract has undergone,
as proved by many subterraneous workings, must have left a highly irregular

surface, which was so levelled by some very active causes as to obliterate the

superficial irregularities corresponding with the interior disturbances. In short, what
was this great power of denudation which took place in a tract where there are no
mountains whence powerful streams descended, and in which there are no traces
of fluviatile action ? Must we not, in candour, admit that such denudation is as

difficult to account for as it is to explain by what possible gradual agency the vast

interior of the valley of elevation of the Weald of Sussex and Kent, and that of
the smaller valley of Woolhope in Herefordshire, have been so absolutelyand entirely

denuded of every fragment of the enormous masses of debris which must have

encumbered these cavities, as derived from the rocks which once covered them ?
Placing no stint whatever on the time which geologists must invoke to satisfy their

minds as to the countless ages which elapsed during the accumulations of sediment,

I reject as an assumption which is at variance with the numberless proofs of in-

tense disturbance, that the mechanical disruptions of former periods, and the over-

throw of entire formations, as seen in the Alps and many mountain-chains, can be
accounted for by any length of action of existing causes.

   But I must not wander further on, illustrating this principle, to which, as an old

practical geologist, I firmly adhere, namely, that in former periods there existed forces

which, though similar in kind, were of much greater intensity than those which
now prevail, and without which we in vain seek to account for the upheavals,
depressions, dislocations, and even many of the denudations of which the old

crusts of the earth exhibit such undeniable proofs.

   To turn, however, from these general views to the immediate prospects of this
Meeting, I must congratulate you on having here among the men of science
many of the good geologists who constitute the Natural-History Clubs, most of
which have arisen since the British Association met last at Birmingham.

   First in the number of such local associations let me mention the Club of the Mal-
vern Naturalists, so ably presided over by the Rev. W. Symonds. Many are the

valuable data which the researches of its president and members have brought to

light, in addition to the original sketches of that highly interesting tract by Mr.
Leonard Horner and myself, and to the more elaborate and finished work of Professor

Phillips, Among the last contributions, I must specially advert to a memoir by

Dr. Holl, in which he endeavours to prove that the lowest crystalline rock of the
Malvern Hills is the equivalent of the Laurentian system' of North America.
Although I was at first indisposed to admit the validity of his inference, and even
yet see objections to it, and incline rather to the belief that it is of a Lower
Cambrian age, I deem it fair to avow that, in a tract where all the lowest
Silurian rocks are exhibited, though in epitome only, it is possible that the

basement of that primitive Malvern series may be the equivalent of the vast

Laurentian of America, the north-west of Scotland, and of Bohemia, though in
mineral character there is not the resemblance I should expect to find.

   Then in Shropshire, the very kernel of the Silurian rocks of Britain, we have the
Caradoc Club, continually adding to*and illustrating all the phenomena around the
Wrekin and Caer Caradoc ; and the Oswestry and Welshpool Naturalists' Club,
whose Secretary is a zealous geologist, and, with his associates, diligently explores
the neighbourhood of Oswestry and Llangollen, to the geology of which he has
recently published a ' Guide.' 'in Herefordshire there is the Woolhope Naturalists'
Club, whose members claim, and occupy with zeal, all the fossil hunting-ground

to the south of the Caradoc, and range in their excursions from the beautiful
valley of elevation at Woolhope to Ludlow and its environs.

 . Next, if we cross the valley of the Severn, or that which, in the geological
--48 report 18G5.

language used in former years, I ventured to term the " Straits of Malvern," and

ascend from the valley of the Severn, occupied by New Red Sandstone and Lias, we

have the Cotteswold Club, the labours of which have already thrown much light
on the composition and fossil contents of the Oolitic formations. And lastly, to
make out three-fourths of a scientific-field circle around Birmingham, there are at
Warwick a Museum and a Field Club vigorously led by the Rev. P. B. Brodie.

Now most of these institutions have local museums, some of them of value ; and

that of Dudley in particular rivals the collections of this opident town.

   With such means and appliances, then, as surround Birmingham, to say nothing
of the great support we shall have from abroad and from numerous parts of our

islands, I have no doubt that the proceedings of the Geological Section of this

meeting will equal those of any former gathering. Above all, as geologists, we

are inspirited and honoured by the prominence which has been given to our science

in the fact, that as the last meeting was presided over by Sir Charles Lyell, so we
are now assembled under another of our eminent leaders, Professor Phillips, whose

untiring labours, blended as they have always been with the heartiest goodwill

and the kindest manners, have, from its origin to the present day, been the main-
stay of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

mains of Labyrinthodonts, of which a fine collection, the best in England, is con-

tained in the Warwick Museum. Hence it was shown that predaceous fishes and

Salamander-like reptiles were comparatively abundant during this period ; and if

this formation was as largely quarried as many others, a more extensive fauna and
Aflora would probably be detected.

undergone were accurately determined.

                      By the Rev. P. B. Brodie, M.A., F.G.S.

   In the first paper the author described in detail the section of the ' Lima beds
exposed on the line of the Great Western Railway, which contain the usual fossils,

and, as far as coidd be measured, reach a thickness of 40 feet, to which, if the low-

est shales could be added, a greater thickness would be attained. Below the Lima
beds the White Lias appears cropping out on the west, where in some places
in the neighbourhood it is largely quarried, passing downwards into the Rhaetic
series, which is partially indicated by the occurrence of a sandy stone with Estheria
miiiuta, the whole overlying the red marl. The Lima beds here agree pretty well
with the same zone in Gloucestershire, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire, though this

section cannot be so clearly correlated with the still liner one seen in the railway-
cutting at Saltford, near Bath. It is to be noted that at Harhury the 'Insect or

Saurian beds,' intermediate between the Lima beds and the White Lias, are so
much reduced in bulk that they are most feebly represented.

            On two New Species of Corals in the Lias of Warwickshire.
                       By the Eev'. P. B. Erodie, M^L.,F.G.S.

   The author observed that an unusually large species of Montlivaltia*, as yet un-
deseribed, had been met with in the Middle Lias, near Shipston-on-Stour, where it
is abundant, the largest specimens measuring 5 to 6 inches in length, and 3 in dia-
meter acros3 the calicular surface, varying in size and form, some being more elon-
gated and others more cyathiform. Most of the corals are unfortunately much
weathered, the epitheca being rarely preserved, but better ones might be obtained
by quarrying. One example of the so-called Montlivaltia Hairnet was described
from the Lower Lias, near Itugby. Though abundant in Nottinghamshire, it is
rare in Warwickshire, and is known also in Ireland, where it was first observed by
Mr. Tate. It may perhaps be questioned whether this coral is correctly assigned
to the Belgian species. Of late years the number of British Liassic corals has
greatly increased, and when all are published and described, the list will certainly
equal, if it does not exceed that already known in foreign countries.

Remarks on the Drift in part of Warwickshire, and on the Evidence of Glacial

       Action which it affords. By the Eev. P. B. Buodie, M.A.,F.G.S.

   The extent and character of the low-level drift round Warwick and Leaming-
ton and along the valley of the Avon, were first described, containing in places the
usual mammalian remains, but no flint implements had yet been detected. Of older
date belonging to the glacial period, was an extensive deposit of drift occupying

the high table-land over an area from G to 12 miles N.N.W. and W. of Warwick.

Bounded pebbles and boulders of various size and diverse mineral composition

are scattered in greater or less abundance over the whole of this tract, including
granite (rarely) and other more ancient rocks. Here and there some large erratic
blocks are met with, but generally the pebbles are of small size, consisting mostly
of sandstone and quartz. Flints little abraded are nowhere absent from this drift,
though more abundant at some spots than others. Fossiliferous rocks are very
scarce, but at one place pieces of chalk rounded and scratched with flints, green-
sand, oolite, lias, magnesian and mountain limestone, and rounded boidders of older
formations were indiscriminately mingled together. Hence it was inferred that an
iceberg had deposited a portion of its load there. The other erratics consist of the

usual detritus, supposed to have been derived by the same means from the north

Generally, though much of it may have been transported from other directions,

  'he most novel and interesting fact was the discovery of Orthis redux, Lingida

Lesueuri, a species of Modiolopsis, and Trachyderma serrata in the quartzose peb-
bles and sandstones, identical with those figured and described by Messrs. Salter

and Vicary in the Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc, from the New Bed Sandstone at Bud-

leigh Salterton in Devonshire \. It was inferred that these numerous pebbles of a
similar lithological character had the same origin as the Devonian ones, and that

in all probability the upper red sand and marls with pebbles once capped the Keuper
in Warwickshire, and the softer material having been denuded, the heavier masses
were scattered about as they are now found. The few fossils hitherto found in them
by the author are at all events Lower Silurian species belonging to the Armorican
sandstone, and the quartzites of Ivray in Normandy.

  A list of some of the chief constituents of the drift was appended, showing its

prevailing contents to be of a very mixed character, though the sandstone and quart-

zose pebbles largely predominate.

On the Fossil Plants of the Post-Pliocene Deposits of Canada in Connexion

   with the Climate of the Period, and the Formation of Boulder Clay. By
   Principal J. W. Dawson, LL.D., F.B.S.

   The author said the leading deposits are, in descending order, the Saxicava-sand
and Leda-clay, and the Boulder-clay ; but the latter, though locally under the Leda-
elay, is of various ages. Instances were referred to of boulder deposits older than
the Leda-clay, contemporaneous with this and the Saxicava-sand, and also later than
either. Many arguments were adduced to show that in Canada the striation of
both surfaces and the deposit of Boulder-clay had taken place under the influence
of ice drifted by ocean currents, and that there was no evidence of any period when
the continent was covered with glaciers, though these may have existed on parts
of the land remaining above water in the period of depression. It was shown that
the driftage had been from the north-east, or against the slope of the country
that the materials of the deposit were of such a character as to prove that they could
not have constituted subaerial moraines, and that marine fossils occur in some parts
of the Boulder-clay. The paper next referred to the action of icebergs in the Straits
of Belleisle, and on the coast of Newfoundland, showing that their vast numbers
and great size, together with their movement and frequent grounding, must enable
them to produce great mechanical effects. The author quoted evidence to show
that more than four hundred large bergs are sometimes acting at one time in the
Straits of Belleisle, and showed that during the Post -pliocene submergence the in-
fluence of icebergs and the Arctic current must have been exercised in a similar
manner over the whole of the St. Laurence Valley. The last point discussed was
the nature of the flora of the Post-pliocene in Canada. The species of plants
found in these deposits were noticed, and their present range stated, from which it
appeared that they constitute a somewhat aerial but not Arctic assemblage, and
would indicate no greater refrigeration than that which would be due to the actual
subsidence proved to have occurred. This inference would also correspond with
the evidence of the animal remains and with the effects attributed to the Arctic
cm-rent, bearing its annual burden of ice over the submerged land.

                  The Succession of Palaeozoic Floras in North America.

                    By Principal J. W. Dawson, LL.D., F.B.S.

   The Palaeozoic formations of Eastern North America may be grouped in four

great ages, each characterized by a distinct fauna and flora, and a corresponding
series of physical conditions. These are the Lower Silurian, the Upper Silurian,
the Devonian, and the Carboniferous, each of which constitutes a great cycle of
Ealneozoic time. The rocks, supposed to be Cambrian, are imperfectly known, and

  ave afforded no fossils. The Permian group has not been recognized.
   1. The Carboniferous flora may be arranged in three subordinate groups.

(1) That of the Upper Coal formation, consisting of a few of the more widely
distributed species of the Middle Coal formation. (2) That of the Middle Coal
formation, the head-quarters of the peculiar Carboniferous flora and of the pro-
ductive beds of coal. (3) That of the Lower Carboniferous Coal-measures, con-
sisting of a few peculiar species, several of which are not found in the overlying

parts of the system. These plants have been recently recognized at this period in
Eastern America, and a similar group seems to have existed at the same time in

Great Britain. The whole coal-flora in British North America may be estimated
at about 150 good species, of which the greater number are common to America

and Europe.
   2. The Devonian rocks in Eastern America have afforded eighty-one species of

land plants, of which only .about ten are common to this and the Carboniferous
period. They occur principally in the Upper. Devonian, but some extend to the
bottom of the system. Though fewer in species, the Devonian flora is not lower
in grade than that of the Carboniferous period. The earliest known species are
allied to Lyeopodiacea. The Devonian flora has been recognized in Pennsylvania,

New York, Ohio, Canada, Maine, and New Brunswick. The number of species

common to the Devonian of Europe and America is not so great as in the case of

the Carboniferous.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                      51

    3. The Upper Silurian has afforded land plants only in its upper beds, and only
at Gaspe in Lower Canada. The only well-characterized species is PsUopkyton
princeps, which is also one of the most common plants in the Devonian. The first
known appearance of land plants in America is thus at the same geological period
with their first known appearance in Europe.

   4. The Lower Silurian has as yet afforded few land plants. It abounds in ob-
jects called fucoids, but the greater part of those are trails of worms, crustaceans
and mollusks, rill-marks, shrinkage-cracks, &c. Those that show carbonaceous
matter or structure seem to be allied to Northern Alga?. The extent of shallow-
water deposits of the Lower Silurian explored in Eastern America without any
observance of land plants, would seem to afford at least a presumption against their

abundance at that period.

   The author anticipates that the Laurentian will yet afford evidence of at least

the existence of Alg;e before the Palaeozoic period. He has prepared for commu-

nication to the Geological Society a detailed accoimt of that part of the above succes-
sion which relates to the Carboniferous of British America.

On the Large Prussian Geological Map of the Rhenish Provinces and Wtst-
      pludia. By Geheimkath H. von Dechen and Prof. E. Eomer.

M. Geheimrath H. von Decheu, of Bonn, gave a general explanation of the large

Geological Map of the Rhenish country, and of the Province of Westphalia, which

is chiefly his own work, and which after twenty years of incessant labour has just

now been finished. This map embraces one of the most interesting parts of Ger-

many. Besides the Devonian strata which occupy the greater part of its area,

the highly remarkable volcanic phenomena of the Eifel and of the Laacher See are

contained within its limits.

   The whole map was executed by order of the Prussian Government. Its scale is

s^ioo- -A certain number of sheets of the map were exhibited in the Section-room.
   Dr. Ferdinand Rbmer, who has taken part in the survey of this map, made some

additional remarks on the Devonian strata represented on it. The Devonian rocks

of the Rhenish country exhibit the most complete and best developed series of

the Devonian system which exist anywhere in Europe. The whole system is here

--distinctly divided into three main divisions, viz. : 1. The Coblenz Grauwacke, con-

sisting of dark-coloured sandstones and clay-slates of a total thickness of at least

10,000 feet. Trilobites of the genus Homalonotus, Spirifer macropterus, Cho-

netes sarctnulatua, and several species of the genus Pterinea, are the most charac-

teristic organic types. In Devonshire this lowest division of the Devonian rocks

on the Rhine is very little developed, or at least very imperfectly known as regards
Aits organic remains.
                       few fragments of Homalonotus armatus, and of Gryphceus

(Plan-acanthus) laciniatus, aud casts of Chonetes sarcinulatus, from Meadsfoot sands,

are almost the only documents from which the existence of the Coblenz grauwacke

in Devonshire may be inferred.

2. The Eifel limestone, i. e. a series of limestone beds and calcareous marls which

chiefly constitute the several basins in the hilly region called the Eifel, which,

surroimded everywhere by the Coblenz grauwacke, appear like islands on a geolo-

gical map. This Eifel limestone forms the very centre of the Devonian system,

and contains that wonderful variety of fossil shells, Corals and Radiata in a beauti-

ful state of preservation, which have made the Eifel a celebrated region to palaeon-

tologists. This middle group of the Devonian series on the Rhine is distinctly re-
presented in Devonshire. The limestones of Torquay, Plymouth, and other loca-

                                                                                                     4*

lities, and the schist3 containing Calceola sandalina, are evident equivalents of
the Eifel limestone, although the number of fossil species in these Devonshire lime-

--stones is not nearly so great as in the Eifel.
    3. Goniatite and Clymenia-beds. This uppermost group of the Devonian series
is of a more varied mineralogical composition than the two other groups ; Goniatites

and Clymenise are the most characteristic fossil types. On the left bank of the

Rhine, 'in the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Chapelle and Stolberg, the uppermost part
of this group is formed by schists which abound with Spirifcr Vemeuilii (Sp. dis-
junctus). Iu that same country these uppermost Devonian strata are immediately
and conformably overlaid by the true Carboniferous or mountain limestone, cha-
racterized by the well-known forms of Productus, as Prod, semireticulatus and Prod.

 Cora. Dr. Romer concluded his remarks by observing that, although the present

 more exact knowledge of the Devonian rocks in the Rhenish country was the result
of the labours of German geologists, it ought not to be forgotten that many years ago
Murchison and Sedgwick, assisted in the pakeontological department by E. de Ver-
 neuil, recognized in the Eifel limestones an equivalent of the limestone of Torquay,

and so were the first who proved the existence of Devonian rocks on the Rhine.

    The President, in commenting upon the great value of the large map of "Von

 Dechen, assured the Section that he had personally tested its accuracy in several
 explorations of the Rhenish Provinces of Prussia, and he rejoiced to find that
 whilst Principal Dawson had detailed the characters of the Devonian rocks of North
 America, his friend II. von Dechen and Ferdinand Rbmer had admirably developed
 that triple division of these rocks into which he, in his last edition of ' Siluria,' had
correlated with the Old Red Sandstone of Scotland, and its equivalent group as it

 exists in Devonshire.

 On the Existence of Gold-hearing Eruptive Rods in South America wJilch
   have made their appearance at two very distinct Geological periods. By

    David Forbes, F.R.S., 4x.

    The author believed that the gold deposits of South America had not as yet
 been studied with a view to determine the geological period at which the gold
 itself had made its appearance. The present communication was the result of ob-
 servations made during seven years' travels over a large part of South America, and
 which had enabled him to class all the deposits of gold which he had visited under
two heads, both of which could be traced back directly or indirectly to the intrusion

 or eruption of igneous rocks.

    Under the first head belonged all gold derived from the disintegration of granitic
 rocks of an age later than much, if not of all of the Silurian strata, but probably not

 later than the Devonian period.
    The largest gold washings of South America, and probably of the whole world,

 he looked°upon as derived from this source as well as the auriferous quartz veins,
 as these could be traced to the proximity of the granite, and which he believed to
 have originated in, or been injected from the granite into the neighbouring strata,
 carrying°the gold, which was 'a normal constituent of the granite itself, along with
 it. This granite, wherever met with, is invariably auriferous in itself; and although
 it would not pay to grind down granite mountains and wash out the gold in it, yet
 in many parts of South America, in Brazil, near Valparaiso, &c, the granite, appa-
 rently solid, was frequently decomposed in situ to depths of even over 200 feet, as
 shown frequently in the late railway-cuttings, and then it sometimes^ repaid the
 labour of washing the whole mass for the sake of the gold in it. To this class also
 belongs several metallic veins, injected also from the granite into the neighbouring
 Silurian strata, which contain gold, and are remarkable for the presence of other
 minerals very characteristic, as oxide and sulphides of tin, iron pyrites, copper py-
 rites, compounds of bismuth, tellurium, selenium, &c, many of which are seldom

 or never met with in later rocks.
    The second appearance of gold is, however, totally distinct from the above in

 mineral character as well as in geological age, and results from the eruption of
 dioritic (greenstone) rocks composed of hornblende and felspar (without quartz),
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  53

which break through the strata even as late as those containing oolitic fossils, and
consequently must be regarded as younger than the oolitic period, but, as far
as researches have yet shown, are probably not posterior to the deposition of the
cretaceous strata. In this case, instead of quartz veins carrying the gold from

the granite into the neighbouring strata, we have veins of metallic sulphides and

arsenides acting in the same manner, and find the gold imbedded in its metallic
state in the compounds of sulphur and arsenic, with iron, copper, &c. ; and from
some unknown cause the more superficial parts of these veins appear as a rule to

be much richer in gold, which by the miners is generally supposed to decrease in

depth.

   The minerals commonly found in these veins are not the same as in the metallic
veins mentioned as also occurring with the granitic rocks under the first head, and,

as far as observations have gone, the metals tin, tellurium, tungsten, titanium, sele-
nium, &c, are never found in these auriferous veins of later date.

   Nothing could be more conclusive than the totally distinct age of these two sets
of auriferous eruptive rocks, which the author believes to represent the only ages
at which gold has been introduced into the upper crust of the globe, and thinks it

 n-obable that this generalization may be carried into other parts of the globe, if it
Ee not altogether universal.

                      On the Igneous Hocks of South Staffordshire.

                                By David Forbes, F.li.S.

   At the request of the Local Committee of this Section, I undertook to investigate
and report upon the igneous rocks of Staffordshire, and at first had some hopes of
laying before the Section, at this Meeting of the Association, a more complete re-
port upon the chemical and mineralogical nature of these rocks. Upon getting
deeper, however, into the subject, I found that all the results which I could collect
from the labours of previous investigators were but of little service, and contained
so many discrepancies that I was compelled to commence the investigations ab initio.

As my time could not be exclusively devoted to this inquiry, it was evident that

in the few months (from March) which would elapse before the Meeting of the
Association took place this year, it would be quite impossible to do any justice to
the subject, especially as the careful chemical examination of many rocks as were
desirable would in itself take up some months' labour. I come forward, therefore,
with the present communication simply to report progress, and to show that the
investigation has not been neglected, and I trust that at the next year's Meeting of

the Association I may be enabled to present a more complete and detailed commu-

nication. I shall therefore merely give a sketch of the system pursued in the in-
quiry, and shall leave the details until I have the honour of laying a second report

before the Section.

   After having collected all the published information on the subject that was
attainable, of which by far the most important is contained in Mr. Beete Jukes's
valuable "Memoir on the South Staffordshire Coal-Field," I found that our chemi-
cal knowledge was confined to some two or three analyses made at random, if I
may so speak. The two analyses of Eowley Rag and Whiterock-trap, made by
Mr. Henry, and inserted in Mr. Beete Jukes's Memoir, represent, no doubt, the
exact composition of the hand specimens sent to Mr. Henry, whose skill was un-
questionable yet I have quite satisfied myself that they do not represent the com-

                                                              ;

position of the rock-masses in general, aud would not be such as a geologist would
select to represent what he considered as a fair specimen of what the rock-mass

really was.

    In these investigations it is absolutely essential that the chemist, geologist, and
mineralogist should go hand in hand in the inquiry. It was therefore resolved to
make a personal visit to each of the principal localities where these rocks occurred,
and to select carefully specimens which would fairly represent the unaltered rock-
mass, distant as far as possible from the external surface, which, naturally, are in-
variably more or less altered by the action of air, water, carbonic acid, &c, as also
from the intermixture and absorption of more or less of the surrounding strata
with which they come into contact. It is quite evident that without such precau-
--54 report 1865.

tions being taken it would be impossible  to place  any reliance  in the results                                                    yet
                                                                                                                                 ;

it is well known that too often no attention is paid to this subject.

A series of specimens thus collected are now prepared, and being submitted to

chemical examination, whilst at the same time to examine their mineralogical

structure, sections have been carefully ground and mounted for the microscope,

thus enabling rocks, which to the naked eye presented nothing but a dark, indi-

stinct surface, as if composed wholly of but one mineral, to be at once resolved into

the various minerals which actually enter into their composition. Their specific

gravity was also carefully determined. It would take up too much of the time of

the Section, and prove too uninteresting to go over the percentage figures of the

analyses already made, or to go into the details of the methods employed in the

chemical examination, especially as it is intended that these results should be laid

before the Section as soon as the whole of the contemplated series of analyses are
concluded, and better enable comparisons to be made between the different rocks.

I may only state that rocks have been already analyzed from some seven different
localities, and microscopical examinations made of about fifteen localities. Some

points, however, have been satisfactorily ascertained, to which attention will be

directed in a few words.

As will be seen from the map of the Ordnance Geological Survey, the bosses of

igneous rock which present themselves at the surface are some thirteen in number;

the most extensive of them all being the Rowley I [ills, << >vering an area of probably

about 2i square miles; after which the "Wednesfield and Barrow Hill eruptions
come respectively next in extent, whilst the remainder are on a mnch smaller scale.

Besides, however, such rocks as are visible on the surface, the extensive mini re-

operations for coal have disclosed numerous dykes cutting through the coal-measures

and frequently forming large masses, or more or less regular sheets of hard rock,

imbedded in the strata. These are generally less compact in appearance, and of a

lighter colour than the larger masses, and are known to the miners of the district

as " green rock," presenting some resemblance in external appearance to a green-

Astone, but in reality quite distinct from that rock.  third variety of igneous rock

forms small dykes and veins, often very irregular, and altering both the coal and

the rocks in contact with it ; it is known to the miners by the appellation of

" white horse," and is occasionally called white trap or felspathic trap.

I have already completed more than one chemical and microscopical analysis of

each of these three varieties of igneous rocks which so often have been looked upon

as different, and the results are so satisfactory as to leave no doubt but that

all these rocks, however dissimilar in their present appearance, are in reality one

and the same rock, or rather were originally identical, and in all probability made

an eruption from one focus, and more or less contemporaneously. I cannot, howevi r,

endorse the opinion which has been expressed, that they are contemporaneous with

the deposition of the coal measures, but rather am inclined to look upon them as

of later date, and intruded after the consolidation of the same. For this reason

also I am disposed to look upon the belt of what is termed basaltic ash, and laid

down as such in the latest edition of the maps of the Ordnance Geological Survey,

merely as rocks decomposed in situ, in part consisting of decomposed igneous rock,

and in part of the decomposed, previously altered sedimentary rocks in contact

with same: believing that the present Rowley Hills have been exposed and laid

bare by denudation of the strata, which I suppose to have originally covered them

when they were an irregular mass of igneous rock imbedded in the strata, similar

to what can be seen at Pouk Hill. The apparent height of the Rowley Hills, if we

look upon them as a mass of igneous rock, as they until lately have generally been

regarded, is quite deceptive ; the recent sinkings and cuttings having demonstrated
that the igneous rock is but a superficial cap, at most of inconsiderable depth.

The Netherton canal tunnel, which has been driven through the very base of the

Rowley Hills from one side to the other, has shown that this cap of igneous rock

has been erupted through a dyke not more than 8 feet wide, and which was the

only one cut through in driving the entire length of the tunnel, and is apparently

the only channel or conduit. The terms of basalt, greenstone, trap, white-rock

trap, white felspathic rock, and locally, Rowley Rag, white horse, green rock, fee.,

have all been applied to these igneous rocks without much discrimination, and it is

to be regretted that in England much looseness prevails in the nomenclature of the

Aplutonic rocks.  microscopic examination of the close-grained and more compact

varieties, effects completely that which the naked eye can do in the case of the

more crystalline and coarser-grained rocks, and shows them in every case to he

composed chiefly of a soda-lime felspar (possibly labradorite) , along with a small
amount of augite, and a small amount of titanoferrite or titanite iron, which is

never wanting. Other minerals are but seldom present, but traces of zeolites and

carbonate of lime may occasionally be found, and possibly a little olivine, though

its existence is not as yet satisfactorily proved. The rock is therefore what may

be termed a true dolerite, which consequently we must regard as being the sole

igneous rock of the district. The presence of titanium is peculiarly constant

wherever these rocks are found. However altered and decomposed their appear-

ance may be, in the white rock, or in the red clay, on the slopes of the Rowley

Hills, which proceeds from the disintegration of the igneous rock itself, there do we

find the titanium, which thus furnishes an excellent guide for tracing out the con-

nexion with the parent mass. I may mention that I have made very careful exami-

nations to determine whether metallic iron existed in these rocks, as in the case of

the rocks of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, according to Professor Andrews, but

with a negative result.

The alteration in the external appearance of these rocks, which has so long led

to the supposition that they were so many distinct species, confounded under the

names of hasalt, greenstone, and white felspathic trap, is due in part to crys-

tallization, in part to the action of water, and lastly, in some part also, to the fact

that in the- smaller veins and sheets the rock is generally found to contain some-

what less felspar and more augite, apparently for the reason that the felspar,

being the less fusible mineral, has a tendency to cool and become less fluid at a

temperature at which the augite is perfectly liquid. There appears, therefore, to

be a greater tendency for the felspar to retain itself like a spongy agglomeration

of crystals in the main mass of the rock, whilst the more fluid portion travels

further into the smaller chinks and cracks of the rocks. The so-called green rock,

therefore, is in general more rich in augite of a green or brown-green colour, and

as it is generally much more crystalline and coarse-grained, might easily be mis-

taken for a greenstone, without more minute examination. Commonly, also, it is

found to be more decomposed than the main mass of rock from which it has pro-

ceeded, for the reason that, having been injected between sedimentary strata, it

absorbs water from these beds, or from the springs connected with them. This per-

centage of water is frequently found to amount to 9 per cent., without much altera-

tion of colour, due to the oxidation of the iron present in the augite. The so-called

--" white rock," or " white horse," has gone a step further in decomposition most
--probably due to the fact that it occurs in general in small veins or strings and

often has absorbed so much water as to be totally altered in appearance, as in the
specimen here shown, which contains as much as 20 per cent, of water ; and, in

fact, at first sight, it looks more like a clay rock, or consolidated clay, and woidd

not be taken for an igneous rock at all. If we, however, remember that all clays

are nothing' but decomposed felspar, and that this felspar constitutes, we may

say, some four-fifths of the igneous rocks or dolerites here alluded to ; it will be

found easy to trace the change in situ from the unaltered dolerite to the white rock,

or even to the clay, which, in its turn, is produced from the disintegration of the

white rock in turn. This I have observed in several open sections, where the

contact of the Rowley Rag and coal-measures are observed near Dudley; and in
the diagram shown, kindly lent to me by Mr. Beete Jukes for the occasion, and

which is from actual survey of Mr. Beckett, and represents the white rock as seen

in section in the thick coal at the Pensnett Colliery. Here the decomposition has

as yet not gone quite so far as to obliterate the peculiar concentric structure cha-

racteristic of decomposing igneous rocks of this class, well seen in the section.

When in unaltered condition, the specific gravity of these rocks, when taken from

the centre, or so far from the exterior as to he quite fresh, is wonderfully constant.

Prom whatever part of the coal-field the specimen may be procured, it may be

regarded as 284, and this agrees well with the usual titaniferous dolerites of this

class met with in other countries. When altered, as might be naturally expected
--56 report 1865.

from the absorption of water, the specific gravity diminishes, and may descend to
263 or 2-55.

   The internal columnar structure and the peculiar concentric -weathering of these
rocks have also been the subject of special study, and the results of the observa-
tions made lead quite to disprove the evidence of any so-called globular structure
in these rock-masses, but to prove that the columnar or so-called basaltic structure

is due merely to mechanical cajises, i. e., the cooling of masses possessing a nearly
homogeneous structure and subjected to the pressure of the surrounding or overlying
strata ; and that the development of this columnar structure is in proportion as the
rock is more fine-grained and less crystalline, or in other words more homogeneous.
The sedimentary strata in contact are themselves frequently so altered by contact
with the igneous rocks as to present in themselves a columnar structure or jointing,
in some cases quite or even more perfect than the igneous rock itself ; and a bed
of clay-ironstone at Pouk Hill was found jointed into regular hexagonal columns by
the heating and the subsequent cooling and contraction due to the proximity to

the igneous rocks which form the basis of Pouk Hill.

    On a New Wealden Saurian named Polacanthus. By the Rev. W. Pox.

    The author had discovered in the Wealden beds of the Isle of Wight, between
Black Gang and Brooke, a new reptile of the Dinosaurian family. The only parts
of the skeleton wanting are the head and neck. The animal was above C feet long
from the shoulder to the sacrum, and was furnished with a massive tail 5 feet long.

The legs were about 4 feet in length, terminating in broad short feet. This strange
reptile was clothed with long armour-plates of bone, from A an inch to 4 inches in
diameter, and about i an inch thick, that covered its body, with the exception of
its back, which was protected by a great bony shield. Another remarkable cha-
racteristic of this animal was a process of spine-like bones which ran along the sides
of the body and tail, some of which are 15 inches long, and in weight 7 lbs. The
remains of this fossil, as well as the Wealden formation from which they were ex-

tracted, were examined recently by Professor Owen ; and with reference to the
extraordinary nature of the spine-like bones, Professor Owen is of opinion that the
most appropriate name for this new Saurian would be Polacanthus.

On the Progress of the Imperial Geolor/iccd Institute of the Austrian Emjn'rc.

                               By W. von Haidingeb.

A concise history of the Imperial Geological Institute was given by the Director

in the opening address of the 8th of November, 1864, comprehending fifteen years

since its foundation in 1849, during the reign of the present Emperor, Francis

Joseph I. During this time, the geological explorations of the country have gra-
dually proceeded, so that 155 sheets of the Austrian Ordnance maps have been geo-
logicallv coloured, 110 of them in the scale of 1 : 144000 (about 2^ miles to an inch),
and 45 'in the scales of 1 :288-000 and 1 : 432-000 (nearly 4| and 7 miles to an inch),

comprising, to more or less detail, all the provinces of the whole empire. Thirteen

volumes of the Jahrbuch (Annals in 8vo) have been published, as also three volumes

of Memoirs in 4to. Of the copies printed (1000 and 600), no less than 800 and 340

Arespectively are gratuitously distributed.  library is formed, containing more than

13,000 volumes, also a considerable collection of maps, including nearly 4000 sec-
tions. The comprehensive collections of minerals, rocks, and fossils are open to

public inspection in twelve rooms of the Prince Lichtenstein's palace, rented by

Government for the Geological Institute.

   During the year 1804, moreover, an additional set of seven sheets of maps of the
north-west of Hungary was completed, as also six sheets thoroughly revised of the

difficult region of the sedimentary secondary rock of the north-eastern Alps.

   The geologists of the Institute were again at work in the north-west of Hungary,
proceeding from the sections gained the summer before in the direction towards
the east. The whole of the classical country around the ancient mining centre of

Schemnitz was this time the object of exploration. Among other interesting facts,

it was ascertained that the metalliferous greenstone-trachyte was superincumbent

on slates of the Werfen series, with Myacifcs fassaensis, Posidvnomya Clara, &c.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  57

Also other facts oi undoubted superincumbence of the trachytic and basaltic rock
upon certain tertiary strata, well characterized by fossils, were ascertained. Messrs.

1-ranz von Hauer, ilipold, Foetterle, Dr. Stache, Baron von Andrian, Paul, were all

engaged in this wort, and beside them also a number of eight younger minin°-
engineers. M. Wolf had to explore the neighbourhood of Toplitz for providing a

sufficient supply of water for domestic purposes for that watering place, and then

to continue his collections of trachytic types in Hungary and Transylvania. M.
Stur had to compare collections of alpine fossils in Germany and Switzerland.

   The International Agricultural Exhibition at Cologne was opened on the 2nd of
June. From the Geological Institute there was sent thither a newly constructed
geological map of the Austrian Empire, along with an explanatory collection of

rocks and fossils. It was rewarded with the gold medal. The collection was after-
wards placed in the Museum of the University of Bonn. The geological map on
the scale of 1 : 432-000 is now in progress of being reduced to the scale of 1 : 576000,
in which it is to be published in twelve sheets.

  A new Number of Dr. Hornes's Fossil Mollusca of the Tertiary Vienna Basin had

likewise been published in the course of the year.

   Dr. Gustavus Lombe had completed an excellent memoir of the St. Cassian fossils,

as also Prof. Charles Zittel, of Carlsruhe, on the Gosan Bivalves, taking as starting-

points our own rich collections of them. The memoirs are printed in our Academy's
Transactions. Under the superintendence of the Academy was likewise brought

to light, of the Novara Publications, Dr. von Hochstetter's second volume of New

Zealand, containing thePala?ontology, by Unger, Zittel, Fr. von Hauer, Suess, Karrer,
Stoliczka, Stache, and Gustavus Jaeger.

             Additional Observations on the Geology of the Lake Country.

             By Prof. Hakkness, F.R.S., F.G.S., and H. Nicholson.

   The Skiddaw slates, the lowest member of the sedimentary rocks of the Lake
country, have hitherto afforded many peculiar forms of Graptolites, a crustacean, the

Can/ocaris Wrightii, a branching bryozoon, and tracks of worms. To these can now
be added other fossils, namely, two trilobitic forms, Agnostes Morea, and a new

species of Phacops. Besides these, a Lingula occurs in several localities in the
Skiddaw slates, nearly allied to L. brevis. These fossils still further corroborate the

inference that the lowest sedimentary rocks of the Lake District are referable to the
Lower Llandeilo or Shelve group.

   They are succeeded, apparently conformably, by green slates and porphyries, the
former having originated from ash-beds. Hitherto these green rocks have afforded
no fossils, although they have been carefully looked into. As rocks of the same
position and nature occur in the north-east of Westmoreland, among which is a
well-marked fossiliferous zone, the authors were induced to examine a band in the
Lake country, corresponding in position with the fossiliferous zone in the north-
east of Westmoreland.

   This zone, which in the north-east of Westmoreland consists of dark grey flao-oy
rocks with distinct cleavage, lies upon a thick mass of porphyry, and is succeeded
by a similar mass, separating it from the Coniston limestone, the north of England
equivalent of the Bala limestone. The Lake country representative of this^zone
also occurs between two masses of porphyry, and consists of green slates which have
been partially worked in some localities. These slates exhibit no trace of fossils
when first obtained from the quarries, in consequence of the cleavage intersecting

at nearly right angles, the original bedding. On weathering, however, the lines of
lamination become exposed, and among the debris of the quarries fossils are seen
which have a distinct Caradoc type. One of the localities affording these fossils is
Style End Grassing, in Long Sledclale, and another is to the north-west of Sunnv

Brow, about 3 miles south-west of Ambleside.

   The rocks in the Lake district which overlie the Coniston limestone, namely

the Coniston flag and Coniston grits of Prof. Sedgwick, appear to occupy the
whole of the area to the south-east of the Coniston limestone band, where Silurian
rocks occur in this country, except in the neighbourhood of Kendal. These Coni-
ston flags and grits are intersected by north-east and south-west faults, such as
--58 report 1865.

those described by Prof. Sedgwick as occurring to the north of Ulverston (Aberdeen
Meeting of the British Association), and the result of these faults causes these rocks
to occupy a large area in the south-east portion of the Lake country. These rocks
in some localities aflbrd fossils, and the fossils refer them to the Caradoc age. The
Caradoc rocks in the north-west of England are therefore referable to three groups,
namely, a lower group consisting of ash-beds and porphyries, a middle series made
up of limestones with shales (Coniston limestones), and an upper group composed
of grey, flaggy, and gritty rocks (the Coniston flags and grits). In the Lake
district there are no equivalents of the Middle Silurians, the Llandovery group, as
no traces have been detected of the smooth Pentameri, of Atrypa hemispherica, or of
any other characteristic fossils of this portion of the Silurian system. The rocks in
the neighbourhood of Kendal, from the nature of their fossil contents, are distinctly
of the Ludlow age, and it does not appear that in the Lake country any portion of
the Silurians are exhibited which lie between the Caradoc sandstones and the Lud-
low group.

   Besides the north-east and south-west faults before alluded to, and which are of
an ancient date, as they not only do not affect the Upper Old Red Sandstones and
the overlying Carboniferous rocks, but have had the irregularities resulting from them
planed down before the deposition of the Old Bed Sandstones, there is another
series of faidts of a later date, which affects the Upper Palaeozoic rocks. Along
the lines of these newer faults, which have nearly a north and south direction, the
most important of the Lakes occur. They give rise to the prominent north and south
valleys, and in combination with the older system of faidts, they produce in a great
measure that bold and varied outline which gives so much beauty to this portion

of the north-west of Eugland.

          On the Silurian Hocks of the Isle of Man.

By Prof. Harkxess, F.R.S., F.O.S., and H. Nicholson.

The largest portion of the Isle of Man is occupied b}' rocks which have hitherto

been regarded as appertaining to the metamorphic group.

These so-called metamorphic rocks form the cliffs and bold coast on the north-

west and south-east sides of the island, and in the interior the mountainous portion

of the country is composed of them. Exposures of these rocks are well seen on

the coasts, but in the mountainous districts soil and peat to a great extent cover up

the rocky masses.

The old rocks of the Isle of Man are not, however, of a metamorphic nature, but

consist of dark grey slaty beds, which in some localities assume a coarser nature,

and sometimes put on the aspect of quartz rocks.

These rocks, as they are seeu in the neighbourhood of Douglas, dip south-east,

and this dip continues, with some local variations, as seen along the coast, to Moar

Creek on the south side of Maughold Head. On the north-west side of Moar

Creek directly opposite dips occur, namely, towards the north-west, and in this

locality the prominent axis which intersects the older rocks of the Isle of Man, and

which has a north-east and south-west course, is seen. On or near the line of this

axis, near Maughold Head, veins of haematite occur, which appear to have a direc-

tion corresponding with that of the axis.

The anticlinal axis can be seen on the opposite or south-west side of the island

at Port Erin, to the north of which, along the coast, north-west dips prevail, until

the older rocks are seen passing under the Old Red Conglomerates in the neigh-

bourhood of Peel. South of Port Erin the inclination is towards the south-east,

and this inclination obtains, with local exceptions, where the older rocks occur,

along the coast to Douglas Bay.

  There are two localities in the Isle of Man where the dark grey slates exhibit
strata of a different nature upon them. These are Douglas Head and Bank How.
The rocks here have a green colour, are distinctly bedded, and, at Bank How, have

porphyries overlying them. These green rocks are conformable upon the dark grey

Howslates. Their line of strike connects those seen at Bank  with those of Douglas

Head; and between these two headlands, which form the north-east and south-

west boundaries of Douglas Bay, the same rocks are seen forming the reef known

as the Conistor rocks, upon which the Tower of Refuge is built.
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                59

  There are no other rocks in the Isle of Man of an age intermediate between
these green rocks and the Old Red Sandstone.

   The dark grey slates and the green rocks, both in mineral character and arrange-
ment, represent the Skiddaw slates and the succeeding green slates of the Lake
countiy, and an extension of the strike from the Skiddaw country would place the

old rocks of the Isle of Man also in the same line. These old rocks of the Isle of
Man must therefore be considered as belonging to the Lower Silurian group.

On the Metamorphic Rocks and Serpentine Marbles of Connemara and Joyce's

                   Country. By Prof. Harkness, F.B.S., F.G.S.

   These rocks, forming a portion of the south-west of Ireland, have on their south
side the granitic area of Galway, on the north of which an extensive development
of gneissic rocks occurs. These gneissic strata have an east and west strike, and,
although greatly contorted, have a prevailing south dip. Coming out from beneath
them conformably, is a band of limestone, greyish in colour, and subcrystalline in
nature. This limestone, in some localities, is highly serprntinous, and yields the
green marble of Connemara. This green marble is most abundant where the lime-
scone is highly inclined and greatly contorted. The limestone reposes conformably

upon quartz rocks, the latter giving rise to the bold scenery of .Connemara. The
mode of arrangement of the metamorphic rocks in this portion of Ireland corre-
sponds with that of the Highlands of Scotland ; and these metamorphic rocks of

Ireland are the equivalents of the upper quartz rocks, upper limestones, and upper
or flaggy gneiss of Sir It. Murchison, being members of the Lower Silurian group.

   It has been stated that the Connemara marble affords Eozoon Canadense, a reputed
organism of the Laurentian rocks of Canada.

   The structure in the serpentinous limestone which has given rise to this state-

ment, the author believed to be of a purely mineral nature, resulting from asbestos
and tremolite which have formed in cavities as crystalline skeletons upon which
serpentine has been subsequently deposited.

       On the Pre-Cambrian BocJcs of Central England.

              By Harvet B. Holl, M.D., F.G.S.

In this communication the author discussed the age of the crystalline rocks which

form the narrow ridge of the Malvems, as also those smaller protrusions which pierce

the Cambrian rocks and Keuper marl of Chamwood Forest. In their profoundly

altered aspect, in the abundance of triclinic felspar, in the prevalence of hornblende

as one of their ingredients, and in their general deficiency in free silica, the rocks

in both these localities, though separated by a distance of 60 miles, have neverthe-

less a character in common. In the Malvern district they extend for about 8 miles

due N. and S., and are again exposed further to the north, near Martley, making

altogether nearly 16 miles for the entire length of the known area occupied by these

rocks, but nowhere does it exceed f of a mile in width. The dominant trend of the

bedding is from S.E. to N.W., i. e.  obliquely across the ridge                                                                                                                          hence  we  learn
                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

that the area which these rocks occupy is only an uncovered portion of a much

larger one, and it is not possible, therefore, to form an estimate of their thickness,
beyond the general one that it is very great. As far as they are exposed, they consist
for the most part of alternative belts of micaceous and hornblendic gneiss and schist,

the foliation of which corresponds with the plane of the bedding. With these are

interstratified belts of coarse, rudely-bedded granite, and of various granitoid and

gneissoid rocks, especially towards the northern extremity of the range, with much

coarse-grained diorite, and some subordinate beds of crypto-crystalline rock, which

have no very definite character. These rocks are traversed by numerous quartzo-
felspathic veins, and by trap-dykes (diabase) of later date*.

   In the Chamwood Forest district the rock is more massive, and the bedding for
the most part effaced. At Motmt Sorel the rock is entirely granite, and is composed

of dark-coloured, ferro-aluminous mica, and a pale pinkish, subtranslucent, triclinic

Structure of the Malvern Hills and adjacent district," in Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. for Feb

--60 REPORT 1865.

felspar, with a variable proportion of quartz ; and is remarkable, inasmuch as it in-
cludes masses varying in size from a walnut upwards, of a finer-grained and other-
wise dissimilar rock. In the great quarries near the village of Mount Sorel it is
impossible to distinguish satisfactorily the bedding from the jointage, but south of

Quorndon an east and west strike is observable. As in the Malverns, the rock is tra-
versed by trap-dykes, one of which may be seen near the Windmill, and another in
a quarry on the road which skirts Baddon Wood. At Kinchley Hill the rock con-
tains hornblende as well as mica, and proceeding southward, at Bazil Wood, some

large-grained diorite is seen associated with granite, both coarse and fine-grained,
which latter is succeeded by purplish-brown, highly micaceous, crumpled schist and
gneissic rocks, having an east and west strike.

   Other protrusions of these crystalline rocks occur in the neighbourhood of New-
town Linford, Grooby, Markfield, Hammercliff Hill, &c. In these knolls the rock
contains hornblende in place of mica. The felspar is partly of a pale greenish colour,

and uncleavable, and partly triclinic, having the same pinkish, subtranslucent ap-
pearance as that of the granite of Mount Sorel. Quartz is either absent altogether, or
occurs in small proportion only, and occasionally, as near Grooby, the rock contains
epidote. Although similar in mineral composition, these rocks vary slightly in their
general appearance, according to texture and to the relative proportions of their
hornblende and green felspar, forming parallel belts or beds of rock of somewhat

dissimilar aspect, Avhich on the north and west of Grooby may be seen to trend
from W.N.W. and E.S.E. to N.N.W. and S.S.E. ; but further westward, as at

Markfield and Cliff Hill, the rock is more uniform in structure, and the direction of
the strike cannot be determined satisfactorily. At Hammercliff Hill part of the rock
is dark-coloured, from the abundance of hornblende it contains.

   The Lower Cambrian rocks, through which these knolls protrude, have been up-
raised along an anticlinal axis, which extends N.N.W. and S.S.E. from Whitehorse

Wood to Holgate Lodge. From this line the rocks dip away to the N.E. and S. W.,

at angles varying from 30 to GO degrees; but from this general direction of the

dip there are many local deviations. In appearance they resemble precisely the
Lower Cambrian rocks of Wales, and consist of purplish, blue, and green slates,

with grits and conglomerates, and interstratified beds of volcanic porphyry and ash.
These latter are well seen in the high ground which extends from Hobs Hole to

Green Hill, at Bardou Hill, Birch Wood Hill, and along the ridge which stretches

N.N.W. from Bradgate Park. Encircling this small area of exposed Lower Cam-
brian rocks are the Keuper marls, which rest on them horizontally, except on the

north, where the underlying sandstone (Water-stones) intervene the marl and the
Cambrian rocks ; and, as observed by Mr. Howell, " it is worthy of notice that the
marl contains fragments and bouldersof the older rocks where in contact with them"*.

   In the Malvern district the oldest overlying rocks are referable to the age of the
Middle Lingula flags, which rest unconformably on the gneissic rocks of the hills
and in the shallow-water conditions under which their lowest beds were accumu-

lated, and in the successive overlap of the succeeding ones, we learn that the meta-
morphic rocks formed land in the Lower Cambrian sea, and that an interval of un-

represented time preceded the deposition of the Malvern Lingula flagsf.

   Now, with respect to the age of these quasi-syenitic and granitic rocks of Cham-
wood Forest and its vicinity, their massive and highly crystalline condition might

countenance the view that they had had an igneous origin, although they show,
here and there, undoubted traces of stratification, without any change in mineral

character ; but assuming for the moment that they have had this origin, there is a
total absence of any evidence of heat-action upon the contiguous Lower Cambrian
rocks, and we may therefore conclude that the latter had no existence at the time
of their eruption. On the other han-1, regarding them as metamorphic, their mode
of occurrence with respect to the Cambrian rocks, and the circumstance that some

of the grits contained in the latter, as, for instance, that near the windmill north of

Markfield, are made up of rounded grains of felspar, hornblende, and quartz, tends
equally to show that they existed before the era of the Lower Cambrian rocks.

   That the age of the metamorphic rocks of the Malverns is earlier than that of
the Hollybush Sandstone (Middle Lingula-flags) is clear, inasmuch as the latter

rests unconformahly on their upturned edges. How much older may be inferred

from the fact that between the period of the accumulation of the sediments from
which these metamorphic rocks were derived, and that of the overlying sandstone,
there took place all those changes which gave to these sediments their crystalline
structure, and which involve the lapse of a long interval of time ; for profound me-
tamorphism of rocks over a large area is never solely due to the intrusion of erupted
masses, but is always the result of a widespread and general cause, t. e., the broad
depression of the area to within the influence of the earth's internal heat ; and in
this change of level and subsequent reelevation of the area and uptiltiug of the rocks
into highly inclined positions, and in their still later invasion by trap-dykes (all of

which events were fulfilled prior to the period of the Hollybush Sandstone), we have

a measure, as it were, of the length of this interval.

It is highly probable that the intrusion of some of the associated igneous rocks,

as, for instance, the diorite, and possibly some of the granite, may have been contem-

poraneous with the metamorphic action ; having taken place into fissures and chasms

in the crust while depressed and still in a heated state, judging from their coarsely

crystalline condition at their line of contact with the metamorphic rocks, and espe-

cially in the small granitic and other veins *. But as regards the trap-dykes, both in

the Malvern district and at Mount Sorel, they were evidently of later date, as shown

not only by their mode of occurrence, but by their amorphous or minutely crystalline

condition at their margins and in their onsets, consequent upon their having come

into contact with rocks in a cool state, and capable of rapidly abstracting their "heat

of fluidity."

   Whether or not certain associated granitic rocks be metamorphic or igneous, is
not now, however, a question for consideration, as iu either case they are equally

pre-Cambrian in age.

As already stated, the metamorphic rocks of the Malverns were upraised prior to

the era of the Hollybush Sandstone. They constituted in fact a mountain-range,

the crest of a slowly subsiding area of emerged land, during the period in which the
Lower Cambrian rocks of Charnwood Forest and the Longmynds were being de-

posited, and as this subsidence went on, higher beds were brought consecutively

into direct contact with the metamorphic rocks, until finally, at the close of the

Lingula-flag epoch, the area may have been nearly or entirely submerged and

covered up. There thus occurred a blank in the sequence of sedimentary deposits,

the result of the reverse of that change of level which gave rise to metamorphism,

and which attends the accumulation of sediments, viz., a local elevation of the crust,

and emergence of the area from which the next overlying formation is absent. As

these blanks or gaps belong to all ages, it follows there must always have been

areas of dry land ; and as the mean sea-level, and therefore the relative proportions

of diy land and water, probably never varied very greatly, there must have been
emerged land in Lower Cambrian times over areas equal to at least a fifth of the

earth's surface, on which no deposition was taking place, forming breaks in the se-

quence of formations to which pre-Cambrian rocks formed the floors. From this

emerged land were derived the sediments that accumulated in the Cambrian seas.

The  absence   of the      Lower  Cambrian  rocks  from the Malvern  district,  therefore,
                        ^

has no greater significance than the absence of the Carboniferous limestone from

beneath the Coal-measures of Bewdley or of Newent, or of the Old Bed Sandstone

from the area of North "Wales.

   But at some time after the close of the Lingula-flag period, and between it and

the epoch of the May Hill Sandstone, the Malvern area was again elevated, as may

be inferred from the total absence of the Llandeilo, Caradoc, and Lower Llandovery

rocks, and from the tilted position of the Lingula beds, on the denuded surfaces of

which the May Hill Sandstone rests, dipping to the westward at a lower angle than
the beds which underlie it. Again,' at the close of the Lower Old Bed Sandstone
period, the ridge was upraised, as seen in the absence of the Middle Old Bed Sand-

   * It is equally probable, however, with respect to the diorite, that its coarsely crystalline

structure may be due to the action of heat on rocks having the same composition that pre-

existed the metamorpliism of the area, ex. gr., traps and some lava beds.

stone (Glyptolepis beds of Scotland), from the adjacent district, and in the attenu-

ation of the Upper Old Red (Devonian beds), the Carboniferous limestone and
Millstone-grit in the direction of the Malverns. And lastly, in the unconformable

position of the Coal-measures, both on the north and south of the range, and of the

Permian breccia to both the Coal-measures and overlying Trias, we have further

evidence of repeated oscillations of level.

   Similar changes of level affected the Cambrian area of Charnwood Forest. The
Upper Cambrian and the whole of the Silurian and Old Eed Sandstone systems are
entirely absent. It was dry land in early Carboniferous times, as pointed out by
Professor Jukes. It was subsiding, however, throughout the latter part of that epoch,
and continued to do so until the close of the era of the lower Coal-measures. The
upper Coal-measures are not known to occur in the neighbourhood with certainty,
at least the evidence of their presence is not conclusive, and the Permian system
not nearer than Ashby-de-la-Zouch, where some " meagre traces" are supposed by
Mr. Hull* to occur, forming marginal outliers of the formation. Be this as it may,
the area was certainly upraised, and was probably dry land in the early Triassic sea,
as shown by the shallow-water conditions which prevailed at the commencement
of that period, and by the gradual subsidence of the area which followed during
which the Keuper marls closed over it.

             Remarks on the Geology of Parts of the Sinaitic Penhisula.

                               By the Rev. "W. Holland.

   The peninsula is composed of three geological elements. The first and most ex-
tensive is the northern table-land of limestone, the Desert of the Tih. The next,
the sandstone formation-- the great mining district of the Egyptians. The third,
the oranite formation, which included the greater part of the south of the Peninsula.
Further, the raised beaches, especially on the western side, are of great interest.
Tlu' author had obtained specimens of existing shells to the north of Tor, at a height
of 20 to 30 feet above the present level of the sea, and large blocks of coral occurred

at a still greater elevation. He had also shells from the old bed of the Gulf of

Suez, a few miles south of the ruins of Se'rapeon. In following the proposed line
of the maritime canal from Lake Tinsall to Suez, he found the desert quite while

in many places with beds of shells, and in one part for nearly four hours he was

walking across a bed of solid rock-salt, about 4 feet in thickness.

Notice of the Occurrence of certain Fossil Shells in the Sea-bed adjoining the

                 Channel Islands. By J. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.R.S.

   In the course of his dredging explorations this year among the Channel Isles,
Mr. Jeffreys found shells of species, some of which are extinct, and one is not
known to inhabit at present the North Atlantic. They were taken with living
mollusca, at depths varying from 12 to 20 fathoms, and in different parts of the
sea-bed. The specimens in question had the same appearance as dead shells of
recent species ; one of them was in a most perfect state of preservation, and evi-
dently had not been rolled or transported to any distance from its original place
of habitation. They consisted of Potamides tricarinatus, Lam., and P. cinctus,
Lain, (both Eocene fossils), a species of Terebratula (or Terelratuli/ia), which Mr.
Davidson referred with doubt to T. squamulosa of Baudon (from the Calcaire
Glossier), and Rotalia (Discorbina) Trochidiformis of Lamarck, also an Eocene

fossil, but larger than specimens from the Bracklesham beds. No tertiary de-

posit has been noticed in any part of the Channel Isles ; but the discovery of the
above-mentioned fossils in the adjoining sea-bed, occupying an intermediate posi-
tion, would seem to connect this district with Hampshire and Normandy, and to
show the great extent of the Eocene basin or area which formerly existed. Another
species obtained by the same dredgings, near Jersey, was Cerithium vidgatum,

Bruguiere. Several specimens were found, one in a tolerably fresh condition.

This species inhabits the Mediterranean and Adriatic, throughout many parts of

which it is most abundant. It does not appear that living specimens have ever
been found elsewhere, although Lamarck gave the North Atlantic as a locality.
M. Cailliaud, of Nantes, included C. mlgatum iu his list of Mollusca from the D6-

  artement of Loire-Iuferieure, having frequently met with shells thrown up on the
Ijeach ; and Professor Sars recorded the discovery of a specimen inside a codfish
caught off Bergen. Mr. Jeffreys believed that C. mdgatum, which usually inhabits
large estuaries and salt marshes, once lived in such situations between Jersey and
the mouth of the Loire, and that this tract has since been submerged, and conse-
quently become unsuitable for the continued habitability of the Cerithlum. The
presence of submarine peat near the Channel Isles and in the Bay of Mont St.
Michel, tends to confirm the supposition ; although it is by no means certain that
the submergence has occurred within the historical period, as suggested by the
Abbe" Manet, Mr. Peacock, and others*.

      The Extent and Duration of the South Staffordshire Coal-field.

                                   By H. Johnson.

Both the extension and duration of this coal-field are questions open to a very

great difference  of opinion                                  and it  is  to  the confines of the present coal-field that any
                                                           ;

hopes for fresh supplies can be looked for. On all sides of the coal-field explorations

are being successfully carried on, with perhaps the exception of the eastern boundary

on the Birmingham side ; but the great depth at which the thick coal has been last
worked in the neighbourhood of West Bromwich (about 400 yards ) has probably

retarded explorations. The result of operations going on in other portions of the

field is looked forward to with great interest, as affording a warrant for an attempt

to reach the coal through the Permians at Smethwick and Harbome. Durino-

the last ten years, a great number of new winnings have been made in the Can-

nock  Chase  district,  at  Aldridge,                                     Hiinley,  and  other  places                       but  the  most  im-
                                                                                                                          ;

portant recent trial sinkings are those on the south end of the coal-field, in the

neighbourhood of Hales Owen, Congreaves, Cradley Park, and Wassel Grove. In

the event of those at Hales Owen and Wassel Grove discovering the thick coal

--both looking promising, and now sunk about halfway more than 4000 acres of

the thick seam may be considered proved, and this assurance will, no doubt, give
Aa fresh impetus to additional search further south.
                                                                                                scheme for proving the

continuity of the coal-field underneath the Permian on the down-throw side of

the Great Western boundary-fault at Essington is now in course of formation.

It is proposed to form a fund, by subscription, from all the adjoining landowners

likely to be benefited. It is proposed to drive from the existing workings on the

upthrow side, at a depth of about 200 yards, across the fault into the Permain

district, and then to bore up or down to discover the position of the coal-measures

underneath. There is, however, a more comprehensive scheme for exploring the

whole Permian districts lying between the South Staffordshire coal-field and the

Warwickshire and Shropshire coal-fields. To attempt to estimate the probable

duration of the coal-field whilst these important additions are being added, woidd

be impossible ; but it may be observed that such additions are not keeping pace

with the enormous consumption and consequent rapid destruction of the parent

portion of the coal-field. In a valuable paper by Mr. Matthews in 1860, he esti-

mated the then duration of all parts of the coal-field at an average of about forty

years. There can be no doubt but that in one-half that number of years a very

large portion of the earlier-developed part of the coal-field will be totally and for

ever exhausted.

         On the Silurian Bodes and Fossils of Dudley. By C. Ketxey.

   This paper has special reference to the proper classification of the bed of shale
which immediately overlies the Wenlock limestone of Dudley, and which has

high northern species ; those now obtained were tropical or southern.

yielded some of the mo3t interesting and beautiful of the organic remains of the
Upper Silurian rocks.

   Its relative position may be seen by reference to the Geological Survey, Hori-

zontal Sections, sheet 24, section 2.
   There is no good natural section of it, but it has been exposed at several places

by sinkings and excavations, and is now seen in a cutting at the Dudley Railway

Station. In the same cutting, near the Trindle, there formerly existed a section
showing the coal-measures resting on the shale, and showing also a cliff* in the

shale, but that section has been obscured or destroyed ; it is, however, well-

figured in Prof. Jukes's 'South Staffordshire Coal-field.'

  By some authorities this shale is classed as Ludlow, by others as Wenlock.

   Sir R. I. Murchison in ' Siluria,' Mr. Salter in his 'British Trilobites,' and the
Dudley Geological Society, in their Reports, have placed it in the Ludlow series.

   Prof. Jukes, in his ' South Staffordshire Coal-field,' mentions it as belonging to
the Ludlow, but in another part of the same work shows it to belong to the Wenlock.

   The Geological Survey Map and Sections have it coloured as Wenlock shale,
excepting a recent edition, in which it is coloured as Lower Ludlow.

   In the Jermyn Street Catalogue, lately published, the localities of the Silurian
fossils from the Dudley rocks, including those from the shale in question, are

given as Wenlock. And Prof. Morris, in his ' List,' published in the first volume

of the 'Geologist,' gives the "localities and fossils of the Lower Ludlow," but
does not include Dudley or the Dudley shale in his " localities," nor the charac-
teristic species of this shale in his "fossils." Of its many Trilobites, not one

is shown.
   In ' Siluria ' it is stated that " from the physical relations of this shale, and from

its forming usually a part of the same hills as the mass of the Ludlow rocks, it is
classed with that formation ; though in reality it is only an intermediate band
intimately uniting the Wenlock and Ludlow, and is almost equally connected with

both by structure and fossil contents."
   As to fossil contents, the materials for examination have greatly increased since

the passage in ' Siluria,' above quoted, was written. The fossils from the Upper
Shale then available would be derived principally from one locality only,

and consisted, for the most part, of species of the classes Lamellibranchiata and

Cephalopoda, in which the Ludlow rocks are so prolific, but of which many are
found also in the Wenlock limestone. Besides these, however, this shale, examined

in other places, is found to contain most of the Zoophyta, Crustacea, Biyozoa,

Brachiopoda, and Gasteropoda, all so common in the Wenlock limestone below it,
but so meagrely represented in the tj'pical Lower Ludlow rocks of the Ludlow

district.

In illustration of this, lists of the principal fossils are appended ; a summary of

which shows that of Cobals this Upper Shale has twenty seven species, of which

twenty-three are found in the limestone below ; but none of them are fomid in the

typical Lower Ludlow rocks of the Ludlow district.

Of Trilobites, the Upper Shale has twenty species and subspecies, fourteen of

which are also in the limestone below. The Lower Ludlow of Ludlow district

has eight species, four of which are also in the Upper Shale and the Wenlock

limestone                                        and of the  remaining  species, three  are in the Upper Shale, but not in
                                              ;

the limestone.

Of the Brachiopoda, the Upper Shale has twenty-nine species, twenty-four of

which are also found in the limestone below. The Lower Ludlow of Ludlow has

ten species, of which six are common to the limestone, Upper Shale, and Lower

Ludlow, and two of them to the Upper Shale.

Does it not thus appear that the fauna of this shale has, on the whole, a closer

relationship to that of the Wenlock limestone below it, than to that of the Ludlow

rocks above ?

 -- --The highest authorities both Sir R. Murchison and Prof. Jukes consider

this shale to be lithologically undistinguishable from that below the limestone.

   And while it overlies, and is conformable to the Wenlock limestone, it is not
found to have any of the Ludlow beds deposited upon it. This is clearly shown

--in Jukes's 'South Staffordshire Coal-field,' thus: "The uppermost member of

the Silurian formation, the Ludlow group, is only found on the western side of
the main part of the coal-field. If we draw a nearly north and south line, start-
ing from Ettingshall Park Farm, running between Hurst Hill and Sedgley Beacon,
and contiuue it down through Cradley to the south, we find that to the west of

that line, wherever the Silurian rocks rise to the surface, namely, at Sedgley, at

Turner's Hill, and at the Lye Waste, they consist of the Ludlow or upper divi-
sion, while all to the east of that line, wherever the Silurian rocks rise to the sur-
face, or have been reached by shafts through the coal-measures, they consist of the
Dudley and Wenlock division."

   All the localities of this shale are east of this line, and accordingly it belongs
to the Wenlock series.

                                      Annelida from Guernsey.

        By E. Ray Lankester, Scholar of Downing College, Cambridge.

   This paper contained an account of the Annelids and Turbellarians obtained by
the Dredging Committee in Guernsey. The author had been able to distinguish
seventy-seven species from this coast, of which four at least, belonging to the
Polynoina, were new to science ; others not previously obtained from British loca-
lities were also in the list of the new species ; one, a Halosydna, the author named
after Mr. Jeffreys, the other forms were also named and characterized ; Harmotho'e
Sarniensis was remarkable for its unusual development of elytra, which were twenty

pairs in number.

On the British S2iecies of Cephalaspis and the Scotch Pteraspis.
                        By E. Pay Lankester.

   The author stated that he had acquired a very large mass of evidence by the
assistance of various friends, particularly Mr. Powrie, of Poswallie, Forfar. From

these specimens he concluded that there were at least five British species of Cephal-

aspis; and they were C. Lyellii of Agassiz, confined to the Scotch beds (which are

very low), and perhaps occurring also in the passage-beds of Herefordshire, as

C. ornatm, a form only known by fragments ; C. Murchisuni of Egerton, from the

passage-beds of England ; C. asterohpis of Dr. Harley, a well-marked form found

in the cornstones ;  C.  Salweyi  of  Egerton,  .also  well  characterized                                                                and lastly, the

species common in the English cornstones, which appears to differ considerably

from C. Lyellii, as the author showed. This species will be named, and other de-

tails given, in the monograph on these fishes in which Mr. Lankester is engaged in

conjunction witli Mr. Powrie.

The Relative Extent of Atmospheric and Oceanic Denudation, with a parti-
   cular reference to certain Bod's and Valleys in Yorkshire and Derby-

  shire. By D. Mackintosh, F.G.S.

The object of the author was to show that most of the cliffs, projections, and

pillars of rock hitherto attributed to weathering, are really due to the former action

of the sea during the last great submergence of the land. Many of the escarp-

ments or cliffs of Yorkshire and Derbyshire present evidences that they coidd only
have been formed by the battering, undermining, and displacing agency of the
sea. " The multitudes of scattered blocks and fragments frequently found lying
under escarpments, do not in general present the appearance of their having fallen
since the last emergence of the land. They exist in too great numbers, at too great

a distance from the parent cliff, or arranged in such positions as to point to the pe-

culiar action of the sea." The Brimham rocks, nine miles from Harrogate, " fringe
an eminence which a geologist can scarcely err in regarding as an upheaved
island, partly spared, and partly wrecked by the sea. . . . The shapes of most of
the rocky pillars at Brimham must have originated in the jointed structure of the
millstone-grit strata of which they are the remains. The passages between them

have evidently been chiefly excavated by the displacement of blocks, and not so

much by disintegration. Some of the rocks have been more or less smoothed and

rounded ; but a little practice will enable a geologist to distinguish between the
effects of frost and rain, and the shapes communicated to rocks bv waves, tides,

and currents. The stones from New Red Sandstone quarries, of which many old

churches have heen huilt, furnish [a. specimen of atmospheric effects, namely, a

very irregular fitting or roughening of the surface, without any special or deter-

minate shape being produced. . . . Some of the Erimham rocks furnish evidences

of their having heen shaped by a cause forcibly propelled in a particular direction,

so as to wear away soft and hard parts alike. Many of them present forms which

show that they have resisted atmospheric action since they rose above the sea.

Numerous blocks may be seen with angles nearly as sharp as when they were

originally displaced, and the sides of many pillars, passages, and crevices reveal the

jointed surfaces of the rocks as fresh-looking as when the displacements and rents

occurred. ... At Brimham there are appearances which can- only be explained by-

marine agency. First, a line of cliff extending along the western and north-

Awestern side of the eminence.  detached part of this coast-line, behind Mrs.

Weatherhead's house, shows a projecting arched rock which a geologist familiar

with sea-coast scenery could have no more hesitation in referring to oceanic action

than if he beheld it still whitened by the spray. Further to the north, this line

of cliff, in some places nearly 100 feet high, shows many of the more striking

characteristics of a modern sea-coast. Here an immense block of millstone-grit

--has tumbled down through an undermining process, there a block seems ready to

fall, but in that perilous position it has probably remained since the close of the

intraglacial or ice-floe period. On the top of this old sea-cliff, and extending for

a considerable distance inland, may be seen the rocky pillars which form the main

attraction of Brimham. They present resemblances to mushrooms, tables, anvils,

and trees. Generally speaking, they are largest at the top, and smallest under-

neath. The Idol Mock, which is about 20 feet high, and upwards of 40 feet in

circumference, rests on a pedestal varying from about 3 feet to little more than

18 inches in diameter. The undermined appearance presented by this and other

rocks at Brimham, can only be explained by the laterally-operating agency of the

ocean. . . . Rain, assisted by detached pebbles of quartz, may have excavated some
of the rock-basins occurring on the upper surfaces of rocks. But at Brimham we

find basin-shaped hollows underneath rocks (the double basin, with a supporting

pillar, called the Kissing Chair, for instance) in situations to which the sea alone

could have gained access. . . . The Rocking-stones at Brimham present every indi-

cation of their being nearly in their original positions. At one time they must have

formed a continuation of the beds of millstone-grit, of which they are now only

the remains. The adjacent blocks or particles would appear to have been carried

or washed away, and the line of bedding between each rocking stone, and the block

beneath, must have been widened by the insinuating and erosive action of the

waves, so as to leave it with a sufficiently slender support to allow it to be easily

set in motion." Mr. Hull, in the Quart. Journ. of the Geol. Soc. (Aug. 1864),
has given an accoimt of similar " sea-shore rocks " as occurring in " multitudinous

assemblages" on the Peak Mountain in Derbyshire. To the observations of Mr.

Hull I would add, that as these rocks are found at an elevation of about 2000

feet above the sea, and in the most exposed situation, no one can say that the atmo-

sphere has not there had a fair chance of competing with the sea as a denuding

agent. But it would appear that many of the monuments the sea left behind

it thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years ago, have ever since mocked

the effects of rain and frost ; and if the sea-shore rocks of Brimham, the Peak, and

numerous other parts of England have retained their wave-worn shapes for so long a

period, what is to hinder them, secure within their mossy arniour, from continuing

to resist the storm and the waterspout until the sea shall again claim these monu-

ments as its own, and decompose them into the foundations of future continents.

       The Bed Sandstone of Nova Scotia. B>/ the Rev. A. W. M'Kat.

   These are the newest rocks known within the colony, if we except the boulder-
drift. They are limited in their range to the neighbourhood of the Bay of Fundy.
The colony of Prince Edward Island consists wholly of them. Here they are
thicker and more compact, and are extensively used for building purposes. In
Nova Scotia this is never the case, on account of their softness and brittleness.
They arc found chiefly in the Valley of Kings and Annapolis; counties, bounded

on one side bv the range of high hills known as the North Mountain, and on the
other by the northern termination of the hills of the Devonian series. They un-

derlie one of the most fertile districts in the colony.
   There are evidences in this locality of extensive denudation. The sandstone is

found high up on the sides of the abrupt termination of the trap hills already
referred to, and is mingled with the igneous rocks on the face of Cape Blomidon,

far above the level of the surrounding country.

   They have not been found in Nova Scotia to contain any fossil remains. In
Prince Edward Island there have been obtained from them some specimens of

fossil wood, and the jawbone, together with seven teeth, of a Saurian reptile,
named by Dr. Leidy, of Philadelphia, Bathygnaihua borecdis. These would appear
to point to the Permian period of Europe as the probable time of its formation.

   This is confirmed from another source. The trap associated with them was
upheaved after the whole formation had been deposited. This trap seems to be

of the same age as the trap of New Brunswick and that of the Alleghany Moun-

tains in America, an extension of which runs eastward through Lower Canada as
far as the Day of Chaleur, where there is found associated with it red sandstone beds

similar to those described above. The red sandstone of the Connecticut river-

valley was deposited after the upheaval of the Alleghany Mountains, for it rests
unconformable upon the upturned edges of carboniferous strata disturbed by the

igneous outburst. It necessarily follows, therefore, that the red sandstone of the
eastern provinces and those of Connecticut are of different ages, the former being

earlier, and the latter later, than the trap hills and mountains referred to. The
red sandstone of Nova Scotia was first deposited, then followed the trap up-
heaval, and when the disturbance had subsided, the red sandstone beds of Con-

necticut were laid down.

   The colour of these beds seems to be derived from the iron contained in the

neighbouring metamorphic rocks. It occurs in these latter in three different forms.
1, There is a quantity of it distributed generally throughout the slate and shale,

of which these strata are composed ; 2. there are veins and beds of specular
iron ore, as in the Devonian rocks of Nictaux ; and 3. it occurs in the shape of

bisulphide of iron or iron pyrites. When these metamorphic rocks were worn

away, the iron set free was oxidized by contact with the atmosphere, and mixed

up with sediment as it was laid down.

On some Fossiliferous Strata occurring between the Bunter Sandstone and

   Mountain Limestone of the Vale of Clwyd, North Wales. By George Maw,

    I.SJL., F.G.S. 4- F.L.S.

   The Ordnance Geological Survey map places the Bunter sandstone, occupying the
vale of Clwyd throughout its boundary, either adjacent to the mountain limestone,

or to the Denbighshire shales and grits. In several places along its eastern side strata
intervene, consisting of mottled sandstones, variegated shaly marls, containing plant
remains and dark micaceous sandstones. The marly shales abound with plant im-
pressions, which Mr. Etheridge, palaeontologist to the Survey, considers to be of a
Permian type, and unlike carboniferous forms. These beds are for the most part
conformable to the mountain limestone, dipping unconformably under the brick-red
Bunter sandstone towards the vale of Clwyd. In lithological aspect they strongly
resemble Permian strata. The principal localities where they are exposed are at
Pentre celyn, near Llanfair, in the wood above Llandibr Farm, and in a lane between

Llandibr Farm and Llangynhafal. Bed and variegated marls and marly shales,

containing some soft coal, and resting on the mountain limestone, occur also at
Rhiwbibill near Llangwyfen, opposite Denbigh. Although apparently conformable

to the carboniferous limestone, it is probable that they rest on its eroded surface.

   The millstone-grit is developed in great massiveness within four and a half
miles to the east of Pentre celyn, and a small outlier crops up in the Vale of Clwyd

at Ty Coch, a mile and a half to the north. Its absence at Pentre celyn could not

be accounted for from the thinning out of its mass within so short a distance, or
excepting from erosion : if a break really occurs, the marls and shales resting on

the limestone coidd not be of carboniferous age.

On an Exfemive Distribution of White Sands and Clays in North Wales

   antecedent to the Boulder Clay Drift. Bu Geohge Maw, F.S.A., F.6.S.

    if F.L.S., Vice-President of the Severn Valley Field Club.
   There exists in the counties of Carnarvon, Denbigh, and Flint, a widely distri-
buted series of uufossiliferous deposits older than the Boulder-clay on the evidence
of superposition, and differing from it in lithological character, but closety resem-
bling some of the Tertiary deposits in the south of England.
   They consist for the most part of white, black, and yellow sands, interstrati-
fied with tough, white aud grey pipeclays and earthy lignite, generally occurring in
pockets or egg-cup shaped depressions in the mountain limestone at altitudes of
from 800 to 1000 feet above the sea, but not exclusively confined to the limestone.

   Among the localities are Gwydfyd, on the Great Ormes Head, Nant y Gamer at

the back of the Little Ormes Head, several places on Halkiu Mountains, near
Holywell, at Pant du and other localities in the neighbourhood of Mold in Flint-

--shire, all on the mountain limestone. Also a deposit of similar white sand and

clay rests on Lower Silurian rocks at the back of Conway mountain, Carnarvonshire.
The strata are generally broken and dislocated, with a frequent tendency to a ver-

tical arrangement, or a concave bending of the beds into the form of the cavities in
which they are contained.

  A theory is referred to which has been advanced by Mr. Prestwich and others

to account for analogous phenomena exhibited in the excavation of sand-pipes and

pockets in various calcareous formations as applicable to tbe formation of the

Welsh deposits, viz., that the cavities were formed subsequently to the beds that
now occupy them, and that, as the pockets were slowly excavated by watery dis-
solution, the preexisting superincumbent beds were gradually lowered into them.

   Tufa deposits frequently accompany sand-pipes in calcareous formations, and are
supposed to result from the redeposition of calcareous matter dissolved away in

their excavation.

   In the valley below Caerwys a great deposit of about 200 acres of tufa exists, rest-
ing on boulder-clay drift, and as it was adjacent to a cavernous opening in the lime-
stone escarpment, it is probably connected with the subterranean dissolution of the
limestone and of the excavation of the pockets in the .adjacent mountain limestone

range. The order of geological events these phenomena imply may be generalized
as follows :--

   1st. The deposition of the white clay and sand strata at some time since the
principal erosion of the mountain limestone, which took place about the Permian

period.

   2nd. The partial excavation of the pockets, and the gradual lowering into them of

portions of the previously existing deposits.

   3rd. The erosion of the great mass of the formation not protected in the pockets,
and the deposition of the boulder-clay drift.

   4th. The continued excavation and deepening of the limestone cavities after the
boulder-clay period, accompanied by the redepositing of the calcareous matter,
carried away in watery solution, as tufa.

    Deposits of a similar character occur in the mountain-limestone district of
Tipperary.

  On Steam as the active Ayent in Earthquakes. By R. A. Peacock, Jersey.

   The author had collected seventy evidences of the presence of steam or its con-
stituents in every species of natural disturbance of the earth's crust. It was proved
by investigation of series z of M. Regnault's most excellent experiments *, that in

saturated steam of the temperatures 241 i° to 447° F., the pressure increased in the

 enormously rapid ratio as the 4^ power of the temperature, very nearly. The pressure
 with the latter temperature, viz. 409 lbs. to the square inch", is the highest limit of

present exact knowledge. What the pressure is at the greatest temperatures attain-
 able we do not know, but we have some indications that at a high temperature it is

 veiy great indeed. The Bev. John Michell * states that in casting two brass can-
nons, " The heat of the metal of the first gun drove so much damp into the mould of
 the second, which was near it, that as soon as the metal was let into it, it blew up
with the greatest violence, tearing up the ground some feet deep, breaking down the
furnace, untiling the house, killing many spectators on the spot with the streams of
melted metal, and scalding many others in the most miserable manner." These great
effects were evidently all produced by the steam of a few ounces of water only, for

it is called merely "damp. ' It must therefore have been verypowerful steam. Now

the temperature of melted brass is known to be only 18(39° F., which would be re-
duced by absorption of latent heat, and by raising the temperature of the damp, and
the mould, and the neighbouring sand. But the heat of melted stone or lava is
3000° F., or, according to some, 3200° F. And since the Gulf of Santorin in the

Grecian Archipelago lias been for 2000 years a scene of volcanic operations!, it ap-
pears the mass of fire below is so very vast that the sea has not been able to quench
it, and therefore the heat of the steam will closely approach to 3000° or 3200° ; for
the water scarcely reduces even the surface temperature of so prodigious a mass

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

radiation instantly replaces the heat abstracted, by other heat. Since, therefore,

saturated steam or its constituents is so very often present in all species of natural

disturbances of the earth's crust, it is worth while to remember, on the bare chance

of the pressure continuing to increase as the 4J power of the temperature, that in

that case saturated steam of the highest temperature would have a force of at least

a thousand tons per square inch, which would be .amply sufficient to cause the

greatest effects of earthquakes aud volcanos. M. Regnault says (p. 619) that the
graphic curve by which he represents hia pressures and temperatures ' presente un

=point d'inilexioii " at 627°-2 (J. 1160°-96 F.J " Enfin," says he, "la courbe, qui

to about 800 tons per square inch. " Ce serait done la LVlimite superieure de la force
elastique de la vapeur." As far as he can judge. But he very properly adds, "' Mais il

serait a mon avis tout a fait deraisonnable d'attacher une signification reelle a ces

points singuliers de la courbe, qui sont si loin en dehors des limites on nos obser-

vations peuvent atteindre." Supposing he is correct in saying that steam pressure

may continue to increase up to about 800 tons per square inch and no higher, that

force would still account for the greatest effects of earthquakes and volcanos.
   The volume of steam compared to the volume of water which produced it when

the pressure is 26^ lbs. to the square inch, is known to be about 941 times as great,
whilst, when the pressure is 606 lbs., the volume of steam is known to be only
about 432 times as great as that of the original water §. And the author of the

Saper thought that heat compresses steam in the same way, though not in the same
  egree, as the force-pump compresses water in the hydrostatic press ; and that sup-

posing the strength of the containing vessel unlimited, and the supply of water

sufficient to saturate the steam, the force or pressure attainable would only be
limited by the maximum heat in one case, and the maximum pumping power in the
other ; and the conclusion he arrived at was, that steam certainly operates quantum

valeat in producing earthquakes, volcanos, and other similar disturbances ; and that

other forces cooperate, where no help is required.

On Extensive and Deep Shillings of Lands in the Channel Islands Seas, and

on some Changes of the French Coast of the Bay of Biscay within the.

Historical Period. By E. A. Peacock, Jersey.

   It is well known that quantities of trees with roots attached, and other supra-
marine products, have been found all along the west coast of Normandy, along the

eastern half of the north coast of Britanny, in the Bay of Mont S. Michel, on the

west, south, and north-east of Jersey, and on the east and west of Guernsey, be-

tween high and low water, and even lower than the latter. Not only so. but in 1787

thousands of trunks (with roots) of trees were washed up on the west of Jersey from
Rigdon shoal and Great Bank, which are respectively at 2 and 3 miles westward of
high water, and on the latter of which banks the soundings are from 7 to 9 fathoms

at low water, and the greatest rise of tide 42 feet. And supposing the original height

of the ground 10 feet above high water, it follows there must have been a sinking
of at least a hundred feet. Prodigious quantities of trees also came up from the
bay of Mont S. Michel after a hurricane on the 9th of January, 1735, and its sands

have been penetrated more than 50 feet in several places without reaching their

bottom, though it is well known that previous to a.d. 709 the whole bay, as far as
Chausey rocks, and for a considerable breadth northwards as far as Cape la Hague,
and the country southwards as far as Dol, was the forest of Sciscy. The positions

of four ancient monasteries and the Bourg of Lhan-Kafruth, which stood in this

forest, are known. One of these stood where there is now a sounding of 54 feet at

low water, and the greatest rise of tide is also 54 feet, to which add 10 feet for sup-

posed height of the monastery above high water, and we have a total of 118 feet of
sinking. If the late Abbe Manet's figures are to be relied on, the Mont was once

176 English feet higher than it is now. It is certain, from the nearly contemporary re-

cords contained in 'Acta Sanctorum,' Dom Bouquet's 'Historians of France,' 'Neus-

tria Pia,' and other middle-age authorities, that Mont S. Michel, which contains

now only about 20 acres, was immediately previous to a.d. 709, 6 miles long by 4

miles broad and covered by forests ; and that the rock was once a Mountain, and

6 miles, or, according to other accounts, 8 miles from the ocean, and even much

Amore.  large tract of land 20 miles long, and in some places 2^ miles broad, now

lost, extended from Cancalle Point, past S. Malo to Cape Frehel. There have been

about nine different sinkings.

   The remarkable angularity of the vast tracts of marine rocks on the south and

west of Jersey, though daily subject to the action of the tides, can only be accounted

for, he thought, by their having only been exposed to that action since 1356, at
which date the tracts sunk, and the soil upon them was washed away, and the

angles of the rocks have not yet had time to become rounded. Poingdestre,
a learned antiquary born in Jersey in 1609, substantially confirms some of these
views in No. 5417 of the Harleian MSS., which is known to be of the date 1685.
The Ecrehous and Dirouilles on the north-east of Jersey are known to have been

much more extensive than at present ; they also sunk, probably in 1356. Ptolemy
gives latitudes and longitudes in his own way, and some of them having been re-

duced to modern latitudes and longitudes, give important corroborative results.

For example, taking his Ocrinum promontory (the Lizard), and his centre of the

Isle of Vectis (Wight) as points of departure, his Gobseum promontory of the

( Vrismii becomes 4° 51'-21 W. long, and 48°33'T8 lat., which nearly coincide with

the present north-western angle of Britanny, and therefore prove that in this instance

Ptolemy is nearly correct. His harbour of Staliocanus becomes 2° 48,-81 W. long,

and 48° 38 ' lat., which nearly agree with the position of the present harbour of

Portrieux, and are probably approximately correct. And, now observe, his mouth of
the river Argenis becomes 2° 0'91 W. long, and 48° o2 'o4 lat., which give a position

seventeen miles west of the present west-coast of Normandy, which is curiously corro-

borated by two modern writers (each independently of the other) having stated that
Mont S. Michel was once ten leagues from the sea, which is the distance from the
Mont to the mouth of the river Argenis, nearly. Observe also, the mouth of the

river ifetus becomes 2° 22'-2 W. long, and 49° 2 '-21 lat., which fall more than thirty

miles west of the present west coast of Normandy, and range very well with lligdon

shoal and Great Bank, formerly forests. He believed Jersey was not an island until

after Ptolemy's time. There. had been a sinking of about 20 fathoms at the
Northern Channel Islands ; and sinkings along the French coast of the Bay of

Biscay but the Aunis has risen a few feet.

                   The Insulation of St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall.

                        By W. Pengelly, F.B.S., F.G.S., Sfc.

   St. Michael's Moimt is an island at every high water, and, with rare exceptions,
a peninsula at every low water. It is about one third of a mile from the mainland.

--Its name in the ancient Cornish language " Caraclouse in Cowse," or the " Hoar

llock in the Wood," is entirely inappropriate at present, and betokens a change in
the geography of the district since Cornwall was inhabited by a people speaking a
language which survived until a very recent period.

   The Mount is undoubtedly the " Ictis " of Diodorus Siculus, whose description
is still so very appropriate as to render it probable that two thousand years have

produced very little change.

   The insulation must have been effected, of course, either by the encroachment of
the sea or by a subsidence of the district. The former hypothesis requires such an
enormous amount of time,* and is so utterly opposed to various geological facts, as
to render it eminently probable that, since Cornwall was inhabited by a race
speaking the British language, St. Michael's Mount was insulated by a general

subsidence of the country.

A Recent Example of the Formation of Pyrites in a South Staffordshire Coal

                            Pit. By Loviboxd Pekcival.

   The example, which was interesting as tending to throw some light on the for-
mation of pyrites in the coal-measures, and further, as having very recently occurred
under definite and known conditions, occurred in a West Bromwich coal pit, which
was opened about twenty-five years ago, and after a time was closed on account of the
rise of water : it remained closed for seven or eight years, and on resuming work,
some slack, which had been left in the pit, was found to be largely permeated by a
peculiar formation of pyrites. In this case there had probably been a decomposi-
tion of pyrites (previously formed), and again the decomposition of the ferruginous
salts in solution, by the presence of carbonaceous matter. The quantity of conglo-
merate of slack and pyrites thus produced was very considerable.

    On Glacial Striation. By Professor Phillips, LL.D., F.B.S., F.6.S.

   On few subjects, amidst some apparent differences, are geologists better agreed
than on the general theory of the movement of glaciers on their inclined beds in

the Alps, while on their former and permanent effects, as evidenced in the valleys
and anions: the lakes of England, the differences of opinion are great. The author
believed that these differences ought to be brought to the test of accurate mecha-
nical principles, such as the limits of effective pressure to move ice forward on level

surfaces and up ascending slopes ; and confronted with accurate notions and exact
maps of definite tracts selected for study. Pie then described the special phenomena
which had been observed by Mr. Lee and himself, on a swelling ground at the foot
of the Corner Glacier. In this case he showed that beautiful striation and polish
were traceable on broad flat surfaces (protected by a shed) 150 feet above the actual

bed of the glacier, and about ICO yards from its base. He showed that this was
quite consistent with the known physical constitution of ice, and the slopes of the

ground, steep as these are. It is quite clear that on such ascending slopes the up-
ward movement of the ice, by pressure from the higher parts of the glacier, is a

real and necessary result. That the glacier formerly extended much beyond its
present limits is well proved by other facts. The author next described the pheno-
mena of glacial movement in Wastdale, and the features of Wastwater, a deep
straight lake, three miles long. In these can be shown the reality of partial move-

ments of ice in the valley, but from the great length of the lower, almost level
tracts of ground, and the shortness of the upper snow slopes in ancient days, he

concluded that effective pressure could not be continued through the length of

Wastdale. Among other reasons for this, he instanced the fact that under the pres-

sure equivalent to 1000 or 1500 vertical feet of ice, that substance would lose its

solidity. He also showed by a study of the relative grinding force of the icy weight

under different conditions of deptli and inclination, that if such pressure could be
communicated, it would not be effective in excavating the lake. It would not tend
to make a hollow such as a lake would till, nor to deepen such a hollow if previously

placed in its path in Wastdale. On the whole, he concluded that for a satisfactory

explanation of the full wearing and excavating effect of ice in valleys and lakes it
would be necessary always to treat each case as a special problem, by no means

purely geological, but including important and quite practicable mechanical deter-

minations.

On the Geology of Coalhvoolc Dale. B>j the Rev. W. Pueton.

   Just where the valley of the Severn contracts towards the narrow gorge through
which it passes the limestone ridge of Wenlock Edge, it is joined by the lateral
valley of Coalbrook Dale, running down from the high table-land which forms the
chief part of the Shropshire coal-field. The Dale, which is for the most part
scooped out of the Wenlock shale, is joined about midway down by the hollow

through which the railway ascends to Lightmoor, and which is excavated in the

Lower coal-measures here faulted down; and is flanked at its entrance into the

Severn valley by the Mound called Strethill on the north, and by Lincoln Hill on

the south. At Strethill, we find the mass of glacial drift, 200 feet high above the

Severn, which formed the subject of Mr. G. Maw's paper read before the Geologi-

cal Society, and printed in their Quarterly Journal for May 1864; and which has

served to prove that at one time during the glacial epoch Wenlock Edge was the

coast-line of the Irish Sea, and the Severn valley a marine strait. At Lincoln Hill

the Wenlock limestone, which rests at a high angle on the shale, is now worked in

a series of extensive caverns ; but in the old surface workings we may still see the

cavities whence the Ball-stone has been extracted, as described by Sir Roderick

Murchison in his ' Siluria.' And there is also exposed a highly interesting sec-

tion, showing the Lower coal-measures resting- immediately on the Wenlock lime-

stone. The lowest seam of coal, the " Lancashire Ladies," and the " Crawstone "

Aironstone are visible.  walk along the south side of the Dale, about a mile,

brings us to Lightmoor Wood, in a quarry in which the fossil tree was found which

was figured some time since in the ' Illustrated London News.' In this quarry

we again met with the Crawstone ironstone, and are able to trace the series ot

strata upwards to the "Little Flint" coal and "Clod" coal; while in the Light-,

moor railway-cutting close at hand, we have exposed no less than six different

seams of coal capped by the " Pennystone " ironstone. In a brick-field about 100

yards to the north still higher strata are exposed ; and thus in a walk of little more

than a mile, we may see in open sections the whole of the Lower coal-measures,

and a portion of the Pppcr. It is to these sections I wish to direct the attention

of those Members of the Association who are about to visit Coalbrook Dale. For

surface of a piece of coal-shale, and is beautifully preserved. Besides the outline
of the body, it shows distinctly the four pairs of legs, and the two palps with their
articulations. Even the coriaceous integument of the body, and the hairs attached
to the legs are preserved. The interest of the discovery of this spider lies in the
fact, that hitherto spiders were not known from any rocks older than the Jurassic,

and that now their existence in the Pala?ozoic rocks is proved. From the resem-

blance to the recent genus Lijcosa, and its occurrence in the Coal-measures, the

name of Protohjcosa anthracophihi was proposed for the species.

     Explanation of a Map of the Faults in the Gold District of Dolyclly.
                                    By J. W. Salter.

   The district examined during the autumn of 1864 included the greater portion
of the right bank of the Mawddach river, from the waterfalls above Dolgelly to the
Clogau Gold Mines nearer Barmouth, and advantage was taken of the dry weather
in September and October to search the watercourses for evidence of the faults
which cut up the mining region. Particular attention was paid to the portion
about the waterfalls, and a few miles south. The results showed that while the
major lines of fault ranged with the strike around the nucleus of Lower Cambrian
rocks, and repeated the beds, thus widening the area of the Lower Lingula Hags,
the other faults, which are very numerous, and have not yet been shown on any
map, are reducible to three or four series, the order being as follows :

  A1. series of east and west faults (Clogau, Gwynfynydd, &c.) of small amount,

bearing quartz lodes and visible gold, copper blende, galena, iron, arsenic ; these
are crossed by

    2. Faults, rarely of large amount, about 30° or 40° north of east, occasionally, as

at Cefn Coch (Welsh gold mines), rich in the precious metal, but also as at Cwm-

heisian lead mine, with lead, or at other places copper, &c.

   The above two series may be of one age ; and are certainly the oldest. They
have reference probably to the first undulations of the North Welsh district, and

which run in a north-east and south-west direction.
   3. Strike faults, following the outline of the Lower Cambrian nucleus (the

Merioneth anticlinal of Professor Sedgwick), and hence varying in direction, more
northerly on the upper waters of the Mawddach, more easterly along the estuary.
Parallel faults to these occur in the great porphyry range of Arran, and of Cader
Idris, and are marked on the Survey map.

   4. North-west and south-east faults, of no great amount, usually as copper or
lead lodes, but often bearing gold, (Tyddyngwladis silver lead mine and Dolfrwynog

gold mines are examples). They are numerous, and as yet only known near the

waterfalls, and thence to Dolfrwynog.

  A5. grand series of north and south faults, usually 15° to 18° west of north,

which cross and interrupt all the foregoing series, shifting the lodes and cross courses
and giving the features to the ground throughout the whole of the gold mining
districts. These are traceable by cliffs and ravines, river and brook courses, ledges
--74 report 1865.

and steep escarpments, from Pistyll Cain, and far northward they extend to Clogau

and Vigra mines, and are especially to be noticed in the Great Lower Cambrian

nucleus of the Merioneth anticlinal, defining the north and south ridges of the

--mountains, and the great Trawsfynydd valley. This series of faults is the latest,

and is probably of very wide extent the north and south valleys of the Lake dis-

trict in Westmoreland, and the great north and south faults of the carboniferous

series in Lancashire, Yorkshire, &c. being very probably included in it.

All the above faults are of course connected by short cross faults at the angles of

intersection ; and the author believes that to this cause are due the minor lake

valleys of North Wales, which, so far as he lms examined them, seem always to he

in the lines of intersecting faults.

   The author is not so certain of the exact order of the series 3 and 4, as he is that
the east and westerly faults and lodes, containing gold, are the oldest ; and the north

and south faults the newest in the district.

That the ascertaining of the principal lines of fault, and their order of succession,

must be of value to the practical miner in any given district is obvious enough

and it behoves those engaged in such operations to ascertain, as has been partly

done in Cornwall, the relative age and contents of each of the series. If lodes be

in lines of fault, as they certainly are, it is of consequence to the owners of mining

property to ascertain what is the number and direction of any given series, con-

taining, for instance, zinc and gold, and whether the slides and cross courses which

interrupt and often spoil these may be advantageously searched for lead, silver, or

copper.

There are eight series of faults known in the Cornwall districts and in Germany,

as we learn from Sir C. Lyell's Manual. And the contents of each series are in

part known                                                but it must  be borne  in  mind that each  successive crust  movement,
                                                       ;

while it opened fissures for the metals of its own age, would by reopening the old

fissures, tend to redistribute their contents, and possibly to commingle them with

the deposits of newer age. The whole subject, as it is one of great scientific interest,

so also demands very careful observation, the result of which will certainly be to

diminish mining risk, and increase the sources of our metallic wealth ; for faults
and the lodes that accompany them are extremely numerous and definite in direc-

tion.

  On the Drift in the Parish of Exludl, North of Coventry. By A. Staetin.

    In this paper the author pointed out the existence of a strictly local stream of
northern boulder drift about two miles wide, passing from north to south over the
centre of the parish of Exhall, and showed that although the drift overlying the
country to the eastward, from the evidence of its fossils, was undoubtedly derived
from the Lias, the Oolite, and the Chalk, and that on the high land at Corley, and
the whole district to the westward being rounded quartzose pebbles and small gravel;
was probably brought from the Bunter conglomerate of Staffordshire, yet that this

drift-stream consisted almost entirely of angular fragments and large boulders from
the Millstone-grit, and detritus from the coal strata outcrop between Nuneaton
and Atherstone, only from 7 to 10 miles to the northward. lie produced speci-
mens from the drift, and also from the rocks in situ, and explained that the carbo-
niferous strata and millstone-grit at Hartshill, a short distance to the north of
Nuneaton, dip to the S.W. at an angle of 40 degrees, and form an elevated escarp-

ment about 600 feet above the sea, overlooking the plane of the New Red marls to

the eastward. From the sharp angular character of the boulders, and also from

the fact that no marks of striation have been observed, he expressed an opinion

that they had been probably earned southward by coast-ice during an epoch when

the high lands of the Warwickshire coal-field formed an island in a shallow sea,
and he suggested that the necessary contour of the supposed coast-line would ac-
count for this drift-strearn being found in its present position.

deposits in the West of England which represent that preglacial period known to

geologists as the Forest of Cromer period, which preceded the great general sub-

mergence of a large portion of Europe and the British isles beneath the waters of

the glacial sea. The nearly total submergence of Siluria and Wales during the

marine glacial period he considered as proved by the position of marine shell-

bearing drifts, containing large ice-worn erratics, upon mountain platforms in

Wales. These drifts have been found in several localities at the height of nearly

2000 feet above the sea. The conclusions arrived at by Sir Charles Lyell, Pro-

fessor Ramsay, and others, are well known, and they all tend to prove that large

portions of Wales and Siluria were submerged during a period of the glacial epoch,

which may be denominated as the glacial marine period. If this was the history

as regards North Wales, Mr. Symonds contended that it applies also to South

Wales, almost the whole of which he believes to have been submerged during this

glacial marine period. Accompanied by his friend, the Rev. James Hughes, he

had crossed the hill of Craig Turch this summer, where the river Cothi rises, half-

way between Llandovery and Tregarron, among the wildest scenery of South Wales.

Here he observed large erratic rocks resting on drift similar in position to those of

the Maenbras  below  Snowdon                                        and he believed these erratics to have been trans-
                                                                 ;

ported from afar by ice-rafts floating over a glacial sea.* The hill platform of Craig

Turch, like that of Moel Tryfaen, and the Snowdon country, had been elevated, in

the course of ages, to its present height. In the accumulation of the marine drifts

of the Snowdon country there coidd be no doubt about their origin, for they con-

tain numerous sea-shells, and many striated, polished, erratic blocks, which must

have been dropped into them by floating ice. The author thinks some of the more

elevated mountain platform drifts of South Wales must be attributed to the same

origin, viz., a f/lacial marine origin; but while believing that there are unmis-

takeable proofs throughout Siluria of long periods of submergence and of gradual

elevation, as proved by the position of marine boulder-bearing drifts at different

elevations, the author maintained that the efl'ects of land-ice and snoiu in transport-

ing great masses of local rocks to long distances had not been sufficiently observed.

He had observed deposits of transported rocks so peculiarly local that it seemed
impossible to suppose they could have been left by icebergs or rafts. No geologist

could explore the valleys of the Wye, Severn, Usk, Towy, Tivy, Cothi, Rheidol,

Yswith, Teme, and Lugg, without observing that the heads of those valleys were

at one time filled with unstratified boulder-clay or till, and that through this till

the rivers have excavated their channels. This till is entirely unlike the stratified

boulder-bearing silts of marine origin. The boulders contained in this till are all

local, are frequently elevated above all signs of even the most ancient river-action,

have never been acted upon by water-action of any kind, and, though belonging

to rocks in situ in the district, have been carried across particular districts and down

particular hills ; wh.de as regards the erratics borne by floating icebergs they are

mingled and heterogeneous. On many hills in Wales you observe boidders of en-

tirely local origin studding hill-sides and resting on rocks to which they do not

belong ; but they have a local distribution, and have been derived from a local

centre. He had observed also that in numerous instances the transported rocks

never crossed a valley, as in the case of Dean Forest, where masses of millstone-

grit and mountain limestone are found on one side of the valley, but not one can

be found on the hills across the Wye. The whole tendency of Mr. Symonds's paper

was to show that since the elevation of the land into its present condition, glacial

land phenomena were continued long after that elevation, and that although there

are evidences of marine glacial action, those evidences have been much obliterated
and destroyed by the long-continued and later effect of land-ice and snow. He attri-

buted the transportation of the masses of subangidar gravel, which contains large

erratics from the Malvern range, and are distributed in patches on the Hanley and

Castle Morton plains, to the effect of a mass of frozen snow and ice which in former
days stretched from the Malverns down to the plains. The ancient river-terraces

of Siluria are well marked, and stand out in some instances at a height of 800 feet

above the existing river-channels. In Worcestershire it is difficult to make out

where the marine conditions ended and the river conditions commenced.

                             By the Key. J. D. La Totjche.

    The Wenlock is a well-marked stratum of limestone, of which one of its chief
characteristics, wherever the author had an opportunity of observing it, is its tendency
to become nodular, but it is near the town of Wenlock that these concretionary
masses assume a remarkable importance at intervals along the Wenlock edge
here, about 700 feet high, buried in the substance of the general stratum, which is
some 30 or 40 feet thick, are huge masses of limestone, locally called ball-stones,

of a purity very superior to the surrounding rock, so superior that they are exten-

sively used as a fluS for iron ore. They appear to consist of greenish-grey veins
mixed irregularly with bluish-grey limestone, and fossils are occasionally found in
them. They vary in size from a few feet to some 50 feet in thickness, and their
length, which is generally at right angles to the line of the ridge, is in some cases
more than 100 yards.

    That they have been formed subsequently to the deposition of the rest of the
stratum seems to be proved, by the arching over them to a slight extent of the rock
above, and in one instance a similar appearance had been observed in that which is
below them. The rest of the surrounding stratum seems to be continued into their
substance, in which but very slight traces of stratification are observable. That
they have been formed subsequently even to the upheaval of the whole neighbour-
hood and its denudation seems probable from the fact that there is no indication
of their existence on the surface of the Wenlock Edge, which there would be had
they been submitted to the same denuding forces as have acted on the surrounding
rocks, from which they differ greatly in hardness and composition.

  A few Notes on the Structure of the Matterhorn. By Edward Whympeh.

   When one observes the great peak of the Matterhorn at a short distance, it is

seen that its rocks are separated into three great divisions, of which the middle
mass is the largest, and grey in colour, while the upper and lower sections are ap-

parently of a didl red. On ascending the mountain, these divisions are clearly

apparent, and the junctions of the sections are so marked, that it is almost possible
to see the lines of separation. The rocks of the upper and lower divisions, however,
it is found, are by no means uniformly red in colour, but are interspersed with

others of a green and of an iron grey. It is from the red rocks being so much more
positive in tone that they present a uniform tint when seen at a distance.

   The specimens collected comprise fragments from each of these divisions. Those
taken from the highest of the three divisions and from the summit (nuca-slate,
chlorite-slate, and quartz) were detached when collected, but the others were
broken from the living rock. The middle and largest division is found to be com-
posed chiefly of chlorite-slate ; mica-slate, with seams of quartz coloured by oxide

of iron, is found to predominate in the lowest division. Serpentine can be fre-
quently found at the base of the mountain, but I have not observed it on the peak

itself. The summit of the Matterhorn is a roughly level ridge of 350 feet to 400

feet in length. It is extremely precipitous on the south side; but on the side
which descends towards the glacier of Zmutt the inclination is moderate, and it can
be traversed with great facility. There are several little points on this ridge, and

the highest of them is usually covered by a small cone of snow. The whole of the
summit is covered with disintegrated fragments, and the living rock is not any-
where visible.

   It was observed by De Saussure that the beds of the Matterhorn rise towards

the N.E. at an angle of 45°. This is scarcely exact, although correct on the whole.

They dip towards the south and west ; but the inclination towards the west is

three times as great as it is to the south. In consequence of these dips, the plane

surface of the beds presents a surface sloping downwards on the western and

southern sides of the mountain, and the fractured edges overhang. It is

mainly from this cause that so much difficulty has been experienced in alfattempts

to ascend the mountain until this year, and it was from observing this fact that I
formed the resolution to attempt the ascent by the north-western face ; for although
it appeared smooth and unbroken, yet I argued that the fractures would fall in
exactly the reverse manner to those which I have described, and this would render

the ascent easy, even although the hold they might afford should be but small.
The theory was correct, and the whole of the north-eastern face was found, in fact,

to be a long staircase, with the steps shelving inward.

It is also in consequence of these steps that stones do not fall to any extent on

the north-eastern side ; it is evident that if any disintegrated fragments do break
away, they must sooner or later be arrested on the ledges, and, indeed, I did not

see any fall during the two days which I passed on the mountain. On the other

sides, on the contrary, the Matterhorn rains down showers, nay, torrents and

avalanches of stones both by day and night. Thus these dips become on one side

a source of safety, but on all others of great danger.

  We are enabled by a knowledge of these facts to account for the enormous

moraine of the Zmutt glacier, which has attracted the attention and the curiosity

of all observers ; for the Zmutt and its tributary, the Tiefenmatten, sweep around

the two faces of the Matterhorn on which we "should expect the greatest masses

of rock would fall. "We find, moreover, that the Furgge glacier, which is below

the N.E. face, has scarcely any moraine. The consideration of these facts also

suggests naturally that we see nearly the primal form of the Matterhorn on its

WeN.E. side, but that great changes have taken place on the others.                                                                                                                                                                 are sure,

indeed, of this, for we see the fallen fragments below.

We can go a step further. The fallen masses are chiefly of the red rocks, and

they must have either come from the upper or the lower of the three divisions.

On the side of the Zmutt and the Tiefenmatten glaciers, however, the lower divi-
Wesion is almost entirely covered by snow and glacier.

the conclusion that they came from the upper                                                                                                                                                                               and  it  is doing no violence to  the

On the ancient Glaciers North and East of Llangollen, ami more particular!)/

   of the Neighbourhood of the Hope Mountain. By W. Mattieu Williams,

    F.C.S.

   In this paper the author described in detail the evidences upon which he bases
his hypothesis of the existence of a large glacier, formerly occupying the elevated
and irregular district lying between the north and east side of the valley of Llan-
gollen, and the east side and south end of the vale of C'lwj'd, the present water-
shed of the river Alyn. The configuration of the district is peculiarly favourable
for the formation and maintenance of a great glacier, and the remarkable course of

the Alyn is due to this same configuration. On this account Mr. Williams has
named it the " Alyn Glacier." The position of the large accumulations of moraine
matter at the foot of the Hope mountain, in the neighbourhood of Mold, and all
along the course of the Alyn, between Mold and Wrexham, formed the chief data
upon which the extent and position of the glacier were determined. The decided
indications of glacier-planing over the whole of the Hope mountain and the neigh-

bouring hills, all of which are roches moutonnees of greater or lesser magnitude, and
the existence of perched blocks, some of which are sufficiently remarkable to have
become the subjects of popular legends, were pointed out.

   Further and very decisive evidence of the course of the glacier is indicated by
the composition of the boulders of the moraine heaps, and most strikingly by the
boulders of the peculiar curly cannel of the Leeswood and Tryddn district, which
--78 report 1865.

have been found in the drift many miles from their source, and in positions which
they could only attain by ascending a considerable slope of the Hope mountain.

   The sudden termination of the moraine mounds in a wide plain of drift, extend-
ing towards the present estuary of the Dee, and the general uniformity of level at
which this occurs, were pointed out as marking the limit of the sea at the[epoch of
this glacier's greatest extension. Some mounds of drift upon this plain, apparently
formed by the melting of icebergs in shallow water, were described ; and the general
phenomenon of the drift of this district was suggested as well worthy of careful
study, in reference to the debated questions relative to icebergs versus glaciers, and

the limits of their respective operations.

   The paper is preliminary. The author announced his intention of pursuing the
investigations further, especially to the southward and the westward ol the ground

already described.

                        On some Vegetable Deposits in the Aaehensee.

                            By W. Mattietj Williams, F.C.S.

    The Aaehensee, about thirty miles N.E. of Innspruck, is a very clear lake, with
precipitous and richly-wooded banks. At the bottom of this lake the author
observed an extensive deposit of trunks and branches of trees, evidently washed by
storms into the lake. Many of these were standing upright, with roots attached
and partially buried. They had assumed this position from having been washed
down into the lake with some soil or stones still adhering to their roots. It was
inferred from this that the upright position of fossil trees, even when the roots
remained attached, does not necessarily prove that they have grown on the spot

 where they are found.

    On examination of some of this submerged wood, it was found to be very dark
 in colour, and so dense that it sunk rapidly in the water. The annual rings
 separated easily like the layer of an onion, the cambium of each year's growth

 bavin"- apparently decomposed more readily than the rest of the wood. This was
 referred to as affording an explanation of the fact, that fossilized wood shows the
 original structure, even when all the wood has been replaced by mineral matter.
 The spaces between the rings would be first filled up in cases where deposition is
 occurring, and then the wood-rings would afterwards be replaced by further
 deposition as they gradually decomposed, and thus a series of concentric strata be

 formed.

    Mr. Williams stated many reasons for supposing that, at the period of our coal

 formation, the British Isles had the configuration of an exaggerated Norway, a
 rid°e or backbone of mountains, with deep wide inlets or fiords, some inland

 lakes, and many small outlying islands. With such a configuration, and a climate

  favourable for the rapid growth of any form of ponderous vegetation, the trees
  growing on the steep banks of the lakes and brackish fiords or estuaries would be

 continually washed down and settle in these basins, and thus form the coal-seams
 while the water remained clear. The dark-coloured and striped shales and rock of
  the coal-measures would be formed wherever the waters were turbid, and a mixture
  of mineral aud vegetable matter was thus deposited together.

Mr. Henby Woodward described and exhibited specimens of a new Phyllopo-

dous Crustacean from the Moffat shales (Lower Silurian), Dumfriesshire.

These anthracitic shales abound in the remains of Graptolites, but other fossils

are extremely rare. Two Phyllopodous Crustacea have been described from them

by Mr. Salter, namely, Pettocaris aptychoides and P. Ilarktiessi.

The new form closely resembles a Discina, but has a sector of ^th of its arc re-

moved in nearly every specimen, the segment being separated from the rest of the

disk-shaped shield by a line of suture. The shield is slightly conical, and ornamented

Awith fine concentric lines ; there is no dorsal suture as in P. aptychoides.  specimen

The most perfect example measures 7 lines in diameter. The caudal portion

is not preserved. The author proposed for it the generic name of Disanoearis,

         ltanunculus radians (Revel) as a British Plant.

By W. P. Hiern, M.A., Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.

   Ranunculus radians is a new name in British Botany. It undoubtedly grows in
England ; but it must be discussed how far it differs specificalhj from its allies. I
discovered it at Silverdale in North Lancashire on the 16th of June, 1864, .and have

gathered it again this year in the same locality. Ranunculus trichophyUus (Chaix)

seems to me to be most likely to be confused with this plant. The floating leaves
of my plant serve to make a striking difference, inasmuch as Professor Babington

states that Ran. trichophyUus has never been found in Britain with floating leaves.

Moreover the fruit and other parts of the plant present distinguishing characters.

I sowed some seeds of it in my room at college on 15th July last, and I have

already (4th September, 1865) got a floating leaf. I have seen a small portion of

a plant or plants from Belfast gathered this season, somewhat resembling my plant.

myThe following characters of  plant serve to distinguish it from its allies, special

reference being made to Ran. trichojihyllus.
   The fruit has a very convex keel below, and commonly the upper edge is more

or less depressed towards the base and convex near the style : towards the depression

thus formed, the transverse ridges on the achene mostly converge.

The receptacle is spherical, or nearly so.

The floating leaves are radiant, with lobes contiguous and often pedicelled.

The capillary segments of the submerged leaves are rather flaccid.

The stamens number from 15 to 18, generally 17.
The number of veins on the petals is about 7 at the middle, where the yellow

colour ceases (and these subdivide at the margin into about 11).

The petals are contiguous, obovate, widened at the free end, contracted at the claw,

and at least twice the length of the sepals.

   The stem attains the length of from 1 to 2} feet.
   Upon sending a good specimen to Professor Boreau of Angers, I received a

decisive reply. He says, I have no doubt but that the plant which you have done
me the honour to send me belongs to Ran. radians (Revel). The foliage is abso-
lutely the same as in the plant that I possess from the same author ! He also states

that Ran. trichophyUus never has floating leaves, and that when these appear, the

plant belongs to some other species.

In a paper on " the British Species of Batrachian Ranunculi," read before the

Cambridge University Natural Science Society last October, I showed, among
other things, that a convenient artificial method of classifying these plants was

found to consist in exhibiting geometrically the position of each (sub) species,

referred to two axes; the number of stamens which the (sub)species commonly

has being measured in inches or other linear unit along one axis, and the number

of veins on the petals being measured along the other axis. On fixing the loci of

the (sub)species in this manner a remarkable law is observed : five of the most

closely allied (sub)species, i. e. Ran. Drouetii, trichophyUus, Baudotii, confu-sus,

heterophyllus, lie in one straight line ; and the three next (sub)species, i. e. Ran.

peltatus, fluribundus, tripartitus, lie in another straight line which is near the former,

and parallel to it. The parallelism can be shown on mathematical principles to

express close affinity.

  Now on placing the plant which is the subject of this paper after the same
         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.     81

fashion, it is found to lie on the former straight line, intermediate between linn,
trichophyllus and hcterophgllus.

   M. Revel, the author of the species, found the plant to remain constant during;

five successive seasons.

   Whether it is considered as a distinct (sub)species, or as a variety of Ran. tricho-
phyllus, I thought a notice of the plant would be interesting.

   The paper was accompanied by several specimens and a drawing of the plant.

plants, must have often been at a loss to determine the exact nature of the various-
sized granular objects which meet the eye. These granules abound in nearly all
vegetable tissues, and vary in size from those of Canna eclulis (or Tous-lcs-mois
starch-granules), the largest known, to the vanishing-point of sight with high

powers.
   During several years of close examination of vegetable tissue, the author has

endeavoured as far as expedient to divide these definable granular bodies into starch
and chlorophylle granules, but the extreme resemblance in a vast number of in-
stances between them, while it has been sometimes a source of perplexity, led to

his examination of them with the view to determine how far these bodies were

identical in their nature and origin. After a series of experiments and investiga-
tions, he arrived at the conclusion that these two series of granules must be con-
sidered fundamentally the same, one series being merely coloured or chlorized.

   The grounds on which this conclusion has been arrived at may be thus epitomized.

    Chlorized and unchlorized starches are found in the same organ in simple obedi-

ence to situation with respect to light. This is seen in the stem of the common

and mature geranium. 1 he granules are here found of the same size and form.

   The same fact is seen in the case of the common potato tuber. Below the soil,

all the granules are colourless ; but, exposed for even a short period to light, the
granules begin at once to become chlorized at the surface.

   Even when detached from the plant and placed in a warm atmosphere with free

exposure to light, this process of chlorization goes on rapidly. In the paper, of

which this is a very short abstract, it is shown how this effect can be produced at

will, and by covering over some parts of tubers, and leaving other parts exposed to

light, chlorization printing in letter or ornament and in the negative may be pro-

duced. In the author's paper the subject of tests and reactions in reference to starch
and chlorophylle granules is examined, together with the chemical features of the

matter.

   The solubility of chlorophylle colouring-matter is also considered, and the reason

why ordinary chlorophylle granules are not sufficiently perfect to exhibit iodic re-

action ; in this respect, indeed, resembling the acknowledged starches which are found
in such fruits as cucumber, and Such roots as turnip and carrot, the starches in
which will seldom show the proper iodic reaction.

   The author concludes that unchlorized starch-granules will never be produced in
the light, for immediately they acquire form and consistence, they become chlorized.

    Also that chlorization will take place in dead, and therefore vitally quiescent

granules, when under certain conditions they are exposed to light, and that there-

fore chlorization is a chemical, or at any rate not a vital process, as heretofore

considered.

    The almost universal green of nature is amylaceous, and can supply fuel, at least
in the matter of food, to animals. Partly or wholly decolorized to the ordinary
observer, as in shrivelled or dry grass as hay, the same amylaceous principle is yet
present. The nutritive properties of hay which can support, of itself, animal life,
cannot depend on the tissues alone, or on the fruits, which in the minor grasses
are insignificant. On the other hand, amylaceous matters are known to be intensely
nutritive, and those parts of plants in which this principle is concentrated are
nutritive in proportion to the amount of that concentration.

                       On a Monstrosity of the Rose.

By Dr. W. Hinds, Professor of Botany, Queen's College, BirmingJuim.

   The specimen introduced serves to illustrate the teratology of the tribe to which
the rose belongs. It may or may not be ruiique, but it is at any rate one of the

most rare transformations. Cases of the conversion of sepals into ordinary leaves

are common enough, and are depicted by Balfour, Lindley, Bentley, and others. In

the apetalous apple we have the petals transformed into sepals, or rather the required
petals have developed merely as sepals. In the cultivated rose we have stamens

merely developing as petals, and the carpels are imperfectly seen, or are converted
Weinto stamens, as described by Bentley.
                                           have thus a complete series of trans-

formations, with two exceptions. Of these, the first is supplied by the rose depicted
in the 'Gardeners' Chronicle,' in which a branch (leaf-bud) and leaves have developed
in the centre. The second, which completes the series, is now supplied in the shape

of &Jloiver bud and peduncle developed in the centre of the primary flower, instead
of carpels. It seems to show that nature being interfered with has made a second

effort to accomplish its ends.

   At first sight this may appear to be one of the highest transformations, but a little

consideration will probably show it to be one of the lowest. There is one lower,

namely the ^/-branch.

    On the Relations of the Southern to the Northern Flora of New Zealand.
                    By "W. Lauder Lindsay, M.D., F.R.S. fflin.

   The NoHh Island flora has hitherto been regarded, in the absence of an equally full

knowledge of the South island flora, as correctly representing the general vegetation

of our New Zealand possessions. But the New Zealand islands extend through 13

degrees of latitude, and the floras of their northern and southern extremes neces-
sarily present various marked differences. The former flora is more tropical, and
the latter more antarctic in its affinities. The former, moreover, is richer in natural
orders, genera, and species.

   Until very recently, however, comparatively little was known of the Otago flora,
all collections previous to 1861 having been made on its coasts, and, with a single

limited exception, on its western coast. In 1861, the author botanically examined

--the vicinity of Dunedin, and the settled districts between that capital and the

Clutha river all on the eastern seaboard of the province. The immediate fruits of
this examination included (in the department of Phamoganis and Ferns alone) out
of a total of 235 species :

   A. 5 species new to science, or 2T2 per cent, of the whole.

            3 not previously foimd in New Zealand or elsewhere.
            2 previously found in certain other parts of New Zealand.
    . 6 species not previously found in New Zealand, or 2T2 per cent.

       3 Tasmanian.

       1 a native of Tasmania, Britain, and various temperate regions.

   C. 22 species not previously found in Otago, or 936 per cent, of the whole, many

of them previously supposed to be confined in their geographical range in New

Zealand to the North Island.

NewD. 30 species rare in Otago or     Zealand, or otherwise exhibiting peculiarities

of geographical distribution; or 12-76 per cent, of whole.

E. 25  species British, and indigenous in  Otago                                or 10-63 per cent,  of  the whole.

       Of these, 10 species, or 40 per cent., are aquatics or semi-aquatics.

In addition to these, and to the total of 235 species, there were 27 species of

British plants Naturalized in Otago.

    Since 1862, the interior of Otago has been explored by the Government Geologi-
cal Survey, and the collections made by the botanist attached thereto have largely
added to our knowledge of the flora, more especially of its Alps and great lake

basins.

   The author's main object in this memoir, which is confined to the departments

--of Phcenogams and Ferns, is taking Otago as the type of the South, and Auckland of
--the North, Island to institute a comparison between the floras of these respective

provinces or islands.

                      By Spence Bate and Professor Westwood.

    After giving the history of this peculiar genus, the authors, while admitting the
ability and general correctness of the recent researches of Mr. Hope, disputed his

right to give the name of Praniza, which had been previously used as that of an adult
animal, as belonging to a larval or young form only. They considered that to
Mr. Hope belong the merit of having demonstrated that Praniza was the adult
female of Anceus, but they differed from him in believing that the male Anceus ever
was a Praniza, and showed that the two sexes passed through separate forms until
each arrived at the adult stage ; after which period they lose their parasitical cha-
racter. That this change of condition is coeval with important structural alte-
rations, by which both males and females lose their oral apparatus, together with
stomach and alimentary canal. The mandibles in the male become large prehen-

sile organs.

          Zoological Nomenclature. By P. P. Carpenter, B.A., Ph.D.

  When generic names have come into almost universal use, and are good in them-

selves, it would save great confusion to allow them to remain. As in property, a
certain number of years' undisputed possession might be regarded as a right. It is
hard to give up such because it is discovered that an obscure writer badly named
an ill-defined group a short time in advance. The new (so-called old) name might
itself have to be displaced when some other antiquary had unhappily disinterred
some older and worse book which had been fortunately forgotten. Surely use ia

the most complete publication.

Notes on the Voracity of Chiasmodus. By Dr. Carte.

   Dr. E. Perceval Wright exhibited for Dr. Carte a specimen of Chiasmodus niger,

Johnson, which had b?en sent to the Museum of the Royal Dublin Society by

MCapt. Sir Leopold L Cliutock, R.N. The fish had been found by Dr. Imery floating

on the surface of the sea near Barbadoes, with a species of the genus Scojjelas in
its stomach. The swallowed fish was nearly twice the size of the swallower, and

the tegumentary covering of the abdomen of the latter was stretched as thin as

Agoldbeater's leaf.  drawing of the specimen by Mr. N. Walsh of Dublin was also

exhibited, showing the position of the Scopelus in the abdomen of the Chiasmodus.

On the Relative Weight of the Brain, and on the External Form of this Ore/an,

    in relation to the Intelligence of the Animal. By Edwards Cri.sp, M.D.

   Dr. Crisp illustrated his paper with 126 casts in wax and plaster-of-paris of the
brains of different species of animals taken by himself; among these, were the

casts of the brain of the Chimpanzee, Orang, Gorilla, and of two species of Gibbon,

and the cast of the brain of the Irish Elk (Megaceros Iiibernicus), made by filling
the skulls with plaster-of-paris ; but many of the casts were from the brains
themselves. The author thought that much error prevailed respecting the belief
that the amount of intelligence corresponded to that of the number of the convo-
lutions; he found that some animals with but few or no convolutions, as the
Marmot, Rat, and man}' species of birds, had a large amount of intelligence
whilst many others, as the Ruminants, with abundant convolutions, were com-
paratively deficient in intelligence. The paper was further illustrated by a Table of
226 different species of animals, the bodies and brains of which (witli a few ex-
ceptions as regards the body) were weighed by the author. As was well known,
the brain of man averaged about 48 ozs. in weight, that of a woman 4 or 5 ozs. less,

forming a proportion of about «^ to jV °f tae body ; but on looking over the Table,

a great many animals among the Quadrumana, Rodentia, and Ave3 had relatively

larger brains than man, but then it should be remembered that the brain in small
animals, like most of the organs, was proportionately large.

  --The weights of the brains of a few animals dissected and weighed by the author,

were as follows : Young Chimpanzee (S. troglodytes), body 19| lbs., "brain 12 ozs.

    In the bodies of the larger animals ounces and grains are omitted.

   From this, the first part of the paper, the author drew the following con-

clusions :

   1. That the external form of the brain alone in most animals is to a great

extent an indication of the comparative amount of intelligence ; but to this rule
there are many exceptions, as in the examples of the Elephant, Dog, Seal, Hat,
Marmot, and many birds.

   2. That the same inference may be drawn from the covered or uncovered state

of the cerebellum, as instanced by the last-named vertebrates.
   8. That the number and figure of the convolutions are to some extent tolerable

indications of the amount of intelligence in Mammals: but to this rule there are
also many exceptions, as exemplified by a comparison of the brains of the Bats,
Capybara, Eats, Mice, Monotremes, and many others.

    4. That, looking to the weight of the brain and of the body in the 226 animals
enumerated in the Table, and carefully selecting aninials of the same class and size,

it is evident that the most intelligent mammals and birds have the largest brains,

and that there is no example of an animal with a relatively small brain that pos-
sesses a great amount of intelligence.

   As the views of the author may be misunderstood in the above abstract the fol-

lowing from the paper is added :

   " As regards the number of the convolutions in relation to the amount of intelli-
gence, I believe that much error prevails upon this subject. As is well known, the

brains of Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes are without convolutions, and so with the

brains of many Mammals. If we look to the ascending scale of Mammals, be-
ginning with the 3Ionotrema(a and Marsupialia, we find some of these with a

greater abundance of convolutions than in the higher divisions ; thus the Bats

have smooth brains, and so have most of the Rodents ; many of the latter, the

Mouse, Rat, Beaver, and Marmot, possessing a great amount (comparatively) of
intelligence, whilst the Capybara, an animal with several cerebral convolutions,
is apparently one of the most stupid of the class. The brains of the Edentata are
smooth, whilst many of those of the Marsupiata are convoluted to a certain ex-
tent. Again, the Carnaria, Ruminantia, and Paehydermata are abundantly sup-
plied with convolutions, but many animals in these divisions are very delicient in
intelligence and docility."

       On the Food and Habits of the Mole, Sparrow, and of the Vcspidcc.
                                By Edwards Crisp, M.D.

   For many years the author has been endeavouring to ascertain, by numerous

examinations, the nature of the food of the mole and of the sparrow, and his
examinations at various seasons have been so numerous, amounting to a thousand

at least, of each of these animals, that he spoke with confidence respecting the
correctness of his conclusions. The mole can scarcely be called an insectivorous

feeder, for its food consists almost entirely of the common earth-worm. He had

never met with a wire-worm in the stomach of any mole that he had examined.
The sparrow is almost exclusively granivorous, and obtains insects chiefly for its
young; but these, when compared to the quantity of grain consumed, are very
limited. Of the dried gizzards of 100 young sparrows which were exhibited, it
was seen that but few contained insects.

   Hornets aud wasps do a vast deal of good by destroying insects in all stages of de-
velopment, as the author had an opportunity of seeing when he had kept the grubs

and perfect hornets under large bell-glasses. He had, moreover, had an oppor-

tunity of watching hornets through a crevice in the door of a pigeon's locker, in
which a nest was constructed, and the quantity of insect food consumed by these
generally despised robbers was immense. Tables of the examinations of moles
and sparrows at various seasons accompanied this paper.

On the External Form of the Hand and Brain of the Orang (S. satyrus).
                            By Edwards Crisp, M.D.

The injected brain of an Orang and the hand of an animal of the same species",

formerly belonging to the Linnean Society, and believed by the author to be the

largest ever seen, were exhibited by way of contrast with the same organs in man.
The measurements of the Orang's hand were as follows :--

From the carpal joint to the longest finger 11 inches; across the palm 2 inches

ith ; the metacarpus 4 inches ; the middle ringer 5 inches ; the thumb 2 inches -^th ;
from the root of the thumb to the point of the index finger 9 inches.

By these measurements, it will be seen that the hand of this ape is longer by about

4 inches than the human hand, and about 1 inch longer than that of the largest

Gorilla. In a large Orang, in the possession of the author, the measurement from

the tip of each finger, when the arms are extended, is 7 feet 11 inches, and the
same measurement in the animal in question must have been of much greater ex-
tent, exceeding that of any human giant.

   The brain of the Orang, when compared with that of man, presents many im-

portant deviations, not only as regards size, but especially in the direction of the

medulla oblongata, an important feature that has been apparently overlooked. In

the brain exhibited, as in Dr.'Rolleston's specimen, the cerebellum is not wholly

covered by the  cerebrum                                               and the same is the case in  the  brains of two Gibbons,
                                                                    ;

casts of which were exhibited ; but in the twenty-eight casts of the brains of

various Quadrumana the cerebellum was in nearly all covered by the cerebrum.

The difference in the number and figure of the convolutions, the want of lateral

and anterior cerebral development, and the more vertical direction of the fissure of

Sylvius Jiave been pointed out by different observers. Another very important

matter Dr. Crisp believed had been overlooked by all writers on this subject. As seen

by the brains of foetal monkeys, and monkeys at birth, which were shown to the

Section, it will be noted that the brain at this period is much larger than in the

human foetus and child at birth ; but it must be remembered that the apes and
monkeys, unlike the child, and like many of the inferior animals, are able to take

care of themselves, to a great extent, as soon as they are bom, and at once

evince a great amount of activity. The author controverted Professor Huxley's

statement in his Lectures at the Royal College of Surgeons, " that there was less

difference beticeen man and the anthropoid apes than between these and the lower

Quadrumema." The existence of a penis-bone in these apes, the author held, was

alone sufficient to disprove this conclusion ; he hoped hereafter to adduce abundant

additional evidence against this inference.

 Notes on the Development of a Deep Sen Sponge. By W. R. Hughes, F.L.S.

   The specimens, six in number, and each about the size of a large pin's head,
were dredged in the neighbourhood of Torquay, in the month of July 1863, and
were afterwards placed in an ordinary aquarium, consisting of a large round glass
pan, having a bottom of three inches of sand, and holding about a gallon and a
half of water. The aquarium was placed in a N.E. aspect, and the stones and
shells in it were well covered with confervoid growth. The sea-water in the vessel
was never changed, but fresh water was occasionally supplied to compensate for
evaporation ; it was always pine and limpid as crystal. The specimens continued to
develope, and by the month of December 1864 had each attained the size of a large
pea, and about this time two, which were originally half an inch apart, coalesced

and further continued to develope. By an accident, in the month of February
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                          87

last, a portion of this particular sponge was lacerated and partially detached from
the shell on which it was located. The injury was gradually repaired, and in six
weeks afterwards the sponge was as firmly coherent and attached as before the
accident. The inhalent and exhalent processes went on chiefly at night, or when

the aquarium was darkened. Dr. Bowerbank, to whom some of the other speci-

mens were sent for identification, pronounced them to he Halichondria suberea

(Johnston), Hymeniacidon suberea (Bowerbank), and stated that "he had never
known this species to develope itself in a vivarium before, its usual locality beinf
on shells, &c, seven to ten fathoms deep, and he had only once found it between
tide marks at Tenby.*' In the month of July last (two 'years after being taken)
the sponge had attained the size of a bean, but died about this time, apparently
from the effects of excessive confervoid growth, which prevented the free action o'f

the oscula and pores. These facts are recorded as an evidence of the great practical

value of the marine aquarium as an instrument for the study of similar phenomena

connected with marine zoologO-Jv.'

Mr. W. R. Hughes, F.L.S., exhibited in an aquarium specimens of Lepidoyaster

bimaculatus and L. cornubiensis. The first named is one of the smallest of British

fishes, and one of the most attractive tenants of the aquarium. It is somewhat

tadpole-shaped, does not exceed two inches in length, the colour is a delicate pink

slightly speckled, but is subject to great change, dependent perhaps on the passions.

The eyes are of a beautiful colour, not unlike (if such can be supposed) living

opals set in an areola of burnished gold ; and they probably have double vision, in

consequence of the optic nerves simply crossing in tbeir transit to the brain without

Aany commissural communication.  curious feature and distinctive'character of

the genus is that they have the power of attaching themselves and firmly adhering

to stones and old shells at the bottom of the sea, by means of a sucker composed

of the union of the pectoral and ventral fins, and consisting of two cartilaginous

plates surrounded by a fringe. The movement of this sucker is effected by largely-

developed muscles springing from the vertebral chain.

   After pointing out the features which characterize the lower jaw in mammals

on the one side, and oviparous animals (birds, reptiles, and fishes) on the other,
showing that in the former it invariably consists of one bone only, or one on each

side, whereas in the ovipara there are three or more bones on each side, Dr. Hum-

phry indicated that these differences have relation to the functions performed by
the jaw in the respective classes. In ovipara, fishes especially, the oifices of the
jaws are chiefly confined to swallowing, which is commonly done with a gulp,
without any previous division or mastication of the food, and every facility for
swallowing is afforded by subdivision of the bones and the widening the pharynx.
In mammals, the jaws being employed in seizing, holding, tearing, as well as swal-
lowing food, they are, for the purpose of greater strength, consolidated into one
bone, which is firmly connected with the skull. The uniformity of this plan, in
spite of certain departures in particular animals from the general functions thus
assigned to the j aws, was adduced by the author as an illustration of the important
principle in zoology that, though the construction of a part in any class is deter-
mined by the general ftmction of the part in that class, yet the same plan of con-
struction is found even in those members of the class in which the function is

different.

   Dr. Humphry then pointed out that, though the mammalian jaw consists of one

--bone only on each side, yet it presents certain distinct] and prominent parts

the dentary, the angular, the coronoid, and the condyloid or articular parts
which obviously correspond with the separate bones bearing those names in
ovipara, adding that if the dentary, the angular, and the coronoid parts of the one
be regarded as homologous with the dentary, the angvMir, and the coronoid bones of
the other, there is the strongest ground for believino- that the articidar part of the

mammal is also homologous with the articular lone of fj>e bird, the reptile, and
--88 report 1865.

--the fish at any rate, that very strong reasons ought to be given before we are

called upon to renounce that which, upon the face of it, is so probable.
   The squamous part of the temporal bone to which the lower jaw is, directly or

indirectly, invariably attached, is in mammals always composed of one bone, and

developed from one centre, like the lower jaw ; and like it, it consists of certain

--well-marked parts a glenoid part, a squamous part, and a zygomatic part.

Dr. Humphry believes that as in the lower jaw the component parts of the mam-

malian bone correspond with the several bones of the ovipara, so, in the temporal
bone, the component parts of the mammalian squamous correspond with the
separate bones of this region in ovipara ; that is to say, the " glenoid " corresponds
with, oris homologous with, the "quadrate," the "zygomatic" with the " qua-

drato-jugal," and the "squamous" proper with the " squamosal."
   By Cuvier, and most subsequent anatomists, including Owen, the quadrate has

been regarded as the representative of the tympanic. In controverting this view,

Dr. Humphry showed that neither in position, in function, nor in development,

does the quadrate correspond with the tympanic. The tympanic bone is simply a

part of the auditory organ, having no relation whatever with the masticatory

apparatus. In the descending series of animals we find that the auditory organ

becomes simplified, part after part disappearing, till, in the fish, a membranous

labyrinth alone remains. And it is far more probable that the tympanic bone

shares this failure, and dwindles or disappears, than that it becomes magnified and

subservient to a totally different purpose. "We are, moreover, prepared for its

disappearance in the inferior classes by the very great varieties which it undergoes

in mammals, which were pointed out in considerable detail. It was shown, as the
result of dissection, that the quadrate does not commonly sustain the tympanic

membrane, and that in many reptiles this function is performed by a distinct ring

of bone resembling the tympanic bone of the mammalian foetus ; and this ring,

and not the quadrate, is really the representative of the tympanic bone.

   Dr. Humphry next proceeded to examine the view propounded by Vogt, and

-- --adopted by Huxley, that certain of the ossicula auditus the malleus and incus

are, in ovipara, modified and magnified so as to form part of the mandibular

pedicle, in short, that the malleus becomes the articular segment of the jaw, and

the incus becomes the quadrate. Such a transposition of parts, topographical as

well as functional, as is implied by this view is not, the author believes, in accord-

ance with the laws of development and morphology. Each organ, he observed,

throughout the animal world, is made to bear its own burden, and by the develop-

mental forces of its own parts furnishes the structures necessary to fulfil the re-

quirements made of it in the different members of the animal series. The com-

ponents of  the  eye are not transformed to  the accommodation  of  the  ear                   neither
                                                                                            ;

can we think that the bones of the ear are transformed to the accommodation of

the mouth.

The arguments in favour of the view referred to are founded chiefly upon deve-

lopment and the relations of the parts concerned to Meckel's cartilage ; and Profes-

sor Huxley has laid much stress upon these relations in the pike. But Dr. Hum-

phry maintained that, even in the pike, the articular bone of the jaw is, like the

dentary bone, developed, not in and around Meckel's cartilage, but on its outer side,

and is easily stripped off from it. Any homological inferences, therefore, deduciblo

from this relation apply to the dentary bone as strongly as to the articular bone.

Dr. Humphry further showed, by the same kind of reasoning as in the case of

the tympanic bone, that the varying conditions of the auditory ossicles in mammals,

the coalescence of the malleus with the tympanic in certain cetaceans and in mo-

notremes, together with the small size or absence of the incus in the latter animals,

prepare us for the disappearance of those bones in the simpler auditory organ of

ovipara. He combated the idea that the development of the quadrate in cartilage

is any sufficient reason for regarding it as the representative of the incus, believing

that the mode of development of a bone in cartilage, or from membrane, is not to
be laid much stress upon as a matter of homological significance.

The careful consideration of the matter from a development, as well as from a

topographical and functional point of view, convinced him that we must not suppose

either the tympanic bone or any of the auditory ossicles to be represented by the
                                                                                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                     89

quadrate ; but that it is far more probable that a subdivision of the temporal takes
place, corresponding with the subdivision of the lower jaw, and of certain other
tones in ovipara, and that the glenoid part is represented by the quadrate, and the
zygomatic part by the quadrat ojugal. This view is, moreover, in accordance with
the relations of muscles and nerves to the respective parts, and with the position
of the quadrate and the glenoid.

On the Transformations of Chlocon (Ephemera) dimidiatum.

    By Sir John Lubbock, Bart.,F R.H., V.P. Linn.Soc.

The author commenced by observing that Chloeon dimidiatum, the subject of his

aper, belongs to a group of insects (the Ephemeridae), which has become a house-

i:lold word among us, as the type of a short life. The idea holds good, however,

only if we consider exclusively the life of the animal in                          its                            perfect condition                                                                                                  but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

if we regard the whole duration of life from the time of leaving the egg- until the

moment of death, it is by no means so appropriate.

The larva, in the earliest stage observed by the author, is a minute, transparent,

active creature, with a large head, a tapering abdomen, and two long- caudal appen-

dages. It spends about a year in the water, during which time it increases in size,

and alters considerably in appearance. These changes, however, are produced quite

gradually, the insect going through about twenty changes of form, each accompanied

by a change of skin.

The antennae increase in length and in the number of segments at each moult,

and it is remarkable that this increase is not produced by a growth of the en (ire

organ, but by a rapid development and division of the third segment, counting

from the base. In the first stage the larva has no respiratory organs, either exter-

nal or internal. After the first change of skin, however, the posterior angles of

several abdominal segments become elongated, and after one or two more moults,

these elongations have taken the form of the gills, or branchiae, characteristic of

the species. At the same time, the tracheae make their appearance, i^o far as the

author is aware, no other insect has yet been observed which is entirely destitute

of trachea?. After the first one or two moults, a minute knob appears between the

two caudal appendages, and with each moult this knob increases in length, so that

the larva which had originally two tails, finally possesses three.

After about eight moults have taken place, it maybe observed that the posterior

mesothoracic angles are slightly elongated. At each change of skin, these, the first

rudiments of the wings, become more and more apparent, and in the last aematic

stage these rudimentary wing-cases cover the first two or three abdominal segments.

The external sexual differences commence to manifest themselves at the eigh-

teenth stage. They consist principally of the rudiments of the pillared eyes, and

of the processes on the under side of the penultimate abdominal segment, both of

which are characteristic of the male sex.

The author then described the manner in which the larva quits the water, a pro-

cess which does not occupy more than ten seconds. It is well known that the

ephemeras pass through one more moult after acquiring their wings and leaving the

water. The author described the principal differences between the pro-imago and

the imago, or perfect insect, and concluded by some general observations on the

subject of insect metamorphoses, laying special stress on the fact that, as was shown

in this paper, the changes in the larva are not all in the direction, so to say, of the

perfect form. Thus, for instance, the young larva has two tails; a third is gradu-

ally developed                                                                     but again the perfect insect has only the original two.
                                                                                ;

If we bear this in mind, and remember that external circumstances continually

act upon the larva?, that the form and characters of the larva have special reference

to its own habits and conditions of life, we shall throw some light on the otherwise

inexplicable fact that in some cases insects and other animals which agree very closely

in their perfect condition have larva? which differ a good deal from one another.

                   On the Characteristics of the South Sclavonic Race.

                         By Miss Iebt and Miss Mackenzie.

   The writers of the paper contrasted the Sclavonic characteristics with those of
the Greeks on the one hand, and the Germans on the other. The Greeks were
ambitious and irritable ; the Bulgarians were contented and not easily roused to
anger. The Greek was subtle : while the Bulgarian was strong in common sense
and perseverance. The Bulgarians were especially devoted to the cultivation of
the soil, especially in Servia, where they carried on a great part of the agriculture.
They possessed a'great respect for truth, of which the Greeks were entirely defi-
cient. The poetry of the Sclaves was very picturesque, but it lacked much of the
great merit of that of the Germans. In art they were not altogether deticieut,
but the condition of the people precluded that cultivation of the tine arts which
might otherwise have developed the tastes they undoubtedly possess.

         MOn the Turdus niigratorius. By the Rev. A. ~W. cKat.

   This paper gave a minute description of the Red-breasted Thrush of North
America, pointing out several particulars in which it resembled the thrushes of

this country. It is a bird about the size of the common blackbird ; the head, back,

and wino-s being black in colour, and the breast and belly red, inclining to white
about the region of the vent. Its note sometimes resembles that of the blackbird,

especially when the bird is startled. Its song-note is much like that of the musical
thrush of this country. The most remarkable peculiarity is in the colours of the
plumage of the voting bird, which is spotted like the permanent coat of the thrush
At the first moulting-season this plumage is cast oft', and the ordinary red and
black assumed. The bud is a universal favourite, for its familiar habits and the

beauty of its song.

           On the Arctic Highlanders. By C. R. Maekham, F.B.G.S.

   The author said the people were found in latitude 76° and 79°, on the verge of
the unknown polar region. The waters were crowded with seals, walrusses, and
whales, and great quantities of small fish. Here they might expect to find man
existing; and there were actually about 140,000 souls scattered along the coast, of
Asiatic aspect, as far as the outer man was concerned. They had no canoes, nor
had thev bows and arrows, but their sledges were superior to those of the Esqui-
maux. The hunting-season enabled them to accumulate large stores for winter use,
but sometimes those failed them, and great hardships had to be suffered in hunting
in January and February, and frequently they were reduced to eating their dogs.
Thev, in common with the natives generally of that part of the world, had a won-
derful talent for topography ; they were very fond of liberty, possessed great powers

of endurance, and were very brave. He thought they had been derived originally

from the frontiers of Siberia.

                        On Phosphorescence, Storms, ami Disease.
                    By J. Moffat, M.D., F.R.A.S., F.G.S., &c.

   The results given' in this paper were deduced from observations extending over
a period of four years. It was asserted that phosphorus was luminous under the
conditions of the* south or equatorial current of the atmosphere, and non-luminous
under the north or polar current ; that it becomes luminous on the approach of
storms, and that it becomes luminous, or, if luminous, it becomes more brilliant
at the time that cautionary telegrams are sent out to give warning of approaching
storms. The author believes that ozone is produced when phosphorus is luminous,
and that there is a connexion between luminous and ozone periods, and non-lumi-
nous and no ozone periods. The commencement of these periods, and the approach
of storms were stated to be accompanied by diseases of the nervous and vascular
systems. Storms, however, are useful in a sanitary sense, as thev ventilate fever
nests and cholera localities. Dr. Moffat considers phosphorus an effective disinfect-
ant, as a producer of ozone, and has used it as such for four years.

            On the Scope of Conchological Inquiries. By Dr. Morch.

   1. The three continents, viz., 1. Europe and Africa ; 2. North and South America
3. Asia and Australia, owe their configuration to a definite plan, which can be traced

in very old geological periods.

   2. These continents represent three different formations, geologically speaking.
   3. The old world is inhabited by the higher forms of each natural division,

whilst the lower are found in the new world; e. g. the Quadrumana of the old
world are higher in organization than those of the new world. The lowest mam-

malia are characteristic of Australia.
   4. America is an island in the Atlantic Ocean, being in zoological respects limited

by the abyss between the Gallopagos and Sandwich Islands.
   5. The limits of marine fauna? depend chiefly on climate.
   6. Most species of one fauna have some characters in common, e. g. colour, sculp-

ture, &c*

   7. Each fauna contains analogous species.
   8. The lingual dentition is of the. greatest importance in deciding whether the
specific differences of univalve shells have arisen from external influences, such as
saltness or depth of water, or originally existed.

              On the Classificatiom of the MoUusca. By Dr. Morch.

   1. The primary divisions of subkingdoms among animals cannot be founded on
the locomotive organs, as proved in the case of Pinnipedia and Cetacea among

Vertebrata.

   2. Lungs and gills indicate only relative superiority and inferiority, but not the

limits of systematic divisions.

   3. The presence of respiratory organs depends only on the thickness of the skin
or other protective coverings impermeable by oxygen.

   4. The development of gills is dependent on the extent of the area impermeable
by oxygen.

   5. The form and size of the renal organ correspond with those of the gills.
   6. According to the number of the auricles of the heart, the Mollusca are divided
into two groups,Monotocardia and Diotocardia, analogous toThermalia and Sicremia
among Vertebrata. The former division has a copulatorj' organ, which is wanting

in the latter.

   7. Gasteropoda with a retractile male organ are androgynous.
   8. Gasteropoda with an external but not retractile male organ are bisexual, with
the exception perhaps of Valvata, according to Moquin Tandon.
   9. The development of a male organ indicates relative superiority of the nervous
system.

   10. Great fertility indicates want of intelligence to provide for offspring.

          On the Zoological Affinities of the Mollusca. By Dr. Morch.

   1. Kadiata, in the sense of Cuvier, cannot be considered a natural division, bein°-
founded only on external form.

   2. The Acalepha3 have, in respect of external form, the same relation to the
Acephala as the Cephalopoda to Gasteropoda ; and they have, in respect of the
gastro-vascular system, the same relation to Acephala as the Phlebenterata to Gas-

teropoda.

   3. The division of Entozoa is artificial like that of the Infusoria, being founded

only on characters dependent on their habits.
   4. The Platyhelmia have the same relation to Pellibranchiata as Linguatulfe to

the Acari.

   5. The locomotion of the Pellibranchiata is performed by the hind part of the

mantle, the true foot being rudimentary only.

 Remarks on some Improved Methods of Displaying Birds in Public Museums,

    illustrated by specimens from the Derby Museum at Liverpool. By Teoiias

    J. Moore.
    The author suggested that groups of birds should be so arranged that the male

 might be seen at a glance, thus conveying to the non-scientific spectator an amount
 of knowledge that no collection of isolated specimens could convey.

   On a remarkable Discovery of Bones o/Didus in the Island of Rodriguez.
By Edward Newton, M.A., C.M.Z.S., Acting Auditor-General at Mauritius.

    In November 1864, the author, in company with some other gentlemen, visited
Rodriguez, and in a cave on the south side of the island (see 'Ibis,' 18G5, p. 152)
three bones of a species of Didus were found. These have been described and

figured in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society' for 1865 (p. 199, pi. 8).
Encouraged by this discovery, the author, after his return to Mauritius, requested a
friend at Rodriguez to continue the researches, from which want of time had com-

pelled him to desist. The result is contained in the following extract from a letter
dated " Mauritius, 3rd August, 1865," and communicated by him to the Section.

-- --" Two days ago I received from Mr. George Jenner, the Magistrate of Rodriguez,
   to whom lie all honour a box containing Turtles' and Birds' bones. With plea-

sure I divided them, and found that of the latter there are remains of no less than
sixteen or seventeen individuals ! They are all apparently of one species, but of two
sizes, the difference in this respect being probably owing to sex. The most plentiful
bones are tibiae, of which there are two or three quite perfect, the antero-proximal
ends beinp: well preserved. There are also several very good femora and metatarsi,
three portions of pelves (showing most conclusively that they did not belong to a
Struthious bird), one anterior end of a coracoid (showing the same), several humeri
of both sizes, an ulna and two radii, and a phalanx of the middle toe. Of these I
believe that the upper end of the tibia, the portions of the pelvis and of the cora-
coid, the ulna, radius, and phalanx are bones which have not before been found,
and are therefore doubly valuable. I retain here a couple of perfect legs of the two

sizes for our Museum, but the rest I am sending home by this mail. It will be seen
that there is one tibia which is much longer than any of the others ; it is not a per-

fect one, but there is such a strong resemblance between them all that I feel sure
they are but of one species. On reading over Mr. Bartlett's paper in the ' Proceed-
ings of the Zoological Society ' for 1851 (p. 284), I must say that I do not think he
shows any good reason for supposing that the true Dodo ever existed in Rodriguez,
or that remains of more than one species have been found in that island, and, now

that I have examined these bones, I am still more convinced of the fact.
   " I am wilting to Mr. Jenner to beg him to look out for some of the smaller

bones, which I feel certain must exist, and with any luck I think we ought to get

a perfect skeleton some day."

On the Birth of a young Hippopotamus in the Zoological Society's Gardens at

             Amsterdam. By P. L. Sclater, M.A., ±h.D., F.B.S.

The author remarked that throe pairs of tliis huge animal were now living in

different Zoological Gardens of Europe, viz. in thoseof London, Paris, and Amster-

dam. Though the female in the Gardens in London had often shown signs of

breeding, and attempts at copulation had been made by the male, it was not be-

lieved that conception had ever occurred. In the case of both other pairs, repro-

duction had already taken                                        place on  several occasions                                                                  but the new-born babe  had
                                                                                                                                                           ;

always perished, either from the violence of its parent immediately after its birth,

or from incapacity to take food when removed from its mother. The first success-

ful instance of the reproduction of the Hippopotamus ill Europe was therefore that

which took place at Amsterdam on 29th July last, for the details of which Mr.

Sclater was indebted to the well-known director of the Zoological Gardens in that

city, Mr. G. F. Westerman. Copulation in the present instance had occurred on

the Oth and 7th of December, 1864, so that the period of gestation was estimated

at 234 days, which had been likewise confirmed in the previous cases of reproduc-

tion in the same pair of animals. As soon as the birth took place the little animal

was removed from the mother, not without some difficulty, as the mother was

alread}' on her legs to defend it, and transferred to a separate* house previously pre-

pared for its reception. Here it is now thriving well and growing fast every day,

taking every day six or seven meals, about 2^ gallons of milk mixed with one-fifth

part of water.

On the Occurrence of Orcynus alalonga on the Coast of Devon.

                         By Dr. W. It. Scott.

The Orcynus alalonga has but rarely been seen in British seas; one is recorded as

having been taken at Portland, two in Mounts Bay in Cornwall, and this, another

specimen, was captured on the coast of Devon, August 20th, 1805.

The full length of this fish from the nose to the base of the caudal fin was 24

inches ; the girth round the pectoral fin 19 inches, and the girth immediately before

the second dorsal 15| inches ; the flesh in this part being very firm and solid. The

head was pointed, the under jaw slightly the longest, the teeth small and incurved,

and the gape about 4 inches ; the nostrils very obscure ; the eye large and slightly

elevated and placed over the angle of the mouth. The sections of'the gill-covers

were well defined, and from the nose to the gill opening was 7 inches. The pectoral

fin, lodged in a deep depression, was 8| inches long- and reached to about the mid-

dle of the anal fin. There was a short space between the first and second dorsal

fins, and there were eight Unlets above and seven below. The anal and second

dorsal fins were  falcated                                       the tail  deeply cleft, and  the weight of                                                   the  fish  twelve

length of the pectoral fin not so great, though fully up to the length given by Cuvier

who states it to be one-third the length of the body. This fish exhibited remark-

able strength for its size, agreeing in this with the account given by the fishermen

who captured the specimens taken in Mounts Bay.

   On the extraordinary partiality shown by Insects of the Genus Laverna/o;1

               Plants of the Order Onagracecc. By II. T. Staixtox.

   The genus Laverna is a genus of moderate extent in the family Elaehistidce of
the Tineina. The limits of the genus are not at present veiy accurately defined
and future investigation may show that its boundaries should be extended, so as to
include some of the cognate species placed in allied genera. At present we have
eighteen species in the genus, eight of which are distributed amongst plants of very
difi'ereut orders, occurring on Tgpha, Tamarix, Pyrus, Cratcegus, Quercm, IMian-
themum, and Rhammts ; the remaining ten species are restricted in their food to the
Onograceee,-xni all feed on Epilobium, one species also feeding on Circcea lutetiana.
Three occur on Epilobium augustifoUum, four or five on E. hirsutum, and two on
E. montanum.

                    On the Natives of Patagonia and Terra del Fuego.

                                 By the Rev. W. H. Sterling.

   The mission to which the author helonged was stationed on Falkland Islands,
and the mission ship coming to England for other purposes, it presented a favour-

able opportunity of bringing a few of the natives, four of whom were present in

the Section-room. These natives belonged to the island of Terra del Fuego. There
was undoubtedly an affinity between their race and the Patagonians, but the habits
of life and the circumstances under which each lived were very different. The
Patagonians were generally spoken of as giants ; this was an error ; forty of them
had been measured, and their average height was about 5 feet 10 inches. The

Fuegians were a shorter race. The Fuegians were very much harassed by the

weather, for they had scarcely anything to wear besides a strip of seal-skin. Their

diet was fish. They were canoe Indians. He had never discovered any traces of

cannibalism, and even their taste for beef, mutton, and other flesh food had to be

acquired.

 On the Domestication of certain Animals in England between the Seventh and

                         Eleventh Centuries. By J. Thrupp.

   This paper gave an account, derived from the actual examination of ancient
documents, of the amount and character of the domestication of various animals

--in England during the period stated. First, animals thoroughly domesticated were

noticed horses, pigs, sheep and poultry. Secondly, animals imperfectly domesti-
cated, such as goats, deer, hawks, &c. ; .and a third class, canaries, parrots, &c,

which, when opportunity presented itself, would escape to savage life. The essay

gave details of the domestication of the pig, with the laws and charters relating to
its protection. Horses came next in the work of domestication, about the tenth

century, when it was unlawful to ride on horseback, and even kings were accus-
tomed to hunt on foot. This restriction was afterwards withdrawn, and riding,
hunting, and fighting on horseback came into use. Bees were domesticated be-

tween the sixth and seventh centuries; and, being found very profitable, the nobles,

clergy, and laity all combined for the protection of that insect. Hawks were next

introduced, but with the introduction of fire-arms went into disuse. Weasels and
cats brought the subject up to the eleventh century.

Address by Henry W. Acland, M.D., LL.D., F.B.S., Regius Professor of

                Medicine in the University of Oxford.

--Ladies and Gentlemen, In addressing you from the Chair this day, I desire

myfirst of all to express  sense of the unmerited honour thus conferred upon me.

When* informed that it was intended to propose me as your Chairman, my first

impulse was without hesitation to decline so great a distinction, in order that the

post might be held by one of the many eminent persons who usually contribute

to the success of the Section, or to the renown of the Department. Further con-

sideration seemed to show me that the greater homage would be to place unre-

servedly at your service such humble powers as I have, and to offer you that which

I possess, viz. the force of profound interest in the progress of one of the most im-

portant departments of human knowledge, and of sympathy all but lifelong with

its promoters.

I rely, therefore, on the support which you will generously give to 'my endea-

vours to secure all fidl and fair discussion that is consistent with a due regard to

the limited time at our disposal.

It has become a custom that the Presidents of Sections should make some

opening address, though it is held to be inexpedient that it should he elaborate or

long. While debating on the subjects on which I might usefully touch, I chanced

to encounter the remark of a philosophic writer, that the time was come when it
was a prime necessity for Biology that it should be separated from Medicine. The

grounds alleged were, the imperfect education of physicians, their want of leisure,

and the magnitude of biological science. There seemed to me such a mixture of

truth and error in the remark itself, and in the general tenor of the data on which

it was founded, that it appeared to me well worthy of your attention.

As to the imperfect education of physicians, the remark is too general to be

correct, and is not a topic proper to be considered here, further than to say,

1st, that it is to great medical minds, from Hippocrates and Galen down to
Haller and Hunter, that we owe the promotion, and, indeed, the very creation,

of a large part of existing biological knowledge, so that these men cannot have

been ill furnished for their work ; and 2ndly, that it is certain that no persons

who are not well prepared will in future make any additions of importance to

this or any other department of science. The observation, therefore, on the

whole, amounts to this, that in these days biological science has become too

extensive to be committed to the care of any but those who can give to it

undivided attention. This also is only true under limitation. It is true so far as

this, that division of labour is as necessary for the perfection of this portion of

science as of others ; and further, that some parts of biology are become so com-

plicated and so extensive as to demand for original work the whole powers of any
man of ordinary calibre. But it would be quite as just if we were to lay it down
broadly, " There has been no period when it was as necessary for the progress of
biology as now it is, that its relations with medicine should be "closely maintained."

Neither position would be wholly true, or, therefore, wholly safe. It may not be

amiss to occupy a short time at the outset of our detailed labours with a brief

consideration of the real scope of the pursuit in which we are engaged, and of the

means which we possess for attaining our objects. I crave your indulgence if

my analytical description fall short of your distinct conceptions or your more

sanguine aspirations.

   The objects of biological study are, unquestionably, as in most other sciences,
First, simply to ascertain what are the facts in a certain department of Nature,

with no regard to the practical consequences which can be deducible therefrom

and Secondly, but less directly, to discover the laws and devise the rules which

are of various degrees of importance and value for the practical exigencies of
mankind,--just as mathematical and physical astronomers investigate the facts

which are necessary for the construction of the Ephemeris, and make it to be a
work of equal value for the pure astronomer and for the practical navigator.

   But some of the facts which physiology investigates, and the laws which it

--seeks to discover, happen to be of cogent consequence to all men equally, to the

thoughtful and the cidtivated, because they have the tendency to illuminate the

most hidden recesses of our mental constitutions, the most obsciu-e traces of our

origin,  and  our various correlations to  other beings, animate  and inanimate                                                          to the
                                                                                                                                      ;

mere " hewers of wood and drawers of water " among men, because it seeks to

ascertain in the most precise manner the conditions of physical existence, to point

out the work that can, and that cannot, be done upon such and such an amount of

sustenance. In short, it seeks to define the exigencies of the human body in

respect of all the external circumstances in which it is ordinarily placed, in respect

also of all other physical agents that can act upon, or be acted upon by it;
together with the internal chemical and physical alterations to which these several

circumstances can, directly or indirectly, give rise. It has to leam also the limits

--of toleration within which the body is confined by these external agents, and the

way in which these limits are regulated as the laws of toleration of climate, of
heat, of food, of various noxious agents, and many other particulars, of which the
catalogue would be greater than that of the ships "of Homer.

 --Every person, therefore, whether he knows it or not the Statesman, who has
--to consider the sustentation of the people the Religious man (that is, every one

who believes in a moral government of the world, or hopes for a future state, and

--who has opinions on the history or origin of the Human Race) the Animal man,

the Mother, rich or poor, who yearns by night and by day for the healthy growth

--of her tender offspring the Physician or Philanthropist, who desires to avert or
--to relieve diseases among communities or individuals of men each and all of these

are alike really interested in the steady progress of the most abstruse philosophical
speculations of the physiologist, as certainly as of the commoner rules of a healthy

life, which are to be safely deduced from them.

   In reference therefore to the opinion which was just now adverted to, I think that

Biology is to be extricated from the hands of physicians only in a limited sense.

No persons have so many grounds for advancing it as they. The physician, abs-
tractedly considered, combines all the characters to which I have alluded. He is,

in respect of the health of the people, a Statesman ; as a Man, like others, a Reli-

gious man ; not less than others, Father and Husband ; as much as any, a Working-
man by education, more or less, a Man of Science. In short, abstractedly con-

                        ;

sidered,! say it is his special duty at least to advocate and, if he can, to promote

--the advance of physiological knowledge unfettered and free,

   1st. As a pure Science.

    2nd. As the basis of the Medical Art.

    3rd. As of practical utility in helping to regulate the lives and habits of society

at large.

  Now the hindrances to a perfectly free study of Physiological Science arise from

two causes :
   1st. The intrinsic difficulty of the subject; and

   2nd. The prejudices of mankind.

   To the consideration of these two points it may not be useless for us to devote

some attention.

   1st. As to the intrinsic difficulty of the subject.
   Although the wisdom of this Association entitles this Meeting a iSfai-Seetion, I
am among the minority who cannot understand the force of the arguments which go
to class Biology (which term may be now used synonymously with Physiology)
as a subordinate subject. Being, when properly considered, the most complicated

of all the subject matter debated at this Association, it cannot be really subordi-
nate to any, least of all to Zoology and Botany, which it distinctly ('/(eludes. It

may be an open question whether Physiology be a branch of Physics and Che-

mistry ; it is not an open question whether it includes the knowledge of the cha-
racteristics upon which the classification of all entities that are said to have life

is based.

   It were an impertinence, however, now to spend time in arguing about the

Classification of Sciences. It is sufficient for us to note the vast range of Biology,

a range which every year makes more wide.

The knowledge of "the actions of living beings depends, and necessarily depends,

not only upon what may be learnt intrinsically, so to say, in the living beings

themselves, but upon the collateral advancing waA'es of physical and chemical

Howinquiry.  largely, for instance, in the last few years, have the idea of Con-

servation of Force in Physics, and the remarkable advance of the Synthetical

operations of the Laboratory affected our fundamental conceptions of the actions in

living bodies, and increased the chances of our advancing a step towards the know-

ledge of what is essential in the phenomena which we designate Life.

The intrinsic difficulty of this search in the present day consists not so much in the

morphological examination of beings, on the one hand, as complex as Man with all

his varieties, and the problems thereto attaching ( though this morphological ex-

amination of Man in all his varieties is still incomplete), nor in the examination, on

the other hand, of beings so inexplicably simple as our own Amabel, or as the

ancient (and how ancient !) Eozoon Canadense, but in the causes and conditions of
the actual or potential changes in the minutest portions of any one creatine. The

labours of Goodsir and Yirehow and Beale, and of many others labouring in the

same direction and in various ways, have shown, what was indeed long suspected,

that the solution of the problem of the actual relation between Function and Organ

may be sought, and has to be sought, among parts mechanically almost as fine as

the Chemical Atom ; for we have life, secretion, motion, generation in parts, to our
                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.             97

present means of examination, structureless. Yet, although this may be the case,
it would be a great error to suppose that there is not much work yet to be done in
the more obvious department of Descriptive Anatomy which chiefly occupied
older investigators. Every year seems to show this, from the researches of culti-

vated Palaeontologists and Naturalists in every department : for both in this country

and on the two continents additions are being unceasingly made to the stock
of knowledge either of objects wholly new, or of objects or parts heretofore incom-

pletely described.

   For the purposes of the great scientific question of this age, the Causes of the
present order of Life on the Globe, it would seem that the minutest accepted data

of biological conclusion may have to be revised under new methods. It is a
saying among painters, " that a draughtsman sees no more than he knows." It is

true in the same way in Natural Science, that the real signification of a known
fact may be concealed for ages. Of this, Pathology offers many examples. The
older naturalists, notwithstanding the great learning of such men as Linnasus and

Haller, had comparatively either very simple or hypothetical and incorrect notions

of the complexities of living Beings and their constituent parts. Chemistry, the

Microscope, and the search for the Origin of Species have, in this century, widened

the horizon of biological study in a way not less surprising than does the dawn of
day to a traveller, who, having by night ascended some lofty peak, sees gradually

unfolding an extent and detail of prospect which he can generally survey, though

he cannot hope to verify each detail and visit every nook in the brief time allotted
to him for travel. The desire " rerun cognoscere causas " urges him even more

keenly than to know the things themselves. Thus in Biology, the laws of the
genesis of every known organic being have now become as much the object of
investigation as was once the nature of the being itself. The existence of defi-
nite species or varieties was formerly assumed in an arbitrary manner to be a kind
of necessity. The search after the laws which produced those species, and the
signification of them, has become as ardent as was once the definition of the spe-
cific characters. But it is a far more difficult pursuit, and requires either a very
special education, or remarkable natural powers. The difficulty pervades every

department of Biology in gross and in detail. Darwin seeks the solution for the
whole kingdom of nature. The Histologist, the Pathologist, the Organic Chemist

approaches it in the detail of every mechanical texture, and of every organic

Wechemical compound.  are apt to look on the Museum of John Hunter as the

most philosophic and extensive exposition of Biological Science in this or any

other country. And justly so. Inquiring originally into what is the proper
treatment of disease, he asks in order, What is its nature ? what its cause ? how
are the functions disordered ? how are they performed in health ? by what me-
chanism ? how is this mechanism varied F whence did it originate ? But compare

with his knowledge the knowledge of biologists of the present period viewed col-
lectively : take our knowledge of the ovum, for instance, and its development,
or the minute anatomy of the tissues, or (may I venture to use the epithet for so

vast a collection of ascertained truth ?) the nascent chemistry of living structures,

or the relations of osseous structures in the Vertebrata. It were hard to say which

is the more remarkable, Hunter's comprehensiveness, or the detail of modem

science. Yet how many details are still needed for a safe Biological Philosophy.

WeYet are we only on the threshold of detailed knowledge.  still speak of

many hard points with an almost childlike simplicity. What do we understand,

for instance, of the cause of that which Herbert Spencer calls "Organic Polarity"--

--that is to say, the power, force, or tendency by which lost parts are repaired" by

-- --which a whole limb or part of a limb or even all but a whole body is replaced
--by the outgrowth from what remains of the original unmutilated whole a process

so common in Asteriadne and Crustacea and other animals as to seem a matter of

course in their history, while it is apparently a property which cannot exist in the

higher animals ? What do we know of the causes of hereditary transmission in

general (a property wholly different from, and more unintelligible* than the hypo-

thesis of natural selection), or of the transmission of disease in particular, as for

Howexample, of Carcinoma ? What is it in its essence ?  does it originate in

Howan individual of untainted family?  is it transmitted? Is it an original

property of the ovum per se, or of tb.3 nutrient plasma by which that ovum is
nourished up to the time of its birth ? Could food, or mode of life, or any specific
agent eradicate the tendencies to transmission, just as in certain cases we empi-

rically modify the transmission of tubercle ? or is the transmission of the Carcinoma

as inevitable in certain cases as the development of the germ ? Grave questions for

future solution.

These allusions to disease, I need not say, are purposely introduced. There

Bvduis to be a tendency in some modern physiologists to pay insufficient attention

to the retrograde metamorphosis of living creatures. The study of death is as
much an object of biological science as the study of birth. The whole being

originates, reaches maturity, declines, and dies. So does every part. He strives
with vain endeavour to grasp the history of any organic thing, who does not

regard it in relation to its origin, its growth, its dissolution, its relations to
objects external to it, the changes which it undergoes in itself and of itself, an 1

the modifications, accidental or necessary, which external agents can and may in-

duce in it.

   General considerations of this kind have a certain, though subordinate office in

scientific deliberations, and seem just now not out of place. It will be remembered

that I have been speaking of the intrinsic difficulties of biological study. If I have

correctly, though briefly, sketched the domain of Biology, the existence of these

difficulties will be conceded. They are now insisted upon, not certainly so much
for the sake of those skilled experts, our teachers, who are carrying on the con-
quest of Nature, as of those many cultivated learners who, from want of leisure,

cannot actively pursue, but who, from real interest, desire to aid and promote

the study of Biology. For them it is desirable to take from time to time a general

--survey of the aims and extent of Biology, in order that they may bring the weight

of their influence in support 1st, of free, unfettered pursuit of Biology for its

own sake                                                and 2ndly, of public  education, such as may conduce in the next gene-
                                                     ;

ration to a just appreciation of its scientific, its educational, and its practical value.

I am thus led to consider, 2ndly, the Prejudices of Mankind, " opiniones

prcejudicatce," in respect of Biology.

   These resolve themselves into Active Prejudices and Passive Prejudices. Active

lead men to object to it as harmful; Passive lead them to regard it with in-

difference.

These prejudices are rapidly undergoing modification, but they have existed harm-

fully more or less, from various causes, among almost all but professed Physiologists.
I need only advert among the Active prejudices to the so-called theological dread of

free inquiry into the origin of Paces, and the origin of Species generally. Among

the Passive prejudices, I would point to the want of appreciation of purely scientific

inquiry that has no practical end in view ; to objections of various kinds brought

against experiments made for Physiological, Toxicological or Therapeutical pur-

poses ; to objections to the introduction of Biological studies into courses of general
education ; to the tardy recognition of Biological knowledge as the basis of practical
Medicine, and of Hygiene, public and private.

History gives the clue to the source of these prejudices, namely, the empirical

assumptions of supposed truths made at former, and often ancient epochs, which
have one by one to be eradicated from their respective departments before the

advancing knowledge of ascertained Natural Law.

What we see around us in the natural world is admitted on all sides to be the

Whyresult of the operations of causes working by fixed laws.                  those laws exist, or

how they came to be, it is not within the domain of Physical Science to discuss.

What (in so far as they affect living beings) they are, and what the mode and limit

of their action, including (of course) the mode and limits of their possible modifi-

cation, is the special province of Biological Science. Science therefore is not only

at liberty, but is bound, at all times to test the correctness of opinions which bear

on or have relations to the subject matter of science, and do not appear to have been

Afounded on adequate scientific evidence.                                     great part of the scientific work in the

present century has been that of recasting or rejecting received dogmas. This work

is not yet complete, .and possibly never will be. It is evident that new means of
research show the incorrectness of the belief of many of the greatest minds. Plato

Ahuman affairs are not susceptible of absolute proof.  physician or a lawyer, or

a moralist, who always refused to act on the greater probability would be a sorry

adviser to his client. But the work of the chemist or the physiologist woidd be

at once set aside if probability and not ascertained fact entered into his formula.

Different subject matters are taught or studied with different degrees of cer-

tainty, or by different methods ; the methods and degrees of certainty must be
known and acknowledged. There can be no just ground of objection to conclusions

based on hypothesis so long as the promoters are ready to accept, on proper and

reasonable evidence, new elements of calculation.

  AI spoke also of the Passive prejudices of mankind in respect of Biology.

curious chapter might be written on the slowness with which physiological

principles have been generally received (I cannot say they are even now accepted
by us) as the basis on which to secure public and private health. England is but
even now awakening to these questions. The Registrar-General, the Army and
Navy Departments, the Health Department of the Privy Council, the various
Drainage Commissioners and Committees, and many other bodies are all engaged

in collecting, disseminating, and in using physiological knowledge under various

aspects. It must be admitted that evidence as to what is and what is not favour-

able to the correct performance of the functions in men and other animals is

even now often conflicting. It was said just now that the pure Physiologist is

too apt to disregard the processes " prcepnrantes ad mortem ;" so also he is too

apt to look on Health Questions as problems of Practice or Art, and not of

Science. Yet the highest scientific qualities are requisite for determining with

precision any problems affecting, for instance, Nutrition, and the consequent Capa-

city for labour of a population, viewed as a whole or as individuals : witness the

investigations of your last year's President (now, happily, employed by the Govern-

ment), and many of the important papers in Mr. Simon's valuable yearly Keports,

and such memoirs as that of Professor Haughtou of Dublin on Work. In such

cases, I will not say Theory, but knowledge precedes, and regulates, and compels

practice.

Similar considerations apply to the relation of Physiology to Practical Medicine.

This art or science is undergoing revision under the influence of Physiology, a re-
vision somewhat indeed retarded by popular prejudice, but certain.

  In looking back on the history of medicine we are at a loss to say which is the

more curious, the sagacity of the older physicians and surgeons, considering the

scantiness of their physiological knowledge, or their folly, considering the extent

of it. The explanation lies in the intermixture of empirical (that is, of accepted,
traditional, unquestioned) belief with really ascertained fact ; and we are not
now-a-davs without danger of undervaluing the eminent artistic power and great

practical shrewdness of former physicians, in the presence of our more precise, but

sometimes also less practically valuable scientific knowledge. Dr. Stokes, the

eminent Dublin Professor, has lately spoken on this topic in a timely and earnest

way.

   The business of Physiology and of an Association like this, as I j list now said, is
therefore not only to add new knowledge, but to destroy incorrect or imperfectly cor-
rect statement and belief. The incorporation of advancing Physiology with Medicine

every year adds certainty to the latter, while it furnishes data as weil as tests to the

former. Experiment properly applied in Medicine under trained physicists and

                                                                     7*

chemists will not only eliminate gradually all remaining error, but will make more

definite the properties of therapeutical agents. In illustration it is sufficient to refer

to some of the investigations of Claude Bernard, from whose great skill, combined

with philosophic power, much may be expected. Yet it may be doubted if the

importance ot this alliance between Science and Medicine to the community at large

is yet fully understood by the Legislature. Under the recent Medical Act, the

whole expense of constructing a National Pharmacopoeia was thrown by Parliament

on the existing Practitioners of Medicine, and the cost of its future maintenance was

charged on the Students of Medicine: the national funds are to contribute nothing

towards the great benefit, a benefit accruing to every one at some period of life, of

a genuine and philosophical revision of known, or the discovery of new, curative

agents. Experiment alone can decide conclusively on the mode of operation of
various agents on the human body and on animals. These experiments are always

difficult, often costly. The Government, as I said, do not acknowledge the duty of

providing funds. Perhaps the Medical Council might. It is indeed charged with

the administration of the only Public Funds that are applicable to keeping on a

level with modern science the National Catalogue of Remedial Agents and the

mode of preparing them. If it could be induced to expend £'1000 a year, as under
proper management it easily might, in experiments and reports bearing on the

physiological action of preventive or remedial agents, sometimes perhaps sug-

gested and aided by the British Association, what might not be the fruit to

science and to the public and private health ?

I have been assuming, what no one here will question, that the basis of Medi-

cine is knowledge of biological laws. It is so, but only in the wide sense assigned

at the outset to biological pursuits ; viz. the study of the laws of decay as well as of

--growth growth and decay of species as well as of individuals. But I must guard

myself by saying that this does not include the whole basis of medicine. Physio-

logical experiment is necessary to obtain the laws of action on healthy bodies, but

alone it does not explain the laws of action on perverted organic structures or

functions, as is seen in the common instance of tbe different effect of opium on a
man in health and on a man in disease. Clinical observation is of course beyond

physiological research, and must, from its far more limited field, follow rather than

precede. It aims at applying, in due course, all safe and established results of pre-

vious physiological inquiry ; and adds the deductions from investigations exclu-

sively its own.

   Much remains to be done in comparing the effects of agents, and the causes of
those effects on man and on the inferior animals respectively. The knoAvledge

which exists on these subjects has become, I need not say, both extensive and

precise. But new problems are constantly arising from the discovery of new

Toxic agents. Even new diseases occur, as is well instanced by Cholera, implying

either new conditions of circumstances external to man, or new combinations of

the internal conditions of man.

Accordingly fresh experiments are perpetually required to meet the new pro-

blems                               and it  has  become the interest and  almost the duty of  States  to  specially
                                 ;

train and to countenance skilled experts familiar with the most recent metbods

and researches in these directions, with a view not only to fresh scientific know-

ledge, but to the great practical results that may be obtained. It is sufficient to

--refer as illustrations to Bernard's experiments, such as those on the Woorara to
--the question of Physiological Antidotes and to the more precise notions of the

Physiological causation and mode of action of Fever Poison.

These you will observe, though apparently what are called medical questions,

are not less physiological questions proper, of vast importance to mankind.

  A few more words in another aspect, and I will not venture further to trouble

the Section, or delay our detailed work, which is ample enough. I have implied,

what is sufficiently obvious, that Physiology proper (I exclude such questions as

the evolution hypothesis, which cannot be proved in this way) has become uncom-

promisingly precise, and that nothing will stand which does not bear the crucial

tests of observation, and where possible of experiment. But the experiments can-

not in the present advanced state of Physics and of Chemistry be devised by ordi-

nary men, nor even executed by them. Consequently every year old statements
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.            101

concerning the effects of agents so called Physiological and Therapeutical, are

becoming of less value, and new ones of more. Most of us, who have passed the
prime of life, must be content to learn from the more favoured in years. They
who are young must be willing to be patient and laborious, if they would add any
thing of permanent value to physiological knowledge. The day in which hundreds

of organic compounds are synthetically produced, and the microscope offers for
mechanical analysis a clearly defining magnifying power of 5000 linear, is not one

when rough work of hand, or conjecture unsupported by proof as to the chemical
changes which go on within organic structures, will stand. What Life is will long,
perhaps always evade our human ken ; what is done during Life, what can be done
consistently with Life, and what produces death among living things, every year
makes more sure and more plain ; every year makes the search more exciting, the
reward more great, the reasons for admiration of the order of things on the whole
more conclusive, and the admiration and awe more profound.

   At the outset it was said that only very qualified assent coidd be given to the

remark of a philosophical writer, that it is a prime necessity for Biology that it

should be separated from Medicine. It has been my endeavour to show the

amount of truth which belongs respectively to the remark and to the dissent.
   Physiology, to sum up, is become a science, precise, of enormous extent, bringing

to its support mathematics, advanced physics, difficult chemistry, accurate and com-
prehensive anatomy. Part of the basis of the science or art, which averts or lessens
suffering and disease, and postpones or makes easy death, depends in great mea-
sure upon its progress. But the applied and observational part can only be learned

by the bed-side of the sick. Therefore pure Biological Science and pure Clinical
Art must each have their votaries, but it must be the aim of each to learn from the

other what is necessary for himself. May the State be wise enough (and it is

becoming so in every civilized country) to appreciate these principles and their

--application ! There never was an age it is not ungratefid to the giants of old to
--say this there never was an age when there were so many students, in the best

sense, of Biology and of Medicine, actuated by a simple love of truth ; and never

a time when, as a class, they were so free from prejudice, so candid, and so patient.

On Life. By Dr. Lionel S. Beale, F.E.S.

On the Formation of Pus, in reference to the doctrine of Cell Pathology. By

   J. Hughes Bennett, M.D., Professor of the Institutes of Medicine, Sfc. in the

     University of Edinburgh.

    Dr. Bennett stated that a cell pathology had naturally sprung from the cell theory
as originally framed by its founders, Schleiden and Schwann, which had greatly
extended the boundaries of science. The cell pathology of Virchow, however, was
ba^ed upon a law he sought to establish, viz., that every cell sprung from a pre-

existing cell, and that we must not transfer the seat of real action to any point be-
yond the cell. This supposed law, the author maintained, was opposed by so many
histological facts as to be altogether untenable. He begged especially to draw at-

tention to the origin of pus-cells, which Yirchow and some of his followers had re-

presented as originating in the interior of connective-tissue corpuscles. Dr. Bennett
and his pupils had frequently sought, by passing setons through the skin and
muscles of animals, to observe in the inflamed tissues the appearances which had
been figured in support of Virchow's views, but had never succeeded in seeing pus-
cells within preexisting cells. Henle had pointed out that the error had originated

in mistaking the triangular spaces observable on a transverse section between the
bundles of various fibrous tissues for cells, as in these unquestionably pus was very

likely to collect. Dr. Bennett further believed that the tendency of many cells to

enlarge as the result of irritation, and to multiply themselves endogenously, as
shown by himself, Lebert, Goodsir, Redfern, and other pathologists, was another

source of mistake among the younger histologists. The granides and included cells
so formed were mistaken by them for those of pus, though easily separated from

them. He called attention to a series of preparations (which were exhibited)

showing suppuration in inflamed eyeballs and in pneumonic lungs, in which pus-
--102 REPORT 1865.

cells might be seen in all stages of formation, originating from a coagulated mole-
cular exudation, unconnected with any preexisting cells whatever. In the sections
of pneumonic lung more especially, the tihrous tissues of the organ might be seen
to be quite healthy. In the coagulated exudation, on the other hand, the mole-
cules might be observed at first uniformly filling up the air-vesicle, then formed
into masses varying in size from the twenty-thousandth to the one-thousandth of
an inch in diameter. The latter were rounded, and were identical with pus-cells.

He believed that these bodies, therefore, were formed by an aggregation of smaller

particles or molecules, comprised originally of the coagulated exudation. It was

certain that in the situations referred to they did not originate in preexisting cells,
as no such cells could be observed. If, as might be supposed, they sprung from the
epithelial cells lining the chambers of the eye or the air-vesicles, such cells would

be seen enlarged and containing the pus bodies. But his preparations and nume-
rous examinations of the parts when diseased had proved to him that no such cells
were mingled with the exudation, or were in any way connected with the formation
of pus. These facts were wholly subversive of the law of cell pathology sought to
be established by Virchow.

       On Beef and Pork as Sources of Entozoa. By Dr. Cobbold, F.R.S.

   The paper commenced by showing that much misunderstanding prevailed,
even amongst eminent authorities, as to the most frequent source of human cestode
entozoa. The author combated the notion so commonly entertained that pork
was the chief source of human tapeworms, and, in proof, referred to the results of
his original experiments, as well as to data supplied by other means. He showed
that the unarmed tapeworm (T<enia mediocanellata) was more abundant in this
country than the hooked tapeworm {Tama solium), which latter species, however,
was somewhat more prevalent in Birmingham than the same species elsewhere.
He threw out several hints respecting the primary origin of these and other human
parasites, and contended that the human body was the legitimate home and terri-
tory of some of these parasites. They did not, and probably could not reside in any

other creature in their adult state. In the case of Trichina, it was by no means
certain that the pig constituted the primary host. The original " creative centre "
was possibly antecedent to the race of swine.

          Remarks on Specimens of Entozoa. By Dr. Cobbold, F.R.S.

    The author exhibited six preparations, being part of an extensive series which he
recently made for the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. Parti-
cular attention was drawn, in the first instance, to a specimen of Trichina spiralis.
This parasite was shown, in the encysted condition, in a portion of the great pectoral
muscle of a dissecting-room subject. The author had fed various animals with this
trichinized flesh, and had reared in them a numerous offspring. Next, in point of
importance, was a portion of muscle from a calf, in which animal Dr. Cobbold had
 succeeded in rearing numerous " measles " ( Cysticcrcns bom's, T. S. C. ) by the admi-
 nistration of the proglottides of the unarmed human tapeworm (Tania mediocanel-

lata). He also showed measles (Cyst, celluloses) from the pig, and several hytadids
 furnished with Echinococcns-brood-capsules. He expressed his thanks to the As-

 sociation for the funds which had been allotted for the purpose of carrying on these
 experimental investigations.

 On the Effects of Scanty and Deficient Diet. By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S., <$fc.

    It seems to be now laid down as a rule or principle that the health and constitu-
 tion of man must Buffer permanently if for any ltngth of time he has not a full
 allowance of food, i. e. a quantity adequate to preserve him in an average state of
 health and strength. And on this principle the formation of dietaries for the in-
 mates of all public institutions, whether workhouses or prisons, has been more or

  less strictly founded.'*

     Is this principle, or, as it might be called, postulate, well established and sup-
 ported by facts ?
                                           TRANSACTIONS 01? THE SECTIONS.                                                                           103

The following are some of the circumstances which have given rise in the author's

mind to doubt :

1st, then, taking the instance of the adult man : is there any evidence that those

engaged in expeditions or services in which for a period the allowance of food was

deficient, though they were weakened indeed greatly at the time, experienced any

permanently bad effects ? Those who belonged to the arctic exploring parties, whe-

ther by sea or land, have not eventually suffered. The author referred specially to
the cases of the late Sir John Richardson, who had suffered so much from priva-

tion in his first arctic journey, and his companion, the late Sir John Franklin.

They were reduced by starvation to such a state that even their minds were en-

feebled                                    and when they arrived  at a station where  their wants  could  be supplied,
                                        ;

they were intent on nothing but cooking and eating, day and night. Nor is there

evidence that any African traveller, whatever his privations, if so fortunate as to

return to this country, suffered eventually. The late Captain Speke is an instance

in point, and both of the effects of deficient diet with fatigue and of ample diet with

rest. Captain Burton, his companion, a traveller in so many lands, and of such vast
experience as a traveller, affords evidence in his own person corroborative of the

fact that temporary privation              is                     not necessarily permanently  injurious                                            indeed  he
                                                                                                                                                 ;

expresses it as his opinion that occasional fasting is beneficial.

  A2. deficiency ol food, especially of fresh vegetables, is productive, as is well

known, of scurvy, accompanied by a diseased state of the blood and great loss of

bodily strength yet how soon does recovery take place when a wholesome invi-
                                                                                     ;

gorating diet is supplied. Nor is the author aware that scurvy is productive of any
taint, as a sequela, injurious to the constitution. And he apprehends that the same

remark is applicable in relation to consequences, to all acute diseases, such as are not

accompanied by organic lesions of a permanent kind. It is marvellous, in cases of

recovery from yellow fever and some other fevers, how rapid is the convalescence,

the gain of weight, and the restoration of vigour.

   ·'!. Taking the instances of tribes of people : some are scantily fed, or, at least,
owing to the regions they inhabit and their habits as to their mode of procuring

food, are often for a considerable time on a scant allowance, sometimes approaching

the starvation degree. Such races are the Boshmen of Southern Africa, the Tas-
manians, the aborigines of Australia, the Veddahs of Ceylon, who all lead the pre-

carious life adverted to as to diet, depending chiefly for their daily food for their

success in the chase. What is their condition ? All of them are below the average

i,i height and size and are thin in person ; but they are not said to be unhealthy
races, or subject to any spe: ial diseases attributable to their mode of life.

  --4. Taking examples of different ages the young during the period of growth,
--adults, the middle-aged, the advanced in years, and the very aged in either of

these stages have we proof that there is any disease special to either when too spa-

ringly fed, provided the food they have is of a wholesome kind ? Dining the period

of distress in Lancashire, owing to the diminished imports of cotton, it would ap-

pear that the people generally were in tolerable health ; indeed it is stated that they
were in improved health, and that there was actually a diminished rate of mortality.

Yet we may be sure that, during that calamitous time, a very large number of men,
-women, and children must have been underfed. Of the men and women most re-

--markable for longevity, the greater number have been of the labouring class in-

dividuals of whom it may be pretty confidently asserted that their diet was sparse

rather than abundant. Though the Irish, as a people, owing to their dependancy

on the potato, have been greater f ufferers from famine than the English in modern

times, yet it is remarkable that the number of persons in that country who have

attained the age of fO years is greater than in England, with a population, com-

paring the two, so greatly in excess.

5. Taking instances of peoples and persons well fed and regularly so, in what par-

ticulars do they differ chiefly from the preceding? Pastoral and agricultural tribes

--well to do may be cited as examples such as the Caftiesof Southern Africa, living

chiefly on milk; and, amongst Europeans, the middle-class, using a mixed diet, and

--that without stint. Such and the Caffres and our own countrynn n are striking

--examples are chiefly remarkable for a size exceeding Ihe average of mankind, and

for a full development with proportional strength and energy ; but the author is
--104 REPORT 1865.

not aware that they are more exempt from diseases, especially of the chronic, ca-

chetic kind, than those of a smaller size and more spare habit.

6. Brute animals afford analogies. The fell sheep of the north of England and

of Wales, picking up a scanty subsistence on the poor pastures of the mountain sides,

are equally remarkable for their hardihood, activity, small size, and the goodness of

Athe mutton they afford.                                                                                 like remark is applicable to the cattle of similar

--districts, such as the Highlands of Scotland and the wilder parts of Ireland and

Wales how inferior are they in size to the longhorns of Devon and the shorthorns

of Herefordshire, feeding in rich meadows ! The horse is another instance. Where-

ever the pasture is poor, ponies will be found; but though small, they are nowise

deficient in strength, activity, and power of endurance. Large horses are the pro-

duct of rich pastures and an unfailing supply of nutritious food. The Yorkshire

breeder, to secure horses most in request, as rated by size and muscle, allows the

colt the milk of two mares. And we are told that in some of the Polynesian

islands the sons of chiefs are similarly reared, so as to secure a princely bulk and

stature.

   7. If, then, it be not proved that a scanty or somewhat scanty diet is not perma-
nently injurious to man, is it right that men undergoing imprisonment for crime

should be otherwise than sparingly fed ? Should the allowance in the least exceed

that sufficient to keep the criminal in a state of health and strength somewhat be-
low par, and merely adequate to that moderate degree of labour erroneously desig-

nated " hard labour " to which he may be sentenced ? What is the general state

of health of such prisoners at present in the county jails, where the dietaries are

least in excess ? So far as the author had been able to learn, disease amongst
them is in less proportion than in the general population of the countiy, and the

mortality less.

The advocates for a liberal diet for prisoners hold that, under the depressing

influence of such confinement, more food is required to prevent undue waste and to

preserve vigour. This seems a very questionable doctrine. Mental depression im-

pairs the appetite                                                                                  and without an appetite for food, little, it may be expected, will
                                                                                                 ;

be digested and assimilated. Were the doctrine sound, and to be carried out in the

--instance of prisoners, should they not be allowed stimulants wine and beer ?

On the principle, indeed, of not endangering health, ought not imprisonment for

crime to be abolished altogether ? for, according to the advocates of a more liberal

diet, the confinement, with the opprobrium attached to it, operates on the mind, de-

presses the spirits, and is thus injurious to health.

   Those who expect effects deleterious to the constitution, productive of cachetic

diseases, and especially pulmonary consumption, from a spare diet, refer to poor

needlewomen and nuns, amongst whom this disease is especially prevalent. But in

their cases other causes are in operation ; and in the instances of the former almost

-- --every cause likely to undermine the constitution poor as well as scanty food bad
-- --lodgings, ill ventilated overwork-- privation of open-air exercise and, not least,

the want of mental exhilaration ; and they are commonly of a class with sen-

sitive  minds                                         and                                           the  circumstances  acting on  nuns  are  often  in  many  respects
                                                   :

similar.

The author contended that it was a false humanity to allow a high rate of diet

to prisoners, with the intent of supporting them in their full working strength

(thus making a prison life quortrl diet as little irksome as possible, and so far detract-

ing from the idea of punishment) and, on discharge in full vigour, the better able
to renew their criminal courses.

The principle of a full diet for prisoners is not well established as essentially

necessary. There should be, he urged, further inquiry instituted to determine the

dietary limits, the lowest not seriously endangering a permanent injury of the con-

stitution.

Is the Opinion that a Diet of Animal Food conduces to Leanness well founded

                   on Facts? By John Davy, M.D., F.R.S., #c.

   Those who have advocated this opinion, viz. that a diet of animal food conduces

--to leanness, have supported it by two trains of argument, one, that a vegetable diet
                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                              105

is richer commonly in the elements from which adipose matter can be formed,

such as starch, &c, than flesh ; the other, that carnivorous animals are commonly

leaner than herbivorous, the food of which is entirely vegetable.

The strength of the first argument it is not easy to appreciate, inasmuch as cer-

tain kinds of animal food abound in fatty matter ; it is therefore passed by.

The second train of argument is more important, and is more easily tested as to

Nowaccuracy.       if it be true that an animal diet conduces to leanness, and this

as a rule, it should bear the strictest scrutiny ; we should find it confirmed bv facts

of an unquestionable kind, i. e. by exact observations free, as much as possible,

from any fallacy. The following are some which appear to lay claim to be so

considered.

1. The nestling of the swallow fed entirely on insects, when fully fledged and

capable of taking flight, is found by the author to be heavier than the parent bird,
and this owing to its being fatter ; and it is found also that it loses weight after

leaving its nest and taking exercise on the wing, and this in consequence" of a di-
minution of its fat.

2. The buzzard, like its congeners of the falcon family, subsists entirely on

animal food, chiefly small birds ; it, according to the argument, should be lean

but the author has not found it so. One, a female, examined in January, killed
in the Lake District, and in full vigour, was found loaded with fat. The bird
weighed about two pounds; the fat that was separable, consisting chiefly of
stearine, weighed six ounces and a half; and besides this, there was a considerable

quantity remaining, not easily detachable from the muscles, &c. The lard-like fat
was found externally covering a large portion of the thorax and the whole of the
abdomen, and internally lining the sternum and the abdominal contents, especially

the stomach and intestines.

3. Many years ago, when in Ceylon, the author had the opportunity of dissect-

ing a  full-grown  Chetah  (Felis pardus)                                              he  found  it  not  merely   in  good  condition,
                                                                                    ;

but more than that, abounding in fat ; its mesentery had deposited on it a thick

layer of fat.

4. Fishes, those of which the food is entirely animal matter, are many of them

remarkable not for leanness, but for their fatness. Very many instances' might be

mentioned ; two may suffice. The salmon, on its ascent from the sea, after luxurious
--feeding there
                                                                ;
               and the eel,  on  its  descent                                              from   fresh  water  to  salt  both fishes

actuated by a similar instinct, that of spawning, seeking water of opposite qua-

lities, are then in their highest condition, and abounding in fat ; on the contrary,

when returning, one to the sea, the other to the rivers after spawning, are remark-

able for being wasted and lean; this, from the loss of fat, the consequence of a
long comparative fast.

    These, the author hoped, may be received as verified facts, tending strongly to
 show that a diet exclusively of animal food is no wise incompatible with fatness.

    5. If we refer to our own species, it is easy to find corroborative instances.

 Butchers and their families, who use a large proportion of meat, are surely not

 remarkable for leanness. The same remark applies to fishermen and their faniilies,
 who use fish largely at their meals. The English, as a people, have always

 been considered large consumers of meat, and especially in the olden time, when
 vegetables were less abundant than at present. Pere Labat, who wrote his account
 of the West India Islands towards the middle of the last century, states, when

giving an account of the Caribs, whom he describes as Cannibals, that he was

 assured by them that they could distinguish an Englishman from any other race
 of men, and that at their feasts they gave him the preference, on account of the
 meals he yielded being richer and more juicy. Shakspeare, who of all poets sur-

 passed in accuracy of observation, had he believed that a meat diet conduced to

 leanness, would never have depicted his fat knight, Sir John Falstaff, who speaks

 of himself apologetically as " having more flesh than another man, and therefore
 more frailty," as one so addicted to capons and sack.

    6. Did a vegetable diet favour the production of fat, the Irish, living mostly on the
·potato, should be distinguished for lustiness, which they certainly are not. Vege-
 tarians should especially be so distinguished ; but the author never heard it as-
 serted that such a distinction belongs to them.
--106 REPORT 1865.

  A fallacy lurks under the idea that an animal diet and a spare habit of body are

associated, partly owing to the circumstance that races of men who use this diet

--such as those who are dependent on the chase for a subsistence are compelled to

take much exercise in the pursuit of game, and are often, from scarcity of game,

underfed. Nearly the same remark is applicable to our soldiers and sailors,

amongst whom a fat man is a rarity ; and no wonder, as though their diet contains

a large proportion of animal matter, their meat ration is never in excess; they are
rather, especially the soldiers hitherto, underfed than overfed; and want of exercise
surely is not one of their wants.

   In conclusion, should the facts here brought forward be considered not altogether
conclusive in proof that an animal diet is not specially favourable to a spare habit

of body, they may at least suffice to render the opinion doubtful as to its accuracy.
   The author's belief is, and it seems to be the received opinion of most physiologists

--one the best founded in experience and most in accordance with the structure of
--man, and the organs chiefly concerned in digestion, that a mixed diet, partly ani-

mal, partly vegetable, is best adapted to his wants, as well as most suitable and pleas-

ing to his taste ; and that the safest way to prevent obesity is to live moderately,
observing the happy medium between a too sparing and a too copious dietary ; and

for the correction of obesity, attending to quantity rather than to quality of fcod.

   As a striking example of what may be accomplished in the reduction of corpu-

lency, a few particulars were added of a man, Thomas Hood, of whom an account

has been given by Sir George Baker in the ' Medical Transactions ' for 1767.

   The author also referred to the case of Cornaro, who attained his 101 year,

and from his fortieth year restricted himself to 12 ozs. of solid food and to 14 ozs.
of wine, and this with the best effects; for from a suffering invalid he became a
healthy man, and continue 1 in the enjoyment of excellent In alth without in-
terruption to the end of his long life.

           On the Functions of the Cerebellum. Bij Dr. W. Dickenson.

         On the Prevalence of Tapeworm in Birmingham, and its Causes.
                                      By Dr. Fleming.

   The author stated that tapeworm prevailed to a great extent in Birming-
ham, and was ofren to be seen in its severest forms among the patients of its several
hospitals. As compared with Edinburgh, the greater frequency of the disease in
Birmingham is very marked. In the General Hospital, the entire number of in- and
out-patients, in the year ending June ?>0, 1864, was 22,040, and of these there
were 51 cases of tapeworm ; in the Queen's Hospital, the number of patients during
the same period was 11,.376, and of these 75 were cases of tapeworm; and in the
General Dispensary the number of patients was 4516, there being 12 cases of tape-
worm. In Edinburgh, the proportion of tapeworm cases in the hospitals was very

small.

   The author, having explained how the measles in the pig developed into tape-
worms in man, attributed its prevalence in Birmingham to the large consumption

of pork, which in this town is a favourite article of food.
   The average number of pigs sold in Birmingham market weekly is 1500, and of

these two-thirds come from Ireland, where the hog suffers more from measles than
in any other part of the kingdom. In spite of the careful inspection of the maikets,
there* is little doubt that a considerable quantity of the pork sold is measly. "When
affected by the disease to such an extent as to render its exposure for public sale
hazardous, it is disposed of privately, and much of it is used in making sausages.

    With regard to the prevention of tapeworm, Dr. Fleming urged that the official
inspection of living and dead pigs should be made as searching as prssible ; but as

this will not suffice completely to protect the public, he advises that information on

the subject should be widely diffused, and thus make each consumer his own in-

spector. Further, all pork should be eaten either thoroughly well cooked or

thoroughly well cured, both ofwhieh processes destroy the parasite. The use of
other than home-made sausages should be strictly avoided.

On Experiments confirmatory of those of Kiihne on the Non- existence of
                    Ammonia in Blood. By Dr. A. Gamgee.

The author referred to the conclusions which Dr. Richardson had arrived at,

1st, that the blood, whilst circulating in the living body, contained free ammonia;

2nd, that when the blood leaves the animal body, ammonia escapes and coagulation

takes place, the escape of the ammonia and the phenomenon of coagulation being

considered to stand in the relation of cause and effect. The author had made some

experiments which were in direct opposition to those of so distinguished an experi-

menter as Dr.  Richardson                                                         and as the quantity of blood which Kiihne and Strauch
                                                                               ;

subjected to analysis was comparatively small, he had determined on repeating the

experiments in the most rigid manner possible, and upon a larger scale than had

been previously attempted. The experiments consisted in introducing blood taken

from the carotids of living animals directly into an atmosphere of pure hydrogen, and

allowing hydrogen to bubble through the fluid. The gases thus expelled were con-

ducted into Nessler's reagent. This (the most delicate test for ammonia) failed in de-

tecting the faintest trace of free ammonia, although it was proved to be capable of de-

tecting 0-5G gr. of ammonia when mixed with 140 ozs. of blood, and 20 ozs. of water.

The author then discussed the question as to whether the blood contained one of

the compound ammonias, instead of ordinary ammonia. He stated that all the

compound ammonias which he had examined gave reaction with Nessler's reagent,

and the author concluded by remarking that further researches would, he believed,

confirm the results of the experiments which he had performed, and satisfactorily

prove that Nessler's reagent was as delicate a test for the compound ammonias as

for simple ammonia.

Refutation of the View recently propounded that the Food comes into contact

   with the Vocal Cords in Deglutition. By George Duncan Gibb, M.A.,

    M.B., LL.D.. F.G.S.
   The author referred to the recent experiments of M. Guilder, of Montpellier, in
relation to the function of deglutition, which were brought before the Academy of

Sc'ences in Paris, and given briefly in the ' Comptes Rendus ' for May last. These ex-

periments by M. Gruinier were performed upon himself by means of autolaryngoscopy,
and consisted in the introduction of food into the larynx whilst the little mirror was
in the mouth, the ep : glottis remaining erect ; and he Therefore inferred that, in swal-

lowing, the food passed into the top of the windpipe, glided over the vocal cords, and

tumbled into the gullet, the epiglottis still being erect. He inferred also that fluids

always passed under the epiglottis in gargling or swallowing fluids. Dr. Gibb
questioned the conclusions drawn from the experiments, and maintained that the
act of swallowing food could not be demonstrated with a mirror at the back of the
mouth, and that the introduction of food into the larynx behind the epiglottis
showed the tolerance of the larynx under certain circumstances, but did not show
that this cartilage remained erect in deglutition. This tolerance was further shown

by the still later experiments of M. Kiishaber, who passed chewed bread into the

larynx with his linger, along the posterior surface of the epiglottis, and on a deep
inspiration this was drawn downwards into the trachea, and could be retained there

as long as the bolus remained warm and soft. Dr. Gibb referred to cases in his own

experience, where the epiglottis was destroyed by disease, and, notwithstanding,
the food did not glide over the vocal cords, as the soft parts at the top of the wind-
pipe approximated and allowed the food to slip into the gullet. It could be seen
also, that whi n the act of deglutition was examined with the laryngoscope, the
cavity of the larynx was quite clo-ed up, and then covered by the depressed epi-
glottis, so that food could not enter in the natural way. From these well-known
facts, with others which he mentioned, Dr. Gibb stated that our well-known views
in relation to deglutition, and the part the epiglottis played in it, remained sound,
and could not bo controverted by any experiments that might be made with the aid

 of the laiyngr srope.

Remarks on the Skeleton of a Woman cet. 104. By Dr. G. M. Humphry, F.R.S.

about half a pint of beer daily. Describing the post-mortem appearances, Dr. H.
said the organs were all sound and health)', and the cause of death was accumula-
tion in the bronchial tubes. The costal cartilages were as soft as in early life. The
same thing was noticed in the post-mortem examination of old Parr by Dr. Harvey,
and this was thought by him and by subsequent writers to be a condition peculiar

to old Parr, but he, Dr. Humphry, had met with the same in many examinations of
aged people. It is well known that after the middle period of life the costal car-
tilages often lose their elasticity, and become more or less calcified. Dr. Humphry
is inclined to regard this change as not so much an attendant upon age as upon an
unhealthy condition of the system. He considers it, in short, to be a morbid rather

than a senile change, and intimated that some aid to prognosis respecting longevity
might be furnished by an examination of the walls of the chest, a deficiency in
their elasticity being an indication of commencing failure of the nutritive functions.
The walls of the skull were unusually thick and heavy, the skull weighing 27|
oimces, or at least six ounces more than the average of adult skulls. In singular
contrast with the condition of the skull was the state of the femur, which was fra-

gile, porous, and light, weighing only five ounces. Dr. Humphry pointed out this
as an anomaly, that when the muscles and bones of the body generally had become
weak and less able to carry weight, the weight to be carried should be increased by
the increased thickness and heaviness of the skull. The only other change noticed
by Dr. Humphry was the depression of the head of the femur, the angle formed by
the neck with the shaft being only 100°. He had often found it as low as 1 10° in

old persons. In the adult it is usually from 125° to 130°.

  On the Vascular Arrangements of the Cornea. By Dr. W. H. Lightbodt.

   In this paper the cornea was shown to be non-vascular, except at its extreme
margin, even during foetal life, the capillaries ending in loops. The circular venous
sinus of Schlemm was described as occurring about the middle thickness of the
junction of the cornea and sclerotic, not at the point of division of the posterior
elastic lamina, where it usually is said to be. Certain very delicate membranous
sheaths were described, surrounding the capillaries of the cornea of many if not of

all animals, in some, as the sheep, containing, in addition to the blood-vessel, cor-
puscles identical in appearance with lymph-corpuscles : also large trunks, not con-

taining blood-vessels, but having the corpuscles in them, were shown leading from
the cornea into the sclerotic. The opinion was put forth that these sheaths and
trunks are really lymphatics, and it was supported by the recently-published dis-
covery of Professor His, viz., that the vessels of the brain and spinal cord are sur-
rounded by sheaths capable of being injected, and from Avhich the lymphatics of
the membranes of these organs may also be injected.

On the Development of the Vascular System of the Foetus in the Vertebrata,

    with the view to determine the true course of the Circulation through the

   Veins and Arteries of the Human Foetus in utero. By Prof. Hacdoxald.

   The early stages of embryonic or foetal development have long been well ex-
hibited by the phenomena of the incubated egg of the domestic poultry ; on the
present occasion the same field will be referred to in tracing the growth of the

vascular system.

   Having shown that the rudimentary heart of the embryo is formed by bending
a tube in the vascular area between the serous and mucous layer, it first appears
as a sacculated cone lying in front of the head of the embryo. From the lower
part, on the right side, a vein protrudes passing upwards to the sinus tenninalis, from
which the blood filtrates through the capillary area of the blastoderm, forming the
blastoderm arteries which enter the embryo, pouring the aerated blood on each side
into aortas. The aorta on each side of the chorda centralis terminates in four
branches ; 1st, to the heart for its growth ; 2nd, to the submaxillary region for the
growth of the lungs, and possibly the subclavian ; 3rd, the external carotid and
facial arteries ; and 4th, the terminal or internal carotid for the development of the
brain. The blood then returns to the atrium cordis by the two veins which enter
on the left side. After the ovule arrives at the uterus, the fiocculi of the shaggy

external chorion form the placenta by the umbilical vein pouring its blood among

the non-vascular branches of the shaggy chorion, as in the earlier stage of the
blastoderm capillary area ; from this the umbilical arteries receive the arterial blood
to be sent by the cord to the foetus for distribution through the body. The heart
of the foetus still continues for some time a unilocular cavity. The ventricle gradu-
allv grows outside of the atrium cordis, and for some time it continues as a single
cavity. The atrium cordis soon becomes divided into the right and left auricles.

   The ventricle in like manner becomes divided by a septum separating the right
and left ventricles. The aortic bulb may assist the circulation. The circulation
thus begun by the venous blood being sent by the umbilical vein to the placenta,
when the heart consisted of a single cavity, the blood would only return by the
arteries of the cord to the aorta through the umbilicus, and thus the course of the

circulation in the foetus as usually described is, according to the author, erroneous.

          Rigor Mortis not Muscular Contraction. By Dr. E. Norms.

   The commonly received theory of rigor mortis is, that it is an energetic muscular
contraction. That this view is erroneous is proved by the following considera-

--tions : 1st. That the rigor of opposing sets of muscles does not cause the redispo-

sition of limbs in obedience to the superior powers of the stronger sets of opponents.
2nd. That if either the flexors or extensors of a limb be divided and the limb be
placed, before rigor has set in, in the position in which it should be drawn by the
cut set of muscles had the action of these been unopposed, the uncut set of muscles
do not alter that position. 3rd. Contraction and the presence of irritability being
an inseparable association, it follows that if irritability be absent for a long time
immediately prior to the supervention of rigor mortis, the latter cannot be regarded
as a contraction. 4th. The microscopical appearance of muscular tissue affected
with rigor mortis is entirely different from that of muscular tissue in a state of con-
traction. The truth of these arguments he had demonstrated by a variety of ex-

periments, selections from which were set forth iu detail. Photographs of many

of the results and specimens of others were submitted to the Section. .Rigor mortis
is therefore not a contraction, either energetic or otherwise, of muscular tissue. It
is a suspension of the property of extensibility, probably due to a solidification
(coagulation ?) of a fibrinous (?) material contained in the intei fibrillar juices of
the muscles, as asserted by Briicke and Kiihne, the resolution of which by incipient
decomposition restores to the muscles their mobility.

On the Early Development of Organs in Embryonic Life.

                By Samuel H. Parkes.

   The difficulty of demonstrating the general anatomy of animals at a very early
period of gestation may be greatly lessened by hardening the foetus in alcohol, and

then making a consecutive series of very thin sections.

  A number of such preparations were exhibited, viz., fcetal rat at twenty-first day

of gestation ;  foetal rabbit at twenty-fourth day ;  foetal calf, two months                                                                                                     fcetal dog,
                                                                                                                                                                               ;

two months : human foetus, two months ; and bantam chick artificially hatched. In

these preparations may be seen the whole of the internal organs in situ, each section

showing the correct relative position of organs lying in the plane of such section.

The advanced state of development which exists at this early period in the

structural peculiarities of the visceral organs is truly astonishing. In the sections of

a human foetus (of about two months), for instance, may be seen at one view some

of the distinctive characteristics of cuticle, muscle, bone, spinal cord, heart, lungs,

liver, kidney with suprarenal capsules, spleen, intestines, and even sexual organs.

   In another central section of a bantam chick, the peculiar lung structure of the
bird is displayed, and the singularly beautiful insertion of rudimentary feathers.
Those of the rat and dog (which are made longitudinally through the centre of the
entire body) display the brain and whole length of spinal cord.

   In another section of a human foetus of between two and three months' growth,
it was seen that the vascular system had progressed to such an extent as to receive

a partial carmine injection.

In carefully examining and comparing (with different degrees of magnifying

power) these and similar preparations made at a very early period of foetal

life, it will be seen that a distinct general mapping out of orgeats exists, before an
equally corresponding change can be traced in the shape and character of those
cells which are concerned in forming these organs. There is no doubt, however

that a differentiation of character takes place in many of these cells to a far Greater

extent than  is revealed  by mere microscopic inspection                                                                                                                       for when the preparations

taken place in many cells which differ very little in appearance from others.

  We may thus see that special local chemical changes take place before the physical

structure of each particular organ is fully developed.

The following particulars were also referred to :

   1st. The large relative size of the liver, in nearly all the specimens, as compared
with the same organ in the adult animal.

   2nd. The smallness of the cerebellum in the mammal foetus, and its largeness in

the bird.

   3rd. The large size of the spinal cord anl posterior ganglia, both in the bird and

mammal fetus, when compared with that of the adult animal.

                     On certain Physiological Experiments with Ozone.

                      By Dr. B. W. Richardson, M.A., F.li.C.P.

    The following are the reliable facts known up to this time respecting ozone :

    1. Ozone in a natural state of the air is always present in the air in minute pro-
 portions, viz., one part in ten thousand.

    2. It is destroyed in large towns, and with special rapidity in crowded, close, and

 filthy localities.

    3. Ozone gives to oxygen properties which enables it to support life. In this
 respect it acts like heat*: its effects are destroyed by great heat.

  --4. Ozone diffused through air in excessive quantities produces, on inhalation,

distinct symptoms of acute catarrh common cold.

   5. When animals are subjected to air richly charged with ozone, the symptoms

produced, at a temperature of 75°, are those of inflammation of the throat and pul-
monary mucous membrane, and at last of congestive bronchitis, which in carnivo-
rous animals is often rapidly fatal.

   6. When animals are subjected for a long period to ozone in small proportions,

the agent acts differently, according to the animal. The carnivora die, after some

hours, from disorganization of the blood and separation of fibrine ; but the herbivora
will live for weeks, and will suffer from no acute disease.

    7. The question whether the presence of ozone in the air can produce actual dis-
ease must be answered cautiously. Science has yet no actual demonstrative evi-
dence on the point. But the facts approach to demonstration that common cold
(catarrh) is induced by this agent. All else is as yet speculative.

    8. During periods of intense heat of weather, the ozone loses its active power.

   9. On dead organic matter undergoing putrefaction ozone acts rapidly ; it en-

tirely deodorizes by breaking up the ammoniacal products of decomposition.
    10. There is an opposite condition of air in which the oxygen is rendered nega-

tive in its action, as compared with the air when it is charged with ozone. Air
can thus be rendered negative by merely subjecting it, over and over again, to ani-
mals for respiration. The purification of such air from carbonic acid and other

tangible impurities does not render it capable of supporting healthy life; but ozone
restores the power. In a negative condition of air, the purification of the organic

matter is greatly modified, and the offensive products are increased. Woimds be-

come unhealthy; and heal slowly in such negative air.

   11. There is no demonstrative evidence, as yet, that any diseases are actually
caused by this negative condition of air; but the inference is fair, that diseases
which show a putrefactive tendency are influenced injuriously by a negative condi-
tion of the oxygen of the air. It is also probable that during this state decomposing
organic poisonous matters become more injurious.

   12. As ozone is used up in crowded localities, and as it is essential that ozone

should be constantly supplied in order to sustain the removal of decomposing sub-
stances and their products, no mere attention to ventilation and other mechanical

measures of a sanitary kind can be fully effective unless the air introduced be made
active by ozone. Fever hospitals and other large buildings in towns should be ar-

tificially fed with ozonized air.

  A few Remarks on the Causes of the Cattle Murrain. By Dr. Skettle.

On Variability as manifested in the Construction of the Human Body.
                    By William Turner, M.B., F.U'.S.E.

After alluding to the diversities in the external form of the body, which impart

characters generally recognized as diagnostic not only of the race but of the indi-

vidual, the author proceeded to show that variations also occurred in the different

organic systems ; and though no outward evidence of the existence of many of

these variations may be manifested, yet they furnish the individuals in whom they

occur with characters as distinctive as any peculiarities of external configuration.

Hence, in the development of each individual, a morphological specialization occurs

both in internal structure and external form, by which distinctive characters are

conferred, so that each man's structural individuality is an expression of the sum

of the individual variations of all the constituent parts of his frame. The illustra-

tions advanced in support of the author's opinions were taken from the flexor

muscles of the fingers and toes, and from the modifications in the form and size

of a foramen called supracondyloid, which is occasionally met with in man, and of

the objects passing through it. Of the variations in the flexor muscles of the

lingers, the author especially pointed out the different slips not imfrequently met

with connecting together the muscles or subdivisions of muscles situated not only

on the same plane but on the superficial and deep planes. Of the variations occur-

ring in connexion with the flexor muscles of the toes, the different modes in which

the connecting slip passes from the long flexor of the great toe to the common

flexor of the toes were analyzed in fifty feet. In eleven it ended solely in the deep

tendon for the second toe                                                                                                                     in twenty in the deep tendons for the second and  third
                                                                                                                                           ;

toes ; in eighteen in the deep tendons for the second, third, and fourth toes ; in one

in the deep tendon for the second, third, fourth, and fifth toes. Each of these

specimens again possessed characters which distinguished it from any other. In

nine cases a connecting band passed from the common flexor to the long flexor of

the great toe. Variations in the mode of arrangement of the accessory flexor, the

short flexor, and the lumbricales in the fifty feet examined were also described. The

differences which tbe supracondyloid process of the humerus exhibited in specimens

dissected by the author were also pointed out, and the variations in the objects

--passing through the foramen which it assists in forming were summarized as fol-

lows : 1st. Both brachial artery and median nerve may go through it. 2nd. With a

high division of the brachial artery,the ulnar artery and median nerve may go through
it. 3rd. With a high division of the brachial artery, the radial artery "and median
nerve may pass through it. 4th. The median nerve' with only a small* branch of the
brachial artery, may pass through it. 5th. The median nerve, unaccompanied by
any vessel, may go through it. Variability in construction was not manifested

merely in different individuals ; but in the same person corresponding structures on

opposite sides of the body were by no means symmetrically disposed. How far

these variations were produced by the conditions of life of the individual, or how

far they might be due to hereditary transmission, were questions which for the

present must be left undetermined.

             Victoria Falls of the River Zambesi. By T. Baines.

The author visited the Victoria Falls of the Zarnbesi in 1862, during- a journey

which he undertook, in company of Mr. James Chapman, with the object of tra-

versing the continent of Africa, from Walvisch Bay on the west coast to Quilimane

on the east, by way of Lake N'gami and the Zambesi river. They spent three weeks

surveying the Falls, Mr. Chapinan photographing, and Mr. Baines sketching the

scenery ; the result being a more accurate delineation than had previously been given

of this remarkable geographical feature of Central Africa, which was discovered, as

is well known, by Dr. Livingstone in 1855. The cataract is formed by the river, at

a point where it is nearly 2000 yards wide, plunging into a deep narrow chasm

(lying across its bed), about 400 feet deep and from 70 to 130 yards wide ; the

waters escaping from this by a narrow gate near the eastern end and pursuing their

course to the lower country along a narrow gorge, prolonged for a great distance in

extremely abrupt windings, traces of which are to be seen 800 miles below the cata-

Aract. cloud of spray, resembling smoke, issues from the depths of the chasm, and

rises, as was ascertained by the author, to a height of 1200 feet ; from this and the

roar of the waters is derived the native Makalolo name of the Falls, " Mosi-oa-

Atunya " " the smoke sounding."                                                                      luxuriant tropical forest, teeming with animal

life, surrounds the cataract, and also the river above it ; but the country further down,

lacking the fertilizing influence of the river, sunk deep below the surface, is of the

usual African aridity. The author described in some detail the various excursions

he undertook through the difficult country round about the Falls, in search of good

points  for  sketching them                                                                          but owing  to their great  extent,  it  was impossible  to
                                                                                                  ;

obtain a good general view from any point, though many partial ones of great beauty
may be found. The whole Fall is broken into a number of minor cataracts, one of

which, at the western end, is more sloping than the rest, on account of the rocky

edge of the Fall being worn away. At this part there is a greater volume of falling

water than elsewhere, and it rushes down the steep incline in a fleecy, seething

torrent, scattering spray that flashes like myriads of diamonds in the sunlight, the

rainbow formed by the unclouded tropic sun upon the rising vapour being one of

the most brilliant and beautiful objects it is possible to conceive.

               Letter from Mr. Samuel Baker to Sir R. I. Mttrchison.

   My -- " Khartum, April 30.

   " dear Sm, I arrived here yesterday, and trust to be in England shortly after
you receive this. I thank you for your very welcome letter, which reached me in
Unyoro, delivered by an Arab trader on the 20th of September, 1864. Your appre-

ciation of my researches among the various Nile tributaries in 1861 gave me great

pleasure, and was a timely stimulus at a moment when I was ill and broken down

with fever.

   " I had the good fortune to meet Captains Speke and Grant at Gondokoro, in

February 1863. The object of my expedition being attained by meeting them, and

by their discovery of the Victoria Nyanza Nile-head, I should have returned with
them had not Captain Speke reported that he had heard of a lake called by the

natives Luta Nzige\ This, he imagined, might be a second source of the Nile, and

I at once determined to attempt its exploration.

  " My boats departed from Gondokoro for Khartum with Captains Speke and
Grant, but when I was about to start the whole of my men mutinied and refused
to proceed, retaining possession of my arms and ammunition. The ivory traders of

travellers' reports upon the slave trade. The chance of being able to proceed ap-

peared hopeless. Being resolved not to be driven back, and rinding it impossible

to lead my men south, I at length induced eighteen of my mutineers to accompany
me to the camp of one of the traders, E.S.E. of Gondokoro about 80 miles, whence
I hoped to be able to alter my course. Having loaded my camels and asses, I started
at night, without either interpreter or guide, neither of whom were procurable, all
the natives being under the influence of the traders. On passing the station of an
Arab trader, six days from Gondokoro, my men, who had previously conspired to

--Prince I named it (subject to Her Majesty's permission) the ' Albert Nyanza,' as the

second great source of the Nile second, not in importance, but only in order of dis-

covery, to the Victoria Nile-head. The Victoria and the Albert lakes are the indu-

bitable parents of the river.

Myout is wooded, interspersed with glades, thinly populated, with no game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    route

elevation was 3686 feet. The rocks were all gneiss, granite, and masses of iron ore,

apparently fused into a conglomerate with rounded quartz pebbles.
   " The Albert Lake is a vast basin lying in an abrupt depression, the cliffs, which

I descended by a difficult pass, being 1470 feet above its level. The lake level is
2720 feet, being 1341 feet lower than the Nile at M'rooli ; accordingly the drainage
of the country tends from east to west. From the high ground above the lake no
land is visible to the south and south-west ; but north-west and west is a large

range of mountains, rising to about 7000 feet above the lake level, forming the
western shore, and running south-west parallel to the course of the lake. Both

King Kamrasi and the natives assured me that the lake is known to extend into

Kumanika's country to the west of Karagwe, but from that point, in about 1° 30'

S. lat., it turns suddenly to the west, in which direction its extent is unknown. In

N. lat. 1° 14', where I reached the lake, it is about 60 miles wide, but the width

increases southward.                                       The     water  is  deep, sweet, and                                                                                                                                     transparent                                       the shores are

    " I navigated the lake in a canoe formed of a hollow tree for thirteen days from

Vacovia, arriving at Magungo, at the junction of the Nile with the lake, in N. lat.

2° 16'.   The  voyage                                was    long,  owing      to                                                                                                                                   the  necessity  of coasting,  and                                 to  the  heavy

    "At the Nile junction the lake had contracted to a width of about 20 miles;

the shores were no longer clean, but vast masses of reeds growing in deep water

prevented the canoe from landing. Mountains had ceased on the eastern shore,

giving place to hills about 500 feet high, which instead of rising abruptly from the

lake, like the mountains further south, were five or six miles distant, the ground

descending in undulations to the lake. The entrance of the Nile is a broad channel

of deep but dead water, bounded on either side by vast banks of reeds. From this

point the lake extends to the north-west for about 40 miles, and then turns to the

west, contracting gradually ; extent unknown.

    * About 20 miles north of the Nile junction at Magimgo the river issues from the

great reservoir, and continues its course to Gondokoro.

    " I went up the Nile in a canoe from the junction ; the natives would proceed no

further north, owing to the hostile tribes on the lake shores. About 10 miles from

the junction the Nile channel contracted to about 250 yards in width, with little per-

ceptible stream, very deep, and banked as usual with high reeds, the country on either

side undulating and wooded. The course from the junction up the river being east,

at about 20 miles from Magungo, my voyage suddenly terminated ; a stupendous

waterfall of about 120 feet perpendicular height stopped all further progress. Above

the great fall the river is suddenly confined between rocky hills, and it races through

" Lake Albert Nyanza forms an immense basin far below the level of the adjacent

country, and receives the entire drainage of extensive mountain ranges on the west,

and of the Utumbi, Uganda, and Unyoro countries on the east. Eventually re-

ceiving the Nile itself, it adds its accumulated waters and forms the second source

of that mighty river. The voyage down the lake is extremely beautiful, the moun-

tains frequently rising abruptly from the water, while numerous cataracts rush

down their furrowed sides. The cliffs on the east shore are granite, frequently

mixed with large masses of quartz.

forms the trade of the miserable villages which at Ion"- intervals are situated on

the Unyoro shore. The natives are extremely inhospitable, in many cases refusing

to sell provisions. Mallegga, on the west coast of the lake, is a large and powerful

country, governed by a king named Kajoro, who possesses boats sufficiently large

to cross the lake. The Mallegga trade largely with Kamrasi, bringing ivory and

beautifully-prepared skins and mantles in exchange for salt, brass-coil bracelets,

cowries, and beads, all of which articles, excepting salt, come from Zanzibar via

Karagwe*, there being no communication with the west coast of Africa.

On certain Simious Skulls, tvith especial reference to a Skull from Louth, in

            Ireland. By C. Caster Blaxe, Ph.D., F.G.S., F.A.S.L.

   The author said the skull exhibited was the property of the Anthropological
Society of London. It was presented to their Museum by Captain Montgomery
Moore, who obtained it from Louth Abbey, in Ireland. Nothing more is known
of its history. The attention which has been drawn, during the last few years, to
the celebrated skull from the Neanderthal, in Germany, renders any skull which
at all resembles it in its most striking aspect of peculiar interest. M. Primer- Bey
was the first who pointed out the close resemblance between the skull from the

Neanderthal and those of existing Irishmen. Professor Wm. King, of Galway, in

his comparison of the Neanderthal skull with the more normal examples of human
crania, refers frequently to a skull from Corcomroo Abbey, County Clare, Leland,
which, from his description, appears to present some points of affinity witli the skull
from Louth now exhibited. The Louth skull was ovately dolichocephalic. The
brow-ridges are large, and the points of muscular attachment are well marked. The
frontal suture has been early obliterated, and no trace whatever exists. The length

of the sagittal suture is 11 '4 centimetres. Throughout the whole of the posterior

two-thirds of its length, obliteration has proceeded to such an extent as entirely to
obscure the indications which woidd have shown its proportions, direction, or ser-
ration. The lambdoidal suture is present on each side, in an upward direction, for
about two inches from its junction with the additamentum mastoidaUs. The coronal
suture offers some points of interest. Partial obliteration has extended through-
out the whole of its course, excepting the deeply serrated portion above the post-
                                               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               115

orbital and temporal ridges. The condition of the sutures around the alisphenoid

hone demands our special attention. It is only necessary to say that on the left

side the spheno-frontal and spheno-parietal sutures are entirely closed, whilst not

the slightest trace exists of their direction. Turning, however, to the right side,

Athe shape of the posterior edge of the alisphenoid becomes manifest. long narrow

tongue of bone extends in front of the squamosal, and is partially confluent with

the parietal, especially at the extreme anterior corner of the latter. It has also

become, to a less extent, though still definitely, coalescent with the frontal bone.
This coalescence is especially interesting, as, although upon the right side of the
skull, it has taken place upon a spot apparently free from the erosive action which

has taken place on the posterior right portion of the skull. It is only necessary to

say that, with respect to the squamous suture, no peculiarities meet the eye of the

observer. The connexion between the mastoid and squamosal bones is obliterated

to a great extent, but not more so than is usually observable in aged individuals.
The brow-ridges are exceedingly peculiar. Enormous frontal sinuses have developed

a bony ridge, which extends above the eyes throughout the whole length of the

supraciliaries, and is thickest and most pronounced immediately below the glabella.

The supraorbital canal on the right side is higher than on the left. Proportio-
nately to the size of the ridge, the supranasal notch does not appear deep. The

forehead is rather low and retrocedent, apparently rendered more so by the great

size of the supraciliary ridges. The curve of the frontal bone, backwards and up-

wards, is equable and smooth. When a line from the glabella to the inion is made

horizontal, the greatest height of the skull is situated about an inch behind the

junction of the sagittal and coronal sutures. When the Abbe Frere's line from the

meatus auditorius to the centre of the coronal suture is made vertical, the most

posterior part of the skull is situated about an inch and a half lower than the apex
of the lambdoid suture, and the same distance above the inion. The line of greatest

breadth of the skull will be found in a line drawn from the spot of greatest height

to the apex of the mastoid process. The parietal bones are very slightly flattened

between the line of the sagittal and the line of attachment of the temporal muscle.

The traces of the latter are not remarkably prominent. From the above descrip-

tion of the skull, the author considered that the following conclusions can safely be

drawn.

The contracted forehead is due to the premature closing of the sutures surround-

ing the alisphenoid bone, and the lower medial part of the coronal suture. In

early life, the frontal and alisphenoid bones being firmly imited with the adjacent

ones in such a way as to form a bony plate, the same conditions were observed as

described by Dr. B. Davis, in his paper on the Neanderthal skull. " It will thus

be seen that there is nothing either of a siniious character, or that might not have
been expected in the low forehead of the Neanderthal skull, in which the brain

had to grow and expand under a plate of bone, which appears to have been in a

great degree in one solid piece. It was impossible to raise this plate of bone up-

wards                                and  the  result,  as will  be  seen, was a development  to  another  direction.
                                  ;

In the middle region of the calvaria, the sagittal suture being closed, the contained

cerebral substance could only expand at the sides, in the situation of the squamous

sutures ; and here the Neanderthal calvarium seems not to lack development. But

in the posterior region its greatest expansion took place, precisely because in this

part was the open lambdoid suture, which admitted of the growth of the brain. In

the figures of this imperfect calvarium, the superior occipital scale is seen to be

bulged out, and the whole of what remains of the occipital bone is frdl and large

the compensatory result for the contracted anterior regions." The above words,

which Dr. B. Davis applies to the Neanderthal skull, can be applied, mutatis mu-

tandis, to the skull from Louth. The peculiarities which were alleged to be so

specially characteristic of the Neanderthal skull having been proved to be due

merely to the premature closing of certain sutures, the fact is not remarkable that

such skulls as the specimen, " 1029 of Davis," or as the skull before us, shoidd be

encountered not unfrequently. Attention having been drawn to the influence

which premature closing of the sutures produces on the form of the skull, it is pro-

bable that we shall find many other instances. But the occasional occurrence of

such cases leads an anthropologist deeply to regret that such an abnormity as the

                                                                                                   8*
116 REPORT 1865,

Neanderthal skull should have ever been put forward as an important link in the

series of early forms, connecting man with the lower animals, and to hope that a

similar error of generalization will not occur again in our science. Although to

allude to the Neanderthal skull, in the present state of the controversy, may appear

to some a superfluous digression, the lesson cannot be too often insisted on, that in
examining a skull purporting to be that of " the missing link," it should have
been worth while to have inquired whether its peculiarities were not in some

degree traceable to the premature ossification of the sutures of the skull.

     Explorations in the Interior of Vancouver Island. By K. Beown.

An expedition, equipped by the Vancouver Island Exploration Committee, and

commanded by Mr. R. Brown, explored a large portion of the hitherto almost un-

known interior of Vancouver Island, in the summer of 1864. The party, which

comprised an astronomer, an artist, and a naturalist, besides a staff of assistants and

native hunters, first traversed the island from Cowichan Harbour to the fortified

Indian village of Whyack, near the "False Nittinaht" of the Admiralty charts.

During this journey the great Cowichan Lake was well explored. It was found to

be 22 miles in length, and from one-half to three-fourths of a mile in breadth, sur-

rounded by two distinct ranges of mountains, from 2000 to 3000 feet in height.

From the lake Mr. Brown struck across a well-timbered country to the south-west

until he reached the Nittinaht  River                       on this stream  the party embarked in rafts,
                                                         ;

and arrived, after a dangerous journey down the rapids, at a broad inlet of the sea,

18 miles in length, the shores of which are studded with Indian villages. The inlet

opens to the Pacific by a very narrow passage between cliffs. The next journey was

performed by Lieut. Leech, the second in command, when the island was crossed a

second time, from Sooke Harbour to Cowichan Harbour. The expedition then pro-

ceeded by sea to Nanaimo, on the east coast, and after exploring the various

branches of the Courtenay River, and discovering extensive beds of coal, again

crossed the island in the direction of the Central Lake, discovering, on the way,

five new lakes and several rivers. The Central Lake they found to be a dreary ex-

panse of water, 18 miles long. Leaving its shores they proceeded by land to Klee-

coot Lake, another large sheet of water, and thence to the Alberni settlement

finally recrossing to Nanaimo. Mr. Brown and Lieut. Leech report the whole of

the  interior  as  rugged  and  mountainous,                but  well  wooded                                  gold and other minerals

were found in various places, but very little pastoral land. Between Nanaimo and

Alberni there are four distinct ranges of mountains, the culminating peaks of which

range from 3700 to 5500 feet in height.

                 Ascent of the River Purus. By W. Chandless.

   The Purus is one of the least known of the great tributaries of the Amazons, and

has been a subject of great interest, not only to geographers but to the people of
Peru and Brazil, from the fact that a few native traders sailing up it in canoes have
reported it free from impediments to navigation, and from the supposition that the
fine stream, the Madre de Bios, flowing from the southern provinces of Peru, formed

its head-water. The Brazilians were further interested in it on account of the
report that there was water communication between it and the great river Madeira
above the cataracts, which might serve as an outlet for the productions of the inte-
rior province of Matto Grosso. In modern times, the Brazilian Government had
despatched four expeditions from the Amazons up the river; but none of them had
solved the problems connected with it, or made accurate geographical observations
durinf the voyage. Mr. Chandless, therefore, undertook to explore it in detail by

his own unaided resources. He obtained, by a fortunate circumstance, a crew of

Bolivian Indians to navigate his canoe, and taking with him a complete outfit of

instruments for observation, entered its mouth on the 12th of June, 1864. He

continued his voyage until, on the 23rd of December, the river was so narrow and

impeded with rocks that he could go no further. He was then 1866 miles from its
mouth, and at an altitude of only 1088 feet above the sea-level. He penetrated as

far as he could up both of the terminal forks of the river ; but neither proved to be

the Madre de Dios, being about 2° of latitude to the N.N.W. of that river, and

lying in a position in which one of the eastern tributaries of the TTcayali is marked
on the maps. The forest was everywhere so dense and lofty that from no point
could a yiew be obtained of the Andes, although Mr. Chandless supposed they
would be visible. Near these upper waters a primitive tribe of Indians was met

with, who had never had intercourse with white men or with the trading Indians
lower down ; they were ignorant of the use of iron, and possessed hatchets of

stone.

The author commenced by avowing that he was aware that the subject of his paper

was an unpalatable one, but asked his hearers to take into account the fact that the

inhabitants of Europe were at one time quite as savage as many existing cannibal
races. He quoted the testimony of many ancient authors in favour of the existence of

cannibalism among the Lsestrygones, the Lamise, and the Cyclopes. Many ancient

writers had advocated the theory that it was more reasonable to eat human flesh

Athan to leave it a prey to worms and to putrefaction.                       French author had stated

that human flesh did not differ appreciably in taste from that of domestic animals,

and that the moral crime of cannibalism consisted in the murder and not in the use

of the body as food. St. Jerome's well-known testimony in favour of the existence

of cannibalism amongst the Attacoli or Attacoti of Scotland was cited, as well as

that of Diodorus Sicidus respecting the Galatce, and that of Herodotus respecting

the Issedones. In the middle ages cannibalism was usually attributed to all nations

which had not embraced Christianity ; it was fashionable to bring the accusation

against enemies, and the Saracens and Christians during the Crusades charged each

other with devouring the flesh of slain prisoners. According to Reinard, Tarik the

Moor served up the flesh of his prisoners to his troops. In Milan, in 1519, a woman
was condemned to death for enticing into her house children, whom she killed and

salted. In 1782 a French bandit was broken on the wheel for the murder of young

women and children whom he devoured. In the reign of Elizabeth a Scotch ban-

dit, Sawney Bean, was executed for cannibalism, and other instances were cited

from Germany and Spain. In the latter country a law existed by which a father

besieged in his lord's castle and pressed by hunger might eat his own son rather

than surrender the castle. During the siege of Calahorra, this law was acted on.

                              The Oriental Negro. By J. Ckawftjed, F.B.S., F.G.S.

Under the designation of " Oriental Negroes," this paper describes no fewer than

seven different races, all differing not only from the African Negro, but widely dif-

fering among themselves in physical form and in language. The Negroes of the

Andaman Islands, of the Malay Peninsida, are pigmies of some 4 feet 9 inches

.high                         the Papuan Negroes  of New Guinea rise to the  average of 5 feet 4 inches
                           ;

while those of the Fiji group reach 5 feet 7 inches, or are of the ordinary stature

of Europeans. In view of all the Negro races of man, whether Occidental or

Oriental, the conclusion to which the writer comes is, that they are inferior to all

the other races in juxtaposition to them. In Africa the Negro is inferior to the

Mauritanian, the Egyptian, the Nubian, and the settlers from Arabia and India.

In the Malay Peninsula, in the Philippines, and New Guinea, he is inferior to the

Malay, and in the isles of the Pacific he is ininieasurably below the brown

straight-haired Polynesian. It is especially his mental inferiority that makes the

Negro everywhere liable to be domineered over or enslaved by the more highly

gifted races.

On the Physical and Mental Characteristics of the African or Occidental Negro.

                          By J. Ckawftjrd, F.B.S., F.G.S.

The Negro was defined by the author as a human being with the hair of the head

 and  other parts of          the  body always    black  and  more  or       less  woolly                          with  a  black

skin of various shades ; dark eyes, a flat face, depressed nose, jutting jaws, thick

lips and large mouth ; with oblique incisor teeth. To this was to be added a pecu-

liar odour of the skin, offensive to and unknown in the other races of man. He

did not think that the form of the skull, in so far as it is the brain-case, could be
insisted on as a criterion of the African Negro, for he did not believe it had any
characters by which it could certainly be distinguished from the skulls of nearly-

allied races, such as those of the Abyssinians and of the Oriental Negroes. The
word Negro was obviously a corruption of the Latin adjective for "black." The
intellectual character of Negroes might be judged of by the low grade of civiliza-

tion which they had attained, notwithstanding that their country has furnished

--them with nearly all the appliances that contribute to social progress fertile soil,
--cultivable cereals, domesticable animals, useful metals, and so forth in a far higher

degree than the most advanced nations of native America and the fairer race of the
Pacific isles. One remarkable example of the obtuseness of the African Negro was
his never having tamed the elephant, which is far more abundant in his country
than in any other part of the world. The African elephant is, indeed, a distinct
species from the Indian, but it is equally amenable to domestication, as sufficiently

attested by the well-ascertained fact of the African being the elephant domesticated
by the Carthaginians, a people of Asiatic origin, whose example the African Ne-
groes have not had the capacity even to imitate. The Negro also had never shown
ingenuity enough to invent letters, symbolic or phonetic.

On Cannibalism in Relation to Ethnology, By J. Crawfurd, F.R.S., F.G.S.

The argument of this paper was to the effect that the early races of men, origi-

nally eaters of the raw flesh of animals, were driven at a subsequent stage of pro-

gress, when wild animals had become scarce, to eat the bodies of their slain

enemies. This was the stage of cannibalism, and it ceased when, pressed by a

diminishing supply of food, human ingenuity was stimulated to invent means for

augmenting it by cultivating vegetable food and domesticating animals. In classic

times the Greeks and Romans, and all the tribes and nations with which they held

intercourse, had reached this stage, and Herodotus is the only classic writer who

Wecharges two Asiatic nations with cannibalism.  have other evidence, however,

of the ancestors of the most civilized nations of Europe and Asia eating human

flesh, in the disinterment from grottos of human bones artificially split for the ex-

traction of marrow, and so forth. Cannibalism was formerly, and is still practised

by South American Indians, as well as by the New Zealanders and the inhabitants

of many islands in the Pacific and in the Malay Archipelago. The author particu-

larly cited the cannibalism of the New Zealanders as a case in support of his view

that savages are prompted to cannibalism by the deficiency of other animal food.

        On the Isthmus of Panama" and Inter-Oceanic Ship Canal Routes.

                                      By Dr. Cullen.

   This was a review of the various routes which have been hitherto proposed for
a ship canal across the narrower parts of America, namely, those of Tehuantepec,
Honduras (from Puerto Caballos to Fonseca Bay), Nicaragua, Chiriqui, Panama,
Chepo, Atrato and San Juau, Atrato, Napipi and Cupica, Atrato and Truando, and
lastly, that of Darien, from Caledonian Harbour to the Gulf of San Miguel. The
author gave the preference to the last-mentioned line, which he had himself ex-
plored some years ago. It is the only one, except that of Chiriqui, which supplies
the indispensable conditions of a good harbour at each end. The failure of the
various expeditions sent out in 1853 to discover a practicable line for a canal, was
attributed by the author to the refusal or inability of the siu'veyors, Mr. L. Gis-

--borne and others, to examine the only point where a passage of the mountains was

practicable a break in the chain inland of Caledonia Harbour. The Cordillera is
stated to consist here of two separate chains, the extremities of which overlap each
other, leaving between them a valley, running at an angle of about 20° with the coast.

In 1860 a partial exploration of this line was made by MM. Bourdiol, De Puydt

and Bourcier, and again, in 1861, by the same gentlemen and M. de Champville.

In 1861 a further examination was made by MM. de Puydt and Tronchon ; and

in the spring of the present year applications were presented to the Congress at

Bogota, by two companies and three firms, for a privilege to cut a canal by this

line. The length of a canal in this part would be thirty -five geographical miles.

A careful survey is still required of the oblique valley in the Cordillera, the

highest point of which probably does not exceed 250 feet.

On the Influence of Civilization upon the development of the Brain in the
          different Races of Man. By Eobert Dunn, F.B. C.S.

The author began by premising, as a basis for his observations, the following

postulates :

   1. That the brain or encephalon is the material organ of the mind.

 --2. That there exists a close correspondence in form and size between the cerebrum

and its outward bony covering the skull ; so that the varying forms of the human

cranium indicate, as outward and visible signs, with certain well understood quali-
fications, corresponding differences or changes in the shape and size of the cerebral

substance within.

  3. That the genus Homo is one ; and that all the races of the great family of man

are endowed with the same intuitions, sensational, perceptive, and intellectual

the same mental activities, however they may differ in degree ; and that they all
have the essential constituent elements in common of a moral, religious, and intel-

lectual nature.

He  waived  the  question  as  to  the  monogenesis  or                                                       polygenesis  of  man                         but  asserted
                                                                                                                                                        ;

that from all historic times there have existed, and do still exist, aboriginal and

typical races of men, widely differing from each other, and easily distinguishable

by well-marked physical and psychical characters : such, for instance, are the Ne-

groes of Africa, the Mongols of Asia, the red men of America, and the white men

of Europe. From time immemorial, he said, there have always existed, besides the

rude and savage hordes of hunters and fishers, two forms or phases of civilization^

the nomadic or the pastoral, and   the agricultural                                                           the  former  essentially stationary
                                                                                                           ;

in its character, but the latter eminently and strikingly progressive

Now, among the purely nomadic races, Mr. Dunn observed, where civilization is

stationary, there exists, as might be expected, a uniform sameness and characteristic

Ji.iitg in the shape of the head, strikingly in contrast with what is seen to prevail

among the agricultural races and cultivated Europeans. He dwelt on the import-

. ance of viewing in contrast, the typical crania of the Negroes or Australian savages,

 the Mongolian   nomades, and  the      cultivated Europeans ;                                                     maintaining                             that,  as  the

.

skull is the outward measure and index of the brain's development within, we are

able fairly to estimate the relative size and comparative developmont of its three

great divisions, the anterior, middle, and posterior lobes ; nay, among the typical

races, to recognize distinctive characters impressed and stamped upon their varying

crania, as indisputable evidence of degradation and elevation of type. In proof of

this, he adverted to the prognathous type as one of degradation. In striking con-

trast to this, he adduced as a type of elevation, that of the orthognathic, seen among

the European nations, the Saxons, Celts, and Scandinavians, where the jaws are

upright and not projecting, the face scarcely, if at all protruding beyond the fore-

 head ; and where, in place of the narrow, low and retreating forehead, associated

. with largely developed, massive, and projecting bones of the face and jaws, we are

struck with the symmetrical contour of the head, its size, and lateral fulness ; but

above all, with the elevation of the forehead in proportion to the size of the face,

and with its broad, expansive, and towering height, clearly indicating a harmonious

development of the whole brain, and a special fulness in the intellectual and moral

regions.

   From the skulls he proceeded to the comparison of the brains themselves, and
stated what were the views and convictions of his own mind, viz., that the anterior

lobes are the seat' of the intellectual, the middle of the personal or individual, and

the posterior of the social and affectional activities or attributes of the human mind.
  He remarked, that as the anterior lobes of the brain are the seat of the intellectual
--120 REPORT 1865.

activities of the mind, fulness of development and complexity of structure are sure
indications of elevation of type ; and that the converse, as Gratiolet, from extended
observations has amply shown, is equally true, viz., that simplicity of structure and
perfect symmetry of shape and arrangement in the convolutions on both sides of the
hemispheres, are indisputable marks of degradation of function.

   He looked forward to the microscopical examination of the ultimate structure of

the grey matter of the brain in the typical races of man, as pregnant with the most
interesting and instructive results. Already Dr. Beale and Mr. Lockhart Clarke
had proved to demonstration that perceptible differences exist in the minute anatomy

of the grey matter of the convolutions in the brain of man and that of the monkey

and the highest anthropoid apes. Dr. Beale had succeeded in demonstrating the con-
nexion between the nerve-cells and the very finest fibres in the grey matter of the
convolutions ; and he maintains that the central cells of every nervous instrument
form, with the peripheral nerve- cells and connecting nerve-fibres, uninterrupted cir-
cuits ; and that all nerve-cells are connected with, or give origin to, at least two
fibres. Mr. Lockhart Clarke had shown that certain structural differences are seen in
the grey matter of the convolutions of the anterior, middle, and posterior lobes.

  --He concluded by adverting to the historical bearings of his subject to the evi-

dence which is presented by history of the conversion, in time, of one type of hu-
manity into that of another, under the influence of outward circumstances, social
states, and intellectual culture. As illustrative instances, he adduced the case of
the transplanted Negroes in America and the West Indies ; amongst the Asiatic or
Mongolian races, the Turks of Europe and the Magyars of Hungary, and amongst
ourselves, as instances of degradation, the Irish of Leitrim and Sligo, and the vaga-

bond nomades who infest our large cities and towns.

    In proof of cranial alterations for the better, from the influence of improved so-
cial conditions and higher intellectual activities, he directed attention to some casts
exhibited, taken at different periods from the same individuals. Iu each case the
interval was not a period of leisure, but of great mental activity ; and the result
in each was seen in the decided enlargement and development of the anterior part

of the forehead.

      On the Worked Flints of Pressigny le Grand. By J. Evans, F.B.S.

    Pressigny le Grand is a small town situated on the river Claise, about thirty
miles to the south of Tours. The peculiar worked flints which the author had
found there in January last, in company with the late Mr. Christy and Messrs.
 Brouillet and Lartet, were discovered in a soil of red loam overlying bryozoic
 chalk, and from their resemblance to pounds of butter, have received from the pea-
 sants the name of livres-dc-bcurre. Their form has been given by striking a suc-
 cession of flakes from the sides of a mass of flint until a boat-like contour has been
 obtained. Looking at a number of them arranged together, the eye is struck by
 their great similarity of form ; and the regular and neat manner in which their
 edges are chipped would at first sight lead to a presumption that they were intended
 for implements, such as ploughshares, or some kind of large and heavy axes. Those

 persons, however, who have paid most attention to the subject have come to the

 conclusion that they are not implements at all, but rather the nuclei or cores from
 which long flakes or knives have been removed, and which have then been thrown
 away as having served their purpose. The supposition of Messrs. Robert and Elie
 de Beaumont, that they are the refuse arising from the manufacture upon the spot
  of flints for fire-arms, was believed to be untenable, on account of their utter dissi-

  milarity to the cores known to be the result of gun-flint manufactories. It seems
  more probable that there must have been in prehistoric times a settlement on the
  spot, of men who manufactured long knives from these flints, and afterwards bartered
  them away, than that they were worked by various tribes who visited the spot as one
  abounding in the raw material for their cutlery.

which could at present be drawn with safety from the admitted facts of philology,

tend strongly to favour a belief in the primitive diversity of languages, and there-

fore of human races. After noting the utter failure of all attempts to discover a

primeval language from which others had been derived, the author argued that all

on which we could at present insist, was the unity of the Semitic and Aryan families

of language, and of one or two comparatively small sporadic groups. He denied

that the unity of the so-called Turanian family was in any way established, and
endeavoured toshow that the name itself was misleading and chimerical and' that

the arguments in favour of the original unity of these languages were shadowy and
                                                                          But even if the existence of a genetic connexion
inconclusive.                                                                                                               between the mem-

                                                                       _

bers of this wide group were admitted, the author urged that there was no possibility

of deriving the number of these different families of language, either from one

another or from any one common source. The radical and fundamental differences

of conception which mark the Aryan and Semitic grammatical systems, were such as

marked them as the intellectual product of two wholly distinct races, and there

was no conceivable theory, even if a vast series of years were postulated, which

would account for the derivation of the one from the other ; and each of these systems

was separated from Chinese by a still broader and deeper chasm, a chasm which

could not be bridged over by any legitimate deduction from the known history and

indisputable facts of the growth and decay of languages throughout the world.

Hence it was concluded that the languages, no less than the flora and fauna of va-

rious nations, originated in different geographical centres.

        On the Exploration of the Holy Land, as proposed faj the Palestine

                 Exploration Fund. By George Geove, Hon. Sec.

   The author said, notwithstanding the numerous books of travel that had been
published respecting Palestine, we were still in great ignorance with regard to much
that concerned the life of the existing people. No work on that country had been
written similar to that of Mr. Lane on the Modern Egyptians. It had been said with
truth that if the Lower Nile valley and its inhabitants were swept away, we should
still have preserved to us a complete picture of the nations which have peopled it, in
this exhaustive work. Now, what had been done for Egypt it behoved us to endea-
vour to do for the Holy Land. "VVe knew nothing of the treasures of ancient Egypt
until they were commenced to be dug up by Belzoni. The explorations of Sir Henry
Rawlinson and Mr. Layard had, in the same manner, disclosed the remains and led
to much of our knowledge respecting the great nations which peopled the plains of
the Euphrates and Tigris. The same still remained to be done in Palestine. There

mmust be a vast amount of treasures in arms, coins, weapons, and utensils, still buried
    the soil, which would throw great light on the domestic life of the Jews. The
soil of Palestine was virgin ; not a spade had vet been put into the mounds of ruins
which existed in that country. There were great difficulties to be surmounted
in the way of carrying out these explorations, the chief one being the difficulty
which had hitherto existed of travellers being able to remain long enough in

the country. Besides, it was in the unfrequented districts that the Exploration
Society was most desirous of penetrating, and in these places travellers especially

qualified, and having the means of remaining long, are required to pursue continued
investigations. One most cogent reason for undertaking the exploration was fur-
nished by the fact, that the ancient traces were fast passing away, and the native
customs of the people disappearing before the advance of Western civilization.
There was a curious orgy, probably very similar to those formerly practised by the

priests of Baal, which had almost fallen into disuse, and such customs as this, if now
investigated, would tend to throw great light on the customs of the people. Much
also still remained to be done in the geography of the land. As an instance of the

confusion which still exists in the orthography of places, he would mention the fact

of a place being named in one map Embarreg, and in another Midniyhghih. The
sites of many of the most celebrated places in Holy Writ were yet matters of uncer-
tainty. In short, it was a systematic, leisurely, and thorough investigation of the
Holy Land which the Society proposed to themselves to undertake.

           On the Comparative Anthropology of England and Wales.
                              By D. Mackintosh, F.G.S.

The author begins by referring to a paper read by him before the Ethnological

Society of London in 1861, and published in their ' Transactions.' Since then he
has had many opportunities of confirming and adding to the theories and facts con-

tained in that paper. He believes that in most parts of England the masses of the

popidation seldom shift their localities, and that internal migrations are generally

limited to the middle and more affluent classes. The fact that different dialects still
linger in different parts of England is a proof that the inhabitants have not become

so interblended as to destroy typical distinctions, or render classification impossible.

During many years the author has succeeded in tracing a difference in type or race

in various parts of England and Wales ; and he believes that this difference is not

the result of accident, but exists through hereditary descent. It may have origi-

nated in ancient " family variations " in certain districts of Europe which have

acquired a persistent character, and which in some cases have become so hardened

as to resist amalgamation. In North Wales the autbor has been able to reduce the

principal differences observable in the physical characteristics of the inhabitants to

two types, one of which, for historical reasons, he provisionally calls Cymrian :

skull  rather   narrow and elongated                                                                                                       hair brown,  frequently very dark ;           eyes  sunk
                                                                                                                                        ;

and ill defined ; sudden sinking in under the cheek-bones ; face long, and nose more

or less prominent. The other he calls British :--skull approximately square ; face

rather flat, the upper part broad, and the lower angular ; eyes sunk, and generally

half-closed ; chest and shoulders very broad. The first type predominates in North

Wales ; and there the second is common, though much more prevalent in South

Wales, where it coexists with a very well-marked type, to which the author gives

the name Gaelic, as it is to be found not only in AVales, but among the lower

--classes in France, the south-west of England, the Higldands of Scotland, and the
west of Ireland :     skull elongated backwards forehead retreating, with the lower
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

part   of  the  face  projecting                                                   nose more or less concave, with a great distance                                                            from
                                                                                ;

the nose to the mouth. The British and Gaelic types coexist with the Saxon in

the south-west of England, but the latter is most prevalent in Sussex, some parts

--of Hampshire and Berkshire : skull intermediate between square and round,

slightly elongated,   and small in the occipital                                                                                           region                                 light  brown hair and promi-
                                                                                                                                                                               ;

nent blue eyes ; low cheek-bones, broad, smooth, and round face ; features exces-

sively regular. The author believes there is a tall and convex-profiled type in the
eastern part of the Isle of Wight and in central Kent, to which he applies the term

Jutian. He describes a type intermediate between Jutian and Saxon, and thinks

it may possibly be Frisian. In the Midland Counties, and throughout a zone
running northwards through the West Riding of Yorkshire into Durham, there is

an extensively-prevailing type, with lateral variations, which he supposes must
have settled in England under the name of Angles. The complexion is very fair,

and in many respects this type resembles the Saxon, though the features are rather

sharper, and the figure not nearly so rotundiform. In Cumberland, and other

districts shown by Worsaae to be inhabited by descendants of Norsemen, the

author has not been able to make out a very distinct predominating type. He has

no hesitation in asserting the existence of a strikingly marked and strongly per-

sistent Danish type in districts where Danes must have settled according to history,
esp'ecially Lincolnshire :-- skull rather narrow, elongated, and elevated backwards,

with projecting occipital region; hair and complexion more or less ruddy; high

nose and prominent cheek-bones ; long or rather long face, tall frame, and swinging

gait. The author describes the mental peculiarities of the different types ; speaks
more favourably of the North Welsh than most writers, especially as regards their

frugality, industry, temperance, social order, &c. The Danes are sanguine, ambi-

tious, and energetic, with great aptitude for progression in the active affairs of life,

but deficient in cogitation. Saxons are characterized by extreme moderation ac-

companying individuality, and an equal absence of great defects and extraordinary

talents. Gaels are quick in perception, deficient in foresight, excitable, and strong

in attachment. The author concludes by stating that he has intentionally left

details relating to anatomical structure and complexion out of consideration, as Dr.

Barnard Davis and Dr. Beddoe have taken up these departments, and will soon be

able to connect them with the evidence of distinct types furnished by physiognomy
and mental characteristics. As we may learn from the history of geology, it will be
only after the results of distinct lines of investigation have been grouped and gene-
ralized, that we can succeed in establishing fundamental principles on which the
superstructure of comparative anthropology can be safely erected.

On North Polar Exploration. By C. R. Markham, F.R.G.S.

The paper was a recapitulation of the arguments which the author and Captain

Sherard Osborn had urged before the Royal Geographical Society, during the last

Session, in favour of an expedition to investigate the unknown region around the

North Pole. The introduction of the subject to the Section was thought appro-

priate, as the governing body of the British Association was about to nominate a

Special Committee for the purpose of representing to Her Majesty's Government

the advantages to various branches of science which would accrue from such an

expedition. Of the two routes towards the Pole which had been proposed, namely,

those of Smith Sound and Spitzbergen, the author gave a decided preference to

the former. He contended that it was impossible to reach the Pole or perform

much scientific work by a sea voyage like that proposed via Spitzbergen, and Sir L.

Mc Clintock agreed with him in the opinion that the only way of accomplishing

these objects was by sledging parties from Smith Sound. An additional reason

for the preference of Smith Sound by an English expedition is now supplied by the

circumstance of the Germans having recently commenced, at the invitation of Dr.

Petermann, the organization of a North Polar expedition to go by the Spitzbergen

Aroute.  pioneer vessel started a few days ago, and although it had broken down

shortly after leaving Hamburg, there was little doubt that the attempt would be

renewed next year. The route via Spitzbergen was therefore preoccupied ; and
we ought to concentrate our energies on the only alternative route, namely, that

of Smith Sound.

Results of Surveys relating to the Water Supply of Jerusalem.

       HBy Capt. T. cNeill and Capt. Wilson, B.E.

This was an elaborate Report to the Syrian Improvement Committee, by the en-

gineers employed, of their surveys in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, with a view

to improve the water supply of the city, and was introduced, with additional re-

marks, by Dr. T. Hodgkin. The survey was undertaken in the autumn of 1864.

The question of the water supply of Jerusalem had been, from an early period, of

much interest, the more so on account of the natural difficulties which attended the

subject. Looking at the remains of ancient works, there is nothing to indicate that

Jerusalem ever had a large supply of water brought from a distance. The fact of

the skill shown in procuring and conveying the small quantity of water by the con-

duits to the town, and in the construction of reservoirs for catching the surface

water, shows that this necessary element must always have been scarce. The chief

supply must have consisted of rain-water collected within the town and stored in

tanks, as in the present day. Jerusalem is about 2700 feet above the Mediterranean,

and 4000 above the Dead Sea, and is placed pretty nearly on the crest of the hills

which define the watershed of the country. The road from Jerusalem to Bethlehem

on the south, and to Bireh on the north, roughly marks this line. The road to

Bireh rises from Jerusalem, Bireh being about 300 feet above the city. The coun-

try north of Bireh maintains its elevation for some distance                                                                                                                                                                                                                             but here, as in nearly
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

all cases, the country is cut up by valleys, which form a very peculiar feature, in-

fluencing not only the landscape but the water question. The district around

Jerusalem consists principally of the steep sides of valleys which twist and encircle

each other, their general direction being towards the Mediterranean on the west,

and the Dead Sea on the east. The valleys are deep, the sides rocky and bare of

soil, which appears to have been earned to the valley-bottoms by the winter rains,

and the soil absorbs the rain, instead of allowing it to run over the surface. The

cause of the present sterility of the district is the destruction, by neglect, of the ar-

tificial terraces which probably existed formerly, and which, by retaining the soil

on the steep slopes, led to the ancient fertility of the .country. The entire absence
--124 keport 1865.

of streams of water in the valleys leads to the belief that there exist subterranean
water-courses. The Brook Kedron is crossed b}r an arch 9 feet wide. In some
years no water at all flows under the arch. After three or four days' rain it will
run on the surface for a few hours 2\ or 8 feet deep, but ceases to flow in one or
two hours after the rain abates ; if, however, heavy rain continues with little inter-
ruption for ten days, the stream will flow on for two or three days after the rain
has stopped. The depth of the soil in the valley-bottoms is probably very great

in the valley of Urtas it was found to be more than 20 feet. The valleys are con-
sequently very ill adapted for reservoirs of water, although the rain-fall is amply
sufficient. The nearest approach to a good site is the Wady-el-Byar, on the road
between Jerusalem and Hebron. The authors found no trace of ancient irrigation
works ; the Pools of Solomon would only water 65 acres for six months in the year
at the moderate depth of 2 feet, spread over the area watered. Near Nabliis, and

at other distant places, there are large streams of perennial water flowing out of the
rock ; these might (at a very considerable cost) be earned round the slopes of the

hills and conveyed from valley to valley for irrigation purposes. The ancient reser-
voirs for rain-water, of which there are many, are in a ruinous state, except the
upper Pool of Gihon aud Ilezekiah's Pool. The former is 315 feet long, 208 feet
wide, and 20 feet deep, and holds about 8,000,000 gallons, which, allowing 2,000,000
for evaporation, gives 6,000,000 as the annual available supply of the pool. Heze-
kiah's Pool holds about 4,000,000 gallons. Careful measurements and details of
construction of the various reservoirs are given by the authors, with suggestions for
their repair ; their total capacity would then be 44,147,000 gallons. Deduction
would, however, have to be made for evaporation, which, calculating the probable
amount of annual evaporation in this dry climate, with its mean temperature of
62°-6 at 60 inches, would be 8,881,562 gallons. In the temperate zone, with a mean
temperature of 52 p, the annual evaporation has been found to be between 36 and
37 inches. On the coast of South America (north latitude 10° 30'), with a mean
temperature of 81°-86, it was ascertained to be more than 100 inches annually.

JU'Intryre's Journey across Australia, and Discovery of Traces of LeicJiJiardt.

                           By Dr. F. Mueller (Melbourne).

Mr. Duncan MTntyre and Mr. Barnett, with a party of three natives and twenty-

five horses, started on the 21st of June, 1864, from the cattle stations on the River

Paroo, to explore the country for cattle-runs and dray-routes, shaping their course

towards the new settlement in Northern Australia. They reached Cooper's Creek

after a march of twenty-two days, crossing the creek about 50 miles below the

junction of the Thompson. Excellent country was found to the westward of

the Paroo, but no permanent water. From Cooper's Creek they continued until

Burk's track was crossed, and so far no difficulty in conveying stock was met with.

The course was then changed for the head waters of the Albert River. The Flin-

ders was struck on the 18th of August, a little south of Donor's Hills, and the river

followed from that point to the sea; the journey from Cooper's Creek to the sea

having occupied thirty-four days, being a little more than half the time taken by

either Burke or MTunlay. The country to the north-west of the point where

Cooper's Creek was crossed was very indifferent for a day or two, and waterless.

It gradually got better on reaching a water-sj-stem in which four new rivers were

found, the first of which was named by Mr. MTntyre the Docker. It then improved

daily, and splendid sheep country was crossed in that part where the Stony Desert

of Sturt is laid down. The ground in places was, however, covered with fragments

of stones, and in some places "paved," as described by Sturt, for a few miles. On

the whole, it was found to be a good grazing country, and particularly well adapted

Afor sheep.  hundred miles or so to the south of the tropic, the country assumes

a high,  undulating  character,  with  beautiful  smooth  downs                             and it continued
                                                                                         ;

magnificent the whole way from this to the coast range. From the Gidf of

Carpentaria to the banks of the Darling an excellent road might easily be made,

along which a buggy could be driven without meeting with a single impediment.

The Flinders River district is now peopled by squatters down to within about 280

miles of the Gulf. The party did not take with them an ounce of meat, but earned
                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.           125

plenty of ammunition, relying on game for food. Bush turkeys were seen every-

where, hut were especially numerous in the neighbourhood of the Gulf. Pigeons, too,

were found in thousands ; altogether they fared well on the game shot by them, and

had no reason to regret not having brought a supply of meat. Fish also were caught

in large numbers in all the creeks, the party frequently taking more than could be

Meaten. The supposed traces of Leichhardt, discovered by Mr. cIntyre, consist of

two trees, near the bank of the Flinders, marked each with a single L cut evidently

by a skilled hand, and two old strayed horses with illegible brands on both of them.

It is contended by Dr. Mueller (one of the former companions of Leichhardt) and

others in Melbourne, who are now taking an active part in organizing a new expe-

dition to search for further traces of Leichhardt, that the marked trees denote

undoubtedlv a Leichhardtian camp. They are situate on the western side of the

main east branch of Flinders River, in latitude 20° S. The bark has encroached

to the extent of four or rive inches on the incision of the letters, showing a much
greater age than that of Landsborough's camps, who also travelled in this direction.

The last communication from Dr. Mueller announces the successful progress of his
Ascheme for a new expedition.
                               " Ladies' Committee " has been organized and a

vigorous attempt made to raise £3000 by subscription. It is hoped that some

member of Leichhardt's lost expedition may be found still living in the far interior,

notwithstanding that seventeen years have elapsed. Under any circumstances it is
contended that the " Ladies' Expedition " will be likely to accomplish what

Leichhardt intended, namely, to open up the unknown great western half of the

continent.

Arctic Exploration. By Rear- Admiral E. Ojotanxet, F.B.A.S.

There are before the public two propositions for proceeding to the North Pole

the one making Smith's Sound the base of operations, the intention being to leave

the ships in a secure position, from whence it is proposed to reach the Pole by tra-

velling over the ice with sledges, making a sledge journey of it, on the supposition

that land will be found extending itself towards the Pole from Smith's Sound. The
other is from Dr. Petermann, who advocates in two very able and well-digested

papers, the course of penetrating into the icy seas between Spitzbergen and Nova
Zembla, on the theory that a warm current flows from the coast of Norway in that

direction into the Polar Sea, extending itself to the vicinity of the Pole, and that

the influence of this warm current of water is operative in raising the temperature

of the sea, thus rendered free from ice obstructions, and available for navigation

contiguous to the Pole. The chief obstacle to surmount, he considers to lie in the

outer barrier of floes and packed ice, forming a moveable band of about five degrees of

latitude in extent ; so that after pushing the ships through this barrier, they would

enter a sea easy of navigation, extending to the highest latitude, no doubt to the

Pole itself. Certainly, on looking at the globe, where can we find a more favour-
Weable point to enter the Polar Sea ?
                                           have in the Spitzbergen seas the largest

and widest openings from the North Atlantic Oceans ; the Spitzbergen Islands have

been circiunnavigated, and their western shores are stated to be clear of ice in the

summer. On glancing at the chart, it will be observed that the Polar region to be

explored is that vacancy contained within the circle of the 80° parallel ; but it is

necessary to state that up to the present time no attempt has been made to reach

the Pole with suitable vessels armed with proper instructions ; for hitherto in all

the voyages to these regions the seas were abandoned by order at the very best

season for making an advance to the Pole.

The author also called to notice the fact that we have made but one attempt in

this countiy to reach the North Pole, viz., that of Parry, in 1827 ; all the other

expeditions have been undertaken with a view to make N.W. and N.E. passages

to India and China.

Of the two routes now under discussion the majority of Arctic officers are in favour

of making the attempt by the Spitzbergen seas. Certainly these seas offer the

shortest route from Great Britain to the Pole. There are so many advantages to
be advanced in behalf of making Spitzbergen the base of operations, that the author

-is induced to give that route his strongest recommendation in preference to pro-

 ceeding via Baffin's Bay, and for the following reasons ;--
--126 report 1865.

1st. The Spitzbergen seas are more free from ice than any other part of the

Arctic seas.

   2ndly. The Western shores are clear of ice in summer, affording an open navi-

gation between a depot fixed at Spitzbergen and England.

3rdly. It affords reasonable hopes for effecting the search of the Polar region in

one season.

   4thly. There are good harbours in Spitzbergen ; the climate is more tem-

perate than that of Smith's Sound ; animal life srtnore abundant ; driftwood for

fuel is found on its shores.

   Hitherto no proper effort by a suitable vessel has been made to reach the Pole
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

we never sent an expedition in that direction provided with the means of wintering

and exploring at the proper season, consequently the Spitzbergen seas were aban-

doned at the most favourable season for exploration.
   The author made a few observations as regards the adoption of Smith's Sound

as a starting-point for making a sledge expedition to the Pole : it appeared to him
to be one of the most dangerous places in the Arctic Sea. And as he holds to the

belief that we can approach the Pole by ships via Spitzbergen for reasons before

adduced, viz., that spaces of water will be found, this state of things would render
it impracticable to make exploration by sledges from Smith's Sound.

   He further added that the information to be sought for in making observations

respecting the condition and phenomenon of the globe at its axis, will be the more

valuable, according to the duration of time available for scientific research. He

compared the advantages which would result from the visit of a ship to the Pole,

with those afforded by small sledge party.

Regarding the speculation whether land will be found about the Pole, all the

observations and facts before us tend to show that there can be no land of any ex-

tent ; for at Parry's farthest north 82f° N., he sounded the sea to 500 fathoms, but

found no bottom. The large icebergs produced from the glaciers in Greenland are not

Weseen north of Spitzbergen.  hear of no earthy debris, stones, or boulders being

observed by the Spitzbergen voyagers lying on the ice-floes or fields. By the

comparatively mild or modified severity of the Arctic climate at Spitzbergen 80° N.,

the isothermal curve of temperature, corresponding with that of South Greenland

and Hudson's Bay, shows almost conclusively that there can be no extent of land

near the Pole capable of bearing glaciers.

Should circumstances involve the necessity of spending a winter at Spitzbergen,

either in Fair Haven or Ilecla Cove, we can find perfect security for a ship, with

an ample field of useful occupation for both officers and crew, in making observa-

tions and gathering information for scientific purposes, from the high latitude of

80° N. As the spring advanced, the pursuit of game would be a source of amuse-

ment and health.
   That the North Pole may be reached by sea is the opinion entertained by many

experienced Arctic navigators and eminent men of the past and present day, among

whom are Parry, Beecher, Ross, Belcher ; and General Sabine, one of the sur-

vivors of our discoverers in those seas, strongly advocates the attempt.

Shores of the Persian Gulf. By Lieut.-Col. L. Pellt.

                    Notes on Arabia. By Lieut.-Col. L. Pellt.

   In this paper the author communicated some further details regarding Arabia, in
addition to those he had already made public in the ' Proceedings of the Royal
Geographical Society.' The most interesting related to the Selabah, Seleb, or

Selaib tribe, who inhabit portions of the interior. On certain festivals, particularly

on occasions of marriage and circumcision, they fix a wooden cross, dressed in red
cloth, and adorned at the top with feathers, at the door of the person married or
circumcised. At this signal the people collect together, and dance round the cross.
The word Saleb means a cross ; but some of the caste derive their name from -Es-
svlb-el-Arab, i. e. from the back of the Arabs, meaning that they are the pure de-
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                     127

scendants of the aboriginal Arabs. The Mohammedans, on the other hand, stig-
matize them as outcasts. Those of the tribe who have immigrated into Nejed and
other Mohammedan settlements, conform outwardly to the religious rites of the
dominant creed ; but in their own tents, and wheu alone, they do not conform.

No intermarriage takes place between the Selaib and the Arabs. The Selaib are

capital sportsmen; they live largely on venison, and wear a long shirt, coming
down to the feet, of deerskin. But their ordinary diet is locusts and dates. They
wander for pasturage for their sheep and camels during eight months in the vear.
They profess to reverence Mecca, but state that their own proper place of pilgri-
mage is Haran in Irak or Mesopotamia. It is said also that their principal people
have psalms and other books written in Chaldasan or Assyrian. They worship the

Pole-star, which they call Jah. as the one immoveable point which directs all tra-
vellers by sea or land. They reverence also a star in the constellation called Jedy,

corresponding with Aries. In adoring either of these heavenly bodies, the Selaib

stands with his face towards it, and stretches out his arms so as to represent a cross

--with his own body. They believe in one God, and pray three times a day at

sunrise, at the declension from the meridian, and at sunset. They are peaceful, and
markedly hospitable, like all people who have nothing to give. The Selaib them-
selves assert that they are a tribe of Sabosans who emigrated to Nejed. The author
stated that the Imauni of Nejed, who had received his mission so favourably, had
been assassinated soon after his departure from Arabia.

              On the Comoro Islands. By Lieut. -Col. L. Pellt.

The Comoros are a group of four islands lying between the northern extremity

of Madagascar and the East African coast. The most northerly is Comoro proper,

an island about thirty miles in length, with an average breadth of about ten miles.

Nearest to this, and a little further south, is Mohilla, the smallest of the four. Jo-

hanna, lying south-east of Mohilla, and distant from it some thirty miles, is the

second in respect of extent ; and Mayotte, thirty miles south-east of Johanna, is

third. In the year 1841 the French established themselves on the little island of

Zaondzi, near Mayotte, gaining their position by espousing the cause of one of the

contending chiefs, on the condition of his ceding Zaondzi to them. It is now forti-

fied and furnished with an arsenal, and it was at one time planned to make Ma-

votte a military and naval position of the first class ; but the plans seem to have
been discarded since the revolution of 1848. Mayotte has reef-locked anchorages

extending over a length of more than thirty miles ; communication is kept up with
Bourbon by means of a small steam schoo'ier of war, and Col. Pelly found some

thousand tons of coal, besides patent fuel, stored at Zaondzi. The staple product of

Mayotte is sugar ; if well cultivated the island might export from 15,000 to 20,000

tons per annum ; but there is a great scarcity of labour. The popidation is stated

to number about 7000 souls. The island of Johanna is a sultanat, without any di-

rect relation with the other islands, the present chief being named Abdullah, the

descendant of a family which has ruled the island for the last century. Johanna

contains a population of 12,000, including aborigines, half-castes, slaves, and
Aforeigners.
              lingua franca, called the Johanna language, is current, but Kisuahili

is also spoken. The Arabic character is used in writing, no matter what the lan-
guage may be, even if English. The people profess the Mohammedan religion, and

are apparently quite free from the vice of drunkenness. The climate is salubrious,

sea breezes and frequent showers tempering the heat. The soil is composed of the

detritus of volcanic rocks and humus. Coffee thrives excellently, and will probably

form ultimately the staple product of the island. The trade of Johanna is at pre-

sent not large, the total value of the past year's (1860) imports being about £4500,
and it is carried on chiefly with Zanzibar and the French settlements at Mayotte

and Madagascar. Mohilla is governed by a queen related to the royal family of
Madagascar. The island has a population of about 4000 souls. Of all the Co-
moro group Comoro proper is the most remarkable for the magnificence and wild-

ness of its scenery. From its surface rises an active volcano, 8000 feet in height,

which frequently vomits forth streams of lava, which flood its flanks and form new

promontories and islands in the surrounding ocean. When the English consul, Mr.

Sunley, visited the island after an absence of four years, he found a lava reef three-.

quarters of a mile in length j utting out near his old landing-place, and perplexing

his topograph}'. The principal town is Maroni, hut the island is partitioned among
many chieftains, who are jealous of their land and water holdings.

          Ethnology of the Hindu- Cliinese Nations. By Col. Phayre.

                        Notes on the Russian Frontiers in Central Asia.

                       By Sir H. C. Rawlinson, M.P., F.B.S.

   The author commenced by stating that the present boundaries of Russia in Cen-
tral Asia were delineated with accuracy on the maps of Asia published by Messrs.

Stanford and by Prof. Kiepert, of Berlin. He then gave a brief narrative of the

successive encroachments of Russia in this direction. Formerly the frontier ex-
tended from the northern shores of the Caspian, by a long bend to the north, to the
northern frontier of Chinese Tartary. Along this border was formed the Orenburg
and Siberian line of outposts, and south of it, extending to the Khanats of Khiva,
Bokhara, and Khokand, dwelt the numerous hordes of Kirghises on their steppes.
In 1847 the Russians constructed here three forts to strengthen their hold on the
region. The Kirghis steppe is traversed only by a few roads, the most important

of which rims from Orsk, north of the Aral Sea, to the Jaxartes. With the ex-
ception of one part of it, over the Karakum sands, this route is well supplied with
pasture, and the whole is traversable by wheeled carriages. By recent encroach-
ments the Russian frontier is now extended to the Jaxartes ; but the line as it at

--present stands is rather difficult to trace at least that part of it which extends from

Fort Perofski, on the Jaxartes, to the river Talas, including the new acquisitions of
Turkestan, Chemkend and Tashkand, and even Russian officers do not know its

exact course in its further continuation to the south of the Lake Issy-Kul. Their
efforts have been directed to the connexion of the Issy-Kul line of forts with those
of the Jaxartes, the result of which will be the absorption of the whole Khokand
territory on the left bank of the Jaxartes. The advance of the Russians in this
direction has been attended with great benefits to science and civilization ; but

although the fear of Russian invasion may be a chimera, it behoves us to consider
what will be the political effect upon our own empire in India when there shall

thus be a powerful Russo-Asiatic neighbour on its northern borders. Whilst the
Russians have been advancing a distance of 1000 miles from north to south, our
Indian empire has extended 1000 miles from south to north. The actual distance
of our political frontier (the frontier of Thibet, a country under our influence) from

the nearest point in Russian territory is now between 400 and 500 miles, that is,
from Karakorum to the Thian Chan range ; but our real frontier at Peshawur is

above 1000 miles distant, according to the most recent itineraries of our agents

who have traversed the intervening space. The most recent advance of Russia in
Khokand has provoked the hostility of the neighbouring Khan of Bokhara, and it
is within the bounds of probability that the forces of Russia and Bokhara are now

in collision.

                    On a Recent Survey of the Chain of Mont Blanc.

                               By A. Adams-Reillt, B.A.

   The author described the imperfect state of our knowledge with regard to the
topography of the Mont Blanc range, and the motives that had induced him to
construct, on his own surveys, 'an elaborate map, a large sketch of which was
exhibited. The errors in the delineation of this and of other mountain-chains
arose from the fact that they usually form the boundaries of countries, and the
Government surveyors of each do not cooperate with each other, but carry their
work simply to the watershed of the ridges. It thus frequently happens that the
surveys of the two sides of a ridge are found, when compared, to contradict each

other. Before the visit of Windham and Pocock, 1741, the valleys of Mont Blanc

were unknown to the world, and the glaciers of the range were so erroneously
delineated up to the year 1842, when Prof. J. Forbes commenced his observations
on the Mer de Glace, that he found himself obliged to make an entirely new survey

of that glacier and its tributaries. This was the only portion of the chain accurately
laid down when the Mont Blanc sheet of the Swiss Federal Survey came out in
1861, which, as the Swiss surveyors only gave, from their own work, the small
portion lying within Swiss territory, filling in the rest from the Sardinian Survey,
was found to be untrue to nature. The author commenced his surveys in 18G3.

The glacier system of Mont Blanc may be roughly said to be divided into three

parts by two large clefts ; that on the west beiug formed by the north and south
glaciers of Miage, and that on the east by the glaciers of Argentiere and Mont
Dolent. In each case the two glacier-valleys advance from opposite sides deep into

the heart of the chain, and their upper heads are only separated by rocky walls
scarcely half a mile in thickness. The centre of the chain is occupied by an im-

mense glacier-basin, which again is subdivided into three glaciers having but one

common outlet, the Mer de Glace. From the point where it makes an abrupt turn

to the north to return again on the other side of the Glacier de Miage, the back-

bone of the chain runs pretty nearly from south-west to north-west. At several
spots, as, for instance, the Aiguille du Glacier, Aiguille Verte, and Mont Dolent, a
number of ridges radiate towards the same point, culminating in a magnificent peak,
and at others the main ridge thickens into an enormous mountain mass, like the
Grandes Jorasses. The Swiss surveyors, in carrying their triangulation up to the
eastern side of one of the ridges on the Sardinian frontier, which had been triangu-

lated by the Sardinians on the western side, mistook the position, and inserted it on

their map as a separate mountain-chain. In order to correct this it was necessary
to annihilate four square miles of glacier, and to pull together into one, two moun-

tains which had previously stood a mile and a half apart on the maps.

                             On the Flints of Pressigny le Grand.

 By Professor Steenstrup and Sir J. Lubbock, Bart., F.B.S., Pres. Ent. Soc.

   The authors related that the discovery of these flints was due to Dr. Leveille",
who had been induced, by the interest which the general subject had excited, to

search for flint weapons in his neighbourhood. He was so fortunate as to find them

in astonishing abundance, and the neighbourhood of Pressigny was evidently the site
of several manufactories, as the distribution of the worked flints is very local. In
one case they were found in abundance on one side of a little valley, while on the
other side not one was to be seen. The i( livres-de-beurre" and their chippings, at

the manufactory of La Claisiere, at least, were found to extend not more than 18
inches below the surface, and among them numerous fragments of charcoal were
discovered. The authors took pains to set at rest all doubts regarding their being

the refuse of a gun-flint manufactory. Gun-flints were first adapted to the muskets

used by the French army in the year 1700, and they proved the much greater an-
tiquity of the flint implements by finding several on excavating under the roots of
an oak-tree, ascertained to be at least 400 or 500 years old. With regard to the age

of the flints, the authors thought that there were not, as yet, any actual proof that
the livres-de-beurre belonged to the age of the extinct mammalia, although other
and probably older worked flints are foimd in the neighbourhood, which closely

resemble those of the Palaeolithic period.

            Notes on the Aborigines of Formosa.

       By R. Swinhoe, H.M.'s Consul, Formosa.

The approach to the Kalee savages, who inhabit a mountainous district in the

southern part of the island of Formosa, is now comparatively easy, owing to the estab-

lishment, by the Roman Catholic Padre Fernando Sainz, of a small church and resi-

dence in a village of half-castes at the foot of the mountains, where he numbers some

forty converts. The villagers to whom he preaches speak the Chinese dialect, with

which he is acquainted, hut he is now turning his attention to the Kalee language.
In the villages adjoining the Christian village of Bang-Kimsing, are chiefly Hakka

Chinese from North Kwang-tung, who are almost always at war with the Kalees.

It is only therefore at night that the Kalees can he induced to come down to visit

the priest. Mr. Edwards, an enterprising photographer, visited the village in

company with the author, and took the portraits of two groups of these savages.

 130 REPORT-- 1865.

 The complexions of the women are brunette, of lighter or deeper shade. The wild
 Kalee women are naturally good-looking, and are sought after by the Chinese of
 the eastern side of the island for wives ; hut the priest said it was common for

  them, after some years, to return to the wilds and pick up savage lords. In
  consequence of these intermarriages, Kalee features and type are seen to prevail
  amongst the ordinary Chinese population throughout Formosa; giving to the

 Formosan Chinese almost as distinct characteristics as a native of Amoy compared
 with a Cantonese. Many faces among the male Kalees reminded the author of the

 Tagals of Lucon. They wear turbans and loin-cloths of black material, and short
 jackets of yellow cloth. Their spear-handles are of bamboo, and their sword-
 scabbards painted red. The men are not tatooed, but the women are so across the
 back of the hand in lines. There is little room for doubting that the Kalee tribe
 are ofTagal origin; but there are other tribes inhabiting the moimtains of Formosa
 of quite distinct race, the wildest of them being of dwarfed stature, and probably
 allied to the Negritos of the Andaman Islands; the author, however, as yet had
 not had an opportunity of seeing them.

 On the Negro-European Dialects of Surinam and Curasao. By E. B. Ttxor.

    The original West African languages of the Negro slaves imported into America
 and the West Indies, have been almost totally replaced by broken-down dialects
 of the languages of their European masters. Two of these dialects, the Negro-
 English of Surinani and the IS egro-Spanish of Curacao, were examined by Mr.
 Tylor, with the view of testing, by a set of facts, the whole history of which
 happens to be known to us, the use and value of philology as an aid to ethnology.
 The Spaniards were superseded as the dominant class in the island of Curacao by
the Dutch. The effect of this change has been, not to supersede a broken-down
Spanish dialect by a Dutch one, but merely to introduce a number of Dutch words
into the Negro language, which still preserves its Spanish character. Thus, too,
the Negro-English of Surinani did not lose its English character by the cession of
the colony to the Dutch, but merely took in a number of Dutch words, the cha-

racter of the language remaining English. Among the examples of the Surinani

--dialect, taken from the New Testament, translated by the Moravian missionaries,

were the following : " Dem hiti netti na mi watra ; bikasi dem dejisiman" " Cast-
ing a net into the sea, for they were fishers." " We ihriwan boon boom de meki

boen vroektoe," "Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit.'' In this

latter example, ibritcan is English "everyone," and meki is "make," but boen,
"good," is Spanish bueno, while boo?n, "tree," und vroektoe "fruit," are Dutch. It
woidd seem at first sight that the fact of a West African Negro population speaking
a language which must be classed as English, is evidence that language is not
necessarily a proof of race at all. Mr. Tylor, however, called attention to the
fact that, according to all experience, the descendants of the originally imported
Negroes must have become mixed with English blood ; and the same with the

Negroes who adopted the language of their Spanish masters in Curacao. He con-

sidered the quaint and rude dialects into which English and Spanish have been
reduced in the mouths of the Negro slaves as good illustrations of a principle of

much moment in the classification of races by language, namely, that though two
peoples speaking kindred languages may be widely different in their descent, and

therefore in their race as a whole, yet their use of languages- derived from the

same source is proof, at any rate, that men of the same race have been dominant
among both peoples to a sufficient extent to impress their language upon them.
And it is to be inferred from experience that such a state of things is always

accompanied by the formation of a half-breed race, so that, at least to the extent of

this minimum of mixture in blood, common language is a definite proof of common

ancestry.

                On tJie Origin of the Hungarians. By M. Vamb£kt.

   The author said the Hungarians belonged to the Altaic race, but there were many
subdivisions which differed essentially ; and it was important to know whether the
Hungarians were of Finnish or of Turco-Tartar origin. To investigate such a ques-
                                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                          131

--tion there were three means history, ethnography, and philology. The Greek and

Gothic historical monuments relating to the tirst appearance of the Hungarians in
the West were insufficient, and did not help to decide the question, hut ethnology
did render more assistance. The author then referred to some striking likenesses
between the customs of Hungary and Tartary. Their greatest evidence they got
from philology. In support of his view, the author quoted the analogy of gram-
matical forms between the Hungarian and Turco-Tartar languages, and then pro-

ceeded to make comparison in the lexicographical character of the languages. He

thought both so strictly connected, that it was quite impossible to make the ety-
mology of one without the other. There were many words of the earliest period of
social state quite analogous, such as in the words tent, ox, hatchet, butter, cheese.
The Hungarians were also connected with the ancient Persian civilization of Cen-
tral Asia, which was proved by the many Persian words in her language. The an-

cient religion and earliest social conditions of the Hungarians wqre borrowed from

the Parsee. There were also, he urged, elements of Turco-Tartar origin in the

Persian.

On the true Assignation of the Bronze Weapons, fyc, supposed to indicate a
 Bronze Age in Western and Northern Europe. By Thomas Weight, X.S.A.

   This paper was a criticism of the* archaeological views of geologists, especially
those of Sir John Lubbock as propounded in his recent work on Prehistoric Archae-
ology. The author gave his grounds of dissent from the division of early times
into the three ages of stone, bronze, and iron, originated by Scandinavian authors.
With regard to bronze, the corner-stone of this system of periods, the statement
that " bronze weapons are never found associated with coins, pottery, or other relics

of Roman origin," was believed by the author to be founded on an imperfect ac-

quaintance with the archaeological conditions of the problem to be solved. Bronze

swords have been found with Roman remains, and the most ornamental Scandi-
navian bronze is simply a debased imitation of Roman Art.

                                     ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address by The Right Hon. Lord Stanley, M.P., F.B.8., the President of the

                                                                     Section.

--Ladies and Gentlemen, In opening this Section, I need not trouble you with

more than a few introductory remarks. It has been questioned how far such sub-

jects ought to form part of the business of a strictly scientific association ; and I do

not think the question unreasonable, for it must be admitted that, while our political

economy itself, in its present state, is rather a collection of practical maxims, sup-

ported by reason and tested by experience, than a science in the same sense as

astronomy or optics are entitled to that name, the topics to which the statistical

--method is applicable are infinitely various, and have little in common except this

one characteristic that in every case we appeal either to the numerical test of

accuracy, to figures, or else to fixed and recognized rules, which are assumed to

Howhave the same kind of certainty as prevails in physical science.                         far that

assumption holds good in practice, must depend on the judgment both of those

who read papers, and of those who comment upon them. The truth is, in my

opinion, our functions here are rather those of suggesting and stimulating, than of

originating thought. Discussion, no doubt, we shall have, and in discussion new

ideas are constantly generated, and new lights thrown upon previously unfamiliar

topics                               but it is not in crowded meetings, it  is not  in  debating speeches, that any
                                  ;

profound and original investigation can be carried on. Meetings like ours answer

--two purposes, apart from that of social enjoyment ; one is the diffusion not the

                                                                                        9*
13.2 report--1865.

--origination, but the diffusion of ideas. Books and newspapers and reviews, no

doubt, are the main agents for doing that work. Still it is, I think, indisputable
that, as seeing is proverbially more impressive than hearing, so what we hear
orally delivered makes upon us a stronger impression than that which lies on a

printed page on which our attention may or may not dwell. The other is the

stimulus given to inquiry by the mere fact of investigations of this kind, or the
result of them, being brought prominently and conspicuously before the public.

Men go home with their heads full of subjects on which they perhaps never thought
seriously before ; and since, as I believe, nothing once known is ever really forgotten

--since an idea which has once found lodgment in the mind, though its presence

there may long have been barren, and though we ourselves may have been uncon-

--scious of it, will often spring up into life after a long interval it is difficult to

determine what crop will not grow, sooner or later, out of the seed thus cast about
apparently at random.

   And now let me say a word as to the right application of the statistical method.

To use figures rightly, assuming that they are accurate in themselves, is not so
easy a matter as it is apt to appear. There are various fallacies into which
unpractised statisticians fall, one or two of which may be worth noting. One, perhaps
the commonest, arises from the use of too narrow a basis for calculation. To express

my --meaning, given a certain class of men, between certain ages, as soldiers, agri-

cultural labourers, artisans, and the like, the aggregate length of life among 10,000,
or even among 1000 of them, will be practically a fixed quantity, you can determine
it beforehand. But the length of any single life is of course uncertain ; and if so
few as 10, 20, or even 100 lives be taken, the element of chance, or what we call
chance, is not sufficiently excluded, and a single exceptional case affects the general
result. Another error, less easy to detect, arises from not taking into account all

causes which affect the result. Thus, supposing that the question is, the effect
produced by reduction of a tax in increasing consumption of the article taxed, it
is natural, but a very obvious mistake, to urge, "post hoc, ergo propter hoc," to speak
of that augmented consumption as arising solely from the reduction of duty which

--preceded it, ignoring the causes such as general prosperity, and consequent aug-

mentation of the consuming power cheapening of means of transport, or lowering
                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

of the actual cost of production by mechanical improvements, or otherwise of the
article consumed. Or, to take an illustration from a different class of subjects :

Suppose it is desired to ascertain the average mortality of a certain class ; that for

this purpose we take the mortality in that class during a certain number of years,

and that, during one of those years, an epidemic of a destructive character has pre-
vailed, you of course strike out that year from the series as unduly affecting the
average. But, if you stop there, your calculation is again vitiated, though in a
different manner, for it will almost always happen that an epidemic sweeps away a
larger proportion of unhealthy than of healthy lives, and so the years succeeding their

mortality, having been, so to speak, anticipated, are above the true average in poii^t
of health, and do not form a firm basis for a permanent calculation. Another variety

of the same error, identical in principle, is when effect and cause are confounded.
For instance, I have heard a sanatorist argue, with great general truth, in favour
of model-lodgings in towns, and support his argument by pointing out the
diminished rate of mortality in them, as compared with that of the same class out-
side. No one could dispute the general conclusion, but in fairness it should have been
taken into consideration, as a qualifying proposition, that model-lodgings, by their

reputation for superior cleanliness and healthiness, attract not the average, but the

--best men of the class for whom they are designed that is, those whose chances of

life are the best, independent of the room in which they are lodged. Hence in-
voluntary exaggeration, by which a good cause could only suffer.

    Another and perhaps simpler example is the existence of a hospital, or sanato-
rium, in an otherwise healthy locality. Unless that be allowed for, it is clear that

the place in question will be credited with many deaths which are not due to it,
nay, this absurdity follows, that the more the spot is resorted to by invalids (Madeira
would be a case in point) on account of its very healthiness, the higher its apparent

mortality becomes. This last example is not without its practical importance,
especially in cases of military mortality. It is obvious that, by a system of dis-
            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.             133

charging at once, or offering inducements for the retirement of men who are likely
to become invalids, a fictitious appearance of healthiness in a camp or army may be

produced, the diseases which arise there not being suffered to work out their

natural result, and their existence, or rather the existence of causes predisposing to

Athem, being thus effectively concealed.  third source of error, perhaps less

material, but still worth notice, is that of confounding in one class facts not identical.

For instance, the average death-rate of England is easily ascertained, but if you

wish to apply that practically to a particular place or class, you must not take the

figures as they stand. The death-rate of towns is not that of rural districts, the

mortality of infants greatly exceeds that of adults, the term of life is shorter in the

labouring than in the well-to-do classes. Age, class, and locality must be separately

determined before you can arrive at an even approximately accurate conclusion.

The figures, which serve for all collectively, precisely because they do so serve, are

illusory if applied to any one of these in particular.

  I mention such possible mistakes in order to show how utterly wide of the truth

is the idea that to work by and with statistical calculations is a merely mechanical
function, needing no ability beyond that of a careful clerk. They require common

sense and vigilance against errors, like every other method of inquiry. Figures do

not, indeed, deceive you, but, if you put them to a use they are not meant for, they

will let you deceive yourself.

I suppose it is hardly necessary to remind you of the uses of the statistical method

as applied to national affairs. If a man in private life finds his money going too

fast, and wants to retrench, the first thing he does is to say, " I must keep regular

accounts." So individuals keep diaries of particular matters in which they feel

interested, not trusting to vague recollections, but setting down their notes day by

day. Every person of observant habits, or engaged in any pursuit which requires

accuracy, is in some sense a statistician ; and it is hardly possible to over- rate the

value of figures, partly as checking the universal tendency to exaggeration, not

wilful, but a kind of mental illusion which operates whenever we are deeply inter-

--ested partly as giving precision to ideas which would otherwise remain floating in
our minds in a vague, and therefore comparatively useless form. For instance, to

--say generally that a given trade or employment that of a grinder or soldier, in the
--tropics is unhealthy, conveys a very faint expression, and expresses our feelings but
--slightly. But put it in this way that the average length of human life in some

occupations is shorter by ten or fifteen years than that of an ordinary labourer

and not only habitual calculators, but the man himself, however ignorant or thought-

less he may be, is able clearly to realize the sacrifice he is making in going into

that business. With regard to the question of drainage, of ventilation, of food, or

use or abuse of strong drinks, it is the statistical test employed on a large scale

which alone can be conclusive. I say on a large scale, for it is of the very essence

of statistical inquiry that by dealing with masses it eliminates individual peculi-

Wearities.  reason back from the mass to the individual. The unit of the statis-

tician, his typical or representative man, is the average man of many thousands.

We are familiar with the effect on public health of the establishment of sanitary

statistics. Let me point out one or two more instances in which figures form a

part, and a very important part, of the diary of our national life. Take the Post

Office returns, showing an increase of the correspondence as compared with the past,

and the difference which exists at the present day in the amount of letter-carrying

between one part of the country and another--say between the population of Ireland

and that of London. Take the Registrar-General's returns of marriages, and note

how the number of these, relatively to the population, rises or falls as the material

condition of the masses is for the time better or worse. Take the annual returns

of the Customs and Excise departments. Take our Census Abstract of the occu-

pations of the people. Take our Criminal Statistics, a comparatively new depart-

ment, and one probably still admitting of much improvement. You may read in

these collectively the social and economical history of the age in which we live

law, but inevitable ignorance on our part of wbat the law is. When you find uni-

--formity, or something which closely approximates to uniformity as in the number

of letters yearly posted without addresses, in the number of widows and widowers

who marry, or in the number of detected offences of the same nature committed

--within the year it is impossible not to be impressed, however trifling may be the

illustration of them, with the permanence and steadiness of the laws which regulate

our existence.

Now, is there any use in knowing that ? I think there is. In the first place, no

knowledge that bears upon human life is useless, even though we do not at the
Amoment see the practical application to which we can put it.
                                                               discovery always

turns to account in some way. The most important mechanical inventions owe

their origin to purely mathematical theories which the authors of them never dreamt

of so applying. In the next place, it is only by observing men in masses, and with
the aid of all such helps to accuracy as we can command, that we can fairly appre-

ciate the influence of general causes, whether material or moral, on individuals.

Take a town in which a thoroughly good system of drainage has been established

you want to leam what has been the effect of that system on health. Question

each person or eacli family separately, you will probably get very conflicting and

dubious testimony ; but register the deaths and causes of death, compare them with
what they were before, and with similar returns in other places, and the decrease

will give you at once a measure of what has been effected. And, lastly, of that

--large class of human evils which are reparable as well as preventible evils affecting
--not life but property, or affecting life in its relation to property there are very few

to which the principle of insurance may not be applied. Now what does insurance

mean ? It is the opposite of gambling. The gambler, desiring to gain something

that is not his, risks in return something of that which he actually possesses. The

insurer, seeking to preserve that which he has, submits to a certain small fixed

deduction, and thereby precludes the occurrence of a much larger possible loss. The

one purposely increases the hazards of life, the other purposely diminishes them.

Now if, as I believe to be indisputable, a sense of security is one of the first requi-

sites both for material improvement and moral development, whatever creates or

strengthens that sense of security is an element of human progress ; and when a

proprietor has guaranteed himself, according to the nature of his property, against

fire, against shipwreck, against loss of stock by disease, or of loss by storm ; still

more, when the man who lives by his industry has secured himself, not indeed

against premature death, but against that which to such persons having families

is the sharpest pang of premature death, the dread of leaving unprovided for those

whose existence is bound up with his own, it is difficult to estimate, by any tests

or results that can be shown on paper, the amount of good which is practically

effected ; for that gain must be measured not by the number of persons actually
saved from distress, but by the infinitely greater number saved from the apprehen-

sion of distress, the fear being often as bad as the thing feared. It is not easy to

overrate the benefit which the modern practice of insurance has conferred and will

confer upon mankind. And why, in opening this Statistical Section, do I refer to it ?

Because it is a practice founded in its very nature on statistical inquiries, and which

without such inquiries could not have existed.

 --It remains only to speak of a few desiderata a few things wanting to be done.

In England our chief defect is the absence of agricultural statistics. That is a

question which has been long before Parliament. The difficulty of collecting such

tacts as are really wanted does not seem to be great; but between prejudices on

both sides, statisticians asking too much, and farmers unreasonably jealous of giving

any information, the thing has always fallen through. I hope in that respect the

new Parliament may be more fortunate than its predecessor. I ought also to note

as inconvenient in the highest degree the excessive complication of our English

weights and measures. They are probably by far the worst in Europe in that re-

spect. But I note that fault in no very sanguine spirit as to a remedy being applied.
Our national peculiarities, a great indifference to simplicity and uniformity, and a

dislike to changing anything to which we have once become accustomed, and the

total absence of any strong interest in the subject, except among a few individuals,

place reform in this matter wholly beyond my expectations. Parliament, no doubt,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                           135

--has legalized the use of the metric system a step which is very well as far as it

goes, hut which really, for all practical purposes, leaves matters where they were.

Compulsion is not to be thought of; and, on the whole, I strongly suspect the next

--generation will do exactly what I am doing now admit the inconvenience, and

say it can't he helped. Even with regard to the decimalization of coinage, which is

a -matter really in the power of the Government, I do not think we are likely soon

to see anything done ; and it is obvious that weights and measures cannot be change*
without a general feeling of willingness among the people to give up those existing

and adopt the substitutes. It is more satisfactory to look to the operations of the

Board of Trade. Their little yearly volume, called "The Statistical Abstract," is

full of useful information, packed into the smallest compass, and arranged with a

careful rejection of trifling and unimportant details. I should be glad to see the

scope of that publication extended, and references added, so as to include the principal

results of all official inquiries, showing in a tabular form where fuller details on the

subjects dealt with may be found.
   I think it is also worth considering, since every European Government now takes

a decennial census, whether some understanding may not be come to amongst

leading States, to frame their inquiries as nearly as may be in the same way, and

to publish them in the same order and form, so that for purposes of comparison they

may be at once and easily available ; for, notwithstanding local and national divisions

-- --differences of languages, of institutions, and of race Em-ope inclines more and

more to become, in its general habits of thought and action, one community ; and

Napoleon's phrase, that a war in Em-ope is a civil war, like most sayings of great

men, becomes truer and more applicable, not less so, by the progress of tim«. I do

not know that it would serve any usefid purpose if I were to anticipate the contents

of papers that may be read in this Section. They will be many, various, and I hope
interesting, and ought to lead to useful discussion. Let me only offer to those who

take part in our discussions one or two suggestions. The first is, time rims fast.

You can say all you have got to say in a few words, if you will think it over before-

hand. It is want of preparation, want of exact thought, that makes difiuseness.
WeAgain, we don't want preambles or perorations.

and in addressing an educated audience a good deal may be taken for granted.

Lastly, we only wish to get at the truth of things. All ideas are welcome, but
mere verbal criticism is of no value to us. Some of the topics with which we shall

deal may perhaps have a political bearing, and in that case I hope and expect that

they will be dealt with in a strictly impartial and scientific spirit.

          On the Municipal Expenditure of the Borough of Birmingham.

                                    By Thomas Avery.

   The intention of this paper was to submit a brief history of the Municipal Expen-
diture of Birmingham, with the view of comparing the progress of the town in
wealth and population with its increase in Taxation, Expenditure, and the amount

of its public debt.

   Previously to the incorporation of the Borough, the town was governed by Com-
missioners, under different Acts of Parliament ; the last of which was obtained in

the ninth year of the reign of King George TV., and was entitled "An Act for

better paving, lighting, watching, cleansing, and otherwise improving the town
of Bh-mingham, in the county of Warwick, and for regulating the police and

markets of the said town."

   The Commissioners, by an Act of Parliament passed in the year 1851, transferred
to their successors a public debt of about £112,250, and an equivalent in valuable

property of £196,291.

  A Table is annexed of the financial results of the concluding five years of the

separate government of the Commissioners, from 1835 to 1839. In all of the fol-
136 REPORT 1865.

lowing calculations, it has been found convenient to give the population of the
present limits of the borough, as nearly as it could be ascertained, but the Table of
the expenditure of the Commissioners has been formed upon the population of the

parish.

   The population of the decennial periods has been taken in both cases from the
Census Tables, and that of the intermediate years has been ascertained by a per-

centage thereon.

understood arrangement, the receipts of the improvement account only are fur-
nished, that being the chief and most legitimate source of income ; but the pay-
ments on account of the debt comprehend the whole of the charges thereon ; that
is to say, those of the municipal and street improvement accounts are also included,
and the same principle is observed throughout the calculation :

smoke, the great stacks of tower-like chimneys which everywhere meet the eye,

the general blackness of the surface, the rolling clouds of smoke which shroud all,

the glimmer of pools of water breaking through the dense masses of habitation

everywhere apparent, the tumultuous roar which comes surging upward, all im-
press the gazer deeply. Underneath that thick smoke-cloud and among those

leaping furnaces, toils and lives and dies as sturdy a population as any in Eng-

land.

Of the moral, social, educational, and religious condition of this population,

the most contradictory accounts are given ; but it was not the purpose of this paper
to balance or contrast contradictory statements. The paper especially regards the

--working classes, and was a review of the influences which have affected this district

in the past and still affect it on the one hand to degrade, on the other to restore

and elevate.

The first point noticeable is that of the circumstances of the growth of the popula-

tions of the towns of South Staffordshire.

   From this point of view much of the present misery and degradation is intel-

ligible.

   Most of the towns have a very old history; some are called old even before the
Norman era. They seem to have been generally agricultural. The population
was small. With the development of the mineral wealth came a great increase in

population, till from the quiet country -village you find yourself in the midst of the

noisy, dirty town of some 20,000 inhabitants. In 1727 Dr. Plot foimd twelve pits

open at Bilston now he would find some 300.                                             Now with such a rapid increase,
                                                                                     ;

and that just at the period of the Chinch's and the country's greatest apathy as to

the secular and religious education of the people, it seems manifest that the district

must have been utterly neglected, its opportunities of education wholly inadequate

to the requirements. Thus the vices which have made the Black Country so

notorious, were developed without check.

   The brutality and propensity to violence imputed to the people are regarded as
much exaggerated in the statements of casual observers. At the same time the

very nature of South Staffordshire work tends to foster a pride in physical strength,

and where ignorance and habits of intemperance prevail this will tend to brutality

and cruelty.

The habits of drunkenness and extravagance which do so very much disgrace the

population, present us with a very important item in the social position. Here

also certain circumstances of the work and the position of the working man throw

a light on the evil and its remedy. There is a strong conviction amongst puddlers,

millmen, and men of that class, that they cannot do without much beer during
their " heats." The effect of this continual recurrence to beer during the interval of
work before a fierce fire is readily understood. The whole constitution becomes
sodden with drink. Then, the workman has no out-of-doors charm of scenery to
fall back upon when his day's toil is over. The exigencies of mining operations

and the acrid furnace-smoke have destroyed the green and pleasant face of nature.

There is but the public-house, or home, or some rough game. Add further that
the workman earns in many cases very high wages ; this to natures uncultivated,

only gives a scope to all propensities to excess. Habits of intemperance are only

too prevalent. Beer-houses are multiplied beyond all proportion. Men are paid in

public-houses. Funerals, accidents, are only occasions of indulgence. Some work-
men have part of their wages in an allowance of beer.

It need hardly be said that licentiousness and immorality are fearfully prevalent,

these are usual concomitants of intemperance ; but it is notable how very much con-
cubinage is the custom, and how little regard is paid to the obligations of marriage.

   The propensity to gambling seems to have a strong hold on the population.

The ignorance of the population, especially in its lower section, demands more

attention.

   Ignorance in South Staffordshire has been something appalling, and is still very
great. The last generation had but few facilities compared with the present ; the

children of most miners can now be educated where the habits of the parents do not

interfere, but persons above forty years of age are frequently incapable of reading.

The facilities of education have increased tenfold within a generation ; still, great
--142 report 1865.

as is the change, the ignorance of the young of both sexes is very great. Of collier

lads, about one-half can read at all, and that lamely ; of lads in " works," reports of

commissioners, committees, and examiners speak in terms which make us aware

how little has yet been done, notwithstanding the immense efforts being made.

Attendance for education or on religious worship seems to be so lax that it counts

for almost nothing. If this be so in cases where facilities are afforded, for there

are schools attached to the respectable " works," what shall we say of that pro-

portion of the popidation utterly neglected or found out only by the town mis-

sionary and the ragged school ? When out of seven in favourable circumstances

one only can read, when such lads know nothing of Christ or the Crucifixion, or

a future state, cannot repeat the Lord's prayer, what shall we say of the others ?

In tracing the causes of this ignorance, the hindrances to education, we must

point to the employment of young persons at a very curly age in nail-making, brick-
fields, on pit bunks and elsewhere. The expression of opinion of a great employer

is quoted advocating such employment of children and denouncing government

interference. The same person objected to all education of colliers or the working

class, as tending to unfit them for their work. These sentiments date back only

three years, yet are now fast disappearing. The children, thus denied the oppor-

tunity of learning in their early life, must grow up rude and ignorant. Statistics

of schools confirm the view thus given. The proportion of children found in

--schools in various districts after ten years of age is as follows : South Stafford-

shire,  16 per cent. ;                    North Staffordshire 32                                                                                                         North and East Ridings of Yorkshire,
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

32 ; Halifax, worsted manufacturing district, 40. The children thus debarred the

benefit of school, are found in engine-<houses, iron-works, japan-shops, brick-fields,

and elsewhere, doing work which men ought to do or machinery. The connexion

of ignorance with pauperism and crime comes out clear enough in the statistics.

In Stafford gaol, out of 23 juvenile offenders, 19 were from the Black Country, and

of those only 9 could read when committed. At the Saltley reformatory, out of

42 lads there for various crimes, 23 were from South Staffordshire, and' of these

only 3 could read when committed.

The employment of females in ivork utterly unfittedfor them is another item in the

social status. South Staffordshire has a bad notoriety in this matter. The labour

on the pit bank or in the brick-field may not be unhealthy, but it is demoralising.
No female can grow up, under such circumstances, with true womanly delicacy or

fitted for domestic life. Statistics gathered from various sources prove that the

result of such a condition of things is a frightful amount of immorality and general

debasement amongst the girls so employed.

  A further element in the social degradation of the people, and an obstacle to all

improvement, is found in the wretched dwellings of the people. The houses of the

poor are but too often the property of the poor, and are thus destitute not only of

--all convenience, but outrage all decency are hotbeds of disease, physical and

moral. The tumble-down shanties of South Staffordshire have become a standing

disgrace                                  but much is now being done towards their improvement.
                                       ;

 --Passing over man}' points of interest, this is noted as a last, and not least, im-

portant item the fact that very few of the great employers live amongst their people
or mingle much ivith them.

This practice of absenteeism is growing ; nor do many of the proprietors take the

Atrouble to keep themselves pleasantly in the minds of their people.                                                                                                     piece of

land laid out for recreation woidd cost them little in any district, and would be a

noble boon. From these and other circumstances the author rates South Stafford-

shire lower than similar districts in England and Scotland.

   Yet there are signs of rapid improvement, and agencies are at work which are

rapidly changing the faces of things. The New Congregational Chapel at Bilston

stands on the spot where the crowd gathered of old to see the bull baited, and

thus many a vile custom has yielded to the influence of education and religion.

The agencies most effectual in such a district are those which partake of the nature

--of guerilla warfare. Evening classes, ragged-schools, working men's clubs, lectures,

books of pleasant reading, short, pithy these are the things which must influence

educationally the working population. The town missionary is the most efficient

pioneer, religiously. Much of such agency is now at work ; the thing ia how to
                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                           143

extend and further organize it.       " The Association for the Promotion of Adult

Education " is a capital example of what may be done in that direction. Tempe-

rance societies have done much and are doing much ; but a quieter mode of action
would be advisable. Provident societies are increasing, and have now generally

adopted the principle of holding their meetings apart from the public-house.

Old vile habits are certainly disappearing ; more literature is circulated and of a

far better tone ; the people themselves seem awake to their deficiencies and eager
to retrieve. The last strikes and lock-outs showed what even ten years had done

in diffusing information, quickening intelligence, and raising almost a .new order

Weof workmen.       may hope that in time, though we cannot free South Stafford-
-- --shire from smoke and grime therein is its wealth still it may be said of the

district, having regard to its moral purity, it is "black but comely."

The following Table exhibits the statistics of population at various periods, and

the relative facilities of secular and religious instruction. The Table is necessarily

imperfect : there is great difficulty in getting correct statistics in these matters, a

difficulty arising from various causes. The centres of population change rapidly in

this district ; the Table, however, is sufficient for our purpose, and trustworthy in

the main.

                                 Statistics of Pneumonia.

By Professor John H. Bennett, M.D., F.R.S.E., of Edinburgh.

The author, in the first place, pointed out the great difficulty of determining- the

exact value of any particular treatment in a disease, and then described a Table he

had constructed, giving in columns the sex, age, previous health, the day when

first seen after the commencement of the disease, the day of convalescence, period

of convalescence, pulse, respirations, complications, treatment, with observations of

all the cases of pneumonia which had entered his wards, in the Royal Infirmary of

Edinburgh, since the year 1848. These were 129 in number, all treated by restora-
tives. There were only four deaths, or 1 death in 32 J cases,, and in these the fatal

result was not owing to the pneumonia but to other diseases which complicated

it. With regard to treatment therefore these four cases are excluded.

Of the 125 remaining cases 85 were males, and 40 were females. The average

age was 30 years ; 105 cases were simple, and 20 were complicated. The average

duration          J-  disease  in  the  former,  when  single,  was  13f days, when  double

          oi the

16J days. The duration of residence in the hospital of the complicated cases was

21f days, that of the uncomplicated cases was determined by the nature of the

complication.

Dr. Bennett compared these results with those of other hospital physicians, in

·which various treatments had been practised in pneumonia, confining his remarks,
however, to such as were drawn from an equal or a larger munber than his own,
and from the whole inquiry derived the following conclusions* :

" 1. That an extreme antiphlogistic treatment has always been attended with a

--large mortality, amounting to 1 death in 3 cases ; but 'that when modified in

various ways that is, by diminishing the amount of lowering remedies selectiuo-

cases, or by the cases being those of young and vigorous subjects--the 'mortality

varies from 1 death in 4*- to 1 death in 13 cases. When one-half the cases are

those of children, or persons below twenty years of age, and the lowering treat-
ment slight, the mortality diminishes to 1 death in 28 cases.

" 2. That a treatment by large doses of tartar emetic has been accompanied by

a mortality varying from 1 death in 4} to 1 death in 9^ cases.
   " 3. That a dietetic or expectant treatment has been followed by a mortality

varying  from 1 death  in  7   l  to  1 death  in  109  cases.  In children, according to

                               T

Barthez, the mortality is almost nil.

" 4. That the results of a mixed treatment, in which various remedies have been

employed, according to the nature of the case and the stage of the disease, are a

mortality varying from 1 death in 3} to 1 death in 13| cases.

   " 5. That a tonic treatment with iron and copper, according to Kissel, was at-
tended with a mortality of 1 death in 22 cases.

" 6. That a treatment by stimulants, according to Todd, was followed by a mor-

tality of 1 death in 9 cases.

   " 7. That the restorative treatment of the author having been attended, in the
worst point of view, by a mortality of only 1 death in 32£ cases, is the most satis-

factory yet published. But when it is considered that the 4 deaths resulted from

pathological complications unconnected with the pneumonia, it may be said to

render the mortality in true cases of pneumonia nil.

   " 8. That 105 uncomplicated cases, occurring consecutively in the clinical wards

of the Royal Infirmary when under my care, during a period of sixteen years,

should all have recovered, is a fact which can only be ascribed to the nature of the'
treatment, as is shown by contrasting that treatment with others in which a

lowering, expectant, mixed, or specific practice was tried.

  " 9.  That just  in  proportion as other     treatments  approach the restorative prin-

_

ciple, and avoid lowering the system, so much the greater is their success. It will

further be observed that although a direct lowering practice has been avoided, if
the diet had been restricted, or opium, digitalis, alcohol, or other drug largely

given, capable of weakening the system and diminishing appetite, no great advan-

tage has been arrived at. So that

" 10. The variations which appear to follow the same treatment by different

physicians are explicable by the amount of weakness in the patient, or circum-

stances favouring weakness in the treatment, such as low diet, bleeding tartar

emetic, &c. It follows that supporting and restoring (not stimulating) the nutri-

tive powers of the system, and avoiding all weakening remedies, aught to constitute

the practice in pneumonia."

 On the Statistics of Crime in Birmingham, as compared with other large Toivns.
                              By J. TfiACKRAY Bunce, F.S.S.

    For the sake of brevity the state of crime in Birmingham was given only at three
 triennial periods-- 1858, 1861, and 1864. The results of the examination were
 given in seven Tables appended to the paper. The figures throughout were taken
 from the official volume of ' Judicial Statistics.'

    Table I. showed the number of houses of bad character reported to the police.
· Table II. the number of the criminal classes, in their recognized divisions of

--known thieves, receivers, prostitutes, suspected persons, and vagrants as estimated

by the police.

   Table III. the number of indictable offences committed, with the number of per-
sons apprehended, discharged, and committed for trial.

   Table IV. the number of persons proceeded against summarily, with those dis-
charged, convicted, and fined.

   Tables V., VI., and VII., the nature of the indictable offences committed, the
principal offences under the class of summary procedure, and the previous character
(as returned by the police) of the persons dealt with under both heads.

   The following is a summary of the first four of these Tables :

Total criminal class                              1864.  1861.  1858.

   The discrepancy between the criminal class in 1858 and 1864 is accounted for by
the adoption of a better mode of reckoning them by the police : in the former year
they Were merely estimated, in the last-named year the name of every person be-
longing to the criminal class (that is, known to be living by crime or to be a pro-
fessional vagrant) was actually written down, and care was taken to see that no
name appeared twice in the list. The following Tables show the general results of
a comparison of all England, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, and

Sheffield for the year 1864 :

afforded through its measures of weight, capacity, square and cubic measure being

all directly and decimally derived from the metre (the measure of length).

The paper was elaborately illustrated by diagrams, and numerous practical ex-

amples were given in proof of the great advantages of the system. To estimate

the number of figures that would be saved in consequence of the metric system

being decimal, the author stated that, " To judge of this advantage it will not do

to take any particular example, for particular examples may be found in favour

either of the English or the Metric System, or even in favour of the old Roman

CDMnumerals ; since  each expresses by one sign the quantity which in Arabic

numbers must be expressed by three or four signs, thus, 100, 500, 1000. It will

therefore be necessary to enter into some general calculation as to the number of

figures required under each system, and to set down and carry out a regular series

of figures in addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division, in order to see

with which of the two systems the advantage lies. I take the weights, and begin

with addition. I proceed with the metric system, and write down consecutively

every weight that can be expressed, proceeding by grammes from 1 to 1024 grammes.

1024 items can be expressed, and to express them either in grammes, deci-

--hecto-, and kilogrammes, exactly the same figures, and therefore the same number

of figures are required the number is 2986.

" I proceed now to set down 1024 items in the English system, from the half

drachm (the approximate equivalent of the gramme) to 1 lb. 15| ounces. The

figures I must set down are

For the fractions                                                                                            1024

or nearly 50 per cent, more than are required for the metric system.

   " This is, however, only writing down data. Suppose we begin to add up the
items in each system, we shall find the gain to the metric system enormous. I

begin by adding 1 and 2 grammes, then 1, 2, 3 grammes, and so on ; adding up
every sum from one gramme till I have added from 1 to 31 grammes.

I have to set down before I add up                      758 figures ; and
The sums of these would take                              83 ,,

  " Now I proceed to add up the English weights from half a drachm to 1 oz. (a

similar number of items to the metric).

I have to set down before I add up                                                                                 1027 figures.

When added up, the number of figures required to express the

sums in drachms is                                                                                                 92 ,,

But the sums of these drachms have to be brought in ounces and

pounds by calculation, and each addition involves a sum in

long division, which again involves multiplication and sub-

traction, and the number of figures I require to set down for

these calculations is                                                                                              4096  ,,

myTo express the final result of  additions in pounds, ounces,

and drachms, I have to set down                                                                                    89 ,,

   "In subtraction, multiplication, and division, the advantage of the metric system

is still greater. In calculations of length, capacity, square and cubic measure, the
proportion in favour of the metric system would be less than 5 to 1 in some cases,

and in others much greater.

   " The next advantage of the metric system arises from all its weights, measures
of capacity, square and cubic measure being directly and decimally derived from the
metre, and consequently being directly and decimally related one to the other."
(Numerous tables were exhibited to illustrate this.)

The author then entered into some elaborate calculations to show that the univer-

sally received English equivalent of the metre was incorrect (notwithstanding that

it had been sanctioned and adopted by the Royal Society, by a Royal Commission

appointed to investigate the matter, and by the Houses of Lords and Commons)

therefore the given English equivalents of all the weights and measures of the

metric system were false. The author showed by demonstration that the abso-

lutely correct English equivalent of the metre was 1 metre=39-370387542944176

=(38024691) inches [38024691 being a recurring series of decimals], say 1 metre

39-37039 inches                                                                            whereas the universally received equivalent is 1 metre =39-37079
                                                                                        ;

inches. He pointed out that this error was increased in a square measure bv the

square of the error; and in measures of weight, capacity, and cubic measure by the

cube of the error, since all metric weights and measures are derived from the metre

by squaring and cubing. He showed that this error was far too great to be allowed

to remain uncorrected, and gave several instances in which it would partly account

for certain apparent discrepancies in terrestrial and astronomical measurements in

different countries, stating, as a familiar illustration, that this error would make a

difference of about 1000 miles in the given distance of the sun from the earth.

  The author proceeded : " A Bill was lately passed by both Houses of Parliament,

making legal in this country the use of the metric system of weights and mea-

sures. Attached to this Bill was a table or schedule which professed to give the

metric equivalents of the English weights and measures ; which equivalents are

declared by the Bill to be binding on all traders using the metric system. Not onlv

was this schedule founded on the incorrect datum that 1 metre = 39-37079 (the

correct datum being 1 metre =39-37039), but it did not harmonize even with its
own datum. According to this Bill, a dekametre, that is 10 metres, or 100 deci-

metres, or 1000 centimetres, or 10,000 millimetres, if reckoned from the Govern-
ment schedule,

                                                                                           as a dekametre, is a certain quantity

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

So that we have five different English equivalents given to represent the same

measure, not one of which quantities is correct after all.

know how to give a decision, as there is nothing in the Bill to say whether deka-

metres, metres, centimetres, &c. are to he calculated from, should any dispute

arise.

   " In illustration of the evils that may occur from this, a trader's yearly purchases
of goods bought and sold by length, such as cloth, silk, satin, &c, are, say,
£389,000. He hopes to make a clear gain (after paying every expense of salaries,
rents, taxes, interest, &c.) of £1000 a year, which we will say he would do were
the schedule of metric and English equivalents correct. Now, accordingly as he

reduces his quantities from English into metric lengths, and vice versa, and buys
and sells and reckons in dekametres, metres, centimetres, &c, though he has done
exactly the same business, and bought and sold at exactly the same nominal

price, yet by using the Government schedule he may actually find his net profit
vary from £400 to £1600 per year. His net profit may vary (solely from the in-
correctness of the schedule) as follows. It mav be £400, or £420, or £435 16s., or

£436, or £700, or £702, or £702 2s., or £710, or £1000, or £1282, or £1282 18s.,
or £1290, or £1300, or £1564, or £1565, or £1580, or £1600. To explain this more
fully, say that 3940 inches of best broad gold lace are sold to A, B, C, and 1) as
100,000 millimetres (which equivalent is correct according to the schedule). I
buy this from A, B, C, and D, but as 100,000 millimetres are equal to 10,000 centi-
metres, and these latter, according to the schedule, are equal to only 3937 inches, I
only pay for 3937 inches instead of 3940. Thus in buying I gain 3 inches of gold

lace through the schedule being incorrect.

  Now" in selling I just reverse the process, and sell only 3937 inches as 10,000

centimetres, which, according to the schedule, is likewise incorrect. These 10,000
centimetres, according to the schedule, would also be exactly equal to 100,000 mil-

limetres so that in selling I gain 3 inches.     Suppose the average price (quoted in
                                              ;

English quantity) of the gold lace were £1 per inch ; then

I buy 100,000 millimetres (3940 inches in reality) for £3937

And sell 10,000 centimetres (or 3937 inches) for            3940

Thus gaining 3 inches and                                   3

   " On the other hand, I might have lost £6 instead of gaining it, or a difference of
£12 might be -made for or against me.

   " In conclusion, I would strongly urge the advisability of investigating and cor-
recting the inaccuracy of the English equivalent of the metre, and the rectification
of the Government metric schedule before any further legal steps are taken to pro-
mote the metric system in this country."

             Statistics of the Small Arms Manufacture of Birmingham.
                                   By J. D. Goodman.

   Prior to the close of the 17th century, at which time Macaulay states that the
population of Birmingham was only 4000, England obtained her supplies of arms
from the continent. In 1689, by the direction of William III., an opportunity was
given to the manufacturers of Birmingham to produce the flint-lock gun then in

use. The first trial of the skill of the Birmingham men having resulted satisfac-
torily, an order was afterwards transmitted to five manufacturers to provide 200

Snaphance muskets per month, for which they were to receive, on delivery of each

hundred muskets, 17s. each, ready money, in one week after delivery in the Tower

of London, and that they were to be allowed 3s. for the carriage of every one

hundred-weight. This document bears date 5th of January, 1693. There is little

or no information as to the progress of the manufacture till the commencement of

the present century, when the military records denote the capabilities of the trade

at that period. The following is the system at present pursued in carrying on this

manufacture in Birmingham at the present time. The manufacture of the various

parts of the gun, as barrel, lock, Sec, are distinct branches. These several parts

--are collected by the manufacturer, known as the gun-maker, and by him are set

up. The chief branches are : Stock-making, barrel-making, lock-making, fur-

niture-making, oddwork-making ; and for military guns there are in addition,

bayonet-making, sight-making, rammer-making. The stocks are of two kinds

beechwood and walnut. They are brought to Birmingham, cut from the plank

into the form of the gun. Beech-stocks are grown in this country, chiefly in

Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. Walnut-stocks are, with few exceptions, im-

ported from Italy and Germany. On reference to the Directory of the present

year, we find 599 names of manufacturers engaged in the different branches of the

trade. The list of workmen employed estimates the total number at 7340. Of

these 3420 are engaged in producing the materials, the barrel employing 700, the

lock 1200, the bayonet 500, and so on. Setting up these materials into guns

employed 3920 men. Of these the three chief branches are the stockers, screwers,

and finishers. Each of these branches, with its subbranches, is estimated to

employ 1000 men. The outworking system leads to the employment of a con-

siderable number of young boys. No very correct estimate can be given of the

rate of wages earned by the workmen in the gun-trade. During the past ten

years there is little doubt but that the wages earned in this trade have probably

exceeded those in any other. It is a very common practice in many of the branches

for a workman to employ several assistants, whether working in the factory of his

employer or as out-door worker. Strikes have occurred in the gun-trade, but

happily not frequently. The gun-makers engaged in the military arms trade are

associated together, one object being the regulation of wages to be paid to work-

men. The men, in like manner, act together, the respective leading branches
having their own organization. Masters and men each know the strength of the

other, and have, on the whole, so arranged their mutual dealings as to avoid dis-

putes. The Birmingham workmen are much more highly paid than those of Belgium

and France. This low price of labour gives our Belgian rivals a great advantage
on the other hand, the better paid and better fed English workman can accomplish

an amount of work far in advance of his Belgian workfellow ; and the English

manufacturers possess a further advantage in the more extended application of

machinery, the use of which in Liege is discouraged by the cheap rate at which

hand labour can be obtained. The Birmingham gun-makers have long been aware

that a more extensive use must be made of the advantages which they possess, and

this has lead to the erection in Birmingham of an establishment for the manufac-
Weture of guns by machinery, on the interchangeable principle.
                                                                must give

America credit* for the introduction of this system. It was from thence it was

brought into this country. The total number of processes under which an Enfield

musket of the pattern 1853 undergoes is upwards of 600. Guns made by this

system will interchange ; that is, that any part of one gun will fit another. The
factory of the Birmingham Small Arms Company is now in working operation.

The system is there carried out in its full integrity. It has been planned on a

scale to produce 1000 guns per week. There are upwards of 300 machines at

work, but at present it has not reached its full power. The number of guns now

made there is about 500 per week. The proving of barrels was first provided for
by a charter granted by Charles I. to the London gimmakers. No public proof-
house existed in Birmingham till 1813, when an Act of Parliament was obtained

Agiving the necessary powers. second Act was obtained in 1815, which remained

in force till 1855, when the inventions of modern days rendered the establishment
of new regidations necessary. By these regulations the security of the user was

.greatly improved. Under this Act the gun-trade is recognized as an associated

body, to which all are entitled to belong who carry on the trade within ten miles

of the Borough of Birmingham, and who are rated to the poor at not less than £15.

A fee of a guinea is paid annually on registration. The trade is required to meet

on the 9th of March in each year, when they elect the managers of the Proof

House. The total number of the guns and pistols proved in England during the

period 1865-1864 was 6,116,305. Of this number there were proved at the

Birmingham Trade Proof House, 3,277,815 ; at the Government Proof House in

Birmingham, 978,249 (these last represent military guns made for the English

service) ; at the London Proof House, 1,355,139; and at the Enfield Factory,

--505,102. The Enfield Factory has only been in operation seven years. The

average annual production will thus be Birmingham Trade Proof House,

327,781 ; Birmingham Government Proof House, 97,824 ; London Trade Proof

House, 135,513; Enfield Proof House, 72,154; making a total annual production

for the whole of England of 633,272. As near as can be estimated, the number of

small arms manufactured in Birmingham and elsewhere, for the Americans during

the last four years, make a total number of 1,078,205, Birmingham supplying

733,403 : London, 344,802. During the last ten years the total production of

England was, after deducting the number of arms made at the Enfield Factory,

5,611,203. The production of the Liege trade during the same ten years was

6,842,264, or something more than 1,000,000 in excess of our make. It must

be understood, however, that while the aggregate number produced in England is

less than that of Liege, the aggregate value of the British arms is greater. The Bel-

gians make a very large number of pocket-pistols at Is. 0^d. to Is. lid. each pistol.

--In the ten years the number of pocket-pistols proved was 2,305,176 more than one-

third of the entire make of Liege. In the English returns we have only 588,477

pistols, or little more than one-tenth, and none of these are sold at anything like

the prices of the common pistols of Liege. As the demand for English work runs on

superior qualities, the English makers have never attempted to make pistols of this

very low class. The following statement will show the number of guns made and

--exported during the ten years, 1855-1864 : Number of guns made in England

for ordinary trade, 3,822,457 ; of this number England exported 2,685,309 ; num-

ber of guns made in Belgium for trade, 5,390,675 ; number assumed to be exported

by Belgium, 3,760,450 ; declared value of Belgian exports, £4,743,296 ; value of

each gun, £l 5s. Id. The arms manufactured by the English trade for Govern-

ment use are estimated at £3 each. This is somewhat below the real value, but it

will be near enough for the present purpose. These data will give us the following

results as the value of the production of the two trades during the ten years 1855

to 1864 inclusive; Belgium, number of guns at 25s. 2d. each, 6,842,265; total

value of Belgian guns, £8,609,849. England, number of guns at 33s. lOd. each,

4,632,954 ; value of ditto, £7,837,409. ' Number of guns at £3 each, 978,249

value of ditto, £2,934,747. Total value of English guns, £10,772,156. Although

the value of our trade is thus shown to be more than equal to that of the only

source of supply which at all approaches us in the extent of manufacture, it is

manifest that the Birmingham gun-trade must be on the alert if it is to maintain

its ground. To contend against the cheap labour of Liege is not an easy task.

The establishment of the machine factory, it is hoped, is a step in the right direc-

tion. It will secure for the town the trade in the highest class of military work,

which otherwise would have gone to its competitors. Excessive prices for labour

are still paid in certain branches of the work, particularly when sudden pressure comes

Aupon the trade.  more uniform rate of wages would benefit all parties ; the

master would feel more confidence in tendering for contracts at moderate rates,

and the workmen woidd secure more regular employment.

   The good effected by the Savings' Banks on the old principle, was limited by
their fewness (only 683 in the United Kingdom), by their want of security
(as proved by several failures), and by the short periods in the week during which
they were, kept open. As the Post-Office Savings' Banks have been well described

Statistics of the Benefit Building and Freehold Land Societies of Birmingham.
                                      By G. J. Johnson.

   Commencing with the statement that since the year 1842 nearly £2,500,000 had
been paid by the working and lower section of the middle classes in Birmingham

into such societies, the writer proceeded to explain four Tables illustrating the

paper. Table I. gave a list of all the societies enrolled under the Building Societies'

Act (1836) since the year 1842, when the first Society in Birmingham was formed
under such Act. The number so enrolled was only two. The early societies were
all formed on the " terminating " principle ; most "of the later ones (twenty-eight
out of thirty-five) on the " permanent principle, the details of which were ex-
plained at length. Table II. stated the results of the societies which had either
terminated successfully, or been wound up without loss, from which it appeared

that about £77,858 had passed through such societies. Table III. gave a list, so far

as could be ascertained, of the  societies which had  ended in  loss to the members
                                                                                                                                                               ;

and it was remarked how small a proportion the unsuccessful societies bore to the

others both in number and in the actual amouut of business done. Table IV. con-

tained the statistics of the nineteen existing Building and Freehold Land Societies

of Birmingham, by which it appeared that these societies had received in the
aggregate £2,242,968; that their present members numbered 11,193; the amount

now due from borrowing members on mortgage was £539,732 ; and the amount

due to investing members was £438,043, exclusive of £60,000 due to persons
not members who had lent money on deposit at interest. The details of the work-
ing of both Building and Land Societies were then explained in reference to both

classes of members, investers and borrowers ; and the paper concluded as follows :
   " There is one question which has forced itself upon the attention of all engaged

in the working of these societies, and that is, whether the time has not arrived for

altering their legal status altogether. I have no wish to raise legal questions here,

but it is not a legal but an economical question, whether societies having an

income, as many of the larger Birmingham societies have, from £50,000 to
£100,000 a year, ought not to have the advantages of corporate existence as may
now be enjoyed by any seven persons who choose, by subscribing a memorandum
of Association for one share of £1 each, to form a ' Joint Stock Company Limited.'

No one can read the Act of 1836 without noticing that from the preamble declaring

' that it was desirable to afford encouragement and protection to societies to assist

the members  thereof  in  obtaining a small freehold  or leasehold  property ;                                               down
                                                                                                                          '

to the last clause the whole scope of the Act is utterly inadequte to the present

condition of these societies. One instance will suffice. It is the theory of the Act

that a Building Society is a small Friendly Society, the members of which will

meet once a week or fortnight. Accordingly, it provides that a general meeting of

the members may be called by a notice read at two such meetings. There are,_at

--least, six societies in Birmingham with 1000 members and upwards one with

more than 3000. These members pay their subscriptions fortnightly, quarterly, or

yearly ; and when they go, or more often send to the office for that purpose, it is no
more a meeting than the shareholders going or sending to pay their calls at a bank
is a shareholders' meeting. The facts have outgrown the theory on which the Act

was constructed. The consequence has been that more than once very improper
rules have been made at meetings, called in the Act of Parliament mode, which

were necessarily unknown to all the members, except the half-dozen interested in

the object on which the meetings were called.

   " What is wanted is a recognition that these societies are no longer small friendly

societies, but are large investment associations, and are therefore entitled to become

incorporated companies."

         On the Past and Present Productive Power of Cotton Machinery,
                                      By D. Morris.

   After stating that between 1760 and 1830 the inventions of Paul, Arkwright,
Cronrpton, Hargreaves, Kay, and others, really laid the foundation of the present
system of cotton factory operations, and giving a brief notice of the different

machines now in use, the author described the progress made in the productive

power of cotton machinery. During the last thirty years, ending in the year 1860,

vast improvements had been made in the blowing-room, the machines being now
entirely made of iron instead of, as formerly, part wood and part iron. The card-
rooms were now almost invariably well ventilated and lighted, whilst the improve-

ments in the carding machines were striking, the entire machines, including self-
acting strippers, better clothing, and greater working surface, having undergone a
total change. The drawing frame, stubbing and roving frames, had also experi-
enced great changes for the better. Less progress had been made in the throstle
frames than in any other frames in cotton machines. In the mules, both hand and
self-acting, great improvements had been made in consequence principally of the

many excellent appliances which had been introduced into the headstock, to save
weight and bodily labour on the part of spinners. The author went at consi-
derable length into the improvements made in looms since 1830. In the winding

apparatus the only improvement was in its form, and the invention of a motion to
shape the bobbin. In warping machines the latest improvement was by Messrs.

Howard and Bullough, of Accrington. The tape-sizing machine, by Mr. W. Ken-

worthy, of Blackburn, would do the work of six of the old ball-sizing machines
used in 1830. The invention of knitting-machines to knit healds was a saving of
50 per cent, in the cost of production. The folding or plaiting, or measuring
machine was generally adopted, and effected a great saving of time and wages, as
was also the hvdraulic press. Finally, in 1764 the cotton imported into this country
was 3,870,392 lbs., in 1830 239,837,350 lbs., and in 1860 1 ,083,600,000 lbs. ; and the
increase in the mills, spindles, looms, and workers was in proportion, namely :

and a quarter.

AThe ages of the people show the migration that goes on.  large number of

girls come into the towns as domestic servants, and a considerable proportion of
these return to the country to die. The male deaths, therefore, show the sanitary

condition better than the female deaths.

   It is commonly believed that while the male death-rate on the whole exceeds
the female, the female death-rate is the higher from puberty to middle life. The

truth is, that from 1851 to 1861 the female death-rate was the higher from puberty
to twenty, and about equal to the male from twenty to middle life.

  Among the causes of death it is remarkable that there are no more deaths to

population from cancer in unhealthy Liverpool than in all England.

From lung disease, even including phthisis, there are more male than female

deaths.                                                                    As to

for the boroughs.

  On the Admission of Illegitimate Children into Workhouses, as a means of
                     preventing Infanticide. By E. Vivian, J. P.

   Air. E.Vivian, of Torquay, one of the Magistrates for the County of Devon, who

committed Harris and Winsor on the charge of murdering the infant child of the
former near Torquay, read a paper founded upon the following resolutions, which
he intended to bring before the Board of Guardians of the Newton Abbott Union,
in which the offence was committed :

   1. " That it is expedient that Boards of Guardians should be entrusted with a
discretionary power to admit illegitimate and, in special cases, legitimate children,
into the workhouses without their mothers also necessarily being inmates. The
expense to be borne, when practicable, by one or both parents.

   2. " That it should be the duty of Believing Officers and other parochial autho-
rities, to ascertain and place on record the parentage in all cases of illegitimate

birth, and to promote the obtaining of orders of affiliation, so to prevent the burden
from falling upon the ratepayers, or exclusively upon the mother, from lapse of the
statutory time in making the application."

   Under the present law, both these courses are prohibited. He believed that,
under the surveillance of the Poor- Law Board, the discretionary power thus given

to the Guardians would not be abused, and that the workhouse would afford a
refuge intermediate between a Foundling Hospital, -with all the encouragements

resulting from secrecy, and the cruelties now practised upon the unfortunate chil-
dren when put out privately to nurse. The mothers might be required to remain
in the workhouse, so long as their services were required, as nurses to their own or

other infants, when, at the discretion of the Guardians, they might resume their
employments, and recover their lost position, which is in most cases imprac-

ticable when burdened with the care of a child.

 A Statistical Review of the Police-recognised Drunkenness of the Metropolis.

                                       By R. Wilkinson.

   Partly by statistics already printed by order of the House of Commons, and
partly from information courteously communicated by the Chief Commissioner of
the Metropolitan Police, the author was enabled to present a view of the police-
recognized drunkenness of the metropolitan district, which embraces a radius of
about sixteen miles from Charing Cross.

   I. The apprehensions for drunkenness, and for drunkenness with disorder, during
each decennial period, with the annual averages, were as follows :--=

IV. The very important question, how far these statistics indicate the extent of

the actual intemperance of the metropolis, remains to he considered. In reduction

of the figures presented, it is to be noted that they represent cases, not distinct

persons, many of whom are apprehended more than twice in the year, and some

of them many times over. If the proportion of persons to cases is placed at 2 to 3,
that proportionate reduction must be made in calculating the numbers appre-

hended, and the proportion of those persons to the population. This rule need

only be applied, by way of exemplification, to the annual average for the last four

years, and it will give

  °Li!a a

If we turn to the facts, which evince a prevalence of metropolitan intemperance

far exceeding the proportions represented by the statistical data, we shall find them

to consist of the following :

1st. The fact tbat police apprehensions are limited to cases of aggravated intem-

perance coming under the view of the police. In 1834, when Col. Rowan, one of

the Police Commissioners, was under examination before Mr. Buckingham's select

committee of the House of Commons, he stated that, as to cases of intoxication

unconnected with disorder, he believed that only one in three came into the

custody of the police. The night-police are specially disposed to do as little as they

possibly can in the apprehension of drunkards, as they have to lose their next

day's rest, to give witness against the accused persons. The police pretend to

arrest drunk and incapable, and drunk and disorderly persons only, but (1) many

of even such cases they never see, and (2) not a few of tbose seen are let alone

from the trouble they would entail, or the wish to preserve individuals, otherwise

respectable, from exposure.

2nd. There is the fact tbat all persons intoxicated, who can manage to get along

with or without the help of others, are systematically avoided by the police.

3rd. There is the fact that, as compared with the population, the very young

and the aged are necessarily excluded from the calculation. This is at once equal

to raising the proportion of arrested persons to the population almost one half ; so

that instead of 1 in 247, we might read 1 in 125.

4th. There is the fact that the intemperance practised in private is in a great

degree withdrawn from the cognizance of the police.

All these considerations tend to prove that the actual arrests for aggravated

intemperance by no means represent the total of such public cases ; that they

absolutely exclude all private cases of that kind ; that they are independent of all

cases of simple intoxication, as such                                                                                                                                                                                  and  that they  have nothing to do with that
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

habit of tippling, the cause of much disease, poverty, and crime, but not necessarily

taking the developed form of positive intoxication.

There are about 10,000 drinking shops in London, and it would be a very

moderate estimate that would assign to each on every Saturday night twenty per-

sons in different stages of intoxication ; and supposing that these were the same

persons every Saturday night (though often they are not the ssvme), they woidd

exhibit a total of 200,000 individuals, mostly of middle age, living in the metro-

polis alone, who periodically subject themselves to the vice of intoxication, a

number equal to 13 per cent, of the adult population, or 1 in every 8 persons.

How this result can be materially altered while the licensed temptations to drink-

ing remain as they are, the moralist and statesman may well despair of discovering.

Public-house associations are perpetually extending, and the evils are transmitted

from one generation to another.

Some vigorous effort for the reduction of drinking shops is the only resource

left, since purely moral and reformatory agencies are counteracted more success-

fully than they counteract the opposite influences.

No remedy yet proposed will be effectual unless it includes a suggestion thrown

out by Mr. Charles Buxton in 1855, and adopted by the United Kingdom Alliance
in 1857, by which every parish and township would be empowered to settle for

itself whether drinking shops should continue to be licensed or not within its

limits. Where the public sentiment was averse to the common sale of intoxicating

liquors, all houses for public refreshment would be carried on without such sale
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and the author believed that an immediate and most gratifying change would soon

ensue in regard to the drunkenness and crime by which these places may have been

afflicted.

On Mural Standards for exhibiting the Measures of Length legalized in the
               United Kingdom. By James Yates, M.A., F.li.S.

The only mural standards exhibited in this country known to the author

are those in the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, London, where are seen the

metre, the yard, the braccio, and the palm ; secondly, those on the outside wall of

the lioyal Observatory at Greenwich, showing the yard, the foot, and the inch ; and

thirdly, three similar instruments put up and exposed to public view by the Messrs.

De la Rue in Bunhill Row, London. Nevertheless the exhibition of similar stand-

ards is required by law and practised in France, and its adoption in this country

has been recommended by the Royal Commission for restoring the lost standards*.

The present period seems eminently suitable for the more perfect attainment

of this object, because the English system of legal weights and measures has re-

ceived an enlargement of the highest importance by the passing of the Act for le-

galizing the metric system. Also the existing standards in many of the cities and

boroughs of the United Kingdom are extremely faulty.

The only measures which can be conveniently exhibited on the walls of public

buildings, are the measures of length. These are the yard and the metre, with

Mytheir divisions.  design in this paper is to inquire how these can be exhibited

by means of mural standards in the best manner. The inquiry may be con-

ducted under the following heads : the material ; the form and dimensions ; the

description by means of letters, figures, and other marks ; the distribution and

exposure to public view ; the use in education ; the aid to be afforded by the

British Association.

 --I. The Material. The material which I am disposed to recommend is that variety

of gun-metal which is known by the name of Baily's metal, having been introduced

into use for similar purposes by the late Francis Baily. The standard yard of Great

Britain is made of this metal, as prescribed by the Act of Parliament, 18 & 19

Victoria, c. 72. It is a mixture of copper, zinc, and tin, as follows :

                    Copper  16
                    Zinc
                    Tin       1

                              2|

   The great recommendation of this metal is that it does not rust. In other respects
it is probably on a par with the other metals which are used or may be suggested

for similar purposes, such as gold, silver, platinum, copper, brass, bronze, steel, or

    * "Another measure ought, in our opinion, to be effected by the authority of the
Government ; namely, the fixing of mural standards of length in public places, where they

may be accessible to the people generally. This is done under the Prussian law and we
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

are supported by the evidence of practical men, that it would conduce most powerfully

--to the dissemination of good measures of length." Report of the Commissioners for

Restoration of the Standards, a.d. 1841, p. 16. This recommendation was seconded in

the following terms by the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Weights and

Measures, A.n. 1862. " Public standards should be exhibited (as barometers are at our
ports and fishing-stations) in conspicuous places in our towns, and secured (as they are on
the Continent) by insertion in the walls. ' There is no such thing in Britain,' says the
Astronomer Royal, 'as a public exhibition of a measure or a weight.' The Government,

--instead of being passive, ought to be active in the question." Report, p. ix. The Astro-

nomer Royal's letter, here quoted, is dated 1st February, 1859. It is addressed to Lord

--Monteagle, at that time Comptroller of the Exchequer, and is highly deserving of atten-

tion. See Appendix to same Report, p. 225.
--160 REPORT 1865.

aluminium bronze. It is sufficiently hard ; it is fusible, and takes good inpressions

--in the mould ; it shows fine and clear lines on being engraved*.
   II. Form and Dimensions. I propose that the instrument should be 102 centi-
metres long, 6 centimetres broad, and 1 centimetre thick. The reasons for adopt-

ing these dimensions will be explained in the sequel.

 --TTT. Description by means of Letters, Figures, and other marks. For the com-

position and arrangement of these I am indebted to Mr. Frank Fellows.

   The yard is placed above, the metre below. Above the yard is its description,
in these words: "Yard divided into Feet and Inches," after which the title of the
Act of Parliament is quoted, by which Act the yard is defined, and its legality
established, viz., "5 Geo. IV. ch. 74." The space* on which these titles are to be

inscribed is proposed to be 1 centimetre broad.

   The antithesis to this space is that at the bottom of the instrument, also 1 centi-
metre broad. It describes the measure immediately above it, and the Act of Parlia-
ment by which that measure is denned, and its legality established : " Metre divided

--into Decimetres, Centimetres, and Millimetres. 27th and 28th Victoria, ch. 117."

   The middle breadth of 4 centimetres is equally divided between the yard and the
metre. Each of these has a space of 2 centimetres broad, and the space belonging to
each is again divided into equal breadths, each of which has consequently a breadth
of 1 centimetre. The space belonging to the. yard is a yard long, and is intended to
be the exact measure of a yard. The space beneath it, and contiguous to it, belong-
ing to the metre, is, in like manner, intended to be the exact measure of a metre.

   The upper half of the space belonging to the yard, being a centimetre broad, is

divided lengthways into 3 feet ; the lower space, also a centimetre broad, is divided
into 36 inches. Thus far the division is that appointed by Act of Parliament. But

we have thought a further subdivision expedient, through a small portion of the

scale, viz., the division into eighths of an inch. "We have chosen eighths rather
than tenths or twelfths of an inch, because eighths are far more extensively in use,

and also some persons of eminence and high authority in this country think a binary

much preferable to a decimal or duodecimal division.

    Proceeding on the same principle and in strict conformity with the law of the

country, we divide the metre lengthways into decimetres, centimetres, and milli-

metres. But whereas the yard has the greater divisions placed above and the
smaller divisions below, we have in the case' of the metre placed the smaller divi-

sions above and the larger below. This arrangement produces great facilities for
comparison, because it brings the small divisions of the two scales into immediate

apposition. Thus we fiud as approximations,

=One eighth of an inch     3 millimetres.
                           6 millimetres.
One quarter ,, =         12i millimetres.
                         25 millimetres.
One half     ,,=         50 millimetres.
                        100 millimetres.
One inch     =

Two inches   =

Four inches  =

   For greater exactness reference may be made to Packard's Ready Reckoner, or

Dowling's Comparative Tables.

   It is necessary to observe that both of these scales begin from the left hand, and
from the same perpendicular line.

   The spaces at the two ends of the instrument, which are extraneous to the
yard and metre scales, are each half a centimetre wide. They will serve as
guards to the two 'scales. The name of the maker of the instrument mav be

engraved on the right hand. If the manufacture of these standards is entrusted
to well-qualified persons, if they are provicfed with exact standards for their

own use, and if they bestow due pains and care on those which they produce,
the standards of their making will be sufficiently accurate for all common prac-

tical purposes, and there will be no necessity to seek assistance in providing lineal

   * Notwithstanding these real or supposed advantages, the use of Baily's metal has been
abandoned in favour of the adoption of glazed or enamelled porcelain.

measures from the Government. But the name of an artist of established reputa-

tion ought to be shown on the mural standard as a voucher for its correctness.

 --IV. Distribution and Exposure to public view. This part of the subject will be

more especially considered when we come to the last division, viz., the assistance
to be afforded by the British Association. At present I will only make the obvious

remark, that the mural standards should be put up wherever they will be least ex-
posed to injury, and can be seen, examined, and compared by the greatest number

--of persons.
   V. Use in Education. The immediate and primary use of these standards will
be to make the two methods of linear measurement universally known, to render the
terms, especially those belonging to the metre, familiar to the people, and to enable
all persons to verify their own measures. But it is important to have an eye also
to the use of these instruments in education. For this purpose I have proposed
exact dimensions in length, breadth, and thickness, on the metric scale. The con-
sequence will be that they may give many useful and interesting lessons in men-

suration and geometry. In this way the instrument may be of great use in large

schools for every class of the community. It will be observed that the space, one
centimetre wide, which is immediately below the yard, is divided into 100 square

centimetres. The dimensions of the other spaces being borne in mind, the follow-

ing questions and answers will illustrate the present subject.      Answer : 101 X 6

   What is the area of this mural standard in square centimetres ?

= 606 square centimetres.

State also what is the area in square decimetres and millimetres.

                              Answer : 6-06 square decimetres.

                                              60600 square millimetres.

What part is this of a solid metre ? Answer :  250 00Q  .

  What is the weight of the instrument, supposing the specific gravity to be 2-6 ?
--Answer : 606x2-6 = 1575-6 grams., or 1-5756 kilos.

 --VI. Aid to be afforded by the British Association. Since the promotion of

the metric system is an object of universal interest, and one in which science
has been applied in the most admirable manner to practical purposes, there
is none to which the British Association for the Advancement of Science can
with greater propriety extend its patronage, and devote a portion of its funds.
In connexion with this object a Committee was appointed at Newcastle-on-
Tvne; this Committee was reappointed last year at Bath, and was authorized
to spend the sum of £20. This money has not been applied for, no specific

object requiring such an expenditure having presented itself to the Committee.

Let the Committee be reappointed. Let it be encouraged to proceed, and autho-
rized to construct mural standards of the best possible description. Let one of

these be offered to every place where the British Association has held a Meeting,

two or three being offered where two or three Meetings have been held. Let the
authorities of these towns, cities, or imiversities be requested to expose these stand-

ards to view in such places and in such manner as they may judge most suitable
and expedient. The Association may thus acknowledge, in a handsome and appro-
priate manner, the kindness and generosity which it has experienced ; it may confer

a public benefit, and supply a great deficiency in the provisions for conducting

trade ; it may aid the movement, than which none, perhaps, is at the present
moment more important in the interests of education and philanthropy, and it may

vindicate and exalt science in the eyes of all reflecting persons, by showing its

utility in every-day life, and in all commercial transactions.

Statistical Data in Relation to the Representation of the People. By Leone

    Levi, Doctor of Economic Science of the University of Tubingen, Professor

   of the Principles of Commerce and Commercial Law in King's College, Lon-

    don, F.S.A., F.S.S., 4>c.

Great as were the difficulties of applying the theoretic principles of political

science to public administration, harder still was the task imposed on the legislator
when he touched the question of parliamentary franchise, a subject so intimately

connected with constitutional rights and political conflicts. Without entering into

the troubled waters of party politics, the author proposed only to give some statistical

data as might serve to mature any views on a matter most important to the well-

being of the people, remembering that political science is founded on inductive rea-

soning and on facts drawn from political arithmetic. Upon a review of the elec-

toral laws of different countries, the author stated, that in France universal suffrage

was established in 1852 ; in Germany the qualifications were birth or naturali-

zation in the country, age, which in Prussia and Austria is fixed at 24 years, in-

dependence, and the payment of a certain amount of taxes. In Spain the limit

of age is 25, and the tax which a person need pay to have the right to vote is 400

reals, with exemptions for members of scientific bodies or professional men. In

Belgium, also, the age of the voter must be 25, and he must pay a tax of 42 frs.

32 cents. In Italy the age fixed is 25, the tax is 40 frs., and the elector must be

able to read and write, except in certain provinces especially designated, but there

are many exemptions to the condition of taxation in favour of members of acade-

mies, &c. In the United States of America the law differs in each State*. The age

is generally 21. The payment of any tax assessed within two years is a condition

in Massachusetts, as well as reading and writing. In Rhode Island the voter must
own real estate worth $184, or rent $7 per annum ; or must pay $1 tax, or have

done militia service within the year. In Connecticut the voter must be able to

read and write. In Pennsylvania the voter must have paid a tax within two years.
The same is in Delaware. In North Carolina the voter must possess a freehold of

fifty acres for six months. In Georgia he must have paid all taxes required of him.
The time of residence in the State before any one can vote differs also materially,

and distinction is made of colour. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachu-

setts, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin make no legal distinctions on the ground of

colour. In New York coloured citizens must be owners of a freehold worth $250.

The other States deny the right of suffrage to the Negro. In the United Kingdom

a difference is made between county and borough electors, the rent of the house

--or tenement occupied being taken as a basis for the right, in the county the limits

being £50                                                   in the borough, £10.  The population of England and Wales on the
                                                         ;

6th of April, 1861, was 20,066,224, of whom 9,776,259 were males, and 10,289,965

females. Taking for granted that women are not entitled to the franchise, politics

not being their vocation, we have to eliminate first all the female population, and

afterwards from the males those under 21, and it appears that the number living of

21 years and upwards in 1861, was 5,181,548. From this number we must deduct

12,000 deaf and dumb, 24,000 in asylums, and 10,000 in hospitals. The blind,

20,000 in number, need not be excluded, but we may take one per cent, of persons

ill and bed-ridden, or 50,000. Making these deductions from the number of males

of age, the number physically able is reduced to 5,045,000. But to be able to

vote, a certain amoimt of intelligence seems requisite, and the least requirement

Wewould appear to be ability to read and write.                                   have no absolute test to ascer-

tain who cannot read and write, but the number of persons who sign their marriage

Nowregister with a cross is a sufficient guide.                                   it appears that, in 1861, of 100

men married, only 75 wrote their names, one-fourth of the whole signing their

register with marks. If we take this as a guide, about 1,250,000 should be de-

ducted for intellectual disqualification. And then there are the paupers, criminals,

army and navy, officers of the revenue, servants, &c. &c, comprising large numbers

incapacitated from moral, social, or official causes. Taking all together we might

not be far wrong in assuming that in 1861 there were not more than ahout

3,500,000 absolutely in a position to exercise their constitutional right in an in-

telligent and independent manner, even if some sort of universal suffrage were

established. And if that were the case, should all have equal votes ? Shoidd the

rich and the poor, the largest and smallest contributor to the public revenue stand

Wein an equal position ?                 have no mode of arriving at the wealth of the different

classes. As to taxes, it is true, that all pay more or less something, yet the

proportion is very different. Assuming the popvdation of the United Kingdom at

29,000,000, the proportion may be taken to be 1,000,000 upper classes, 9,000,000

middle, 18,000,000 lower, and 1,000,000 paupers ; and taking the average amount

of revenue and local taxation at £70,000,000, the taxes paid constituted a bur-

den of £22 per head on the upper, of £3 9s. on the middle, and of £1 Is. per head

on the lower. In fact 70 per cent, of the revenue was obtained from about 30

per cent, of the population. There would be great difficulties in arriving at

anything like a correct and equitable apportionment of votes in relation to wealth

and payment of taxes, especially as we have no direct public tax sufficiently low

to include the entire community, and it may be taken for granted that any attempt

in that direction would be sure to fail for want of data. Abandoning therefore

any hope to arrive at an equitable adjustment by any such conclusion, we come to

the present test of the house rent. The intention of this plan seems to be the
bringing in within the pale of the constitution all those who live in sufficient com-

fort and affluence as an indication of a sound civil condition. Taking this test,

we have the fact that at the time of the census there were 3,739,505 inhabited

houses, producing an estimated rental of £58,013,181, which gave an average of

£15 5s. per house. But of this number, 3,219,514, or a^ many as 86 per cent., were

rented under £20 ; and of these, 459,693 houses only were rented at from £15 to

£20 ; 822,149 were rented at £10 to £15 ; 1,277,956 were rented at from £5 to £10;

and 659,724 houses were rented at from £3 to £5. The largest number of persons

live in very low rented houses, which indicate great discomfort if not wretched-

ness                        and this is  especially the  case  in  large  towns, where  house  rent  has much
                         ;

increased, as well as in the agricultural and mining districts. Hence it is that by

this test the largest number are practically disqualified. In fact the number of

persons having votes is now less than one million against 5,000,000 males of age, or

3,500,000 of persons free from any personal disqualifications. From several returns

relating to the economic condition of the people, it appears that the consumption

of articles of food and comfort has largely increased of late years, that the amount

deposited with savings banks is much larger, and that the number of children at

school is considerably larger, facts which seem to indicate a large increase of com-

forts and welfare among all classes. Yet it is evident that there are large masses

of the people possessing very scanty means and who are very deficient in intellec-

tual acquirements, and that if the franchise was lowered to rents from £5 to £10

the number of voters added would be considerable, including probably not a few of

the lowest class of society. Shoidd such an extension be attempted, a restriction

should certainly be imposed as regards persons unable even to read and write. If

we can go no further in the way of imposing an educational test, let it be provided
that henceforth at least the franchise shall be given to those only who can sign

their own names in the register, an alteration being made for the purpose in the

method of recording the vote at the poll. It should be our aim to hold out the

right to vote as a premium to self-mastery and frugality ; and if the State cannot
undertake to educate and elevate the masses of the people, let it at least show
that for the exercise of the higher functions of a free man in a free state, the citizen

must prepare himself by a life unstained in character, high in moral principle, and

well-trained and enlightened in the great school of constitutional and political

government.

                       MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

   Address by Sir "W. Armstrong, K.O.B., F.R.S., President of the Section.

--Gentlemen, The Mechanical Section of the British Association is fortunate this

year in having the Annual Meeting held at Birmingham. In no other town in the
kingdom are mechanical and manufacturing processes carried on in greater variety,
and the Members of this Section cannot fail to derive both pleasure and profit from
the opportunity thus afforded them of witnessing these manifold branches of in-
dustry, and of discussing amongst themselves the various objects brought before
them. Let it also be recollected that we are here on ground rendered classic by
the labours of Watt. It was here that he reduced to practice those splendid me-
chanical conceptions which have contributed more than anything else to the
marvellous progress of the last half century. Every relic of the great mechanician

which may here be presented, will excite reverential feelings in our minds, and we

shall be especially interested in the collection of his original models, which I under-

stand are to be submitted to our inspection at the conversazione this evening in

the Town Hall.
   The papers to be read to the Section embrace, as might be expected, matters of

great interest and importance, and will, I trust, give rise to much instructive dis-
cussion. Nothing can be more surprising than the recent rapid and still accele-

rating progress of mechanical science, and assuredly this progress is in no small
measure attributable to the facilities afforded by such occasions as the present for

a more easy and general interchange of experience and ideas. Amongst the papers
to be read I notice one by Mr. Robinson, of Manchester, on the subject of that
interesting and most curious apparatus, "Gifford's Injector;" and I anticipate that
Mr. Robinson's experience will enable him to throw additional light upon this
paradoxical machine. Should any obscurity remain, it will, I hope, be cleared up
by the observations which this paper will call forth.

   The subject of hewing coal by machinery will be brought before the Section by
Mr. Levick. I refer to this subject with much satisfaction, not only on account of
its importance, but also as being a successful step in mechanical science accom-
plished during the year which has elapsed since the last Meeting of the British
Association. It may be a matter of regret with some persons that the application
of machinery to this and other similar purposes will operate to deprive labourers
of their employment ; but it must be admitted that whatever tends to economise
human labour in the dark and dangerous recesses of a coal mine, must be a benefit

to the community ; moreover, all experience has shown that although labour may

be diverted in its channels by the introduction of machinery, the aggregate amount
of employment suffers no diminution, but, on the contrary, seems to increase.

   I regret that we are not also to have a paper on the progress which has been
made in puddling by machinery, and I trust that when another year has passed

away, the President of this Section will have occasion to notice the attainment of
complete success in that desirable object.

   The paper from Mr. Bessemer upon steel cannot fail to be highly valued by the
Section. The growing importance of this material, and its rapidly extending
sphere of usefulness, have attracted attention in a special degree to the question of
economy in its production ; and certainly no one has contributed so largely as Mr.
Bessemer to our advance in this direction.

   The various papers which are to be read on deep-sea telegraphic cables will prove
peculiarly acceptable at the present moment, when our interest is so much engaged
in the grand attempt to establish telegraphic communication between England and
America. Never was there an undertaking which presented such formidable risks
and difficulties at the outset ; never were more discouraging failures experienced,
and never were failures encountered with more indomitable courage and perseve-
rance. Such enterprise as this reflects credit, not only upon the individual pro-
of e rs of the undertaking, but also upon the nation itself.

   The paper promised by Mr. Cox upon Mr. Siemens's regenerative furnace will

bring forward a subject the importance of which can in my opinion scarcely be
over estimated. Few people are aware of the prodigious waste of heat which takes

place in all furnaces where it is requisite to communicate a high temperature to
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                        165

any material. If, for example, a mass of material is to be heated to a temperature

of 2000° by flame of a temperature of 3000°, it is plain that the heating gases must,

in the ordinary furnaces, escape at a temperature equal to that of the material, and

thus carry off with them a heat which will, when the maximum temperature is

attained, amount to two-thirds of the whole heat and combustion. The regenera-

tive furnace arrests a large proportion of this fugitive heat, and adds it to the

gaseous fuel which supports the combustion of the furnace. Wastefulness must

always be deprecated in mechanical processes ; but considering how much the gTeat-

ness of this country is dependent upon her resources of mineral fuel, and with what

prodigality we are now drawing upon these resources, any wholesale wastefulness

demands especial reprobation, and renders the introduction of more economical

methods of consumption a matter of national importance. The regenerative gas-

furnace not only prevents waste of fuel, but it also prevents smoke. Smoke may

be altogether prevented, and is in fact inexcusable in the case of ordinary steam-

boiler furnaces ; but I know of no means yet introduced by which its prevention

can be effected in manufacturing furnaces heated directly by coal. It' gas were

substituted for coal, and the regenerative principle applied, the nuisance and dis-

figurement occasioned by smoke would be entirely avoided in nearly all manufac-

turing processes. But the introduction of gas-fumaces upon so large a scale must

necessarily be a work of considerable time, and the system itself would probably

require improvement and development to render it so widely available.

my1 might extend  observations to the subjects -of other papers to be read before

you, all of which possess considerable interest; but I feel that little would be

gained by such an extension of my comments, and that it is better for us at once

to proceed to the proper business of the Section.

On Cham-testing Machines. By Sir "VY. G. Armstrong, F.R.S.

The machines referred to were constructed for the Mersey Harbour Trustees.

The most important consideration in the construction of a chain-testing machine

was to obtain an accurate indication of the strain upon the chain. The hydraulic

press had been the means employed of exerting the strain, but the method for

determining the amount of strain had been extremely imperfect. Most commonly,

the strain had been estimated by the indications on a mitred valve pressed down

by a lever and weight. This mode of indication he considered was highly delu-

sive, and he pointed out the advantages of substituting a packed loaded plunger

for the loaded valve. The packing should consist of cup leather, so that the

Whenfriction should vary directly as the pressure.  a chain broke in the test, it was

desirable to show not only tha± it failed to bear the full test strain, but also the

amount of strain exerted at the moment of- fracture. The pendulum indicator has

now been brought into general use. In this the pressure upon the plunger is

exhibited by the motion of a pendulum through a graduated arc. When a chain

broke, the pendulum fell back until stopped by a ratchet, but left a marker at the

exact point on the scale attained by the pendulum. Having spoken of the effect

of friction on the results indicated, the author proceeded to say that in the arrange-

ment of a public chain-testing establishment it was desirable that the apparatus

for the various operations should be placed in such succession as would allow the

chains to move from process to process without any retrogression. The Birkenhead

establishment was then described, in which the machines are adapted to cable

lengths of fifteen fathoms, the Board of Trade having recently fixed upon that

length as the limit of chain to be tested at one time. He thought the restriction

very desirable, and referred to many objections to testing chains in greater lengths.

 On the Manufacture of Cast Steel, its Progress, and Employment as a Sub-
                 stitute for Wrought Iron. By Henry Bessemer.

   On the 13th of August, 1856, the author had the honour of reading a paper before

the Mechanical Section of the British Association at Cheltenham. This paper,
entitled " The Manufacture of Malleable Iron and Steel without Fuel," was the first

account that appeared shadowing forth the important manufacture now generally
known as the Bessemer process.
--166 report 1865.

It was only through the earnest solicitation of Mr. George Renme, the then Pre-

sident of the Mechanical Section of this Association, that the invention was, at that

early stage of its development, thus prominently brought forward ; and when the
author reflects on the amount of labour and expenditure of time and money that

Were found to be still necessary before any commercial results from the working of

the process were obtained, he has no'doubt whatever but that, if the paper at Chel-

tenham had not then been read, the important system of manufacture to which it

gave rise would to this hour have been wholly unknown.

  A diagram showed in section the original fixed converting vessel, as patented

and erected in London for experimental purposes in 1856. It was observed that

the tuyeres were passed through the sides of the vessel in a horizontal direction, the

result was that the blast of air entered only a short distance into the fluid mass, and
much of it escaped upwards between the sides of the vessel and the metal. The
effect of this was the rapid destruction of the brick lining, caused by the excessive

temperature generated in the process and the solvent property of the resulting sili-
cate of protoxide of iron, which sometimes destroyed a lining of half a brick in
thickness during the blowing of two charges of metal for about twenty minutes

each. Another difficulty arose from the impossibility of stopping the process with-

out running out the metal ; for if the blowing ceased for one instant, the fluid metal

would run into the tuyeres and stop them up.

  A great inconvenience of the fixed vessel also arose from the danger and difficulty

in tapping out the fluid malleable iron with a bar, after the manner of tapping an

ordinary cupola furnace, for the blast had to be continued during the whole time

the charge was running out of the vessel in order to prevent the remaining portions
Afrom entering the tuyeres.
                             similar difficulty arose while running in the crude

metal from the melting furnace, since it was necessary to turn on the blast before

any metal was run into the vessel ; the first portions so run in were in consequence

partially decarbonized before the whole of the crude metal had left the melting-fur-

nace.

   These were among the more prominent difficulties that had to be remedied. It
is, however, satisfactory to know that even in this, its infant state, the process and

apparatus were practically successful, in proof of which there is placed upon the

table part of a malleable iron railway bar made from pig iron, at Baxter House, by

blowing air through it in the apparatus just described, the fluid malleable iron

having been run into a 10-inch square ingot mould and the bloom so made rolled
direct into the bar shown. The small malleable iron-forged gun -will serve as an
example of the clearness and freedom from cracks or flaws in malleable iron so made

and forged under the steam-hammer. It is one of the very early productions of the
process, and, like the malleable iron rail, was made wholly without any recarbo-
nizing of the metal, or the employment of spiegeleisen or manganese in any form
whatever. Malleable iron so made from hematite pig iron is red-short, like all other
wrought iron made wholly from hematite; but that it is perfectly malleable and

extremely tough when cold, may be seen on examination of the iron rope exhibited,

which consists of four rods of l|-inch round iron twisted cold into a close coil.

These bars extended 13 inches in length in 4 feet, and were reduced nearly i inch

in diameter in the operation of twisting, thus showing that malleable iron so made

possesses an extraordinary degree of ductility.

   It may be remembered that an important part of the process, as described at

Cheltenham in 1856, consisted in tapping the fluid crude iron from the blast-fur-
nace, and allowing it to flow directly into the converting- vessel, and be there blown

to the extent only of decarbonizing it so far as to produce cast steel. This part of
the original programme has been most successfully carried out in Sweden,"where an

extensive establishment for its manufacture has been erected by M. Gbransson, of
Gene. The large steel circular saw plate exhibited is an example of the conversion
of crude cast iron run direct from the blast-furnace into the converting-vessel, and
there blown for nine minutes, in which period it had been converted into cast steel
of the desired quality, and was then pom'ed into an ingot mould without being re-
carbonized, and wholly without the employment of spiegeleisen or manganese in
any form whatever.

   With these few illustrations of the capabilities of the process as originally de-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  167

scribed at Cheltenham, the author proceeded to show how the disadvantages of

the old fixed converting-vessel were remedied and other improvements introduced.

Many forms of converting-vessels were tried on the large scale before this desirable
object was attained. In some of them the lining was too easily broken down by

the violent motion of so heavy a fluid as iron ; in some of the forms tried the an-
gles allowed the metal to solidify in them, and so clog up the vessel ; in others, the
mouth of the vessel being too small, caused the metal to be thrown out by the force
of the escaping blast. It was also found that if the mouth was too large the heat

escaped, so as to cause part of the converted metal to solidify in the vessel ; the re-

lative height and diameter of the vessel was also found to produce important dif-
ferences in the working of the process ; finally, and after many long and expensive
trials, the form of vessel shown in a diagram was adopted. This vessel is made in
two parts, so as to admit easily of its being lined up with a pulverized siliceous
stone, known as ' ganister,' which so resists the action of the heat and slags as to
last for fully 100 consecutive charges of steel before it is worn out. Its form is that
of the arch in every position which prevents the lining from falling down by its
own weight. There are no angles in which the splashes of metal can solidify and
accumulate. Its mouth directs the flame and sparks away from the workman, and
from the moulds and other apparatus ; while the throat of the vessel, and the posi-
tion of the mouth, almost entirely prevent the throwing out of the metal. The
vessel is mounted on trunnions supported on stout pedestals, so that a semirotary

motion may be communicated to it at pleasure. The tuyeres are placed at the bot-
tom of the vessels, so as to force the air vertically upward through the metal, as
shown, without coming in contact with the sides of the vessel. When the crude

metal is to be run into the vessel, it is tinned on its axis nearly into the position
shown, the mouth being a little higher up ; a gutter will then conduct the crude

cast iron from the melting-furnace into it. It is not necessary to turn on the

blast until the whole of the metal is run in, because the tuyeres occupy a position

above the level of it. As soon as the air is admitted through the tuyeres, the
vessel is turned into the position shown, when its decarbonization immediately com-
mences. As soon as this is effected, as much molten pig iron made from spathose

iron ore is added to it as will restore the quantity of carbon necessary to produce
the desired quality of steel, which is then rim into the casting ladle in the manner
shown, and from whence it is transferred to a series of iron moulds ranged in a
semicircular pit, each mould being placed within the sweep of the casting-crane

the filling of these moulds is regulated by a cone valve made of fireclay and fitted
in the bottom of the casting-ladle, so as to be opened or shut at pleasure by means

of a handle on the outside of the ladle.

   It will be readily understood that in the fixed vessel first described any giving

way of a fireclay tuyere would stop the process and cause much inconvenience
but with the moveable vessel it is not so, for at any moment of time during the
process the vessel may be turned on its axis and the tuyeres raised above the level
of the metal ; the blast may then be turned off, the tuyere box opened, and the

faulty tuyere stopped up or removed, after which the process niay be again resumed.
The movement of the vessel on its axis, the rise and fall of the casting-crane, and
the other cranes employed for removing ingots from the casting-pit, are all effected
by a simple hydraulic apparatus, so that the whole process is under the perfect con-
trol of a single operator, placed far away from the heat and showers of splashes that
accompany the process.

   Up to this period the mauufacture of cast steel by the old as well as the new

process is still so far imperfect that steel of the highest quality cannot be made from

inferior iron. In the old Sheffield process the original quality of the Swedish char-
coal iron employed governs the quality of the cast steel made ; consequently £36
per ton is freely given for the high class Danamora iron, while other brands of

Swedish charcoal iron may be bought for £15. In either case these are expensive
raw materials for the cast-steel maker.

   In 1839 the trade of Sheffield received an enormous impulse from the invention

of Josiah Marshall Heath, who patented in this country the employment of metallic
manganese, or, as he called it, 'carburet of manganese.' The addition of a small
--168 report 1865.

quantity of this metal, say from one-half to one per cent., rendered the inferior coke-

made irons of this country available for making cast steel ; it removed from these
inferior qualities of iron their red-shortness, and conferred on the cast steel so made
the property of welding and working soundly under the hammer. This invention
was of immense importance to the town of Sheffield, where its value was at once

appreciated. Mr. Heath, supposing himself secure in his patent, told his licensees
that if they put oxide of manganese and coal tar or other carbonaceous matter

into their crucibles along with the blister steel, it would do as well, and be much
cheaper than the carburet of manganese he was selling them ; in effect it was the
same thing, for before the steel was melted the carbon present reduced the oxide of

manganese to the metallic state, so that his patent carburet of manganese was formed
in the crucible in readiness to unite with the steel as soon as it became perfectly
fused. But the law decided that this was not Heath's patent, and so the good

people of Sheffield, after many years of litigation, were allowed to use it without

remuneration to the inventor.

   Manganese has now been used for many years in every cast-steel works in
Europe. It matters not how cast steel is made, since manganese added to it neces-

sarily produces the same beneficial changes ; no one better appreciated this fact
than the unfortunate Mr. Heath, as evidenced by his patent of 1839, in which he
declares that his invention consists in ' the use of carburet of manganese in any

process whereby iron is converted into cast steel.' Had Heath seen in his own day
the Bessemer process in operation, he could not have said more ; he well knew the

effect produced by manganese on steel, and therefore claimed its employment in any
process whereby iron is converted into cast steel.

    With this patent of Heath's expired and become public property, coupled with
the universal addition of manganese and carbon to cast steel, it woidd naturally be
supposed that the author, in common with the rest of mankind, would have been

allowed to share the benefits which Heath's invention had conferred on the whole
community ; but it was not so.

    The reading of the author's paper at Cheltenham in 1856 was, by the powerful
agency of the press, communicated in a few days to the whole country. Great ex-
pectations of the value of the new process were formed, both by scientific and prac-
tical men, in proof of which it may be stated that licenses to manufacture malleable
iron under the patent were purchased by ironmasters to the extent of £25,000 in
less than twenty-five days from the reading of the Cheltenham paper. Great ex-
citement existed at that moment in the iron trade, and many persons seemed to
covet a share in an invention that promised so much ; there was consequently a
general rush to the patent office, each one intent on securing his supposed improve-
ment. It was thought scarcely possible that the original inventor should at the
very outset have secured in his patents all that was necessary to the success of so
entirely novel a system, he must surely have overlooked or forgotten something
perhaps even left out all mention of some ordinary appliance too well understood
to need really mentioning : so in the jostle and hurry to secure something, any point
on which a future claim could be reared was at once patented. Some of these gen-
tlemen even repatented portions of the writer's own patents, while others patented
things in daily use, in the hope that they might be considered new when added to
the products of the new process.

    Within six weeks of the date of the Cheltenham paper, Mr. Robert Mushet
had taken out three patents, which form part of that long series of patents by which
 he hoped to secure to himself the sole right to employ manganese in combination
 with iron or steel made from pig iron by forcing atmospheric air through it. In
this long series of patents almost every conceivable mode of introducing manganese
into the metal is sought to be secured. It was claimed if used in combination with
 pitch, or other carbonaceous matter ; it was claimed if simply used in the metallic

--form, or as Mr. Heath calls it, a carburet of manganese ; it was also claimed if

 combined with iron and carbon as in spiegeleisen. Manganese, in any of these
 states of combination, was claimed if put in with the metal prior to the commence-
 ment of the process ; it was claimed if put in during the continuation of the pro-
 cess, and claimed if added to the steel after the process had been completed ; it was

also claimed if put into any furnace . crucible, or vessel that the converted metal

might be run or poured into ; in fact manganese and its compounds were so claimed

under all imaginable conditions that if this series of patents eoidd have been sus-

tained in law it would have been utterly impossible for the author to have employed

manganese with steel made by his process, although it was considered by the trade
to be impossible to make steel from coke-made iron without it.

   In the ' Mining Journal ' of September 24th, 1853, just four years before the first

of Mr. Mushet's series of patents, a letter was published on the subject of Heath's

invention. The writer of that letter says, " I am a steel maker, and deny that

steel was ever made with the addition of carbon and manganese or carburet of

manganese previously to Heath's invention, and I confidently assert that no cast-

steel maker can now carry on his business to profit without the aid of carburet of

manganese. Tbere are," he says, " a hundred methods of improving steel with

manganese, but they all involve the same principle. Put carbon and manganese

into the steel pot in any form you please and at any time you like, and if the steel

be thoroughly melted, the carburet of manganese melts also and is alloyed, and the

improvement is unerringly effected, and by the use in every instance of carburet of

manganese."

This letter clearly shows how well the subject was understood in the steel trade

thirteen years ago.

Very soon after the reading of the Cheltenham paper several rough trials of

the Bessemer process were made privately by persons in the iron trade, and defects
discovered which were supposed by practical men to be perfectly fatal to the inven-

tion. Once more the press teemed with accounts of the process, but this time it

spoke only of its utter impracticability, and of regrets that the high expectations

originally formed were so fallacious. The storm, however, gradually subsided, and

the process and its author were soon entirely forgotten. Imperfections in the pro-

cess there certainly were, but the author had had the most irrefragable proofs of

the correctness of the theory on which his invention was based, and also that the

reasoning on which it was so utterly condemned by the trade was in itself wholly

fallacious ; he therefore decided not to argue the question against a hundred pens,

but to energetically prosecute his experioients and to remain silent until he could

bring the process to a commercial success. When, at the expiration of about three

years of incessant labour on the part of himself and his partner, Mr. Longsdon, and

an expenditure of more than £10,000, the process was again brought before the

public, not the slightest interest was manifested by the trade : it had been for years

agreed on all sides that it was a total failure, and was looked upon simply as a

brilliant meteor that had suddenly flitted across the scientific horizon, leaving the

subject in more palpable darkness than before. This entire want of confidence on

the part of the trade was most discouraging ; one of two things became imperative,

either the invention must be abandoned, or the writer must become a steel manu-

facturer                                 the  latter  alternative  was  unhesitatingly  accepted,  and  Messrs.  Henry
                                      ;

Bessemer and Co. determined to erect a steel works at Sheffield, in the veiy heart

of that stronghold of steel making. At these works the process has ever since been

successfully carried on ; it has become a school where dozens of practical steel
makers received their first lessons in the new art, and is the germ from which the

process has spread into every state in Europe, as well as to India and America.

  By the time the new works at Sheffield had got into practical operation, the

invention had sunk so low in public estimation that it was not thought worth pay-

ing the £50 stamp due at the expiration of three years on Mr. Mushet's large batch

of manganese patents ; they were consequently allowed to lapse and become pub-

lic property.

The author has therefore used without scruple any of these numerous patents for

manganese without feeling an overwhelming sense of obligation to the patentee.

   At the suggestion of the author works for the production of manganese alloys
were erected by Mr. Henderson at Glasgow, who now makes a very pure alloy of
iron and manganese, containing from twenty-five to thirty per cent, of the latter
metal, and possessing many adA'antages over spiegeleisen, which it will doubtless
replace. Two bright rods of l£ inch diameter were placed on the table, they

were folded up cold under the hammer. This extremely tough metal is made by
170 REPORT 1865.

using Mr. Henderson's alloy in lieu of spiegeleisen, which is incapable of making

steel of such a quality.

  A Prussian gentleman, Ilerr Prieger, has been also successful in manufacturing a

new alloy, which he calls ferro-manganese, consisting of sixty to eighty per cent,

of metallic manganese. It is extremely useful in making malleable iron by the

Bessemer process, in which spiegeleisen cannot be employed on account of the large

proportion of carbon it contains.

It is gratifying to turn from a review of the troubles aud impediments of the

past and briefly notice some of the more important applications of steel as a substi-

tute for wrought iron.

In no case is this change of material more important than in the construction

of ships, for in no instance are strength and lightness more essential.

  The Bessemer cast steel made for ships' plate by the several eminent firms now

engaged in that manufacture is of an extremely tough and ductile quality, Avhile it

possesses a degree of strength about double that of the inferior kind of iron plates

usually employed in shipbuilding, hence it is found that a much less weight of
material may be employed, and at the same time a greater degree of strength may

be given to all parts subjected to heavy strains.

   Most prominent among the builders of steel ships is the firm of Jones, Quiggin,
and Co., of Liverpool, who have now constructed no less than 31,510 tons of ship-

ping, wholly or partially built of steel. Of these thirty-eight vessels are propelled

by steam with an aggregate of 5910 horse-power ; besides this the principal masts

and spars of eighteen sailing ships have been made by them wholly of steel.

AaVessels of a large size, constructed to Class    twelve years at Lloyd's, weigh,

when built of iron, about 12 cwt. per ton measurement, whereas similar vessels

built of steel weigh only about 7 cwt. per ton measurement ; thus an iron ship, to

take first-class at Lloyd's for 1000 tons measurement, would weigh 250 tons more

than a steel one of the same class. Such a vessel could therefore take 250 tons, or

25 per cent., more freight at the same cost, or could avail herself of the difference
of immersion to leave or enter port when the tide would not permit an iron vessel

to do so. As a steamer she would carry 250 tons more of coal, and thus be enabled

to lengthen her voyage or take her coal for the return trip. The two steel paddle-

wheel steamers launched at Liverpool by Messrs. Jones and Co., on the 13th ult.,

for Dublin and Liverpool service, will draw from 3 feet to 4 feet less water than

iron steamers built on the same lines ; and being thus enabled to leave port at all

states of the tide, will not require a tidal train in connexion with them. If the

employment of steel for the construction of merchant vessels is found to be so im-

portant, how much more so is it for ships of war P Some of the larger class of

armour-plated vessels require 6000 tons of iron for their construction, and an addi-
tion of 1800 tons in the shape of 4|-inch armour plates. Now, if the frames and

inner skin of such a vessel were constructed of steel, it would be much stronger

even if reduced to 4000 tons in weight ; this would admit of 9-inch armour plates

being used in lieu of 45-inch, and would still leave the vessel 200 tons lighter than

the present ones, and hence, as the resistance of the armour to impact is as the

square of the thickness of the plate, we should have a vessel capable of resisting

four times the force of those at present constructed, while it would be 200 tons

less in weight.

   These important facts have not escaped the attention of Mr. Reed, our present

talented constructor of the navy, and we shall doubtless soon have substantial
proof of what may be eft'ected by the employment of steel in the construction of

ships of war.

The application of steel for projectiles has now become a necessity since the

Weintroduction of armour plates.   have before us a 110-lb. shot that has passed

with very slight injury to itself through a 5-inch armour plate, and also some spe-

cimens of bent angle-iron, made of Bessemer iron, and rolled at the Millwall Iron

Works in London, and from the same works a portion of one of Hughes's patent

hollow steel beams for supporting the armour plating in course of construction for

the forts at Cronstadt : both these are interesting examples of what the rolling

mills of the present day can effect, and of the facility with which cast malleable

iron and cast steel admit of being worked into the most difficult forms.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  17l

   There is no department in engineering in which the peculiar toughness of steel
and its strength and power of resisting wear and abrasion are of such vital impor-
tance as in its application to railway purposes. This fact had long since impressed
itself strongly on the mind of Mr. Rauisbottorn, of the London and North Western

Railway, who commenced experiments with this material in 1861 ; carefully, though

trustingly, he tried it step by step, not even at first venturing to employ it for pas-
senger trains, but as proofs of its safety and economy crowded upon him, he care-
fully applied it to the most important parts of passenger engines, and even to the
manufacture of the formidable engine cranks (at the time entrusted only to the

most eminent iron-making firms in the kingdom) ; these iron cranks are now being
replaced by steel ones forged from a single mass. One of these steel cranks, manu-
factured at the new steel works at Crewe, has been obligingly lent by Mr. Rams-

bottom as an illustration of the use of steel for this purpose ; that gentleman has

also taken out of use a plain steel axle that has run a distance of 112,516 miles, and

now exhibits very slight signs of wear.
   The tires of wheels, on which so much of the public safety depends, were then

tried, but the exact amount of difference between the endurance of wrought iron
and Bessemer steel for this purpose is not yet ascertained, as none of these steel
tires are yet worn out ; but enough has been shown to prove the advantage of en-
tirely replacing iron by stee! for this purpose.

   In order to show how a steel tire will resist the most violent attempts to pro-

duce fracture, an example is given of a steel tire manufactured by Messrs. Bessemer
and Co., of Sheffield ; it was placed on edge under a six-ton steam-hammer, and
subjected to a series of powerful blows until it assumed its present form, that of a
figure of eight, a degree of violence immensely more than it coidd ever be subjected
to in practice. These tires are made without weld or joint, by forging them from
a square ingot partly under the improved plan invented by Mr. Ramsbottom, and

partly by an improved mode of flanging and rolling, invented by Mr. Allen, of the

Bessemer Steel Works, Sheffield.

    So important were found to be the advantages of employing cast steel as a sub-
stitute for wrought iron at the works of the London and North Western Railway
Company, that the directors, acting under the advice of their able engineer, deter-

mined on building large steel works at Crewe, which are now in active and suc-

cessful operation. In the design and arrangement of their plant for working up
the steel several important improvements have been introduced by Mr. Ramsbottom,
among others his duplex hammer, which strikes a bloom on both sides of the ingot
at once, in a horizontal direction, and thus renders unnecessary the enormous foun-
dations required for ordinary hammers. Here also he has put up his improved
rolling mill for rolling blooms of large size, the enormous machine being reversed
with the greatest rapidity and ease by the attendants, without any shock or con-

cussion whatever.

   While matters were thus steadily progressing in the engine department of the
Company, the engineer of the permanent way, Mr. Woodhouse, took in hand a
thorough investigation of a no less important problem, viz., the substitution of cast
steel for wrought-iron railway bars. For this purpose some 500 tons of rails were
made, and put down at various stations where the traffic was considerable, so as to

arrive, at the earliest period, at a true comparison of the respective endurance of
wrought-iron and cast-steel rails. It will be unnecessary here to enter into the
numerous details of the extensive series of experiments systematically carried out

by Mr. Woodhouse ; the trials made at Camden will suffice to show the extraor-

dinary endurance of steel rails. It is supposed that there is not one spot on any
railway in Europe where the amount of traffic equals that at the Chalk-farm bridge

at Camden Town. At this spot there is a narrow throat in the line, from which
converges the whole system of rails employed at the London termini of this great

railway. Here all passenger, goods, and coal traffic have to pass ; here also the

making-up of trains and shunting of carriages is continually going on. At this
particular spot two steel rails were fixed on May 2nd, 18G2, on one side of the line,
and two new iron rails were on the same day placed precisely opposite to them, so
that no engine or carriage could pass over the iron rails without passing over the
steel ones also. When the iron rails became too much worn to be any longer safe
--]72 report 1865.

for the passage of trains, they were turned the other way upwards, and when the
second side of the iron rails were worn as far as the safety of fhe traffic would

--allow, the worn-out rail was replaced by a new iron one the same process being

repeated as often as was found necessary. Thus we find, at the date of the last
report on March 1st, 1865, that seven rails had been entirely worn out on both
faces. Since then another rail has been worn out up to July, making sixteen faces
worn out, the seventeenth face being in use on August 22nd, when the steel rail
that had been placed opposite to them was taken up in the presence of the writer,
and, by the kind permission of Mr. Woodhouse, was placed on the table before the
meeting. The first face of the rail only has been used, and this is now become

much thinner than it was originally, but, in the opinion of the platelayers, is still

capable of wearing out another half dozen faces. Taking its resisting powers at
three more faces only, it will show an endurance of twenty to one in favour of

steel.

Mr. Woodhouse has ascertained, by careful and continued testing for twenty-

four hours at a time, that an average of 8082 engine tenders or carriages pass over

the steel rails every twenty-four hours, equal to 16,164 wheels every day for 1207

days, making a total of 9,754,974 wheels passed over the rail. Subject to this

excessive wear, the rail appears to have been reduced 7i lbs. per yard, hence for

every grain in weight of steel lost by abrasion, no less than 371 wheels had to pass

over it. Another steel rail, put down also in May 1862, at a place much less sub-

ject to wear, has had four faces of iron rails worn out opposite to it, and still ap-

Anpears as if very little used ; this rail was also placed on the table.  iron rail wears

out by the giving way at various parts of the imperfectly welded mass, and not by

the gradual loss of particles of metal, as in the case of the steel rail, which no

amount of wear and tear seems capable of disjointing. It must be borne in mind

that this enormous endurance of cast steel is not owing to its hardness or brittle-

ness, as some have supposed, for, in fact, Bessemer steel possesses an extreme de-

gree of toughness. There was before the Meeting an example of this fact ; one of the

same quality of steel rails having been attached at one end to the main driving shaft

of a steam-engine so as to twist it while cold into a long spiral, measuring 9 feet in

length at top and bottom, and only 6 feet if measured along the centre of the web.

A single glance at this spiral rail will, it is presumed, dispel any idea of brittleness

that may have been entertained.
   In conclusion it may be remarked that cast steel is now being used as a sub-

stitute for iron to a great and rapidly increasing extent.

The jurv reports of the International Exhibition of 1851 show that the entire

production of steel of all kinds in Sheffield was, at that period, 35,000 tons annually,

of which about 18,000 tons were cast steel, equal to 346 tons per week ; the few

other small cast-steel works in the country would probably bring up this quantity

to 400 tons per week as the entire production of cast steel in Great Britain. The

jury report also states that an ingot of steel, called the ' monster ingot,' weighing
24 cwt, was exhibited by Messrs. Turton, and was supposed to be the largest mass

of steel ever manufactured in England. Since that date a great change has been

made, for the largest Bessemer apparatus at present erected in Sheffield, at the

works of Messrs. John Brown and Co., is capable of producing with ease every four

hours a mass of cast steel weighing 24 tons, being twenty times larger than the

'monster ingot' of 1851.

   There are now seventeen extensive Bessemer steel works in Great Britain. At
the works of the Barrow Steel Company 1200 tons per week of finished steel can
easily be turned out, and when their new converting-house, containing twelve more

five-ton converters, is completed, these magnificent works will be capable of pro-

ducing weekly from 2000 to 2400 tons of cast steel. There are at present erected

and in course of erection in England no less than sixty converting vessels, capable of

producing from three to ten tons at a single charge. When in full and regular ope-

ration these vessels will be capable of producing 6000 tons of steel weekly, or equal

to fifteen times the entire production of cast steel in Great Britain before the in-

troduction of the Bessemer process. The average selling price of this steel is at

least £20 per ton below the average price at which cast steel was sold at the period

mentioned. With the present means of production, therefore, a saving of no less

than £6,240,000 per annum may be effected in Great Britain alone even in this

infant state of the Bessemer steel manufacture.

                WelcUess Tyres, Circular Boiling, and Railway Wheels.

                                    By F. I. Brajiwell.

   The paper was not intended for engineers only, but was also addressed to those
who are not intimately acquainted with the details of the manufacture of tyres and

wheels as hitherto pursued.

   The paper gave an account of some of the principal modes employed in the
manufacture of tyre hoops prior to the use of weldless tyres, and pointed out the
defects of those modes, and alluded to plans that have been adopted to prevent
accidents arising from their use.

   The paper then gave a description of the means by which weldless tyre hoops
are now made by some manufacturers, referred to Bodmer's circular rolling, and
entered into the details pursued in working tyre-making machinery principally
designed by the writer.

   The paper then referred shortly to the manufacture of steel tyres by circular
rolling, and showed that that mode of rolling is applicable to the making of boilers
and other articles.

   The paper then considered the question of making straight or level or flat bars,
rails, or plates, by the use of circular rolling in the first instance to form a hoop,
which hoop is to be cut open and laid out flat to make the bar, rail, or plate.

   The paper then referred to the principal kinds of railway wheel-centres in use,
and stated the nature of Arbel's improvement in the maiiufacture of entire wrought
wheel-centres, and Lahousse's mode of making an economical wrought wheel-centre,
which is arrived at by dispensing with the necessity of requiring the spokes to be
got to a welding heat, and described how these modes of Arbel's and Lahousse's

are practically used.

   The paper was illustrated by several diagrams.

                                       On Railways in War.

        By General Sir J. P. Btjegotoe, Bart, G.C.B., D.O.L., F.R.S.

   The paper opened by stating that railways would have an important effect on
war, and that it was a matter of interest to ascertain the means of obtaining the
greatest advantage from them, and what would be their precise capabilities.

A vague idea existed that armies could be transported from place to place and to a

seat of war with the same facility and speed as ordinary travellers, whereas there
were many circumstances connected with the conveyance of the former which
would show any such comparison to be quite fallacious. With regard to a small

body of infantry, there was no reason why this should not be the case ; but with

large forces, and with cavalry and artillery, and all the accessories of an army, its
baggage, camp equipage, spare ammunition, its waggons, &c, enormous means would
be required, and difficulties would arise which called for study and consideration to

reduce them to a minimum. How to adapt the ordinary railway passenger and

horse carriages and trucks in the best manner to the transport of troops of all kinds,

and how to get the troops most rapidly in and out of them, would be easily ascer-
tained, if it had not been so already ; the great desideratum was to define how
large forces could be moved in greatest strength, with the most rapidity, on single
railways or by a limited number of lines ; for it was on these calculations, having

under consideration the several lines which could be brought to bear on the opera-
tions, that the generals in command must arrange their plans. The basis for

consideration would be : What could be done by any one line of railway with its

ordinary means, or aided by additional means from other lines of the same gauge
with which it was connected, on the same level, and which might not have the
same pressure on them ? To afford an idea of what might be required, it might be
assumed that the officers and soldiers would occupy the space of ordinary travellers,

and consequently it would become a question how many passenger carriages, in how
many trains, each drawn by one locomotive, would be required to convey 1000 men,
--174 report 1865.

with their officers ; and how many horses of cavalry, artillery, and for staff of in-

fantry regiments, one truck would carry. The guns and equipments of each battery

of field-pieces, with number of trucks necessary to carry them, should be defined,

as well as the number of horses per battery of horse or foot artillery. To give an

idea of the amount of conveyance required for such forces, on one occasion, to trans-

port a battery of field-pieces, with its horses and carriages, and about 500 cavalry,

merely to a review, no less than six trains were required, consisting each of thirty

railway carriages. Viewing the very large means necessary for moving any but a

very moderate force, the embarrassments which would attend the undertaking, and

the rapid succession required to be effective, it became a matter of much interest
for railway engineers to consider and define how arrangements could be made in

providing, stationing, and working the trains that would tend to facilitate the ser-

vice, and what, with the adoption of these measures, would be the capabilities of

conveyance of troops of given strength to given distances in given times on emer-

gent occasions on any one railway ; whether, for instance, as the great traffic would

be in one direction, both lines of rails might not be used for it for certain distances,

under the best arrangements which can be made for the return of carriages, &c.

These researches are required not only to ascertain the best modes of accelerating the

movements, but also to come to a clear understanding as to what, even when duly

organized, can be obtained from railways in rapidity of transport for large bodies.

It is manifest that, as they approach the scene of action, the railways would have

less influence on the immediate theatre of warfare itself; it would be somewhat

dangerous to trust to them at all under the chance of the enemy interrupting the

communication between the divisions and resources of the army. For short dis-

tances there would rarely be much advantage, as regards time, in moving troops by

them, on account of the time required for getting to and away from the railway,

and into and out of the carriages. Their great advantage would be for concentrating

troops and means, by converging lines, from the interior to some appropriate point

forming a basis  of  operations                                                  for gradually bringing  up reinforcements  and other
                                                                              ;

resources to the rear of the army ; and for the speedy and better removal of sick or

wounded, prisoners, and all incumbrances. They would also be particularly favour-

able to retreating forces, by expediting their movements ; while, by the destruction
of the lines behind them, the enemy would be deprived of any use of them. . The

partial destruction and the repairs to railways will hereafter be an engineering duty

for which the service should be prepared.

   Every railway, even in the vicinity of the operations in a campaign, will be of

much value, so long as it can be used without danger of interruption, and therefore

it becomes a subject of interest to possess a knowledge of the best means for their

destruction, and how to apply them in cases where the lines are likely to fall into

the hands of the enemy, or for reestablishing any that may have been more or less

injured. It is clear that a portion of a railway might be for hours in temporary

possession of a part of an army, who might, from ignorance, or want of some trifling

means, be unable to take advantage of the occasion, and thus would leave it to be re-

possessed by its enemy in perfect order, when, by due instruction and a little pre-

paration, an influential amount of damage might have been done to it. The mili-

tary engineers of an army have attached to them in the field a selected assortment

of the most useful implements for the different services most frequently required of

them, the proportions of which they vary according to the prospect of the nature

of the approaching engineering operations, such as for sieges, entrenchments, de-

struction or repairs of roads and bridges, mining, &c. ; and they are practised in the

best modes of applying whatever means may be at hand for their purpose. To these

must now be added what is applicable to the destruction and reestablishment of

railwa}rs. In damaging a railway to impede the progress and available means of an

enemy's army, the object will of course be to do as little injury to a great conve-

nience of the country as is consistent with the primary consideration of crippling

the military resources of the enemy for the time. Should the exigencies of the pe-

riod justify extensive damage, it will be done by blowing in tunnels, bridges, via-

ducts, or embankments, by mines and processes as practised by military engineers,

with regard to the old routes, to the extent that circumstances will allow and may

admit. The object for consideration, however, here is, how the peculiarities of a

railway can be dealt with to most effect, in a summary manner, with little time and

small means. Taking it, then, as a question rather of dismantling than of destroying,

the first measure would be the taking up and destroying of the rails. This would

be easy enough to a party of railway navvies provided with their apparatus ; but

what we require is, some instructions and practice given to soldiers how to do as
much as possible with the smallest means. Thus, instead of being, as at present,

from ignorance, perfectly helpless, they might be taught, under previous instruction,

that even a few stray articles for implements, such as might be found in an adjoin-

ing house, as might be described, coidd, on an emergency, be made available to
some extent. Possibly it could be shown that, after a first rail was removed, the

very article itself, with the sleepers, &c, might be used to extend the damage.

Another question would be, having in view the possibility of obtaining a temporary

power over a railway which is of service to the enemy, what very small and most

portable assortment of implements might be carried with any detachment, beino-

accompanied, if possible, by a few Sappers that would aid such a proceeding, and

what would be the most effective process                                                                                                                                                                                             and if the implements could be such as
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

enter into the assortment forming part of the engineer field-equipment, required for

other purposes, all the better. The rails being raised, the best disposition of them

would be clearly to carry them away altogether ; but it is very improbable that

there would be available means of conveyance to render that practicable. The next

most easy resource would be to scatter, hide, or bury them ; but if it could be shown
how they could be broken or rendered unserviceable, the effect would be still

greater. The destruction of the sleepers would be much more easy, but the effect

would be less, and the removal of the chairs, from their portability, would be easy,
and also valuable for the object. With regard to the reinstatement of a damaged

line, it would be instructing to know whether any temporary expedients could be

adopted for the passage of locomotives and carriages, or even of the carriages onlv,

across the places where the rails may have been removed, till new rails can be pro-

cured                      and, if so, what those expedients may be,                                                                                                                                                                 and how to  be  applied.  One re-

source might be available in double lines, namely, to dismantle one of the double
rows, from the nearest part untouched, to make good a thorough communication

for at least one single line. It will be very desirable to obtain from railway engi-

neers a consideration of all these matters, and special instructions drawn up on all
expedients that can be suggested, in which the troops, but more particularly the

engineer soldiers, might be subsequently practised ; nothing of the kind, it is be-

lieved, having yet been imdertaken.

                       On a Pneumatic Hammer. By G. Burt.

   This hammer does not approach the power of a steam-hammer of the same total
weight', nor would it take the place of the steam-hammer for general smith's work.
The advantages claimed for it were that it was very simple, especially in its single-
acting form, as shown by a model ; that there were no valves in constant motion
and wear ; that the momentum of the driving parts connected with the crank-
shaft was very small, on account of their small extent of motion (a throw of 1 inch
only being given to the 10-inch piston) ; that the wear on these parts was con-
sequently very slight, also owing to the elastic nature of the medium between the
driving and driven pistons ; that there was an absence of all dropping of condensed
steam, such as would invariably be caused by the use of a steam-hammer.

   On Torbite (a new Preparation of Peat) and its Uses. By D. K. Clark.

   The object of the paper was to describe the system pursued at Horwich, near
Bolton, for the manufacture of torbite and charcoal from peat. The obstacles
hitherto to treating peat for the manufacture of fuel were shown to consist chiefly

in the difficulty of separating, at a moderate cost, the excessive proportion of
water held in suspension by peat in its natural condition, in consequence of the
uncertainty of the climate and the great amount of hand-labour employed, and in
the impossibility of efficiently condensing and solidifying peat by mechanical com-

pression, which has been the agency relied on for that object. The author then
explained that, according to the Horwich system of treatment, compression by
--1*6 REPORT 18G5.

mechanical force in any manner is studiously avoided ; and that, on the contrary,

advantage has heen taken of the natural property of peat, suitably prepared, of

contracting as it parts with its moisture, and becoming perfectly solid and cohe-

sive. To separate the water, the peat travels upon endless bands, within a close

chamber, exposed to currents of heated air, by which the moisture is effectually

extracted                                 the blocks of peat being turned up on all sides in succession, so as to be
                                       ;

equally and regularly dried, and emerging dry, hard, and dense. To the peat sub-

stance thus prepared the name of "torbite" has been given; and it was stated

that it could be delivered at a cost of from 10s. to 12s. per ton. In the subsequent

stage, the conversion of the torbite into charcoal, it was pointed out that the fatty

and other matters disengaged during the charring process were valuable commer-

cial products, the sale of which alone would nearly cover the cost of the whole

process. Some experiments were described, proving the suitability of torbite and

its preparations for purposes of generating steam and smelting iron ore, and in the

other stages of the manufacture of iron. It was contended, therefore, that the

problem of the probable utilization of peat had at last been solved. It was stated,

in conclusion, that the bogs of Great Britain and Ireland cover an area exceeding

five millions of acres, the average depth of which might be taken at twenty feet

and that the benefits of the utilization of peat on the large scale, particularly for

Ireland, could scarcely be over-estimated from an industrial point of view.

         On a Machine for stitching Button-holes. By J. M. Clements.

   The paper stated that the almost universal adaptation of the sewing-machine to
manufacturing as well as domestic purposes, had given rise to a demand for a
machine for working button-holes, most of the large manufacturing clothiers in
England and the shirt-makers in Belfast and other towns of Ireland having for
several years expressed their desire for, and great want of, such a machine. Having
noticed the various attempts made to produce a button -hole stitching machine, the
paper described that introduced to notice by the writer, and proceeded to point out
that it could be applied, not only to fine work, but also to heavy work, such as
sail-making, railway sheets, or carpet-making. The machine would work sixty or
seventy holes per hour, both sides alike, and with a lock stitch.

         On a new Cotton Gin for separating Cotton Fibre from the Seed.

                                              iJy E. A. Cowper.

   This gin is composed of a roller having strips of leather on its surface at intervals,
and strips of pointed surface between them ; the roller revolves continuously, and
there is a blunt steel blade, which is caused to approach the roller, and recede
from it at intervals, by means of eccentrics, which also move it up and down both
in the direction of the surface of the roller and in the opposite direction. In addi-
tion to this roller and blade there is a vibrating beater to push off the seeds, this
last action being very similar to the motion of a beater in a MacCarthy gin. The
eccentrics are on a small crank-shaft that moves the beater, and which has a
pinion on it, driven by a wheel on the roller-shaft. This gin differs from all

others in its complete intermittent action, and it also acts on an entirely new

principle, viz., that of nipping fast hold of the cotton-fibre close up to the seed (just
as it might be taken fast hold of by a person's finger and thumb) whilst the seed is

separated. The steel blade recedes from the roller when fibre is entering, and then
nips upon it and holds it fast close up to the seed whilst the beater pushes off the

seed. In consequence of the fibre being thus locked fast in the jaws it has been
called the " Lock-jaw Gin," one side of its jaws being formed of the strips of com-

mon leather on the roller, whilst the jaw on the other side is formed of the blunt
steel blade, caused to approach the leather surfaces when nipping by means of eccen-

trics. This machine does its work so effectually and quickly that it gets through
several times as much work as a common "MacCarthy gin" can, and many times
as much as an " Indian Churka," and at the same time gives a decidedly increased
length of staple from a given sample of cotton. This new principle of action in
separating cotton-fibre from seed, promises to cause as great a change and improve-
ment in ginning cotton as Heilmann and Lister's invention did in the combing of
           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      177

wool, as the work is done better than by a MacCarthy gin, and nearly as quickly

as by a Saw gin, .and it is thus particularly valuable in reference to the short stapled

cotton of India, and the long stapled cotton of Egypt.

On the Effect of Blowing Blast Furnaces with Blast of very High Tempera-

                                tures. By E. A. Cowper.

   Very satisfactory results were obtained in 1860-1861 from a pair of Cowper's
hot-blast stoves, heating the blast to a particularly high temperature for one tuyere
only for a blast furnace (the other four being blown with ordinary hot blast). These
stoves were for a length of time in successful operation at Messrs. Cochrane and
Co.'s works at Ormesby, near Middlesborough-on-fees ; these gentlemen then erected

large stoves to supply blast of very high temperature for a whole furnace, which
stoves have now been in full operation for upwards of four years with the follow-
ing satisfactory results, viz. an increased " make " of iron from the same plant of
fully 20 per cent., the iron being of rather improved quality, owing to less impurity
being carried in with the fuel, the avoidance of all leakage caused, by the ordinary
cast-iron pipes, reduced friction or loss of pressure in the blast passing through
the stoves, and a saving of upwards of five hundredweight of coke per ton of iron
made, the blast being at 1150° Fahr. These stoves are the invention of Mr. E. A.

Cowper, who has adopted the regenerative principle invented by Mr. Siemens, as

the means of absorbing the heat rroin the products of combustion and giving it out

again to the air to be heated, the regenerators being each enclosed in an iron
casing lined with firebrick, and provided with valves to allow of the passage of
ignited gas through the stove to heat it, and valves to allow the entrance of the

cold blast and exit of the hot blast. The stoves are heated by the combustion of gas
obtained from gas producers, such as are now used largely for Mr. Siemens's glass
furnaces ; but recent experiments have been made, with the view of separating the
gas from the top of the blast-furnace, from the dust it commonly contains, so that
such gas may be conveniently used, and it has been found that it is only necessary
to cause the gas to travel for some distance at a speed of less than 1 foot per second.
in thin layers, in order thoroughly to deposit all the dust contained in it ; and by
arranging a number of thin shelves at a small distance apart, and at an incline in
a large pipe or box, the dust deposits on the shelves, and can be easily washed out
occasionally with great facility by a stream of water, blast, or steam.

On Siemens's Regenerative Gas-Furnaces and Producers. By S. N. F. Cox.

The author commenced by stating that the system of regenerative gas-fumaces

having now been before the manufacturing world for several years, and having

been employed for the manufacture of glass of all kinds, iron, and steel, and nearly

every other article in the production of which great heat was required, and having

proved in nearly every case successful, it had ceased to be an experimental system,

and had become an established and recognized success. The paper then described,

by the aid of diagrams, the construction of the furnace in which the gas was burnt,

and the gas-producers for all descriptions of fuel. By this process a flame was ob-

tained (equal to a white heat) which did not contain anything that could injuri-

ously affect the most delicate manufacture, for even sulphuring was prevented, for the

--sulphur in separating from its hydrogen took up oxygen supplied by the carbonic

acid and water, forming sulphurous acid, a stable compound, which was not de-

composed on meeting metallic oxides in the furnace. The nature and intensity of
the flame was also under the instant control of the man in charge of the furnace,

--so that the chemical nature of the flame could be altered at will one minute an

oxidizing flame being obtained, and the next a reducing or carbonizing one. So

also the amount of the flame could be altered from the smallest flicker to the com-

plete filling of the chamber with an intense body of fiame. The paper pointed out

the immense advantage thus obtained in furnaces where the delicate operation of

heating or melting steel was carried on ; and for reheating purposes, especially for

reheating steel blooms and ingots. The advantage of the system was a large saving

Aof fuel.  ton of steel by the furnace was melted with an average weight of a ton

of coal, instead of two and a half to three tons of coke, which represented six to
seven tons of best coal. With such names before them as Meyer, Borsig, and
Krupp, as employers of Siemens's furnaces for steel melting, it did little credit to
English enterprise to say that there was hardly one furnace in England in constant
work for steel melting. Besides the saving of fuel, there were other advantages
in the working of the furnace, such as cleanliness, no" solid fluid being brought into
the shop where the furnaces were, the fuel being converted into gas at any con-
venient distance from the furnaces ; compactness of arrangement, saving of labour,
and, above all, improvement in the processes themselves. In every trade in which
the furnace might be employed, the same advantages were apparent ; and though
the furnaces were costly, and required a large outlay at first, especially in old

works, they soon paid for themselves.

On some of the Causes of the Failure of Deep-sea Cables, and Experimental
   Researches on the Permanency of their Insulators. By William Fair-

    bairn, F.R.S.

   The author stated that the recent disaster and loss of the greater portion of the
Atlantic cables is one of those casualties which may be considered national, and
looked upon as a misfortune much to be regretted. It is, however, suggestive of
improvements and the removal of impediments which seem to have beset the last
attempt to submerge what was considered the best and most effective cable ever
constructed for a durable telegraphic communication between this country and

America.

   This cable was unanimously selected by the scientific committee, to whom was

entrusted a long series of experiments to determine its strength and other chemical
and electrical properties of the materials of which it was composed. These will be
found in a former Report in the Transactions of last year, pages 408 ct seq.

   It will be noticed that the late failure of the insulation, submergence, &c, is not
an uncommon occurrence on the contrary, it has been estimated that out of about

                                                                                                                       ;

14,000 miles of cable that have been laid, nearly three-fourths of that length have
been failures, and that at the present time not more than from 4000 to 5000 miles

are in successful operation.

   There are two things in marine telegraphy which require special attention, viz.,
the manufacture of the cable, and its submergence in deep water. In this inquiry
the author ventures to assume that the conducting wires, insulation, and strength
of the cable were satisfactory, and nothing more remained to be done than to lay
it quietly on the bed of the ocean. The recent loss of this cable, and the imperfect
insulation of others, are, however, important lessons, which prove the necessity of
the most vigilant inspection of every inch of cable as it is manufactured in the first
instance, and its careful preservation until it is safely deposited in the bed of the
ocean in the second. Every possible care was in this case taken ; but, notwith-
standing the precautions exercised by the manufacturing company, small pieces of
wire on three different occasions were found sticking in the cable in contact with
the conducting wires and destructive of the insulation. These apparently trifling
circumstances were the whole and sole cause of the loss the Company and the public
have sustained in the failure of this important enterprise.

  A voyage from the Nore to Valentia in July last presented opportunities for

examining the big ship with her machinery and valuable cargo. The paying-out
machinery was perfect, as it proved itself to be in regard to its powers for regula-
ting the slack to be paid out at different depths, and the uniform degree of tension

requisite to be observed in paying out the cable at great depths.
   Paying out a cable of considerable weight and strength from the coil seems to be

surrounded with many difficulties, the greatest
of which is the danger of kinks arising from
the twist which it receives in being uncoiled.

This is the great objection to every description
of cable payed out from the coil, as the ten-

dency is to run into loops, such as shown at A,

^ ^^^rf^and this, when submitted to an amount of ten- '"^22s:2S2r^s^3SSscssesa£r
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                         179

sion of not more than one-half its ultimate powers of resistance, would injure the

insulation, and what is more than probable, would ultimately destroy the conducti-

vity of the cable. These are difficulties which in this weight of cable and large

diameter of coils in the tanks has been overcome. With a smaller cable (carefully

insulated) depending entirely upon the conducting wires for its strength, it would

be possible to wind it in lengths of 80 to 100 miles upon reels, and these, neatly

balanced in the hold of the ship, might be paid into the sea entirely free from

kinks but in doing this it must be observed that considerable risk is incurred of
                                ;

breaking the cable from the amount of friction to which the wheels would be sub-

ject when loaded with 80 miles of cable. Taking the whole conditions of these

arrangements into account, it is not clear that the reels would be any improvement

upon the large coils in tanks, as adopted in the ' Great Eastern' ship. In fact

there is no other plan suitable for the paying out of the Atlantic cable of its pre-

sent weight and dimensions but the coil.

   With regard to the ' Great Eastern ' ship, he stated that she proved herself
everything that could be wished for. Her easy steady motion was just what was

required for paying out the cable, and its relief from undue strain by the absence

of pitching renders the ship exclusively calculated for the submergence of subma-

rine cables in deep water. She is the very thing that is wanted for such a pur-

pose, and he firmly believed, if she was properly fitted and prepared for such a ser-

-- --vice with some additional stringers to strengthen the upper deck and sides she

would find full employment as a sub merger of cables in every sea which divides

the four quarters of the globe. She is admirably adapted fer such a purpose, and

her double engines, with screw and paddles, assist the steering, and afford great

facilities for paying out and hauling' in the cable shoidd accidents occur such as

overtook the vessel in the middle of the Atlantic.

The author further remarked that the recovery of a lost cable is at all times a

precarious operation, and the difficulties which present themselves in the case of the

Atlantic cable, are its large diameter and the friction of its external surface in pas-

sing through the water. If raised at all it must be at an exceedingly slow speed,

and that with one end loose, otherwise he shoidd despair of raising it froni a depth

of 2100 fathoms, by hooking it in the bight or middle, where the resistance would

be doubled in raising two sides instead of one.

Supposing the cable to be hooked by the grapnel at a few miles distant from the

fracture, it will then be seen (if it is to be raised from a depth of 2 J miles) that
the present cable would have to be lifted at an angle of about 45° on each side, or

3-18 miles of cable =6-25 x 11 cwt. (the weight of the cable in water), a weight of

4J tons, or equivalent to more than one-half the breaking strain. To this dead
ABweight must be added the friction of the two sides of the triangle  and AC,

which will be as the squares of the velocities with which it is raised. What may
be the additional amount of strain from the speed with which it may be drawn

through the water it is not necessaiy here to calculate, as it is obvious that at a
                                                                                                     12*
--180 REPORT 1865.

velocity of two miles per hour it would approximate close upon the breaking

weight of the cable.
   Assuming, for the sake of calculation, that the strain, including weight and fric-

tion, to be t> tons, and as it requires a strain of 7§ tons to break the cable, there is left

Nowin reserve If ton to carry the bight of the rope to the surface of the water.

this is assuming that the cable has been paid out with as much slack as will enable
it to be raised in the manner j ust described ; but this is evidently not the case, and
as any attempts at raising tbe cable in this form would break it, the slack of 1100
yards on each side would require to be taken up, and a drag for 5 miles on each
side would be the result, before it could reach the surface. This is evident from
the fact that the excess of cable paid out over the distance run was 1210 : 1060, or
12J per cent, of slack. This would be equivalent to dragging some miles of cable
through the ooze or mud to make up the difference between the catenaries D, E,
and AB, AC.

    According to this reasoning, it would appear that any attempt to raise the cable
in this way would prove fruitless unless some means were adopted to cut it at the

Npoint on the American side, and haxd in by a second grapnel which would hold

fast until the cable was brought to the surface*.

    In the construction of submarine cables, he observed that their success depends

-- --on such a variety of circumstances some of them exceedingly precarious that

the wonder is they have succeeded so well as they have done. In the manufac-
ture of a marine cable there is no difficulty with the conducting wire, if made of
pure copper ; but the greatest care and caution is required to be taken with the in-
sulator to see that the different coats of gutta percha are pure, solid, and free from
injury by the abrasion of the external covering when composed of strands of wire,

constituting the strength of the cable.

   The following experiments were instituted by the author at the request of the
Commission, with a view to determine how far the different kinds of material pro-
posed as insulating coverings for electric submarine cables were reliable when
placed at the bottom of the ocean under the pressure of the superincumbent water.

    Generally in regard to the insulating powers of the various materials tried, they
seem to arrange themselves in the following order of permeability, the first absorb-
ing least water, and the last absorbing most :

1. Chatterton's compound.    5. Carbonized india-rubber.
2. Gutta percha.             6. Wray's compound.
3. Masticated india-rubber.  7. Unmasticated bottle india-
4. Vulcanized india-rubber.
                                     rubber.

   The experiments on the insulating powers of various cores under pressure are
less complete than those on absorption, and have been prosecuted under greater
difficulties and with less variety of conditions.

   The first experiments have for their object the determination of the increase of
weight of various insulating materials when subjected to enormous pressure under

water.

    * Since the above was written, the author has been in communication with the engineers

and others connected with the Construction and Maintenance Company, who are now con-
structing an entirely new cable similar to that of last year, excepting only that the iron
wires are galvanized, and the hemp covering is not saturated with tar. This new cable
will be attached to the shore ends at Valentia and Newfoundland ; and should this expe-
dition be successful, the ' Great Eastern ' and her two consorts will be enabled to return
to the spot where last year's cable parted, and by the usual means of grapnels to fish it
up, and splice to it as much of the new cable as will carry it forward to Newfoundland.
Thus it is confidently expected that two cables will be the important result of this year's

undertaking. Considerable difference of opinion appears to exist as to the ultimate success
of these critical operations, but as every precaution is taken in having improved machinery

for picking up and hauling in, under the direction of Mr. Canning, the Construction and
Maintenance Company's Engineer, the prospect of success is much more encouraging than
at any former period in the history of this important enterprise. It is moreover intended
to employ two more vessels with proper apparatus for grappling the cable at those distinct
spots, in order to relieve the strain and to hold by buoys until the cable is cut and hauled
on board.

   The temperature in all these experiments was low, sometimes several degrees
below the freezing-point. In the first experiment with Wray's compound, the
cylinder when opened was found to be filled with loose ice.

   In the next series the whole of the specimens were placed in the same cylinder,
and remained under pressure during the same period, and under the same condi-

tions.

from the cylinder, in consequence of the evaporation of the water absorbed, was in
these experiments noted, and it was found the specimens decreased in weight be-
low their original weight when dry.

   In the whole of these experiments the pressure was 20,000 per square inch, area
of specimens 8 square inches, and thickness about |-th of an inch.

as much. In like manner, india-rubber absorbed 0177 grain at a lower tempera-
ture, and 0-45 at a higher, or two and a half times as much. Wray's compound
0-072 at a lower temperature, and 058 at the higher, or seven times as much.

   In the earlier experiments the insulating power of the various cores was tested
with voltaic electricity. In the following series, however, recourse was had to
frictional electricity, which from its high intensity passed with greater or" less
facility through the insulating coverings of the wire. In the former, the measure-
ment and regulation of the charge, and the rate of loss were made with a double
pith-ball electrometer; in the latter, or fifth series, a Peltier's electrometer was
employed.

   The charge was given from an electrophorus, and was ordinarily of such inten-
sity as to deflect the needle through an arc of 70°. The fall of the needle was
watched at intervals till it had sunk to 20°.

   On a careful inspection of the above summary, it will be seen that a great differ-

ence exists in the retentive powers of the different cores or insulators under severe
pressure, which in these anomalies almost defy attempts at comparison. The expe-
riments are, however, satisfactory, in so far as they show approximately the relative

porosity of various materials ; but they do not point out how Ave are to obtain an

insulator impermeable to water, and at the same time a good non-conductor. This
desideratum has yet to be attained.

   Blocks were exhibited, in which the vertical and lateral pressures of the weight
suspended were directed (by a combination of levers) to disengage the hooking
parts which moved on eccentric bearings.

   In the boats accumulated strength was given (to all the parts liable to alter)
with the utmost compactness ; and with all the detailed requirements these boats

                District Privecte Telegraphs. Bg Nath. J. Holmes.

   The introduction and use of private telegraphs in this country is of comparatively
recent date. The apparatus in use upon the railways in signalling trains, and by

the telegraph companies for the transmission of public messages, is unsuitable for
the requirements of the private telegraph. The employment of conventional signs,

and what is technically known as the "dot and dash" system, renders the signals
unintelligible except in the hands of properly trained clerks. In 1840 Prof. Wheat-

stone patented his first alphabetical telegraph.

   This instrument has since been greatly improved, and another patent was taken
out in 1858, from which year the general introduction of private telegraphs may
be dated. The first private lines erected in London under the new system were
those of Messrs. Spottiswoode, Messrs. Waterlow and Son, and the London Dock
Company-

    In the year 18G0 Prof. Wheatstone and Mr. Nath. J. Holmes established the
present Universal Private Telegraph Company for the purpose of providing private
wires in various parts of the kingdom upon a system of annual rentals. This Com-
pany, afterwards incorporated in 1861, has already extended its system to every
important town and district in the kingdom, and during the last four years has
erected upwards of 2000 miles of private wire, employing 863 sets of instruments.

      On the Applicability of India-rubber as an Insulator for Telegraphic
                               Conductors. By W. Hooper.

   The author noticed the difficulties encountered in applying caoutchouc for insu-
lating purposes, describing the decay of caoutchouc, especially when exposed to air
 and light, arising from oxidation, and resulting in a condition of fluidity. In apply-

 ing caoutchouc as an insulator, it has been generally washed, dried, and masticated,
 being manufactured by the process into solid blocks, which are then cut up into

sheets, which are again divided into tapes. After the tapes have been wound round
the wires, they have usually been consolidated by heat, or by the use of solvents, both
of which are injurious by their tendency to favour oxidation. Wires thus insulated
give good results for a short time, but their efficiency is soon destroyed. The re-
sults obtained with five specimens of india-rubber-covered wire supplied by different
manufacturers for experimental purposes to the Government of India, and sent out
to Kurrachee in 1863, were adduced by the author, and showed that four out of the
five were defective after submersion in the Indian Ocean, the one only, supplied by
himself, remaining perfect. In insulation this specimen was the highest yet at-
tained, and the perfection of the joints was fully proved. The central position of
the conductor was unaltered by any elevation of temperature, and its insulation re-
mained good up to 150° Fahrenheit, and even higher temperatures. The mechani-
cal properties of the core devised by the author, were also shown to surpass all other
materials yet produced. The importance of the low inductive capacity of the wires,
insulated by the author's process, was dwelt upon. Sir Chas. Bright, Mr. Latimer
Clark, and Professor Thomson, had made independent investigations into the capa-
bilities of the wire thus insidated, and the results deduced by those gentlemen were
singularly in accordance with each other, the two former giving the induction of the
author's wire compared with gutta percha as 100 to 136, the latter as 100 to 135.
The rate of signalling being proportionate to the retardation arising from induction,
the value of the process, in a line of such length as the Atlantic cable, would be
at once apparent in a commercial as well as a scientific view. The Government
have since ordered three lengths of 50, 40, and 45 miles of this insulated wire, which
are now en route for India.

Machinery for compressing Air, and the Applicability of such Compressed Air

  for working Coal-cutting and other Underground Machinery. By T.

    Levick.

 --The advantages which the paper described were: 1. The simplicity of con-

struction, and small cost. 2. The small amount of power to overcome the friction
of the moving parts. 3. It was not affected by the production of heat in the com-

pressed air. 4. It acted as a regulator, adapting its speed to the consumption of air

underground. 5. Being used at the mouth of coal-pits, the additional loss of
power was not of so much consequence. 6. The small amount of space occupied.
The paper explained that the air compressed by the engine at the mouth of the
pit was conveyed to the machinery underground in 4-inch cast-iron pipes, carried
along the main-headings, from which the compressed air was conveyed in 1 J-inch
gas piping, connected with the machine in the pit by an india-rubber hose. The
prominent feature of the machine is a pick, which digs the coal when the engine
at the mouth of the pit is in motion. The pick can be worked at any angle at
which the coal may lie, and can be easily put to work at any part of the thickness
of the coal, whether it might be desired to " hole " in the bottom or at the top of
the measure, or at a parting in the middle, or any other portion of it, by simply
shifting the pick to a greater or less distance upon the axis on Avhich it is keyed.
The machine moves forward as the work progresses by means of a hand wheel,
which communicates motion by bevel wheels to the wheels upon which the ma-
chine travels. In cases of bad roof, the use of the coal-cutting machines had been
objected to on account of the distance required (between the face of the work
and the supports to the roof) for the back work of the pick. Another objection
was that the work had to be passed over twice or three times, in order to gain
the required depth of cut. These objections have been obviated by the machines
introduced to notice, by which the stroke of the pick, when making its cut, was
from the back of the cut towards the face, instead of passing across the road and

striking into the face in the direction observed heretofore. By this means the

 supports to the roof could be brought close up to the road ; the concussion of the
blow was reduced ; and about six inches of the coal had not to be cut, it being
forced out as the pick approached the face. The quantity of compressed air con-
 sumed by each coal-cutter was determined from some indicator diagrams to be 327 '6
 cubic feet per minute, at 30 lbs. pressure. The machine was working at 08 strokes
--186 report 1865.

per minute, showing an expenditure of air equal to 3 horse-power. The machines
at Blaina Ironworks, South Wales, were working in coal which the men refused
to work, and which, though opened out, has not been touched for years, and hole
at the rate of 8 yards per hour, to a depth of 3 feet. The machine, when woiked
with the outward cut and self-propelling motion, will exceed this quantity con-

siderably.

         On some Developments of and Improvements in Giffard's Injector.
                                      By J. Robinson.

   Having referred to the difference of opinion existing among engineers as to this,
which had been called by the President a somewhat paradoxical instrument, the

--author described the action of the injector to be as follows : Steam was taken from

the steam space of any boiler by means of the injector, the water supply was brought
into contact with the steam current, and the result in the shape of hot water was
passed into the water space of the boiler. The question was, how, having an equal
pressure on all parts of the boiler, did a fluid not only pass in the shape of a current
from one part to another, but at the same time carry with it another fluid exposed

--to atmospheric pressure only ? The author propounded the following explanation

of the instrument : Advantage is taken of the superior velocity at which a steam
current issues from a boiler, over that of a water current issuing from a boiler at
the same pressure. These velocities are assumed to bear an exact proportion to
the densities of the two fluids. The steam current having but a small amount of
momentum, the water supply is brought into contact with it, and two results fol-
low : first, the steam current is incorporated with the water current by the con-
densation of the former; secondly, an amount of the velocity of the steam current is
imparted to the water current in the proportion of the quantities of each which are

brought together in the combined jet. As the weight of steam issuing from an

opening is exactly equal to the weight of water which would, under the like pressure,
issue from the same opening in the same time, the area for the admission of steam
to the combining chamber is made greater than the area of the pipe which receives
the condensed jet for transmission to the boiler, as otherwise the amount of velocity
imparted to the water current would not be sufficient to overcome the velocity of
the resisting current from the boiler. The combination of the foregoing principles
and arrangements in the injector is so effective that, steam at a pressure of 30 lbs.
above the atmosphere, water can be forced into a boiler containing steam of very
nearly double that pressure. Having described the construction of the injector,
the paper pointed out the importance of an apparatus capable of supplying water to
steam boilers without motion of any of its parts, and independently of the engine
connected with it. It had proved almost essential to some particular arrange-
ments of boilers and engines. For locomotives, the advantage had been very con-
siderable, inasmuch as it was most important that the machinery of engines run-
ning at such high velocity should be free from the apparatus and repairs necessary

when their boilers were fed by pumps worked by the engine. The advantage also
was obtained by feeding the boiler while the locomotive was at rest, either in the
station, or during its retention in a siding waiting for the line to be cleared. For
this purpose 5230 of the injectors had been manufactured in this country. For

stationary boilers the injector had been found convenient, because of the saving of
the pipes and other communication from the boiler to the engine-room, the sup-
pression of the pumps and the parts of the engine necessary to work them, and the
advantage of being able to fill up the boilers during meal hours, and at other times

when the engine was stopped. For this purpose 3816 had been made in this country.
For marine boilers the apparatus was most convenient, since it answered generally
the purpose both of the main engine pumps and of the donkey pumps, and brought

the control of the feeding-apparatus within reach of the stokers, without reference
to the engine-room, and without the noise and complication of the donkey pump.
In a simple form, and also in the ordinary injector arrangement, the principle had
been applied for raising water from mines and wells, the inducement being the
cheapness and simplicity of the apparatus, and the small space and easy manipula-
tion required. The paper proceeded to describe in detail improvements which had

On the Outer Covering of Deep-sea Cables. By C. "W. Siemens, C.E.

The want of success which has hitherto attended deep-sea cables renders it per-

haps desirable that the attention of the Section should be called to the subject.

We are able at present to point to shallow sea-lines, such as the Dover and

Calais, the Port Patrick and Dunagadee, and the Dover and Ostend lines, which

have lasted above fourteen years, and in which the electric conductors, together

with their insulating coating, remains to this day unimpaired, although the thick

iron wires which constitute their outer covering are greatly diminished in strength

through oxidation, and have given rise to occasional repairs. It has, moreover,

been proved, beyond doubt, that the great hydrostatic pressure upon deep-sea

cables does not deteriorate the insulated conductor, but, on the contrary, greatlv

improves the insulation ; and, as regards the durability of the outer covering, deep-

sea cables have the natural advantage over shallow* sea-lines that they lie upon

tranquil ground far beyond the reach of currents, of accidental disturbances through

ship's anchors or the coral-fisher's hooks, and, to some extent at least, beyond the

reach of animal life. The drawbacks to these advantages are, that the risk of acci-

dent is greater in laying down deep-sea lines, and that, when laid, they are less

accessible for repairs                                                                                              but these circumstances do not suffice to account for the very
                                                                                                                 ;

rapid failure of those deep-sea cables which had been successfully submerged, as, for

instance, the first Atlantic, the Toulon and Algiers, and other lines in the Medi-

terranean.

   But why, it may be asked, are deep-sea cables not made precisely the same as

shallow sea- or shore-end lines, seeing- that the latter have given proof of greater
strength and durability ? The answer is that the laying of a heavy iron-clad cable
into deep seas woidd be attended with great risk, because the retarding force which
has to be applied to a cable in going overboard increases with the depth (or length
of suspended cable), and would amount to several tons ; tug-steamers woidd have
to be applied to assist the cable-ship, and any stoppage in the operation through
the breakage and entanglement of a wire, or other cause, might seriously compromise
the safety of the cable and of the ships themselves. Moreover, deep-sea cables are
generally lone/ cables, and ships could hardly be found to carry a heavy cable of the

requisite length in one niece, nor could it be joined with safety on the open seas.
The risk of breakage of a heavy deep-sea cable woidd also be great, because the

thick iron wires composing the same could hardly reach down to the bottom of the
North Atlantic without breaking by their own dead weight.

   Considering these circumstances, it becomes evident that the strength and per-
manency of a deep-sea cable cannot be attained by thick iron wires, but that other
materials and modes of construction must be had recourse to.

   In reviewing past experience, we find that in the case of the Varna and Balaclava
cable (300 miles) , which was laid in 1858, no sheathing- of any kind was applied to
the insidated conductor. The operation of paving out was accomplished with great

ease and success, and the electrical communication was kept open for nearly nine
months, when it suddenly ceased, in consequence either of chafing against rocks or

shells, or the tooth of the Teredo.

Several cables were laid in the Mediterranean in 1855 and 1856, consisting of an

insidated conductor covered with strings of tarred hemp, which was laid on in the
Amanner of an iron sheathing.
                                                                                                                    difficulty was experienced in laving this descrip-

tion of cable, owing to its excessive specific lightness and roughness of surface,

which combined to make it sink so very slowly to the bottom, that it was paid out,

as it were, in a straight line upon the surface of the water ; and although no break-

power whatever was applied, not sufficient cable would leave the ship to cover the

irregularities of the bottom. This tightening of the cable, when laid, was further

increased by the shrinkage of the hemp strings in the water, and, moreover, by the

action of local currents in the water, to which the cable remained exposed for a long

time during its descent. The consequence was that the cable strained and broke

during the operation of laying, or rather immediately after. In raising this cable
--188 report 1865.

a few mouths later, it was found, moreover, that the hemp had engendered millions

of small marine insects of a peculiar kind (the Xylophaga, according to Huxley),
which had not only completely destroyed the rope, but had eaten deep holes in the
gutta percha without reaching, however, the copper conductor. This action had

been accomplished at a depth of from 300 to 500 fathoms.
    Several heavy iron-covered cables have been laid into moderately deep water in

the Mediterranean, some of which were laid successfully, though at great risk, aud
with great loss of cable, and have worked for several years before giving way. The
most remarkable is the Spezzia aud Corsica cable, which consisted of six insulated
conductors served with tarred hemp, aud sheathed with twelve galvanized iron
wires of vo ths of an inch diameter, producing a weight of 8| tons per mile of cable.
This cable was laid in 1854 in a depth of 600 fathoms, and remained in good
working order till 1863, when it failed.

   The Red Sea and Indian cable was laid successfully in 1859-60, but failed after
nine months' exposure to the sea-water, when it was found that the iron sheathing,

consisting of sixteen wires, and weighing 2 tons per mile, had been completely cor-
roded through in places.

   The first Atlantic cable, which was laid in 1857, had a sheathing of a peculiar
form, consisting of 126 thin charcoal iron wires of No. 22^ B.W.G., giving it great

relative strength during the process of laying. Considering, however, the large

exposure of iron surface to corrosive action of the sea, this cable must have failed a
few weeks after submersion, if the insulated conductor had not been so defective

in itself as to render the cable unfit for regular telegraphic communication from the

first.

Another type of sheathing for a deep-sea cable is that which was adapted for the

Toulon and Algiers line in i860                                                                                                                                                it consisted of ten steel wires, each of which had
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

been previously covered with tarred hemp, for the purpose of giving it additional

strength and protection against corrosion by sea-water. It was proved by experi-

ments that the strength of each steel wire was increased to the full amount of the

strength of the hemp serving, or about 20 per cent., while at the same time the

specific gravity of the cable was greatly decreased, and its descent through the

water further retarded, in consequence of the rough surface the hemp serving

presents. The insulated conductor of this cable was well proportioned and care-

fully tested, and its sheathing was found to be such that a moderate break-power

sufficed to prevent its running out too fast in the laying, while at the same time

the cable descended with sufficient rapidity to provide the necessary slack (about

10 per cent.). Thus far this compound sheathing of steel and hemp had proved a

complete success, when about six months after its submersion the continuity sud-

denly ceased, and in endeavouring to raise the cable it was found that the marine

insects {Xylophaga) had again done the work of destruction, having completely

eaten the hemp and left the steel wires like a loose cage around the insulated con-

ductor, and fully exposed to corrosive action.

These repeated failures of the outer covering of deep-sea cables led the writer to

devise one which combines the requisites of low specific gravity and relative

Astrength with greater durability than could hitherto be attained.                                                                                                             cable of

this description actually forms an important link in the telegraphic chain which

now unites France with its African dependency, and is therefore practically entitled

to consideration. It consists of the ordinary insulated copper conductor,* which is

covered in one process with two layers of best Italian hemp moderately twisted in

opposite directions, and lastly with an outer binding sheathing of copper, which is

put on under great pressure, and in such a manner that the copper strips composing

the same overlap, and are, as it were, mortised into one another, producing practi-

cally the effect of a complete flexible tube. Each string of hemp is put on in the

machine under an equal strain, which gives to the rope a strength fully equal to the
sum of all its constituents. The metal of the outer sheathing is copper mixed with

about \ per cent, of phosphorus, which imparts to it greater tenacity, and an
increased power to resist chemical action in the sea-water. Instead of copper,

zinc has sometimes been used, which also resists sea-water in a remarkable degree.
   The hemp gives great relative strength to this cable. The Algeria cable, with

an outer diameter of only \ inch, bears a strain exceeding 1^ ton ; and a cable of
                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  189

the dimensions proposed by the writer for the Atlantic, having a diameter off inch,

bears between 3 and 4 tons of longitudinal strain before breaking, or fully as much

as an iron-covered cable of the same diameter, while its weight in sea-water is from

five to six times less.

The machine used in the manufacture of this cable presents several practical

mechanical combinations, which the writer, however, passed over, in order not

to extend the subject of this paper.

The peculiar properties of this cable, as contrasting with the ordinary cable with

helical or spiral sheathing, are as follows :

1st. The absolute strength of this cable can be increased to any desired extent

without adding to its weight in water, the hemp being very nearly of the

same specific gravity as the water itself. Considering past experience, a

specific gravity of 1.}, and a strength sufficient to support from ten to twelve
miles of weight of the cable in sea-water appears desirable.

2ndly. The elongation of this cable under half its breaking strain does not exceed
   -! per cent., and has no tendency to untwist when suspended from one end,

whereas an iron-sheathed cable (or a cable of the Toulon and Algiers type)

will elongate from 3 to 4 per cent, under similar circumstances, and partially

untwist at the same time, because each wire tends to assume a straight line

parallel to the axis. This elongation throws a great and dangerous strain upon

the insulated conductor, which will be permanently elongated and disposed to

fall into kinks at the bottom.

3rdly. In the manufacture of iron-clad cables the insidated conductor frequently

   gets injured through the breakage of a wire, or the carelessness of workmen

in making welds, and the cable, when manufactured and in the very act of
being paid overboard, may be penetrated by the sharp end of a broken wire,

as has most unfortunately happened on a recent occasion. The copper-sheathed

cable precludes almost the possibility of any such accidental injury ; the in-

sulated conductor, after being carefully tested, passes through the sheathing-

machine, where it receives spontaneously its double hemp covering and

complete metallic armour coat. It is worthy of remark that the insulation

resistance of the cores invariably increases in receiving the armour coat,

owing, it appears, to the external pressure produced, and that not a single,

fault of insulation has ever occurred in the cable during the processes of ship-

ment and submersion.

4thly. The durability of the copper-sheathed cable has already been proved by

Aexperiment and in actual practice.            cable which had been laid in 1864 in

the Mediterranean, from Oran to Carthagena, was raised again nine months

later (in consequence of an accident of a purely mechanical nature) from a

depth of 1500 fathoms, when it was found to be in a perfectly good condition,
the insulation and the strength of the hemp being unimpaired, and the copper
sheathing being covered by a thin green scale of chloride of copper and mag-

nesia, it is supposed, which appears to have arrested further chemical action.

The cable so recovered, and of which a specimen was exhibited, now forms part

of the line connecting Sicily with Algeria ; whereas the iron-sheathed shore-
end cable, which was also recovered, was found to be unfit for further use, being

much corroded and covered with coral growth.

5thly. The copper-sheathed cable is mechanically well suited to the operations

of laving; it is extremely flexible, occupies relatrvely little space in the ship's

holdj! and glides smoothly overboard without the least risk of catching by

broken wires, or of forming into kinks, or untwisting under strain. It offers
remarkably little resistance in the water, and can be recovered from the

       greatest depth at the rate of one knot per hour.

   It has been objected that hemp rope contracts very considerably (about 3 per
cent.) upon being immersed, and that the copper-sheathed cable must be liable to
the same injurious effect. While fully admitting the general proposition, the
writer has no difficulty to show that it does not apply to the cable in question.

   It was seen from the experiment which was shown to the Section, that although
a twisted hemp rope contracts upon being moistened, a single hemp fibre, taken
from the same rope, actually elongates under the same treatment, the reason
--190 REPORT 1865.

being, as it appears to the writer, that each hemp fibre consists of a series of col-

lapsed tubes between knots, which, upon filling with water, straighten from knot

to knot,  and therefore slightly augment  the  total  length                                   whereas the same fibre,
                                                                                            ;

if wound spirally, will reduce the length of the spiral, in consequence of its increase
in diameter in filling with water. Proceeding from this consideration, hemp yarn

of little twist is used in the manufacture of this cable, the copper sheathing binding

the fibres sufficiently to continue their strength, and the result is that its length

remains practically the same upon being immersed.

In drawing this paper to a conclusion, the writer feels that he has laid himself

open to the charge of partiality in favour of one particular covering, but his excuse

is that he could not have done otherwise without doing violence to his convictions,

which, however, are open to criticism. So much will, he thinks, be readily con-

ceded, that the failure of deep-sea cables has hitherto been mainly due to the
mechanical imperfections and perishable nature of the outer coverings. The un-

fortunate result of the last attempt to establish telegraphic communication with

America goes to strengthen this proposition. Both the insulated conductor and the

paying-out machinery had been prepared with extreme care ; the great ship was
well adapted to its important work, which in all human probability would have

been crowned by success but for the unfortunate injuries which the insulated

core received through insufficient protection. The recurrence of the same kind of

accident may perhaps be avoided by special care ; but there remain the dangers of

kinks at the bottom, through the untwisting of the rope while in suspension, and,

most of all, the question of durability to be disposed of.

It has been maintained by some that the outer covering of deep-sea cables is

only of use for submerging the same, and that its decay at the tranquil bottom of

the ocean could not harm the insulation ; but such a proposition is disposed of by
experience, and it is natural to suppose that the sheathing must give way first in

such places where it rests upon a stone or gentle elevation of the ground (and is

most exposed to chemical action). Upon giving way, the cable will sink to take

new bearings and cause the unsupported insulated conductor to separate. It may,

on the other hand, be maintained that a permanent metallic sheathing is requisite

to ensure the success of deep-sea as well as shallow-sea cables.

   In this machine the ram ("one ton in weight) falls twelve times in a minute, with
a 5-feet lift. The size of the bottom frame is only 7 feet 6 inches square, and it
occupies a smaller space than an ordinary hand-machine, and can be used in any
situation, on land or afloat, where the other can. It supplies a deficiency long felt,
viz. something more powerful and expeditious than hand-machines, and something
less ponderous and costly than those steam-machines hitherto brought out. Du-
ring the past six years fifty-four of them have been made ; seven are in use on the
Thames Embankment, and Mr. Brassey has five in operation in Galicia.
