       REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.            XXXIU

    Report of the Council of the British Association, presented to the
               General Committee, Wednesday, August 33, 1866.

  --The Council have the honour to report as follows :

   The Council have received a Report from the Treasurer at each of their
Meetings, and a Report for the year wiU be presented to the General Com-

mittee this day.

   The Report of the Parliamentary Committee has been received for pre-

sentation to the General Committee.

   The Kew Committee have presented to the Council a Report for the year

1865-66, which wiU be laid before the General Committee this day.
   The Council have added to the list of Corresponding Members the names

of the following Foreign Men of Science who attended the Birmingham

Meeting, viz. ;

Capt. Belavenetz.       Prof. Kiepert.

Geheimrath von Dechen.  Prof. F. Romer.
M. Gaudry.              Chev. C. Negri.
Prof. Grube.
                        Prof. Steenstrup.

   The Council recommend that the names of Mr. J. Hind, F.R.S., and Mr.
T. Close, be added to the list of Vice-Presidents of the Meeting.

   In consequence of the resignation of Mr. Hopkins as Joint General Secre-
tary, annoiuiced last year, the Council appointed a Committee, consisting of

the General Secretaries and the Gentlemen who had formei'ly filled that

office, for the pui-pose of taking into consideration and reporting to the Council
on the advisability of nominating a Joint General Secretary. The Council
have received the following Report, viz. :

       '·' That Thomas Archer Hii'st, Esq., Ph.D., F.R.S., Professor of Mathe-
           thematical Physics in University College, London, be recommended

            as highly qualified for Election as Joint General Secretary of the
             Association."

   The Council recommend that Mr. Hirst, F.R.S., be elected Joint General

Secretary.

   The Council have been informed that invitations for future Meetings of
the Association have been received from Dundee, Norwich, Plymouth, and

Exeter,

Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for the

       Advancement of Science for 1865-66.

The Committee of the Kew Observatory submit to the Council of the British

--Association the following statement of their proceedings during the past

year :

  A Unifilar and Dip Circle for Captain J. Belavenetz, of the Russian Navy,

Director of the Compass Observatory at Cronstadt, have been verified at Kew

Observatory and forwarded to Russia.

   Three Unifiilars and three Dip Circles, ordered by Colonel Strange for the

Indian Survey, have been verified.

   Dr. Kirk, who has gone out to Zanzibar on the African coast, has received

instruction at Kew Observatory ; and a Dip Circle, a Unifilar, and an Azimuth

Compass have been verified for him, and await his directions.

In consequence of a representation from Mr. C. Chambers, Acting Super-

intendent of the Observatory, Bombay, a correspondence has taken place

between the Director of the India Store Department and the Chairman of

1866.  '

the Kew C!ominittee, the result of which is that the Committee have super-

intended the consti-uction of an Anemometer, a Dip Circle, and a TJniiilar
for the Bombay Observatory. These instruments have been verified, and are

now in the hands of the India Board for transmission to their destination.
   The Admiralty have ordered a Unifilar and a Dip Circle for Captain Mayne,

of Her Majesty's ship ' Nassau,' who is about to proceed to the Straits of

Magellan ; these instruments have been verified at Kew Observatory, where

Captain Mapie and several of his officers have likewise received instruction

in magnetism.
    Dr. Buys-Ballot has ordered a Declination Magnetograph, which has been

constructed by Mr. Adie, and forwarded to Utrecht, where it has safely

arrived.

  A set of Self-recording Magnetographs and also a Barograph have been

ordered by the Stonyhurst Observatory ; and the Rev. "Walter Sidgreaves has
been at the Observatory receiving instruction in magnetism. The Self-

recording Magnetographs for Stonyhiirst have been verified and dispatched

to their destination.

   The set of self-recording instruments ordered by Mr. Meldrum of the

Mauritius Observatory, are at present at Kew ; Mr. Meldrum intends to visit
the Kew Observatory for the purpose of making himself further acquainted

with the process of observing and deducing results previous to his return

to the Mauritius.

   Mr. Ellery, of Melbourne Observatory, has likewise- ordered a set of Self-

recording magnetographs. These have been constructed bj" Mr. Adie, and

will be taken to Kew for verification when the set for Maui'itius have been

removed.

   Professor Smimow (from Kasan) has received instruction in magnetism at

the Observatory.

   The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-
tinue to be made by Mr. Whipple, Magnetical Assistant, and the self-recording
magnetographs are in constant operation as heretofore, also imder Mr. Whipple,
who has displayed his usual care and assiduity in the discharge of his duties.

   The photographic department connected with the self-recording instru-
ments is under the charge of Mr. Page, who performs his duties very satis-

factorily.

  A stoneware stove free from iron has been erected in the room containing

the Kew magnetographs, and by its means this room has been heated through

a range of 20° Fahr., in order to determine the temperature correction of the
horizontal and vertical force magnetographs. The observations for this pur-
pose are being reduced.

   The meteorological work of the ObseiTatoiy continues in charge of Mr.
Baker, who executes his duties very satisfactoiily.

   Since the Birmingham Meeting 126 barometers have been verified.
395 thermometers have likewise been verified, and 8 standard thermometers

constructed at the Observatory.

   The Self-recording Barograph continues in constant operation ; and traces
in dupHcate are obtained, one set of which is regularly forwarded to the
meteorological department of the Board of Trade.

   An arrangement for a Self-recording Thermograph has been devised by the

Superintendent and by Mr. Beckley, and, as a preliminary experiment, gave

a very satisfactory curve ; the instrument is now being arranged in a suitable

site.

   The instruments used by the late Mr. Appold for regulating the tempera-

ture and moisture of his apartments have been forwarded by the Royal Society

to the Kew Observatory.

   The Indian pendulum observations are in active progress. Both Colonel
"Walker and Captain Basevi are in correspondence with the Observatory in
discussing questions relating to this work.

   The Superintendent has received JlOO from the Government Grant Com-

mittee of the Eoyal Society for preliminary observation with Captain Kater's
pendulum. These preliminary observations are in progress under the charge

of ilr. Loewy as observer, and have the following points in view ;
   (1) To see by the general agreement or non-agreement of the observations

with each other whether Captain Kater's pendulum is still in a state to justify
its adoption as an instrument to give a correct determination of the length of

the seconds' pendulum.
   (2) To determine the true temperature correction of the pendulum,
   (3) To use Kater's pendulum, and also the Eoyal Society's invariable

pendulum ISTo. 8, for the purpose of determining a curve of correction for
atmospheric pressure, from inch to inch, at low pressures.

   The Superintendent has received £50 from the Government Grant Fund

of the Royal Society, to pursue the experiments on a rotating disk.

   The Kew Heliograph, in charge of Mr. De la Rue, continues to be worked

in a very satisfactory manner. During the past year 282 negatives have
been taken on 158 days, and the usual number of positives have been

printed from them.
    Since the last Meeting of the Association, the first set of the results ob-

--tained by this instrument have been published at the expense of Mr. De la

Rue, under the following title : " Researches on Solar Physics, by Warren
De la Rue, B. Stewart, and B, Loewy ; first series ; On the Nature of Sun-

spots."

   The present progress of the work of reduction wiU best be seen from the
following letter, written by Mr. De la Rue, in answer to a request made
through the Astronomer Royal by Padre Secchi, to know what was doing in

this country in the subject of Heliography.

                                                                " 110 BunhiU Eow, August 8th, 1866.

Mt --" dear Sir, In reference to the extract from Padre Secchi's letter,

I beg to supply the following information.

   " The pictures taken by means of the Kew Heliograph are all measured by
means of my Micrometer ; the positions of the spots are then reduced to dis-

tances in terms (fractional parts) of the sun's radius, and the angles of position

corrected for any error in the position of the wires.
   " Pictures of the Pagoda are taken from time to time, and the measure-

ments of the various galleries of the Pagoda serve to determine the optical
distortion of the Sun's image, and the corrections to be applied to the Sun-

pictures.

   " The heliocentric latitudes and longitudes of the spots are then calculated.
   " The areas of the spots and the penumbra are also measured, and the areas
corrected for perspective are tabulated in terms (fractional parts) of the area

of the sun's disk.

   " The areas of the spots (fee. on aU of Carrington's original pictures have re-
cently been measured, and an account of these measurements will be shortly

published.

   " Padre Secchi wiU be able to judge, from the foregoing statement, whetiier

it will be worth while to undertake the work he proposes.

" The measurements obtainable from photographs are much more reliable

than those from projected images.            <' I am,

                                             " Yours very truly,

   The Association Tvill regret to learn the deaths of Dr. Sabler and M. Gussew,

in consequence of Avhich the "Wilna Heliogi-aph is not at work.

   M. Smysloif of the Pulkowa Observatory has been appointed Director of the
Wilna Observatory, by the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg.
M. 0. Struvc having asked for information respecting the vrorking of the

Heliograph, it has been suggested to him by the Kew Committee that it would
be advisable for M. Smysloif to visit the Kcw Observatory, to see the instru-

ment in operation.
   The sun-spots continue to be observed after the method of Hofrath Schwabe,

of Dessau, and the valuable collection of drawings lent by this eminent ob-
server remains at the Obsei-vatory. These have been supplemented by the
beautiful series of detailed drawings of spots made by the Eev. F. Hewlett,
which that gentleman has deposited at Kew.

   The apparatus for verifying sextants alluded to in the last Ptcport has now

been constructed by Mr. Cooke, and is being erected at the Observatoiy.

   About three-fourths of the region of the solar spectrum between E and F

has been mapped by the spectroscope belonging to the Chairman. The spec-
troscope is now in London, the work appertaining to the staff at the Obser-

vatory not permitting sufficient time for further observation with this instru-

ment.

   The instrument devised by Mr. Broun for the purpose of estimating the
magnetic dip by means of soft iron, remains at present at the Observatory,

awaiting Mr. Broun's return to England.

    The Superintendeiit has received grants from the Eoyal Society for special
experiments ; and when these are completed, an account will be rendered to

that Society.

    The Eeport of a Committee appointed to consider certain questions relating

to the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade, and presented to

both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty, has been communi-

cated to the Members of the Kew Committee, and has been otherwise widelj'

circulated among the meteorologists of the British Association : the object

of the Beport is expressed in the following terms :

    *' Upon the death of the late Admiral FitzBoy, a correspondence took

" place between the Board of Trade and the Boyal Societj- with respect to
 " the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade. The result of that
 " correspondence was the appointment of a Committee, consisting of the fol-
 " lowing gentlemen, viz. Francis Galtou, Esq., F.E.S., General Secretary of the

 '* British Association for the Advancement of Science, nominated by the Pre-
 " sident and Council of the Eoyal Society ; Staff Commander Evans, E.IS".,
 " F.Pt.S., Chief Naval Assistant to the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, by
 " the Admiralty ; T. H. Farrer, Esq., one of the Secretaries to the Board of

--" Trade, by the Board of Trade, to consider and report upon the following

 " questions :
     " 1. "Wliat are the data, especially as regards Meteorological Observations

 " at sea, already collected by and now existing in the Meteorological Depart-
 *' ment of the Board of Trade ?
                                                                            --

         REPORT OF THE KEAV COMMITTEE.                              XXXVll

   " 2. Whether any, and what steps should be taken for arranging, tabula-
" ting, publishing, or otherwise maldng nse of such data,

   " 3. Whether it is desirable to continue Meteorological Observations at sea,
" and if so, to what extent, and in Avhat manner.

   " 4. Assuming that the system of Weather Telegraphy is to be continued,
" can the mode of carrying it on and publishing the results be improved ?

   " 5. What staff will be necessary for the above purposes ? "

   The authors of the lleport arrive at the following conclusions in respect
to the ocean statistics, weather telegraphy, foretelling weather, and obser-

vations affecting Avcather in the British Isles.

" The collection of observations from the captains of ships is a function

" which can probably best be performed through the medium of such agencies

" as a Government OfRcc can command, and which was in fact well performed

" by the Meteorological Department before its attention was devoted to the

We" practice of foretelling weather.    assume, therefore, that this function

" will remain with the Board of Trade.

" The digesting and tabulating results of observations is, on the other hand,

" a function which requires a large knowledge of what the state of the science

" for the time being requires, as well as exact scientific method.

" This function is one that has not been satisfactorily performed by the Me-

" teorological department. And we believe that it would be much better, as well

" as more economically performed, under the direction of a scientific body

" such as a Committee of the Royal Society, or of the British Association, if

--" furnished with the requisite fimds by the Government than it will be if

" left to a Government Department. The establishment already existing at

" Kew might probably be easily developed, so as to carry into effect such a

  The Kew Committee have examined this Report, and, speaking in general

terms, they cordially acquiesce in the conclusions of its authors. They con-

sider the proposed arrangement to fall within the competence of the Kew

Observatory.

   In the last Kew Report it was stated that many experiments and observa-

tions of a nature to advance science are made by the Committee under the

sanction of the Association, the cost of each being defrayed by the pro-

moters.

The Committee consider that the suggested observations contained in the

Government Report which has been referred to, would be merely an exten-

sion of the usual practice of the Obseiwatory ; but in consideration of the

magnitude of the work proposed, they suggest that the Council should bring

the subject before the General Committee, -with the view of the Kew Com-

mittee being authorized to discuss and make the necessary arrangements

with the Board of Trade, should any proposal be made.

The Committee are also desii-ous of bringing under the consideration of

the Council, the expediency of proceeding in the formation of a memoir on

the periodic and non-periodic variations of the temperatm-e at Kcw, as a nor-

mal station of British meteorology. Similar works have for some years past

occupied the attention of the most eminent amongst the continental meteo-

rologists as being in fact the foundation of all scientijic knowledge of the

Aclimatology of their respective countries.  memoir on the periodic and non-

periodic variations of the temperature at the magnetical and meteorological

observatory at Toronto in Canada has been printed in the Philosophical

Transactions for 1853, but no such work has yet been systematically under-

taken at Kew, although it is quite in accordance vrith the objects for which

the Observatory was instituted, in familiarizing British meteorologists with

a system of tabulation they have hitherto unduly neglected. DaUy photo-

grams taken from the thermograph constructed under Mr. Stewart's direction

will supply in the most unexceptionable manner the observational basis on

which the memoir would be founded.

   To obtain such photograms would constitute a very small addition to the

duties of the assistant by whom the daily photograms of the magnetical in-

struments are taken. The tabulation from the daily photograms of the tem-

perature would be the only increase of any moment to the ordinary present

work of the observatory, and would require, possibly, the part services of an

additional young assistant.

The tabulation would supply twenty-four equidistant entries in every

solar day. The tables containing these entries, together with the Photo-

grams, after careful inspection by a proper auth&rity, would be preserved for

subsequent use. Five or, at most, six years would constitute quite a sufficient

basis for the determination of the periodic variations forming the first part

of the proposed work, and would require about a couple of months of super-

intending care on the part of the person who might be director of the Obser-

vatory, when the observations of the five or six years should have accumu-

lated.

   Nothing more than ordinary clerk's work under such general superintend-
ence would be required.

    Should the Board of Trade be disposed to avail itself of the suggestion

which has been made to them in respect to the Kew Obsei-vatory, the publi-

cation which has been suggested would become one of its first important

duties.

--Xl REPORT 1866.

lieport of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                      Association at Nottingham, August 1866.

The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follo-n's :

Your Committee have to express their regret that another Session of Par-

liament has heen allowed to pass away without any step having been taken

by the Legislature to promote the study of science in our great pubhc schools.

In the last Session, howevei-, an Act was passed to amend the Acts rela-

ting to the Imperial Standards of Weight, Measure, and Capacity.

The Act was introduced chiefly for the purpose of carrying out the recom-

mendations of a Treasury Committee, which reported in 1864 ; and it M'ill

effect some very useful reforms in the constitution of the Office having the

custody of the Imperial Standards, whereby the whole organization of the

Department will be placed on a more scientific basis.

An Officer is appointed to be called the Warden of the Standards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   and due
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

provision is made for the periodical comparison of the Imperial and Secondary

AStandards, a matter which had hitherto been very much neglected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  pro-

vision is for the fu'st time made for defining the amount of error to be

tolerated in Secondary Standards ; there is also a clause in which it is stated
to be the dutj' of the Warden " to conduct all such comparisons, verifications,

and other operations with reference to Standards of Length, Weight, and

Capacity, in aid of scientific researches, or otherwise, as the Board of Trade

from time to time authorize or direct."

Your Committee have also to express their regret that no steps have as yet

been taken to reorganize the Meteorological Department of the Board of

Trade, and carry out the valuable suggestions of the Eeport of Mr. Francis

Galton and his colleagues, presented to Parliament during the last Session.

Your Committee will not fail to advocate such measures as may be neces-

sary for placing this Department on a satisfactory footing. They wiU

neither be unmindful of the part which they took in its original establish-

ment, nor of the benefits which it has already conferred, and which, if suc-

cessfully reorganized, it will continue to confer on Meteorological Science.

   In conclusion, we recommend that Sir Henry Eawlinson be elected a
Member of our Committee.

AVILLIAM ROBERT GROVE, Esq., Q.C, M.A., E.R.S.,

                                       PRESIDENT.

If our rude predecessors, who at one time inhabited the caverns Avhich

surround this town, could rise from thcii- graves and see it iu its present

state, it may be doubtful whether they Avould have sufficient knowledge to

be surprised.
    The machinery, almost resembling organic beings in delicacy of structure,

by which are fabricated products of world-wide reputation, the powers of
matter apphed to give motion to that machinery, are so far removed from

what must have been the conceptions of the semibarbariaus to whom I have

iJluded, that they could not look on them with intelligent wonder.
    Yet this immense progress has all been effected step by step, now and then

a little more rapidly than at other times ; but, viewing the whole course of
improvement, it has been gradual, though moving in an accelerated ratio.
But it is not merely in those branches of natural knowledge which tend to
improvements in economical arts and manufactiu'es, that science has made

great progress. In the study of our own planet and the organic beings
^nth which it is crowded, and in so much of the universe, as vision, aided

 by the telesco])e, has brought M'ithin the scope of observation, the present
 century has surpassed any antecedent period of equal duration.

     It would be difficult to trace out all the causes which have led to the in-
 crease of observational and experimental knowledge.

    Among the more thinking portion of mankind the gratification felt by
 the discovery of new truths, the expansion of faculties, and extension of the

 boimdaries of knoM'ledge have been doubtless a sufficient inducement to tho
 study of nature ; while, to the more practical minds, the reality, the cer-
 tainty, and the progressive character of the acquisitions of natural science,
 and the enormously increased means which its applications give, have im-
 pressed its importance as a minister to daily wants and a contributor to
 ever-increasing material comforts, luxury, and power.

     Though by no means the only one, yet an important cause of the rapid
 advance of science is the growth of associations for promoting the progress
 either of physical knowledge generally, or of special branches of it. Since
 the foundation of the Eoyal Societj', now more than two centuries ago, a
 vast number of kindi'cd societies have sprung up in this country and in
 Europe. The advantages conferred by these societies are manifold ; they
  enable those who are devoted to scientific research, to combine, compare, and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

check their observations, to assist, by the thoughts of several minds, the
promotion of the inquiry undertaken ; they contribute from a joint purse
to such efforts as their members deem most worthj^ ; thej^ afford a means of
submitting to a competent tribunal notices and memoirs, and of obtaining
for their authors and others, by means of the discussions wliich ensue, in-
formation given by those best informed on the particular subject ; they
enable the author to judge whether it is worth his while to pursue the sub-
jects he has brought forward, and they defray the expense of printing and
publishing such researches as are thought deserving of it.

    These advantages, and others might be named, pertain to the Association

the 36th Meeting of which we are this evening assembled to inaugurate
but it has, from its intermittent and peripatetic character, advantages which

belong to none of the societies which are fixed as to their locality.

   Among these are the novelty and freshness of an annual meeting, which,
while it brings together old Members of the Association, many of whom only
meet on this occasion, always adds a quota of new Members, infusing new

blood, and varpng the social character of our meetings.

   The visits of distinguished foreigners, whom we have pre^iously known by

reputation, is one of the most delightful and improving of the results. The
wide field of inquiry, and the character of communications made to the
Association, including all branches of natural knowledge, and A'arying from
simple notices of an interesting observation or experiment, to the most in-
tricate and refined branches of scientific research, is another valuable charac-

teristic.

    Lastly, perhaps the greatest advantage resulting from the annual visits

of this great parliament to new localities is that, while it imparts fresh

local knowledge to the visitors, it leaves behind stimulating memories, wliich

--rouse into permanent activity dormant or timid minds an effect which, so far

from ceasing with the \dsit of the Association, frequently begins when that

visit terminates.

    Every votary of physical science must be anxious to see it recognized by
those institutions of the country which can to the greatest degree promote

its cultivation and reap from it the greatest benefit. You will probably
agree with me that the principal educational establishments on the one hand,
and on the other the Government, in many of its departments, are the insti-
tutions which may best fulfil these conditions. The more early tlie mind is

trained to a pui'suit of any kmd, the deeper and more permanent are llie
impressions received, and the more service can be rendered by the students.

                          " Quo semcl est imbuta recens servabit odorem

                                   Testa diu."

    Little can be achieved in scientific research without an acquaintance with

it in youth ; you wiU rarely find an instance of a man who has attained any
eminence in science who has not commenced its study at a very early

period of life. Nothing, again, can tend more to the promotion of science

than the exertions of those who have early acquired the yOos resulting from
a scientific education. I desire to make no complaint of the tardiness with

which science has been received at our public schools and, Avith some ex-
ceptions, at our Universities. These great establishments have their roots
in historical periods, and long time and patient endeavour is requisite be-
fore a new branch of thought can be grafted with success on a stem to which
it is exotic. Nor should I ever wish to see the study of languages, of history,
of all those refined associations which the past has transmitted to us, ne-
                                                           ADDRESS.                                       Iv

glected ; but there is room for both. It is sad to see the number of so-called

educated men who, travelling by railway, voyaging by steamboat, consult-

ing the almanac for the time of sunrise or full-moon, have not the most

elementary knowledge of a steam-engine, a barometer, or a quadrant ; and

Avho will listen with a half-confessed faith to the most idle predictions as

to weather or cometic influences, while they are in a state of crass igno-

rance as to the cause of the trade-winds or the form of a comet's path.

May we hope that the sHght infiltration of scientific studies, now happily

commenced, will extend till it occupies its fair space in the education of

the young, and that those who may be able learnedly to discourse on the

Eolic digamma will not be ashamed of knowing the principles on which the

action of an air-pump, an electrical machine, or a telescope depends, and vrill

not, as Bacon complained of his contemporaries, despise such knowledge as

something mean and mechanical.

To assert that the great departments of Government should eneom-age

physical science may appear a truism, and yet it is but of late that it has

been seriously done ; now, the habit of consulting men of science on im-

portant questions of national interest is becoming a recognized practice,

and in a time, which may seem long to individuals, but is short in the

history of a nation, a more definite sphere of usefulness for national pur-

poses will, I have no doubt, be proAadcd for those dulj' qualified men Avho
may be content to give up the more tempting study of abstract science for

Kewthat of its practical applications. In this respect the lleport of the
Committee for this year affords a subject of congratulation to those whom
I have the honour to address. The Kew Observatory, the petted child of

the British Association, may possibly become an important national establish-

ment                          and if  so,  while  it will  not, I  trust, lose  its  character of a home  for
                           ;

untrammelled physical research, it will have siiperadded some of the functions

of the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade with a staff of skil-

ful and experienced observers.

This is one of the results which the general growth of science, and the

labours of this Association in particular, have produced ; but I do not propose

on this occasion to recapitulate the special objects attained by the Association,

this has been amply done by several of my predecessors ; nor shall I confine
my address to the progress made in physical science since the time when
my most able and esteemed friend and predecessor addressed jou at Bir-

mingham. In the various reports and communications which will be read

at your 8ections, details of every step which has been made in science

since our last Meeting will be brought to your notice, and I have no doubt

fully and freely discussed.

   I purpose, with your kind permission, to submit to you certain A^ews of
what has -within a comparatively recent period been accomplished by science,

what have been the steps leading to the attained results, and what, as far as

we may fairly form an opinion, is the general character pervading modei-n

discovery.

It seems to me that the object we have in view would be more nearly

approached, by each President, chosen as they are in succession as repre-

senting different branches of science, giving on these occasions either an

account of the progress of the particular branch of science he has ciiltivated,

when that is not of a very limited and special character, or enouncing his
own view of the general j)rogress of science ; and though this will necessarily
involve much that belongs to recent years, the confining a President to
a mere resume of what has taken place since our last Meeting would, I
--Ivi KEPUllT 1860.

veutiu'C Antli difflclcncc to think, limit his means of usefuhics>s, and render

his discourse rather an annual register than an instructive essay.

              I need not dwell on the common-place but yet important topics of the

material advantages resulting from the application of science ; I -will address

myself to what, in my humble judgment, arc the lessons we have learned

and the probable prospects of improved natural knowledge.

              One word will give you the key to what I am about to discourse on ; that

word is continuiii/, no new word, and used in no new sense, but perhaps

Weapplied more generally than it has hitherto been.        shall see, unless I am

much mistaken, that the development of observational, experimental, and

even deductive knowledge is cither attained l)y steps so extremely small as

to form really a continuous ascent ; or, when distinct results apparently

separate from any coordinate phenomena have been attained, that then, by

the subsequent progi'css of science, intermediate links have been discovered

uniting the apparently segregated instances with other more familiar

phenomena.

Thus the more we investigate, the more we find that in existing phe-

nomena graduation from the like to the seemingly unlike prevails, and in

the changes which take place in time, gradual progress is, and apparently

must be, the course of nature.

Let me now endeavour to apply this view to the recent progress of some of

the more prominent branches of science.

   In Astronomy, from the time when the earth was considered a flat plain

--bounded by a flat ocean, when the sun, moon, and stars Avere regarded as

--lanterns to illuminate this plain,- each successive discovery has brought with

it similitudes and analogies between this earth and many of the objects of

the universe with which our senses, aided by instruments, have made us

acquainted. I pass, of course, over those discoveries which have established the

Copernicausystemas applied to our sun, its attendant planets, audtheirsatellites.

The proofs, hoM-ever, that gravitation is not confined to our solar system,

but pervades the imiverse, have received many confiimations by tlie labours

of Members of this Association ; I may name those who have held the

office of President, Lord Eosse, Lord AVrottesley, and f^ir J. Herschel, the

latter having devoted special attention to the orbits of double stars, the

former to those probably more recent systems called nebula?. Double stars

seem to be orbs analogous to oiu* own sun and revolving round their common

centre of gravity in a conic-section curve, as do the jilanets with which we

are more intimately acquainted ; but the nebida; present more difficulty, and

some doubt has been expressed whether gravitation, such as we consider it,

acts with those bodies (at least those exhibiting a spiral form) as it does with

us            possibly  some  other  modifying  influence  may exist, our  present  ignorance
           ;

of which gives rise to the apparent diificulty. There is, however, another

class of observations quite recent in its importance, and which has formed a

special subject of contribution to the Eeports and Transactions of this

Association ; I allude to those on Meteorites, at which oiu- lamented Member,
and to many of us our vahied friend, Prof. Baden Powell assiduously laboured,

for investigations into which a Committee of this Association is formed, and

a series of star-charts for enabling observers of shooting-stars to record their

observations was laid before the last Meeting of the Association by Mr. (ilaisher.

It would occupy too much of your time to detail the eff'orts of Be.ssel,

Sehwinke, the late Sir J. Lubbock, and others, as applied to the formation of

star-charts for aichng the observation of meteorites which Mr. Alexander

Herschel; Mr. Brayley, Mr, Sorby, and others arc noAv studying.

Dr. Olmsted explained tlic tippearaucc oi' a point from wliich the lines of

flight of meteors seem to radiate, as being the perspective vanishing point of
their parallel or nearly parallel courses appearing to an observer on the
earth as it a})proachcs them. The nuifornaity of position of these radiant

points, the many corroborative observations on the direction, the distances,

and the velocities of these bodies, the circumstance that their paths intersect
the earth's orbit at certain definite periods, and the total failure of all other
theories Avhich have been advanced, -while there is no substantial objection to
this, afford evidence almost amoimting to proof that these are cosmical bodies
mo^-ing in the interplanetary space by gra\itatiou round the sun, and some

perhaps round planets. This view gives us a new element of continuity.
The universe -would thus appear not to have the extent of empty space
formerly attributed to it, but to be studded between the larger and more

A'isible masses with smaller planets, if the term be permitted to be applied to

meteorites.

   Observations are now made at the periods at which meteors appear in
greatest numbers-- at Greenwich by Mr. Glaisher, at Cambridge by Prof.

--Adams, and at Hawkhiu'st by Mr. Alexander Herschel and every preparation

is made to secure as much accuracy as can, in the present state of knowledge,

be secui-ed for such observations.

   The number of kno-wn asteroids, or bodies of a smaller size than what are
tenned the ancient planets, has been so increased by numerous discoveries,
that instead of seven we now count eighty-eight as the number of recognized

--planets a field of discovery with which tlie name of Hind v\'ill be ever

associated.

   If we add these, the smallest of which is only twenty or thirty mUes in
diameter, indeed cannot be accurately measured, and if we -\\'ero to apply the

same scrutiny to other parts of the heavens as has been applied to tlie zone
between Mars and Jupiter, it is no far-fetched speculation to suppose that

in addition to asteroids and meteorites, many other bodies exist until the

space occupied by our solar system becomes fiUed np with planetary bodies
varying in size from that of Jupiter (1240 times larger in volume than the

earth) to that of a cannon-ball or even a pistol-buUct.
   The researches of Leverrier on the iutra-mcrcurial planets come in aid of

these views ; and another half century may, and not improbably will, enable

us to ascertain that the now seemingly vacant interplanetary spaces are

occupied by smaller bodies which have hitherto escaped observation, just as
the asteroids had nntil the time of Olbers and Piazzi. Put the evidence of

continuity as  pervading the universe does not stop  at telescopic observation
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

chemistry and physical optics bring usnewproofs. Those meteoricl)odies which

have from time to time come so far -v^-ithin reach of the earth's attraction as

to fall iipon its surface, give on analysis metals and oxides similar to those

which belong to the structure of the earth--they come as travellers bringing

specimens of minerals from extra-terrestrial regions.
   In a series of papers recently communicated to the French Academy,

M. Daubree has discussed the chemical and raincralogical character of

meteorites as compared with the rocks of the earth. He finds that the
similarity of terrestrial rocks to meteorites increases as we penetrate deeper

into the earth's crust, and that some of the deep-seated minerals have a
composition and characteristics almost identical with meteorites [olivine,

herzolite, and serpentine, for instance, closely resemble them] ; that as we

approach tlie surface, rocks having similar components with meteorites are

found, but in a state of oxidation, which necessarily much modifies their
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        --

mineral character, and which, by involving secondary oxygenized compounds,

mustalsochangetheirchemieal constitution. By experiments he has succeeded

in forming from terrestrial rocks substances very much resembling meteorites.

Thus close relationship, though by no means identity, is established between

this earth and those wanderers from remote regions, some evidence, though
at present incomplete, of a common origin.

Surprise has often been expressed that, while the mean specific gravity of

this globe is from five to six times that of water, the mean specific gravity of

its crust is barely half as great. It has long seemed to me that there is no

ground for wonder here. The exterior of our planet is to a considerable

depth oxidated ; the interior is in all probability fi-ee from oxygen, and what-

ever bodies exist there are in a reduced or deoxidated state, if so, their specific

gravity must necessarily be higher than that of theii- oxides or chlorides, &c.:

we find, moreover, that some of the deep seated minerals have a higher

specific gravity than the average of those on the surface ; olivine, for instance,

has a specific gravity of 3'.3. There is therefore no a priori improbability that

the mean specific gravity of the earth should notably exceed that of its

surface ; and if we go further and suppose the interior of the earth to be

formed of the same ingredients as the exterior, minus oxygen, chlorine,

bromine, &c., a specific gravity of 5 to 6 would not be an imlikely one.

Many of the elementary bodies entering largely into the formation of the

--earth's crust areas lighter lighter than water, for instance, potassium, so-

dium, &c.; others, such as sulphur, silicon, aluminium, have from two to three

times its specific gravity ; others, again, as iron, co^jper, zinc, tin, seven to

nine times ; while others, lead, gold, platinum, &c., arc much more dense,

but, speaking generally, the more dense are the least numerous. There seems

no improbability in a mixtiu-e of such substances producing a mean specific

gravity of from 5 to 6, although it by no means follows, indeed the proba-

bility is rather the other way, that the proportions of the substances in the

interior of the earth are the same as on the exterior. It might be Avorth the

laboiir to ascertain the mean specific gravity of all the known minerals on the

earth's surface, averaging them in the ratios in which, as far as our know-

ledge goes, they quantitatively exist, and assuming them to exist -ndtho^it the

oxygen, chlorine, &c., with wliich they are, A^'ith some rare excejjtions,

invariably combined on the surface of the earth : great assistance to the know-

ledge of the probable constitution of the eartli might be derived from such an

investigation.

While chemistry, analytic and synthetic, thiis aids us in ascertaining the

relationship of our planet to meteorites, its relation in composition to other

planets, to the sun, and to more distant suns and systems is aided by another

science, vi'i. optics.

That light passing from one transparent medium to another should carry

with it evidence of the soiu'ce from which it emanates, would, untU lately, havo

seemed an extravagant supposition                                                                                                                                                   but  probably (could  we  read it)  every-
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

thing contains in itself a large portion of its own history.

   I need not detail to you the discoveries of Kirchhoff,Eunsen,MiUcr,Huggins,

and others, they have been dilated on by my predecessor. Assuming tliat

spectrum analysis is a rehable indication of the presence of given substances
by the position of transverse bright lines exhibited M-hcn they are burnt and

of transverse dark lines when light is transmitted through their vapours,
though Plucker has shown that with some substances these lines vary Avith

temperature, the point of importance in the view I am presenting to you is,
that while what may be called comparatively neighbouring cosmical bodies

exhibit linos identical with manj- of those shown by the components of this
planet, as Ave proceed to the more distant appearances of the nebulas we get
but one or two of such lines, and we get one or two new bands not yet iden-
tified with any known to be produced by substances on this globe.

   Within the last year Mr. Huggins has added to his former researches
observations on the spectrum of a comet (comet 1 of 1S6G), the nucleus of
which shows but one bright line, while the spectrum formed by the light of
the coma is continuous, seeming to show that the nucleus is gaseous while
the coma would consist of matter in a state of minute division shining by
reflected light : whether this be solid, liquid, or gaseous is doubtful ; but tlie
author thinks it is iu a condition analogous to that of fog or cloud. The
position in the spectrum of the bright line furnished by the nucleus is the
same as that of nitrogen, which also is shown in some of the nebulae.

    But the most remarkable achievement by spectrum analysis is the record
of observations on a tcmporaiy star which has shone forth this year in the

constellation of the northern crown about a degree S.E. of the star e. When
it was first seen. May 12th, it wa.s nearly equal in brilliancy to a star of the
second magnitude ; when observed by Mr. Huggins and Dr. MUler, May IGth,

it was reduced to the third or fourth magnitude. Examined by these
observers with the spectroscope, it gave a spectrum which they state was
unlike that of any celestial body they had examined.

    The light was compound and had emanated from two different sources.
One spectrum was analogous to that of the sun, viz., formed by the light of
an incandescent sohd or Licjuid photosphere which had suffered absorption by
the vapours of an envelo]3e cooler tlian itself. The second spectrum consisted
of a few lu'ight lines, which indicated that the light by which it was formed
was emitted by matter in the state of luminous gas. They consider that, from
the position of two of the bright lines, the gas must be probably hydrogen,
and from their brilliancy compared with the light of the photosphere the gas
must have been at a vcrj' high temperature. They imagine the phenomena to
result from the burning of hydrogen with some other element, and that from

the resulting temperature the photosphere is heated to incandescence.
    There is strong reason to believe that this star is one previously seen by

Argelander and Sir J. Herschel, and that it is a variable star of long or irre-
gular period ; it is also notable that some of its spectrum lines correspond
with those of several variable stars. The time of its appearance was too
short for any attempt to ascertain its parallax ; it would have been important
if it could even have been established that it is not a near neighbour, as the
magnitude of such a phenomenon must depend upon its distance. I forbear
to add any speculations as to the cause of this most singular phenomenon
however imperfect the knowledge given us by these observations, it is a great
triumph to have caught this fleeting object, and obtained permanent records

for the use of future observers.

    It would seem as if the phenomenon of gradual change obtained towards
the remotest objects with Avhich we are at ijresent acquainted, and that the
further we penetrate into space the more unlike to those we are acquainted

--with become the objects of our examination, sun, planets, meteorites, earth

similarly though not identically constituted, stars diftering from each other
and from our system, and nebiilae more remote in space and differing more in
their characters and constitution.

    While we thus can to some extent investigate the physical constitution of
the most remote visible substances, may we not hope that some further insight
as to the constitution of the nearest, viz. our own satellite, may be given us

by this class of researches ? The yiiesiiuu \vhether the inoou possesses any

atmosphere may still be regarded as unsolved. If there be any, it must be
excecdiuglj small in quantity and highly attenuated. Calculations, made

from occultation of stars, on the apparent differences of the scmidiameter of

the bright and dark moon give an amount of diiference ·which might indicate
a minute atmosphere, but which Mr. Airy attributes to irradiation.

   Supposing the moon to be constitiited of similar materials to tlie earth, it
must be, to say the least, doubtful whether there is oxygen enough to oxidate
the metals of which she is composed ; and if not, the surface Avhich we see must
be metallic, or nearly so. The appearance of her craters is not unlike that
seen on the surface of some metals, such as bismuth, or, according to Professor

Phillips, silver, Avlieu cooling from fusion and just previous to solidifying ; and
it might be a fair subject of inquiry whether, if there be any coating of oxide

on the surface, it may not be so thin as not to disguise the form of the con-
gealed metallic masses, as they may have set in cooling from igneous fusion.
M. Chacornac's recent observations lead him to suppose that many of the

limar craters were the result of a single explosion, which raised the surface
as a bubble and deposited its debris around the orifice of eruption.

   The eruptions on the surface of the moon clearlj- did not take place at one
period only, for at many parts of the disk craters may bo seen encroaching
on and disfiguring more ancient craters, sometimes to the extent of three or

four successive displacements : two important questions might, it seems to me,
be solved by an attentive examination of s\ich portions of the moon. Bj' ob-
serving carefully with the most powerful telescopes the character of the ridges

thus successively formed, the successive states of the lunar surface at different

epochs might be elucidated ; and sccondlj-, as on the earth we should look for

actual volcanic action at those points where recent eruptions have taken place,
BO on the moon the more recently active points being ascertained h\ the suc-
cessive displacement of anterior formations, it is these points which should be
examined for existing disruptive disturbances. Metius and Fabricius might
be cited as points of this character, having been found by M. Chacornac to
present successive displacements and to be perforated by numerous channels
or cavities. M. Chacornac considers that the seas, as they are called, or
smoother portions of the lunar surface have at some time made inroads on
anteriorly formed craters ; if so, a large portion of the surface of the moon
miist have been in a fused, liquid, semiliquid, or alluvial state long after the
solidifying of other portions of it. It would be difficult to suppose that this
state was one of igneous fusion, for this could hardlj* exist over a large part
of the surface witliout melting up the remaining parts ; ou the other hand,
the total absence of any signs of water, and of any, or, if any, only the most
attenuated, atmosphere, would make it equally difficult to account for a largo

diluvial formation.

   Some substances, like mercury on this planet, might have remained liquid
after others had solidified ; but the problem is one which needs more exami-
nation and study before any positive opinion can be pronounced.

    I cannot pass from the subject of lunar physics M'ithout recording the obli-

gation we arc under to our late President for his most valuable observations
and for his exertion in organizing a band of observers devoted to the exami-
nation of this our nearest celestial neighbour, and to Mr. Xasmyth and Mr.
De la Hue for their important graphical and photographical contributions to
this subject. The granular character of the sun's surface observed by Mr.

Before quitting the subject of Astronomy I cannot avoid expressing a feeling

of disappointment that the achromatic telescope, which has rendered such

notable service to this science, still retains in practice the great defect which
was known a centnry ago at the time of Hall and DoUond, namely, the inac-

curacy of definition arising from what was termed the irrationality of the

spectrum, or the incommensurate divisions of the spectra formed by flint

and crown glass.

The beautiful results obtained by Blair have remained inoperative from the

cii'cumstance that evaporable liquids being employed between the lenses,

a want of permanent imiformity in the instrument was experienced ; and
notwithstanding the high degree of perfection to which the grinding and

polishing object-glasses has been brought by Clarke, Cooke, and Mertz, not-

withstanding the greatly improved instrumental manufacture, the defect to

which I have adverted remains imremedied and an eyesore to the observer

with the refracting telescope.

We have now a large variety of different kinds of glass formed from

Adifferent metallic oxides.                                             list of many such was given by M. Jacque-

lain a few years back ; the last specimen which I have seen is a heavy

highly refracting glass formed from the metal thallium byM. Lamy. Among

all these could no two or three be selected which, having appropriate re-

fracting and dispersing powers, would have the coloured spaces of their

respective spectra if not absolutely in the same proportions, at aU events
much more nearly so than those of flint and crown glass '? Could not, again,

oily or resinous substances, such as castor oil, cauada balsam, &c, having much

action on the more refrangible rays of the spectrum, be made use of in com-

bination with glass lenses to reduce if not annihilate this signal defect ? This

is not a problem to the solution of which there seems any insuperable diffi-

culty ; the reason why it has not been solved is, I incline to think, that the

great practical opticians have no time at their disposal to devote to long ten-

tative experiments and calculations, and on the other hand the theoretic

opticians have not the machinery and the skill in manipulation requisite to

give the appropriate degree of excellence to the materials with which they

experiment                                            yet  the  result  is worth labouring  for,  as, could  the  defect  be
                                                   ;

remedied, the refracting telescope would make nearly as great an advance

upon its present state as the achromatic did on the single lens refractor.

   "While gravitation, physical constitution, and chemical analysis by the
spectrum show us that matter has similar characteristics in other worlds than

our own, when we pass to the consideration of those other attributes of

matter which were at one time supposed to be peculiar kinds of matter itself,

or, as they were called, imponderables, but which are now generally, if not
universally, recognized as forces or modes of motion, we find the evidence of

continuity still stronger.

  When all that was known of magnetism was that a piece of steel rubbed

against a particiilar mineral had the power of attracting iron, and, if freely

suspended, of arranging itself nearly in a line with the earth's meridian, it

seemed an exceptional phenomenon. When it was observed that amber, if

rubbed, had the temporary po^^'cr of attracting light bodies, this also seemed

something peculiar and anomalous. What are now magnetism and electricity ?

forces so universal, so apparently connected with matter as to become two of
its invariable attributes, and that to speak of matter not being capable of
being affected by these forces would seem almost as extravagant as to speak
of matter not being affected by gravitation.

So -with light, heat, and chemical affinity, not merely is every form of
--Ixii REPORT 18GG.

matter with which wo nro acquainted capable of manifesting all these modes

of force, but so-called matter supposed incapable of such manifestations would
to most minds cease to be matter.

   Fiu'tlicr than this it seems to me (though, as I have taken an active part
for many years, now dating from a quarter of a century, in promoting this
^dcw, I may not be considered an imptu'tial judge) that it is now proved tliat

all these forces are so invariably connected inter se and with motion as to be
regarded as modifications of each other, and as resolving themselves objec-
tively into motion, and subjectively into that something which produces

or resists motion, and which we call force.
   I may perhaps be permitted to rccal a forgotten experiment, which

nearly a quarter of a century ago I showed at the London Institution, an

experiment simple enough in itself, but which then seemed to me important

from the consequences to be deduced from it, and the importance of which

will be nrach better appreciated now than then.

  A train of multiplying wheels ended "with a small metallic wheel which,

when the train was put in motion, revolved with extreme rapidity against the
periphery of the next wheel, a wooden one. In the metallic wheel was

pliiced a small piece of phosphorus, and as long as the wheels revolved, the

pliosphorus remained unchanged, but the moment the last wheel was stopped
by moving a small lever attached to it, the phosphorus biirst into flame.

Mj object was to show that while motion of the mass continued, heat Avas

not generated, but that when this was arrested, the force continuing to ope-
rate, the motion of tlie mass became heat in the particles. The experiment

ditfcred from that of llumford's eannon-boring and Davy's friction of ice in
showing that there was no heat while the motion was unresisted, but that the

heat was in some way dependent on the motion being impeded or arrested.

We have now become so accustomed to this Aiew, that whenever we find

motion resisted we look to heat, electricity, or some other force as the

necessary and inevitable result.
    It would be out of place here, and treating of matters too familiar to the

bulk of ray aiidience, to trace how, by tlie labours of Oersted, Scebeck, Faraday,
Talbot, Dagucrre, and otliers, materials have been provided for the generaliza-

tion now laioAvn as the correlation of forces or conservation of energy, while

Davy, Eumford, Bcguin, Mayer, Joule, Helmlioltz, Thomson, and others

(among whom I woidd not name myself, were it not that I may be misimdcr-

stood and supposed to have abandoned all claim to a share in the initiation
of this, as I believe, important generalization) have carried on the work;
and how, sometimes by independent and, as is commonly the ease, nearly
simultaneous deductions, sometimes by progressive and accumidated disco-

A-erics, the doctrine of the reciprocal interaction, of the quantitative relation,

and of the necessary dependence of all the forces has, I think I may venture

to say, been established.
     If magnetism, be, as it is proved to be, connected with the other forces or

 affections of matter, if electrical currents always pi'oduce, as thej- are proved

to do, lines of magnetic force at right angles to their lines of action, mag-
 netism must be cosmical, for where there is heat and light, there is electricity
 and consequently magnetism. Magnetism, then, must be cosmical and not
merely terrestrial. Could we trace magnetism in other planets and suns as a

 force manifested in axial or meridional lines, l. e. in lines cutting at right
 angles the curves formed by their rotation round an axis, it would be a great

 step ; but it is one hitlierto unaccomplished. The apparent coincidences be-
tween the maxima and minima of solar spots, and the decennial or undecen-

nial periods of terrestrial magnetic intensity, though only empu-ical at pre-

sent, might tend to lead us to a knowledge of the connexion wo are seeking

and the President of the Eoyal Society considers that an additional epoch of
coincidence has arrived, making the fourth decennial period ; but some doubt
is thrown upon these coincidences by the magnetic observations made at
Greenwich Obsei-vatory. In a paper published in the ' Transactions of the
E.oyal Society,' 1863, the Astronomer Royal says, speaking of results ex-
tending over seventeen years, there is no appearance of decennial cycle in the
recurrence of great magnetic disturbances ; and Mr. Glaishcr last year, in the
physical section of this Association, stated that after persevering examination
he had been unable to trace any connexion between the magnetism of the
earth and the spots on the sun.

    Mr. Airy, however, in a more recent paper, suggests that currents of
magnetic force having reference to the solar hour arc detected, and seem to
produce vortices or circular disturbances, and he invdtes further cooperative
observation on the subject, one of the highest interest, but at present re-

maining in great obscuritj'.
    One of the most startling suggestions as to the consequence resulting from

the dynamical theory of heat is that made by Mayer, that by the loss of vix
viva occasioned by friction of the tidal waves, as well as by their forming,
as it were, a drag upon the earth's rotatoiy movement, the velocity of the
 earth's rotation must be gradually diminishing, and that thus, unless some
 undiscovered compensatory action exist, this I'otation must ultimately cease,

 and changes hardly calculable take place in the solar system.

    M. Delaunay considers that part of the acceleration of the moon's mean
 motion which is not at present accounted for by planetaiy distiu-bauces, to be
 duo to the gradual retardation of the earth's rotation ; to which view, after
 an elaborate investigation, the Astronomer Royal has given his assent.

    Another most interesting speculation of Mayer is that with which you are
 familiar, viz., that the heat of the sun is occasioned by friction or percussion
 of meteorites falling upon it : there are some difficulties, not perhaps in-

 superable, in this theory. Supposing such cosmical bodies to exist in suffi-
 cient numbers they woTild, as they revolve round the sun, fall into it, not as
 an aerolite falls upon the earth directly by an intersection of orbits, but by

 the gradual reduction in size of the orbits, occasioned by a resisting medium
 some portion of force would be lost, and lieat generated in space by friction
 against such medium ; when they arrive at the sun they would, assuming
 them, like the planets, to have revolved in the same direction, all impinge in
 a definite dii'ection, and we might expect to see some symptoms of such in
 the sun's photosphere ; but though this is in a constant state of motion, and
 the direction of these movements has been carefully investigated by Mr.
 Carrington and others, no such general direction is detected ; and M. "Paye,
 who some time ago wrote a paper pointing out many objections to the theory
 of solar heat being produced by the fall of meteoric bodies into the sun, has

 recently investigated the proper motions of sun-spots, antl believes he has re-

 moved certain apparent anomalies and reduced their motions to a certain re-
 gularity in the motion of the photosphere, attributable to some general action
  arising from the internal mass of the sun.

     It might be expected that comets, bodies so light and so easUy deflected
 from their course, would show some symptoms of being acted on by gravita-
 tion, were such a number of bodies to exist in or near their paths, as are
  presupposed in the mechanical theory of solar heat.

     Assuming the undulatory theory of light to be true, and that the motion
Ixiv                        REPORT ISGD.

wliieli consfitiites liglit is transmitted across the intorpknetary spaces by a

highly ehistic ether, theii, unless this motion is confiued to one direction,

unless there be no interference, imless there be uo viscosity, as it is now-
termed, in the mcdiiim, and consequently no friction, light must lose some-
thing in its progress from distant luminous bodies, that is to say, must lose

something as light ; for, as all reflecting minds arc now convinced that force
cannot be annihilated, the force is not lost, but its mode of action is changed.
If light, then, is lost as hght (and the observations of Stru-se seem to show this
to be so, that, in fact, a star maybe so far distant that it can never bo seen in
consequence of its luminous emissions becoming extinct), what becomes of the

transmitted force lost as light, but existing in some other form ? So with

heat : our sun, our earth, and planets are constantly radiating heat into
space, so in all probability arc the other suns, the stars, and their attendant

planets. AYhat becomes of the heat thus radiated into space ? If the uni-

verse have no limit, and it is difficult to conceive one, heat and light should

be everywhere uniform ; and yet more is given off than is received by each

cosmicai body, for otherwise night would be as light and as wann as day.

What becomes of the enormous force thus apparently non-recurrent in the

same form ? Does it return as palpable motion ? Does it move or contri-

bute to move suns and planets ? and can it be conceived as a force similar to

that which Newton speculated on as universally repulsive and capable of

Webeing substituted for universal attraction ?  are in no position at present

to answer such questions as these; but I know of no problem in celestial

dynamics more deeply interesting than this, and we may be no further re-

moved fi'om its solution than the predecessors of Newton were from the

simple dynamical relation of matter to matter which that potent intellect

detected and demonstrated.

Passing from extraterrestrial theories to the narrower field of molecular

physics, we find the doctrine of correlation of forces steadily making its way.

In the Bakerian Lecture for 186-3 Mr. Sor])y shows, not perliaps a direct

correlation of mechanical and chemical forces, but that when, either bjr solu-

tion or by chemical action, a cliange in volume of the resulting substance as

compared with that of its separate constituents is effected, the action of

pressure retards or promotes the cliange, according as the substance formed

Avould occupy a larger or a smaller space than that occupied liy its separate

constituents ; the application of these experiments to geological incjuiries as to

subterranean changes which may have taken jAnce under gi'eat pressure is

oindous, and we may expect to form compounds under artificial compression

Avhich cannot be found under normal pressure.

In a practical point of view the power of converting one mode of force into

another is of the highest importance, and with reference to a subject which

at present, somewhat prematurely perhaps, occupies men's minds, viz. the

prospective exhaustion of our coal-fields, there is every encouragement de-

rivable from the knowledge that we can at will produce heat by the expendi-
ture of other forces ; but, more than that, we may probably be enabled

--to absorb or store up as it were diffused energy for instance, Berthelot has

found that the potential energy of formate of potash is miich greater than that

of its proximate constituents, caustic potash and carbonic oxide. This change

may take place spontaneously and at ordinary temperatures, and by such

change carbonic oxide becomes, so to speak, reinvested with the amount of

potential energy which its carbon possessed before uniting witli oxygen, or,

in other words, the cai-bonic oxide is raised as a force-possessor to the place of

carbon by the direct absorption or conversion of heat from surrounding matter.
                           ADDRESS.     IxV

   Here we have, as to force-absorption, an analogous result to that of the for-

mation of coal from carbonic acid and water ; and though this is a mere illus-

tration, and may never become economical on a large scale, still it and similar
examjiles may calm apprehension as to future means of supplying heat,

should our pi-esent fuel become exhausted. As the sun's force, spent in
times long past, is now retui-ned to us from the coal which was formed by that
light and heat, so the sun's rays, which are daily wasted, as far as we are
concerned, on the sandy deserts of Africa, maj' hereafter, by chemical or

mechanical means, be made to light and warm the habitations of the denizens

of colder regions. The tidal wave is, again, a large reservoir of force hitherto

almost unused.

   The valuable researches of Prof. Tyndall on radiant heat afford many in-

stances of the power of localizing, if the term be permitted, heat which would

otlierwase be dissipated.

   The discoveries of Graham, by which atmospheric air, di-awn through films

of caoutchouc, leaves behind half its nitrogen, or, in other words, liecomes

richer by half in oxygen, and lience has a mucli increased potential energy,

not only show a most remarkable instance of physical molecular action,
merging into chemical, but afford us indications of means of storing iip force,
much of the force used in working the aspirator being capable at any

period, however remote, of being evolved by burning the oxygen with a com-

bustible.

   What changes may take place in our modes of applying force before the
coal-fields are exhausted it is impossible to predict. Even guesses at the

probable period of their exhaustion are uncertain. There is a tendency to

substitute for smelting in metallurgic processes, liquid chemical action, which

of course has the effect of saving fuel; and the v/aste of fuel in ordinary

operations is enormous, and can be much economized by akeady known pro-
cesses. It is true that we are, at present, far from seeing a practical mode
of replacing that granary of force the coal-fields ; but we may with confidence
rely on invention being in this case, as in others, born of necessity, when

the necessity arises.

   I will not further pursue this subject ; at a time when science and civiliza-
tion cannot prevent large tracts of country being irrigated by human blood in

order to gratify the ambition of a few restless men, it seems an over-refined
sensibility to occupy ourselves with providing means for our descendants

in the tenth generation to warm their dwellings or propel their locomo-

tives.

   Two very remarkable applications of the convertibility of force ha^'e been

recently attained by the experiments of Mr. "VVilde and Mr. Holz ; the former
finds that, by conveying electricity from the coUs of a magneto-electric ma-

chine to an electro-magnet, a considerable increase of electrical power may

be attained, and by appljiny this as a magneto-electric machine to a second,
and this in turn to a third electro-magnetic apparatus, the force is largely
augmented. Of course, to produce this increase, more mechanical force must
be used at each step to work the magneto-electric machines ; but provided
this be supplied there hardly seems a limit to the extent to which mechanical

may be converted into electrical force.

Mr. Holz has contrived a Franldinic electrical machine, in which a similar

Aprinciple is manifested.  varnished glass plate is made to revolve in close

proximity to another plate having two or more pieces of card attached, which
are electrified by a bit of rubbed glass or ebonite ; the moment this is effected
a resistance is felt by the operator who turns the handle of the machine, and

1866.                                e
--Ixvi
REPORT 1866.

 tlie slight temporary electrization of the card converts into a continuous

flood of intense electricity the force supplied by the arm of the operator.
    These results offer great promise of extended apjjlication ; they show that,

by a mere formal disposition of matter, one force can be converted into an-
other, and that not to the limited extent hitherto attained, but to an extent
coordinate, or nearly so, with the increased initial force, so that, by a mere
change in the arrangement of apparatus, a means of absorbing and again

eliminating in a new form a given force may be obtained to an indefinite
extent. As we may, in a not very distant future, need, for the daily uses of

mankind, heat, light, and mechanical force, and find our present resources

exhaiisted, the more we can invent new modes of conversion of forces, the
more prospect we have of practically supplying such want. It is but a month

from this time that the greatest triumph of force-conversion has been attained.

    The Atlantic Telegraph is an accomplished fact.
    In physiology very considerable strides are being made by studying the
relation of organized bodies to external forces ; and this branch of inquiry has
been promoted by the labours of Carpenter, Bence Jones, Playfair, E. Smith,
Frankland, and others. Vegetables acted on by light and heat, decompose
water, ammonia, and carbonic acid, and transform them into, among other
substances, oxalate of lime, lactic acid, starch, sugar, steariue, urea, and
ultimately albumen ; while the animal reverses the process, as does vegetable
decay, and produces from albumen, urea, stcarine, sugar, starch, lactic acid,
oxalate of lime, and ultimately ammonia, water, and carbonic acid.
    As, moreover, heat and light are absorbed, or converted in forming the syn-
thetic processes going on in the vegetable, so conversely heat and sometimes
light is given off by the living animal ; but it must not be forgotten that the
line of demarcation between a vegetable and an animal is difficult to draw,
that there are no single attributes which are peculiar to either, and that it is
only by a number of characteristics that either can be defined.

   The series of processes above given may be simulated by the chemist in
his laboratory ; and the amount of labour wliich a man has undergone in the
course of twenty-four hours may be approximately arrived at by an exami-

nation of the chemical changes which have taken place in his body, changed
forms in matter indicating the anterior exercise of dynamical force. That
muscular action is produced or supported by chemical change would probably

now be a generally accepted doctrine ; but while many have thought that

muscular power is derived from the oxidation of albuminous or nitrogenized
substances, several recent researches seem to show that the latter is rather
an accomiDaniment than a cause of the former, and that it is by the oxidation
of carbon and hydrogen compounds that muscular force is supplied. Traube
has been prominent in advancing this view, and experiments detailed in
a paper published this year by two Swiss professors, Drs. Fick and Wislicenus,
which were made by and upon themselves in an ascent of the Faulhoni, have
gone far to confii'm it. Having fed themselves before and during the ascent,
upon starch, fat, and sugar, avoiding all nitrogenized compounds, they found
that the consumption of such food was amplj- sufficient to supply the force

necessaiy for their expedition, and that they felt no exhaustion. By appro-
priate chemical examination they ascertained that there was no notable
          ;

ADDRESS.  Ixvii

increase in the oxidation of the nitrogenized constituents of the bodj-. After
calculating the mechanical equivalents of the combustion effected, they then

state, as their first conclusion, that " The burning of protein substances cannot

be the only source of muscular power, for we have here two cases in which
men performed more measurable work than the equivalent of the amount of

heat, which, taken at a most absurdly high figure, could be calculated to
result from the burning of the albumen."

   They fiu'ther go on to state that, so far from the oxidation of albuminous
substances being the only source of muscular power, " the substances by the
biirning of which force is generated in the muscles, are not the albuminous
constituents of those tissues, but non-nitrogenous substances, either fats or

hydrates of carbon," and that the burning of albumen is not in any way

concerned in the production of muscular power.

  We must not confuse the question of the food which forms and repairs

muscle and gives permanent capability of muscular force with that which sup-
plies the requisites for temporary activity ; no doubt the carnivora are the
most powerfully constituted animals, but the Chamois, Gazelle, &c., have great
temporary capacity for muscular exertion, though their food is vegetable ; for
concentrated and sustained energy, however, they do not equal the carnivora

and with the domestic graminivora we certainly find that they are capable of
performing more continuous work when supplied with those vegetables which

contain the greatest quantity of nitrogen.

   These and many similar classes of research show that in chemical in-
quiries, as in other branches of science, we are gradually relieving ourselves

of hypothetical existences, which certainly had the advantage that they might

be varied to suit the requirements of the theorist.
    Phlogiston, as Lavoisier said with a sneer, was sometimes heavy, sometimes

light ; sometimes fire in a free state, sometimes combined ; sometimes passing
throiigh glass vessels, sometimes retained by them ; which by its protean
changes explained causticity and non-causticity, transparency and opacity,
colours and their absence. As phlogiston and similar creations of the mind
have passed away, so with hypothetic fluids, imponderable matters, specific
ethers, and other inventions of entities made to vary according to the re-

quirements of the theorist, I believe the day is approaching when these will
be dispensed with, and when the two fundamental conceptions of matter and

motion will be found sufficient to explain physical phenomena.
   The facts made knowni to us by geological inquiries, while on the one

hand they aff'ord striking evidence of continuity, on the other, by the breaks

in the record, may be used as arguments against it. The gi'eat question

once was, whether these chasms represent sudden changes in the formation

of the earth's crust, or whether they arise from dislocations occasioned since

the original deposition of strata or from gradual shifting of the areas of sub-

mergence. Few geologists of the present day would, I imagine, not adopt
the latter alternatives. Then comes a second question, whether, when the

geological formation is of a continuous character, the different characters of

the fossils represent absolutely permanent varieties, or may be explained by

gradual modifying changes.

   Prof. Ansted, summing up the evidence on this head as applied to one

--division of stratified rocks, writes as follows : " Pateontologists have endea-

voured to separate the Lias into a number of subdivisions, by the Ammonites,
a roups of species of those shells being characteristic of different zones. The

evidence on this point rests on the assumption of specific differences
being indicated by permanent modifications of the structure of the shell.

                                                                                   e2
                        ;

Ixviii  --REPORT 1866.

But it is quito possible that these may mean nothing more than -wovld be due

to some change in the conditions of existence. Except between the Marl-
stone and the Upper Lias there is really no pala^ontological break, in the
proper sense of the words ; alterations of form and size consequent on the
occurrence of circumstances more or less favourable, migration of species, and

other well-known causes sufficiently account for many of those modifications

of the form of the shell that have been taken as specific marks. This view is
strengthened by the fact that other shells and other organisms generally
show no proof of a break of any importance except at the point already

aUudedto."
   But, irrespectively of another deficiency in the geological record, which will

be noticed presently, the physical breaks in the stratification make it next to

impossible to fairly trace the order of succession of organisms by the evidence
afforded by their fossil remains. Thus there are nine great breaks in the
PalfBozoic series, four in the Secondary, and one in the Tertiary, besides those
between Palajozoic and Secondary and Secondary and Tertiary respectively.
Thus in England there are sixteen important breaks in the succession of strata,

together with a number of less important interruptions. But although these
breaks exist, we find pervading the worlis of many geologists a belief, re-

sulting from the evidence presented to their minds, sometimes avowed,
sometimes unconsciously imphcd, that the succession of species bears some

definite relation to the succession of strata. Thus Prof. Eamsay says

that " in cases of superposition of fossiliferous strata, in proportion as the
species are more or less continuous, that is to say, as the break in the suc-
cession of life is partial or complete, so was the time that elapsed between

the close of the lower and the commencement of the upper strata a shorter or a

longer interval. The break in life may be indicated not only by a difference

in species, but yet more importantly by the absence of older and appearance

of newer allied or unallied genera."
    Indications of the connexion between cosmical studies and geological re-

searches are dawning on irs : there is, for instance, some reason to believe that

we can trace many geological phenomena to our varying rotation round the

Sim ; thus more than thirty years ago Sir J. Herschel proposed an explanation
of the changes of climate on the earth's surface as evidenced by geological

phenomena, founded on the changes of excentricity in the earth's orbit.

   He said he had entered on the subject " impressed with the magnificence

of that view of geological revolutions which regards them rather as regular
and necessary efforts of great and general causes, than as resulting from a
series of convulsions and catastrophes regulated by no laws and reducible to

no fixed principles."

    As the mean distance of the earth from the sun is nearly invariable,
it would seem at first sight that the mean animal supply of light and heat

received by the earth would also be invariable ; but according to his calcula-
tions it is inversely proportional to the minor axis of the orbit : this would
give less heat when the excentricity of the earth's orbit is approaching to-
wards or at its minimum, ilr. CroU has recently shown reason to believe
that the climate, at aU events in the circumpolar and temperate zones of

the earth, would depend on whether the winter of a given region occurred

--when the earth at its period of greatest excentricity was in aplielion or

perihelion if the former, the annual average of temperature would be lower

if the latter, it would be higher than when the excentricity of the eartli's
orbit were less or approached more nearly to a circle. He calculates the
diffei'ence in the amount of heat at the period of maximum excentricity of the
                                                                                                  ;;

                                                                  ADDRESS.                                                 Ixix

earth's orbit to be as 19 to^2G, according as the winter would take place wbeu
the earth was in aphelion or in perihelion. His reason may be briefly stated
thus : assuming the mean annual heat to be the same, whatever the excen-
tricity of orbit, yet if the extremes of heat and cold in winter and summer
be greater, a colder climate vnH prevail, for there will be more snow and ice

--accumulated in the cold winter than the hot summer can melt a result, aided

by the shelter from the sun's rays, produced by the vapour suspended in
consequence of the aqueous evaporation ; hence we should get glacial periods,
when the orbit of the earth is at its greatest excentricity, at those parts of the
earth's surface where it is winter when the earth is in aphelion ; carboni-
ferous or hot periods where it is Avinter in perihelion ; and normal or tem-
perate periods when the excentricity of orbit is at a minimum ; all these would
gradually slide into each other, and would produce at long distant periods

alternations of cold and heat, several of which we actually observe in geo-

logical records.

   If this theory be borne out, we should approximate to a test of the time

which has elapsed between different geological epochs. Mr. CroU's compu-

tation of this would make it certainly not less than 100,000 years since the

--last glacial epoch, a time not very long in geological chronology probably it

is much more.

   When we compare with the old theories of the earth, by which the

apparent changes on its surface were accoimtcd for by convulsions and

cataclysms, the modern view inaugurated by LyeU, your former President, and

now, if not wholly, at all events to a great extent adopted, it seems strange

that the referring past changes to similar causes to those which are Jiow in

operation should have remained iminvestigated until the present century

but Math this, as mth other branches of knowledge, the most simple is fre-

quently the latest view which occurs to the mind. It is much more easy to
invent a Deux ex macliind than to trace out the influence of slow continuous
change ; the love of the marvellous is so much more attractive than the
patient investigation of truth, that we find it to have prevailed almost uni-

versally in the early stages of science.

   In astronomy we had crystal spheres, cycles, and epicycles ; in chemistry

mysterious fluid could knock down a steeple. In geologj' a deluge or a volcano

was supplied. In palaeontology a new race was created whenever theory

required it : how such new races began, the theorist did not stop to inquire.

  A curious speculator might say to a palaeontologist of even recent date, in

the words of Lucretius,

physically arrived ou this earth. Whence did he come ? did ho fall from tho

sky (i. e. from the interplanetary space) ? did he rise moulded out of a mass
of amorphous earth or rock ? did he appear out of the cleft of a tree ? If he
had no antecedent progenitors, some such beginning must be assigned to

him." I know of no scientific writer who has, since the discoveries of

geology have become familiar, ventured to present in intelligible terms any

definite notion of how such an event could have occurred : those who do not
adopt some view of continuity are content to say God willed it ; but would it
not be more reverent and more philosophical to inquire by observation and

eSperimeut, and to reason from induction and analogy, as to the probabilities

of such frequent miraculous interventions ?

   I know I am touching on delicate ground, and that a long time may elapse

before that calm inquiry after truth which it is the object of associations like
this to promote can be fully attained ; but I trust that the members of this

body are sufficiently free from prejudice, whatever their opinions may be, to
admit an inquiry into the general question whether what we term species

are and have been rigidly limited, and have at numerous periods been created
complete and unchangeable, or whether, iji some mode or other, they have not
gradually and indefinitely varied, and whether the changes due to the infiu-
ence of surrounding circumstances, to efforts to accommodate themselves to
surroiTuding changes, to what is called natural selection, or to the necessity

of yielding to superior force in the struggle for existence, as maintained by
our illustrious countryman Darwin, have not so modified organisms as to

enable them to exist under changed conditions. I am not goijig to put for-
ward any theory of my own, I am not going to argue in support of any

special theoiy, but having endeavoured to show how, as science advances,
the continiiity of natural phenomena becomes more apparent, it would be
cowardice not to present some of the main arguments for and against con-

tinuity as applied to the history of organic beings.

   As Ave detect no such phenomenon as the creation or spontaneous genera-
tion of vegetables and animals which are large enough for the eye to see
without instrumental assistance, as we have long ceased to expect to find a

Plesiosaurus spontaneously generated in our fish-pond, or a Pterodactjdc in
our pheasant-cover, the field of this class of research has become identified

with the field of the microscope, and at each new phase the investigation has
passed from a larger to a smaller class of organisms. The question whether
among the smallest and apparently the most elementary forms of organic
life the phenomenon of spontaneous generation obtains, has recently formed

the subject of careful experiment and animated discussion in France, If it
could be found that organisms of a complex character were generated with-
out progenitors out of amorphous matter, it might reasonably be argued that
a similar mode of creation might obtain in regard to larger organisms.

Although we see no such phenomenon as the formation of an animal such as

an elephant, or a tree such as an oak, excepting from a parent which
resembles it, yet if the microscope revealed to ns organisms, smaller but
equally complex, so formed without having been reproduced, it would render
it not improbable that such might have been the case with larger organic
beings. The controversy between M. Pasteur and M. Pouchct has led to a
very close investigation of this subject, and the general opinion is that when
such precautions are taken as exclude from the substance submitted to
experiment all possibility of germs from the atmosphere being introduced,
as by passing the air which is to support the life of the animalculse through
tubes heated to redness and other precautions, no formation of organisms

takes place. Some experiments of Dr. Child's, communicated to the lloyal

Society during the last year, again throw douht on the negative results

obtained by M. Pasteur ; so that the question may be not finally determined,

but the balance of experiment and opinion is against spontaneous generation.

One argument presented by M. Pasteur is well worthy of remark, viz. that

in proportion as our means of scrutiny become more searching, heterogeny,

or the development of organisms without generation from parents of similar

organism, has been gradually driven from higher to lower forms of hfe, so

that if some apparent exceptions still exist they are of the lowest and

simplest forms, and these exceptions may probably be removed, as M. Pasteur

considers he has removed them, by a more searching investigation.

If it be otherwise, if heterogeny obtains at all, all wiU now admit that at

present the result of the most careful experiments shows it to be confined to

the most simple organic structures, such as vibrions and bacteria, and that all

the progressive and more highly developed forms are, as far as the most en-

larged experience shows, generated by reproduction.

The great difficulty which is met with at the threshold of inquiry into the

origin of species, is the definition of species ; in fact species can hardly be

defined without begging the question in dispute.

Thus if species be said to be a perseverance of type incapable of blending

itself with other types, or, which comes nearly to the same thing, incapable

of producing by union with other types oflPspring of an intermediate cha-

racter which can again reproduce, we amve at this result, that whenever

the advocate of continuity shows a blending of what had been hitherto

deemed separate species, the answer is, they were considered separate species

by mistake, they do not now come under the defiuition of species, because

they interbreed.

The line of demarcation is thus ex hypothesi removed a step further, so

that, unless the advocate of continuity can, on his side, prove the whole

question in dispute, by showing that all can directly or by intermediate

varieties reproduce, he is defeated by the definition itself of species.

 --On the other hand, if this, or something in fact amounting to it, be not

the definition of species if it be admitted that distinct species can, imder

certain favourable conditions, produce intermediate offspring capable of re-

production, then continuity in some mode or other is admitted,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      j
   The question then takes this form. Are there species or are there not ?

Is the word to be used as signifying a real, natural distinction, or as a mere

convenient designation applied to subdi\isions having a permanence which
wiU probably outlive man's discussions on the subject, but not an absolute

fixity? The same question, in a wider sense, and taking into consideration
a much longer time, would be applicable to genera and families.

Actual experiment has done little to elucidate the question, nor, imless we

can suppose the experiments continued through countless generations, is it

Welikely to contribute much to its solution.  must therefore have recourse

to the enlarged experience or induction from the facts of geology, palaeon-

tology, and physiology, aided by analogy from the laws of action which

nature evidences in other departments.

The doctrine of gradual succession is hardly yet formularized, and though

there are some high authorities for certain modifications of such view, the

preponderance of authority would necessarily be on the other side. Geology

and palaeontologj' are recent sciences, and we cannot teU what the older

authors would have thought or written had the more recently discovered

facts been presented to their view. Authority, therefore, does not much help

us on this question.
                                                                                   ;

Ixxii                       --KEFOKT 1866.

Geologicfil discoveries seemed, in the early period of the science, to show

complete extinction of certain species and the appearance of new ones, great

gaps existing between the characteristics of tlic extinct and the new species.

As science advanced, these were more or less filled np ; the apparent dif-

ficulty of admitting nnhmitcd modification of species would seem to have

arisen from the comparison of the extreme ends of the scale where the inter-

mediate links or some of them were wanting.

To suppose a Zoophyte the progenitor of a Mammal, or to suppose at some

particular period of time a highly developed animal to have come out of

nothuig, or suddenly grown out of inorganic matter, would appear at first

sight equally extravagant hypotheses. As an efi'ort of Almighty creative

power, neither of these alternatives presents more difiiculty than the other

but as we have no means of ascertaining how creative power worked, but by

an examination and studj- of the works themselves, we are not lilcely to get

Acither side proved to ocular demonstration.  single phase in the progress

of natural transmutation would probably require a term far transcending all

that embraced by historical records ; and on the other hand, it niiglit be said,

sudden creations, though taking place frequently, if viewed with reference to

the immensity of time involved in geological pei-iods, may be so rare v.'ith

reference to our experience, and so difficult of clear authentication, that the

non-observation of such instances cannot be regarded as absolute disproof of

their possible occurrence.

The more the gaps between species are filled up by the discoveiy of inter-

mediate varieties, the stronger becomes the argument for transmutation and

the weaker that for successive creations, because tlie former view then

becomes more and more consistent with experience, the latter more discor-

dant from it. As undoubted cases of variation, more or less permanent, from

given characteristics, are produced by the effects of climate, food, domestica-

tion, (fcc, the more species are increased by intercalation, the more the di-

stinctions slide down towards those which are within the limits of such

observed deviations ; while on the other hand, to suppose the more and more

frequent recurrence of fresh creations oiit of amorphous matter, is a multipli-

cation of miracles or special interventions not in accordance with what we

see of the uniform and gradual progress of nature, either in the organic or

inorganic world. If we were entitled to conclude that the progress of dis-

covery would continue in the same course, and that species would become

indefinitely multiplied, the distinctions woidd become infinitely minute, and

all lines of demarcation Avould cease, the polygon would become a circle, the

succession of points a line. Certain it is that the more we observe, the more
we increase the subdivision of species, and consequently the number of these

supposed creations; so that new creations become innumerable, and yet of these
we have no one well- authenticated instance, and in no other observed opera-

tion of nature have we seen this want of continuity, these frequent ^cr salium

deviations from uniformity, each of which is a miracle.
   The difficiilty of producing intermediate offspring from what arc termed

distinct species and the infecundity in many instances of hybrids are used as

strong arguments against continuity of succession ; on the other hand, it

may be said long-continued variation through countless generations has given

rise to such differences of physical character, that reproduction is difiicult in

some cases and in others impossible.

MSuppose, for instance,     to represent a parent-race whose offspring by

successive changes through cons of time have divaricated, and produced on
the one hand a species A, and on the other a species Z, the changes here have

been so great that we should never expect directly to reproduce an interme-

A A Ydiate between and Z.
                            and E on the one hand, and and Z on the

other, might reproduce ; but to regain the original tj'pe M, we must not only

retrooede through all the intermediates, but must have similar circumstances

recalled in an inverse order at each phase of retrogression, conditions which

it is obviously impossible to fulfil. But though among the higher forms of

organic structure we cannot retrace the effects of time and reproduce inter-

mediate types, yet among some of the lower forms we find it difficult to

assign any line of specific demarcation ; thus as a result of the very elabo-

rate and careful investigations of Dr. Carpenter on Foraminifera, he states,

" It has been shown that a very wide range of variation exists among Orbito-

lites, not merely as regards external form, but also as to plan of development
and not merely as to the shape and aspect of the entire organism, but also
Avith respect to the size and configuration of its component parts. It Avould
have been easy, by selecting only the most divergent types from amongst the
whole series of specimens which 1 have examined, to prefer an apparently

substantial claim on behalf of these to bo accounted as so manj- distinct

species. But after hanng classified the specimens which could bo arranged

around these types, a large proportion would yet have remained, cither pre-
senting characters intermediate between those of two or more of them, or

actually combining those characters in different parts of their fabric ; thus
showing that no lines of demarcation can be drawn across any part of the

scries that shall definitely separate it into any number of groups, each cha-

racterized by features entirely peculiar to itself."

  --At the conclusion of his inquiry he states,

   I. The range of variation is so great among Foraminifera as to include not
merely the differential characters \\hich system atists proceeding upon the

ordinary methods have accovmlcd specific, but also those upon which the

greater part of the genera of this group have been founded, and even in some

instances those of its orders.

   II. The ordinary notion of species as assemblages of individuals marked

out from each other by definite characters that have been genetically trans-

mitted from original proto-types similarly distinguished, is quite inapplicable

to this groTip ; since even if the limits of such assemblages were extended so
as to include what elsewhere would be accounted genera, they would still be

found so intimately connected by gradational links, that definite lines could

not be drawn between them.

III. The only natural classification of the vast aggregate of diversified

forms which this group contains will be one which ranges them according to

their direction and degree of divergence from a small number of principal

family tj^^es; and any subordinate grouping of genera and species which

may be adopted for the convenience of clesciiption and nomenclature must

be regarded merely as assemblages of forms characterized by the nature and

degree of the modifications of the original type, which they may have respec-
tively acquired in the course of genetic descent from a common ancestry.

   IV. Even in regard to these family types it may fairly be questioned

whether analogical evidence does not rather favour the idea of their deriva-

tion from a common original than that of their primitive distinctness.
   Mr. H. Bates, when investigating " The Lepidoptera of the Amazon Valley,"

may almost be said to have witnessed the origin of some species of Butterflies,

so close have been his observations on the habits of these animals that have

led to their variation and segregation, so closely do the residts follow his

observations, and so great is the difficulty of otherwise accounting for any

of the observed facts.

In the numerous localities of the Amazon region certain gregarious species

of Butterfly (Heliconidea) swarm in incredible numbers, almost outnumbering

aU the  other                                                   butterflies in  the  neighbourhood                                                                  the  species  in  the  diff'erent
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

locahties being different, though often to be distinguished by a very slight

shade.

   In these swarms are to be found, in small numbers, other species of butter-

flies belonging to as many as ten diflferent genera, and even some moths

and these intruders, though they structurally differ in toto from the swarms

they mingle with, and from one another, mimic the HeHconideae so closely in

colours, habits, mode of flight, &c., that it is almost impossible to distinguish the

intruders from those they mingle with. The obvious benefit of this mimicry

is safety, the intruders hence escaping detection by predatory animals.

Mr. Bates has extended his observations to the habits of life, food, varia-

tions, and geographical range of the species concerned in these mimetic phe-

nomena, and finds in every case corroborative evidence of every variety and

species being derivative, the species being modified from place to place to suit

the peculiar form of Heliconidea stationed there.

Mr. Wallace has done similar ser\dce to the derivative theory by his obser-

vations and writings on the Butterflies and Birds of the Malay Archipelago,

adducing instances                                              of  mimetic resemblances strictly analogous to the                                                                         above
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and adding in further illustration a beautiful series of instances where the

form of the wing of the same butterfly is so modified in various islets as to

produce changes in their mode of flight that tend to the conservation of the

variety by aiding its escape when chased by birds or predacious insects.

   He has also adduced a multitude of examples of geographical and repre-

sentative species, races, and varieties, forming so graduated a series as to

render it obvious that they have had a common origin.

The effect of food in the formation and segregation of races and of certain

groups of insects has been admirably demonstrated by Mr. B. D. Walsh, of

North America.

Dr. M'^Donnell has been led to the discovery of a new organ in electric

fishes from the application of the theory of descent, and Dr. Fritz Miiller

has published numerous observations showing that organs of veiy different

structure may, through the operation of natural selection, acquire very

similar and even identical fimctions. Sir John Lubbock's diving hymeno-

pterous insect affords a remarkable illustration of analogous phenomena ; it
dives by the aid of its wings, and is the only insect of the vast order it belongs

to that is at all aquatic.

The discovery of the Eozoon is of the highest importance in reference to

the derivative hypothesis, occurring as it does in strata that were formed

at a period inconceivably antecedent to the presupposed introduction of life

upon the globe, and displacing the argument derived from the supposition

that at the dawn of life a multitude of beings of high organization were

simultaneously developed (in the Silurian and Cambrian strata).

Professor A. De CandoUe, one of the most distinguished continental bota-

nists, has, to some extent, abandoned the tenets held in his ' Geographic

Botanique,' and favours the derivative hypothesis in his paper on the varia-

tion of oaks                                                    following up a paper, by Dr. Hooker, on the oaks of Palestine,
                                                             ;

showing that some sixteen of them are derivative, he avows his belief that

two-thirds of the 300 species of this genus, which he himself describes, are

provisional only.

Dr. Hooker, who had only partially accepted the derivative hypothesis

propounded before the publication of ' The Origin of Species through Natural
ADDRESS.  IXXV

Selection,' at the same time declining the doctrine of special creation, has
since then cordially adopted the former, and illustrated its principles by
applying them to the solution of various botanical questions : first, in refer-
ence to the flora of Australia, the anomalies of which he appears to explain
satisfactorily by the application of these principles ; and, latterly, in reference

to the Arctic flora.
    In the case of the Arctic flora, he believes that originally Scandinavian

types were spread over the high northern latitudes, that these were driven

southwards during the glacial period, when many of them changed their

forms in the struggle that ensued with the displaced temperate plants ; that
on the returning warmth, the Scandinavian plants, whether changed or not,
were driven again northwards and up to the mountains of the temperate
latitudes, followed, in both cases, by series of preexisting plants of the tem-

perate Alps. The result is the present mixed Arctic flora, consisting of a
basis of more or less changed and unchanged Scandinavian plants, associated
in each longitude with representatives of the mountain flora of the more tem-

perate regions to the south of them.

   The publication of a previously totally unknown flora, that of the Alps of
tropical Africa, by Dr. Hooker, has afforded a miiltitude of facts that have

been applied in confirmation of the derivative hypothesis. This flora is found
to have relationships with those of temperate Eui'ope and North Africa, of
the Cape of Good Hope, and of the moimtains of tropical Madagascar and
Abyssinia, that can be accounted for on no other hypothesis, but that there
has been ancient climatal connexion and some coincident or subsequent slight
changes of specific character.

   The doctrine of Cuvier, every day more and more borne out by observation,
that each organ bears a definite relation to the whole of the individual, seems
to support the view of indefinite variation. If an animal seeks its food or
safety by climbing trees, its claws wiU become more prehensile, the muscles
which act upon those claws must become more developed, the body will become
agile by the very exercise which is necessary to it, and each portion of the
frame will mould itself to the wants of the animal by the eflTect on it of the

habits of the animal.

   Another series of facts which present an argument in favour of gradual
succession, are the phases of resemblance to inferior orders which the embryo
passes through in its development, and the relations shown in what is termedthc
metamorphosis of plants ; facts difiicult to account for on the theory of fre-
quent separate creations, but almost inevitable on that of gradual succession.
So also, the existence of rudimentary and eff'ete organs, which must either be
referred to a Jusiis naturce or to some mode of continuous succession.

   The doctrine of typical nuclei seems only a mode of evading the difficulty
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

experience does not give us the types of theoiy, and, after all, what are these

types ? It must be admitted there are none such in reality ; how are we led

to the theorj' of them ? simply by a process of abstraction from classified exist-
ences. Having grouped from natural similitudes certain forms into a class,

we select attiibutes common to each member of the class, and call the assem-

blage of such attributes a type of the class. This process gives us an abstract

idea, and we then transfer this idea to the Creator, and make Him start with
that which our own imperfect generalization has derived. It seems to me

that the doctrine of types is, in fact, a concession to the theory of continuity

or indefinite variability ; for the admission that large groups have common

chai'acters shows, necessarily, a blending of forms within the scope of the

group, which supports the view of each member being deriyed from some
Ixxvi                   --REPORT 1866.

other member of it : can it be asserted that the assigned limits of such groups

have a definite line of demarcation ?

   The condition of the earth's surface or, at least, of largo portions of it,
has for long periods remained substantially the same ; this would involve a

greater degree of fixity in the organisms which have existed during such

periods of little change than in those which have come into being during

periods of more rapid transition ; for, though rejecting catastrophes as the

general modus aijendi of nature, I am far from saying that the march of

physical changes has been always perfectly uniform.

   There have been doubtless what may be termed secular seasons, and there

have been local  changes of varying  degrees  of extent  and  permanence                                              from
                                                                                                                   ;

such causes organized beings would be more concentrated in certain direc-

tions than in others, the fixity of character being in the ratio of the fixity

of condition. This would throw natural forms into certain groups whicli

would be more prominent than others, like the colours of the rainbow, which

present certain predominant tints though they merge into each other by

insensible gradations.

While the evidence seems daily becoming stronger in favour of a derivative

hypothesis as applied to the succession of organic beings, we are far removed

from anything like a sufiicient number of facts to show that, at all events

within the existing geological periods capable of being investigated, there

has been any groat progression from a simj^ler or more embryonic to a more

complex tyjjc.

Prof. HiTxley, though inclined to the derivative hypothesis, shows, in the

concluding portion of his address to the Geological iSociety, 1862, a great

nunibcr of cases in which, though there is abundant evidence of variation,

there is none of progression. There are, however, several groups of Vertebrata

in which the endoskeleton of the older presents a less ossified condition

than that of the younger genera. lie cites the Devonian Ganoids, tlie Mcso-

zoic Lcpidostcidsc, the Pala?ozoic Sharks, and the more ancient Crocodilia

and Laccrtilia, and particularly the Pycnodonts and Labyrinthodonts, as

instances of this Avhcn compared Avith their more recent representatives.

The records of life on the globe may have been destroyed by the fusion of

the rocks, which would otherwise have preserved them, or by crystallization

after hydrothermal action. The earlier forms may have existed at a period

when this planet Avas in course of formation, or being segregated or

detached from other worlds or systems. We have not evidence enough to

speculate on the subject, but by time and patience we may acquire it.
   Were all the forms which have existed embalmed in rock, the question

would he solved ; but what a small proportion of extinct forms is so preserved,
and must be, if we consider the cii'cumstanccs necessary to fossilize organic

remains. On the dry land, unwashed by rivers and seas, when an animal

or plant dies, it undergoes chemical decomposition which changes its form ; it
is consumed by insects, its skeleton is oxidized and crumbles into dust. Of

the myriads of animals and vegetables which annually perish, we find hardly

an instance of a relic so preserved as to be likely to become a permanent

fossil. So again in the deeper parts of the ocean, or of the larger lakes, the few

fish there are perish and their remains sink to the bottom, and are there fre-

quently consumed by other marine or lacustrine organisms or chemically de-

composed. As a general rule, it is only when the remains are silted iip by

marine, fluviatile or lacustrine sediments that the remains arc preserved.

Geology therefore might be expected to kecj) for us mainly such organic

remains as inhabited deltas or the margins of seas, lakes, or rivers; here
          --

ADDRESS.  Ixxvii

and there an exception may occur, but the mass of preserved relics would be
those of creatures so situated : and so we find it, the bulk of fossil remains

consists of fish and amphibia, shell-fisli form the major part of the geological
museum, limestone and chalk rocks frequently consisting of little else than
a congeries of fossil shells. Plants of reed or rush-like character, fish Avhicli
are capable of inhabiting shallow waters, and saurian animals form another
large portion of geological remains.

   Compare the shell-fish and amphibia of existing organisms with the other
forms, and what a small proportion they supply ; compare the shell-fish and
amphibia of Palaeontology with the other forms, and what an overwhelming

majority they yield.

   There is nothing, as Prof. Huxley has remarked, Uke an extinct order of

Birds or Mammals, only a few isolated instances. It may be said the ancient

world possessed a larger proportion of fish and amphibia, and was more
suited to their existence. 1 see no reason for believing this, at least to any-

thing like the extent contended for ; the fauna and flora now in course of

being preserved for future ages would give tlio same idea to our successors.

   Crowded as Europe is with cattle, birds, insects, &c., how few are geologi-
cally preserved ! while the muddy or sandy margins of the ocean, the

estuaries, and deltas are yearly accumulating numerous cnistacea and mol-
lusca, with some fishes and reptiles, for the study of future palteontologists.

    If this position be right, then, notwitlistanding the immense number of pre-
served fossils, there must have lived an immeasurably larger niimber of unpre-
served organic beings, so that tlic chance of filling up the missing links, except
in occasional instances, is very slight. Yet where circumstances have remained
suitable for their preservation, many closely connected species are preserved

in other words, while the intermediate types in certain eases are lost, in

others they exist. The opponents of continuity lay all stress on the lost and

none on the existing links.

   But there is another difficulty in the way of tracing a given organism to
its parent form, which, from our conventional mode of tracing genealogies, is

never looked ixpon in its proper light.

   Where are we to look for the remote ancestor of a given form ? Each of

us, supposing none of our progenitors to have intermarried with relatives,

would have had at or about the period of the Norman Conquest upwards
of a hundred milUon direct ancestors of that generation, and if we add the
intonnediate ancestors, double that number. As each individual has a male
and female parent, we have only to multiply by two for each thirty years,

the average duration of a generation, and it will give the above result.

   Let any one assume that one of his ancestors at the time of the Norman
Conquest was a Moor, another a Celt, and a third a Laplander, and that
these three were preserved while all the others were lost, he would never
recognize either of them as his ancestor, he would only have the one-hundred

millionth of the blood of each of them, and as far as they were concerned

there would be no perceptible sign of identity of race.
    But the problem is more complex than that which I have stated ; at the

time of the Conquest there were hardly a hundred million people in Europe,
it follows that a great number of the ancestors of the 'propositus must have
intermarried with relations, and then the pedigree, going back to the time of
the Conquest, instead of being represented by diverging lines, would form a
network so tangled that no skill could unravel it ; the law of probabilities
would indicate that any two people in the same country, taken at hazard,

would not have many generations to go back before they would find a
Ixxviii  --REPORT 1866.

common ancestor, who probably, could they have seen him or her in the life,
had no traceable resemblance to either of them. Thus tM'o animals of a very
different form, and of what would be termed very different species, might
have a common geological ancestor, and yet the skill of no comparative

anatomist could trace the descent.

   From the long continued conventional habit of tracing pedigrees through
the male ancestor, we forget in talking of progenitors that each individual

has a mother as well as a father, and there is no reason to suppose that he
has in him less of the blood of the one than of the other.

   The recent discoveries in palaeontology show us that Man existed on this

planet at an epoch far anterior to that commonly assigned to him. The
instruments connected with human remains, and indisputably the work of

--human hands, show that to these remote periods the term civilization coidd

hardly be applied chipped flints of the rudest construction, probably, in the
earlier cases, fabricated by holding an amorphous flint in the hand and
chipping off portions of it by striking it against a larger stone or rock ; then,
as time suggested improvements, it would be more carefuUy shaped, and

another stone used as a tool ; then (at what interval we can hardly guess) it

--would be ground, then roughly polished, and so on, subsequently bronze

weapons, and, nearly the last before we come to historical periods, iron. Such

an apparently simple invention as a wheel must, in all probabilitj^, have been
far subsequent to the rude hunting-tools or weapons of war to which I have

alluded.

  A little stcp-by-step reasoning will convince the unprejudiced that what

we call civilization must have been a gradual process ; can it be supposed that
the inhabitants of Central America or of Egypt suddenly and what is called
instinctively built their cities, carved and ornamented their monuments ? if

not, if they must have learned to construct such erections, did it not take time

to acquire such learning, to invent tools as occasion reqidred, contrivances to

raise weights, rules or laws by which men acted in concert to effect the design ?

Did not all this require time ? and if, as the evidence of historical times shows,

invention marches with a geometrical progression, how slow must have been
the earlier steps ! If even now habit, and prejudice resulting therefrom, vested
interests, &c., retard for some time the general apphcation of a new invention,
what must have been the degree of retardation among the comparatively \\n-

educated beings which then existed ?

    I have of course been able to indicate only a few of the broad argiimenta
on this most interesting subject ; for detailed results the works of Darwin,
Hooker, Huxley, Carpenter, Lyell, and others must be examined. If I appear

to lean to the view that the successive changes in organic beings do not take
place by sudden leaps, it is, I believe, from no want of an impartial feeling

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

but if the facts are stronger in favour of one theoi-y than another, it would be
 an affectation of impartiality to make the balance appear equipoised.

    The prejudices of education and associations with the past arc against this
 as against all new views ; and while on the one hand a theory is not to be
 accepted because it is new and prima facie plausible, still to this assembly' I
 need not say that its running counter to existing opinions is not necessarilj'
 a reason for its rejection ; the onus j)rohandi should rest on those who advance
 a new view, but the degree of proof must differ with the nature of the subject.
 The fair question is, Does the newly proposed view remove more difficulties,
 require fewer assumptions, and present more consistency with observed facts

--than that which it seeks to supersede ? if so, the philosopher wiU adopt it,

 and the world will follow the philosopher after many days.
                                ADDRESS.                      Ixxix

It must be borne in mind that even if we are satisfied from a persevering

and impartial inquiry that organic forms have varied indefinitely in time,

the cmisa causans of these changes is not explained by our researches ; if it be

admitted that we find no evidence of amorphous matter suddenly changed
into complex structure, still why matter shoidd be endowed with the plasticity

by which it slowly acquires modified structure is imexplained. If we assume

that natural selection, or the struggle for existence, coupled with the tendency

of like to reproduce like, gives rise to various organic changes, still our re-

searches are at present uninstructive as to why like should produce Hke, why

acquired characteristics in the parent should be reproduced in the offspring.

Reproduction itself is stUl an enigma, and this great question may involve

deeper thoughts than it would be suitable to enter upon now.

Perhaps the most convincing argument in favour of continuity which could

be presented to a doubting mind would be the difl[iculty it would feel in

Whorepresenting to itself any per saltiim act of nature.      would not be

astonished at beholding an oak tree spring up in a day, and not from seed or

Weshoot ?  are forced by experience, though often miconsciously, to believe

in continuity as to aU effects noAV taking place ; if any one of them be ano-
malous we endeavour, by tracing its history and concomitant circumstances,

to find its cause, i. e. to relate it to antecedent phenomena ; are we then to

reject similar inquu-ies as to the past ? is it laudable to seek an explanation

of present changes by observation, experiment, and analogy, and yet repre-
hensible to apply the same mode of investigation to the past history of the

earth and of the organic remains embalmed in it ?
   If we disbelieve in sudden creations of matter or force, in the sudden

formations of complex organisms now, if we now assign to the heat of

the sun an action enabHng vegetables to live by assimilating gases and amor-

phous earths into growing structures, why should such effects not have taken
place in earher periods of the world's history, when the sun shone as now,
and when the same materials existed for his rays to fall upon ?

   If we are satisfied that continuity is a law of nature, the true exjiression
of the action of Almighty Power, then, though we may humbly confess our
inability to explain why matter is impressed with this tendency to gradual
structural formation, we should cease to look for special interventions of

creative power in changes which are difficult to understand, because, being

removed from us in time, their concomitants are lost ; we should endeavour
from the relics to evoke their history, and when we find a gap not try to

bridge it over with a miracle.

   If it be tnie that continuity pervades all physical phenomena, the doctrine
applied by Cuvier to the relations of the different parts of an animal to each
other might be capable of great extension. All the phenomena of inorganic
and organized matter might be expected to be so inter-related that the study
of an isolated phenomenon would lead to a knowledge of numerous other phe-
nomena with which it is connected. As the antiquary deduces from a monolith

the tools, the arts, the habits, and epoch of those by whom it is wrought, so
the student of science may deduce from a spark of electricity or a ray of light

the source whence it is generated ; and by similar processes of reasoning other

phenomena hitherto unknown may be deduced from their probable relation

with the known. But, as with heat, light, magnetism, and electricity, though

we may study the phenomena to which these names have been given, and
their mutual relations, we know nothing of what they are ; so, whether we
adopt the view of natural selection, of effort, of plasticity, &c., we know not
why organisms shoidd have this nisus formativus, or why the acquired habit

or exceptional quality of the individual shoixld reappear in the offspring.
IXXX  REPORT 1866.

    PhilosojAy ought to have no likes or dislikes, truth is her only aim ; hut if

a glow of admiration be permitted to a phj'sical inquirer, to my mind a far

more exquisite sense of the beautiful is conveyed by the orderly development,
by the necessary inter-relation and inter-action of each element of the cosmos,
and by the conviction that a bullet falling to the ground changes the dyna-
mical couditions of the viniverse, than can he conveyed by mysteries, by con-
vulsions, or by cataclysms.

   The sense of understanding is to the educated more gratifying than the
love of the marvcUous, though the latter need never be wanting to the nature-

seeker.

    But the doctrine of continuity is not solely applicable to physical inquiries.
   The same modes of thought which lead us to see continuity in the field of
the microscope as in the universe, in infinity downwards as in infinity up-

wards, will lead us to see it in the history of our own race ; the revolu-

tionary ideas of the so-caUed natural rights of man, and « priori reason-
ing from what are termed first principles, are far more unsound and
give us far less ground for improvement of the race tliau the study of the
gradual progressive changes arising from changed circumstances, clianged
wants, changed habits. Our language, our social institutions, our laws, tlio

constitution of which we are proud, are the growth of time, the product of

slow adaptations, resulting from continuous struggles. Ilappilj- in this
country, practical experience has taught us to improve rather than to remo-

del ; we follow the law of nature and avoid cataclysms.
   The superiority of Man over other animals inhabiting this planet, of civi-

lized over savage man, and of the more civihzed over the less civilized, is
proportioned to the extent which his thought can grasj) of the past and of the
future. His memory reaches further back, his cai^ability of prediction reaches

further forward in proportion as his knowledge increases. He has not only
personal memory which brings to his mind at will the events of liis indivi-

--dual life, he has history, the memory of the race ; he has geology, the his-

tory of the planet ; he has astronomy, the geology of other worlds. "Whence
does the conviction to which I have alluded, that each material form bears
in itself the records of its past history, arise? Is it not from the belief in
continuity ? Does not the worn hollow on the rock record the action of the
tide, its stratified layers the slow deposition by which it was formed, the

organic remains imbedded in it the beings living at the times these layers

were deposited, so that from a fragment of stone we can get the history of
a period myriads of years ago ? From a fragment of bronze we may get the
history of our race at a period antecedent to tradition. As science advances

our power of reading this history improves and is extended. Saturn's ring

may help us to a knowledge of how our solar system developed itself, for it
as surely contains that history as the rock contains the record of its own

formation.

   By this patient investigation how much have we already learned, which
the most civilized of ancient human races ignored ! While in ethics, in
politics, in poetry, in sculpture, in painting, we have scarcelj-, if at all,
advanced beyond the highest intellects of ancient Greece or Italj% how great
are the steps we have made in physical science and its applications !

   But how much more may we not expect to know ?
   We, this evening assembled. Ephemera as we are, have learned by trans-

mitted laboiir, to weigh, as in a balance, other worlds larger and heavier than

our own, to know the lengtli of their days and years, to measure their enor-
mous distance from us and from each other, to detect and accurately ascertain
                                                                                                                  '

                                      ADOKESS.                                                                            Ixxxi

the influence they have on the movements of our world and on each other,

and  to discover the  substances  of  which      they are  composed                                            may we     not
                                                                                                            ;

fairly hope that similar methods of reseai-ch to those which have taught us so

much may give our race further information, until problems relating not

only to remote worlds, but possibly to organic and sentient beings which may

inhabit them, problems which it might now seem wildly visionary to enunciate,

may be solved by progressive improvements in the modes of applying obser-

vation and experiment, induction and deduction ?

Second Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cave^'n, Devon-
   shire. The Committee consisting of Sir Charles Lyell^ Bart.,

   Professor Phillips, Sir John Luhisock, Bart., Mr. John Evans,

   Mr. Edwakd Vivian, and Mr. William Pengelly (Reporter).

In tlie Pirst Report of the Committee, presented to the Association at tlie
Meeting held at Eirmingham in 1865, it was stated that Kent's Hole is
situated in a small limestone hill about a mile eastward from Torquay

harbour ; that though it has been known from time immemorial, it did not
attract the attention of scientific inquii-ers until the year 1824 ; that it was
partially explored by the Ecv. Mr. M'Enery from 1825 to 1829, by Mr.

Godwin -Austen prior to 1840, and by the Torquay Natural History Society in

184G; and that all the explorers had been vmanimous in stating that they

found flint "implements," undoubtedly of human origin, mixed up with

remains of extinct animals, in the ordinarj- cave-earth, beneath the floor of

stalagmite.

   Having briefly narrated the circumstances which led to the exploration of
the cavern under the auspices of the British Assoieation, the Committee pro-
ceeded to state that they had selected for the commencement of their
researches the large Chamber into which the most southerly of the two

external entrances opens, having been guided in their selection by the acces-

sibility of the Chamber, and by the indispensable fact that the deposits it

--contained were certainly intact; that these deposits were, in descending

order 1st, huge blocks of limestone which had fallen from the roof, and
some of which were estimated to weigh 7 tons each ; 2nd, black mould or
mud, varying from '6 to upwards of 12 inches in thickness, and lying

between and beneath the limestone blocks ; 3rd, a stalagmitic floor, gra-
duating downwards into a firm stony breccia, and averaging at least a foot

in thickness; 4th, reddish ochreous loam, or "cave-earth," of unknown
depth, having incorporated within it a large number of angular fragments of

limestone lying- confusedly without anything like an approach to stratification

or symmetrical arrangement ; that blocks of limestone almost as large as those

overljdng the deposits were met with everywhere in the black mould, in the

floor of stalagmite, and in the cave-earth ; that though the stalagmite was
everywhere firmly attached to the walls, a few instances occurred in which it

did not extend quite across the Chamber, but that even in these exceptional

cases the line of demarcation between the black mould and the cave-earth was

sharp and well defined, there being no example of the commingling of the

two ; and that the presence of a calcareous drip was more or less traceable

throughout the cave-earth.

They then described, somewhat in detail, the mode of exploration which

had been followed uniformly from the beginning, and which rendered it easy

--to define accurately the position of every object of interest which had been

met with, that is to say, its distance in feet from the entrance of the
Chamber ; its distance in yards, right or left, from a " datum " line crossing
the middle of the Chamber from the entrance to the back wall ; and its

depth in feet below the base of the stalagmite, to the extent of 4 feet,

beyond w^hich the excavation had not been carried.

Proceeding to a very general, but by no means exhaustive description of

the contents of the various deposits, they stated that in the black mould

were found numerous well-rounded pebbles, consisting of various kinds

of rock, and probably derived from the neighbo\iring beaches ; whet-

stones                         pieces  of slate,  some of which  w^ere wrought into  curvilineal  shapes
                            ;                                                                                                ;

a spoon, a fibiila, a socketed celt, and other articles in bronze ; a large frag-

ment of a plate of smelted copper ; numerous pieces of pottery which, though
including one bit of Samian ware, were generally of a somewhat coarse

character ; a comb, a spoon, a chisel, and other objects formed of bone

spindle-whorls of various kinds of stone ;                       a few flint-flakes ;  charred    wood
                                                                                                                           ;

bones of various animals, such as the pig, deer, sheep, badger, fox, hare,

rabbit, small Rodents, bat, birds, and diff'erent kinds of fish; shells of diff'erent

species of Helix, as well as of many of the marme forms common on the

coast; and hazel-nuts, generally perforated at one end. That the few

remains yielded by the stalagmitic floor included charred wood, land and

--marine shells, and bones of various animals all probably of existing species.

That from the cave-earth had been exhumed a very large number of bones

of Hyana sjjelcea, Felis spela'a, Ursus s^eJceus, Rhinoceros tichorliinus, EJejphas

ITiimigeniiis, Fox, probably more than one species of Horse, and several species

of Deer ; that those of the Hyaena were the most numerous, after which,

those of the Horse and llhinoceros were, perhaps, about equally abundant

that the remains of the Mammoth were those of very young individuals*

that many of the bones occurred as fragments and mere splinters ; that a large

number of them were scored with the teeth-marks of various kinds of animals;

that some of the long bones were split longitudinally ; that some of those

found beneath the large blocks of limestone were in a crushed condition

that most of them were of a chalk-lilce whiteness, a few only being dis-

colom-ed ; and that they were all of greater specific gravity than those found
in the black mould. That lumps made up of cave-earth, small stones, com-

minuted bone, and matter of probably fajcal origin were numerous and widely

distributed. That, rejecting doubtful specimens and mere chips, nearly thirty

flint " implements " had been found in the undisturbed cave-earth, under

   * Some of the teeth, &c., of Elephas prmi^cnius found in the cavern by the early

explorers belonged to funy-growii animals.

precisely the same conditions as the bones of the extinct animals with which
they lay ; that, with the exception of three, they were all of the kind deno-
minated flakes, the excepted specimens being wrought to an edge all round
their perimeters ; that, like the bones, they were least numerous in the first
foot below the stalagmite ; and that those most elaborately wrought were

--found in the third and fourth foot-levels the greatest depth to which the

excavation had been carried.
    In conclusion, the Committee stated that, unlike Mr. M'Enery, they had

not succeeded in finding the remains of MacJiairodus latUIens or of Hipj)0])0-

tamus major, nor had they detected any part of the human skeleton either

in the cave-earth or in the overlying black mould, but that with these
exceptions they had confirmed aU the statements of the early explorers.

    During the twelve months which have elapsed since the First lleport, just
recapitulated, was drawn up, the Committee have carried on their labours
without interruption, the Superintendents have continued to visit the cavern
daily, the original rigorous methods of excavation and examination have been
itniformly followed, the results of each day's labour have been carefully
registered, and at the commencement of every month a lieport of progress
has been forwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, the Chairman of the Committee.

   The selected Chamber has been completely explored to the depth of 4 feet
below the stalagmite. It measures about 62 feet from east to west, and
something more than 30 from north to south. The limestone floor has been
reached in several places, but elsewhere the deposits descend through wide
fissures to probably considerable depths, and there is reason to believe that

beneath the limestone there arc extensive undervaultings.
    In the inner or back wall of the Chamber, almost due west from the

entrance, the workmen laid open the mouth of a Gallery, about 16 feet wide
and extending westward for a distance of 29 feet, where it suddenly tei'mi-
nates in a mere sht in the limestone rock. This Gallery has also been exca-
vated in the same manner and to the same depth as the Chamber.

  A comparatively narrow passage leads out of the Chamber northwards,

and must be traversed in proceeding, within the cavern, from one of the
external entrances to the other. Mr. M'Enery termed it the " Passage of
Urns," on account of the large amount of broken pottery which he there
found in the black mould above the stalagmite. Since the completion of the
exploration of the Gallery, the workmen have been occupied in excavating
this Passage, a work now almost completed.

   AU the investigations of the Committee have been carried on in virgin

ground. iN'o traces of the earlier researches have been encountered, the
deposits being everywhere indubitably intact.

   Several blocks of limestoiie overlying the black mould have been met with
in the Chamber and the Passage of Urns. Some of them were of great size,
and one greatly surpassed the largest of those mentioned in the First Report.
It measured 19| feet long, 9 feet broad, and 2| thick, or upwards of 430
cubic feet ; so that its weight must have exceeded 30 tons. In order to the
removal of this huge mass, it was necessary to blast it five times, each blast

being very successful.

   From their characters and positions, as well as from the condition of the

roof, it is obvious that, from time to time, the blocks were severed naturally
from the limestone strata, perhaps by the action of acidulated water along
planes of jointage, such planes being prevalent and well defined in the

                                                                            b2

Devonian rocks of the district generally. No such masses were found on the

floor of the Gallerj'.

    The overlying black mould previously mentioned was found everywhere
both in the Chamber and in the Passage of Urns; but not in the Gallery, except
quite at the entrance, where there was a mere trace. It has continued to
yield a large series of such articles as were mentioned in the First Report,
few of which require to be particularized. The most interesting additions to
 the collection from tliis deposit are a series of spindle-whorls, a polishing
 stone, and a portion of a cake of smelted copper.

    The whorls are six in number, and, unlike any of tliose mentioned in the
 First lleport, are all formed of slate. Four of them are highly finished, and
 two are somewhat elaborately ornamented, but in different styles or patterns.
 No two of them are of the same size. The ornamented two were found lying

 together. Mr. Franks, of the liritisli Museum, to whom they have been sub-

 mitted, states that " the pattern on one of them resembles that on British

  pottery."

     The " polishing stone " is a quadrantal fragment of an oblate spheroidal
 pebble of fine-grained qnartzite, probably derived, directly or indirectly, from
 the famous " pebblc-bcd " occurring in the Triassic cliff immediately west of
 Budleigh 8altcrton, about thirteen miles nortli-casterly from tlie cavern. One
  of the flattened or polar surfaces, and also one of those at right angles to it,
 formed by the fracture of the stone, have undergone a considerable amount of
  artificial polish, as if they had been used in grinding, sharpening, or polish-
 ing. The stone was found under a large block of limestone, measuring 18
  inches in thickness, and cemented with stalagmite to other such blocks.

     The piece of copper difl'ers from that mentioned in the Fii'st Ecport only in

  being smaller.

     Some of the pottery found recently is so rotten as scarcely to hear handling,
  and when placed in water it resolves itself into a coarse mud.

     As has been already observed, it was stated in the Eeport sent in last year
  that in a few instances the floor of stalagmite did not extend quite across
  the Chamber. Tliesc gaps entirely ceased at about 42 feet from the external
  entrance, so that in the innermost 20 feet of the Chamber, as well as through-
  out the entire GaUery, stalagmite occurred everywhere in unbroken continuity.

  Its level, however, instead of being uniformly the same, was, on the southern

  side of the Chamber, invariably somewhat lower than on the northern side.
  In other words, immediately in front or east of the Gallery, it suddenly sank
  below the general level which it attained elsewhere ; but was, nevertheless,
   perfectly continuous with that which covered the other parts of the Chamber,
  without any indication of a line of fracture or severance. The Gallery pos-
  sessed two such floors, or, as they were termed by way of distinction, a " floor"
   and a "ceiling." The former or lowermost, like that elsewhere, rested
   immediately on the red cave-earth, and towards its base gradually became
   a strong breccia. It varied from 3 inches to upwards of 2 feet in thickness,
   and was strictly a continuation of that part of the floor of the Chamber with

 --Avhich it was directly connected, and of which it was the immediate prolon-

   gation that part, in f;ict, just stated to have been somewhat below the
   common level. The " ceiling," or uppermost floor, was of greater thiclcness.
   It extended from wall to wall across the Gallery without further support than
  that furnished by its own inherent cohesion. Its level was that of the general
   or comparatively high floor of the Chamber of which it was a continuation.

   Indeed a vertical north and south section through it showed that, at the
                     ON KEXT S CAVERN, DEVONSHIRE.             5

northern side of the mouth of the Gallery, the floor of the Chamber bifurcated

and became two distinct floors, one above the other, and separated by an inter-

--space which varied from 6 inches to nearly 4 feet in height the uppermost

being the " ceiling," on the common level ; the lowermost the " floor," on the

level of the depressed portion in the southern part of the Chamber.
   Immediately above the " ceUing " there is in the limestone rock a consider-

--able alcove. This branch of the cavern, therefore, is divided into three stories

or flats that below the " floor," occupied with cave-earth ; that between the
" floor " and " cciHng," entirely unoccupied ; and that above the " ceiling,"

also without deposit of any kind.

The nether surface of the "ceiling" is of a beautifully stainless cream-

Whencolour, and sends do^vn a profusion of small stalactites.  fii'st disclosed,

the " ceiling " was siipposed to be a stratum of limestone in situ, completely

invested with a mere fllm of stalagmite. In order to determine its true

character, several holes were bored through it, when it was found to bo

--exclusively stalagmite throughout granular and comparatively soft in the

upper part, but highly crystalline towards the base.

The origin of this mass is not a little puzzling ; for whUst on the one hand

it seems necessary to suppose that it was formed on a basis, either of lime-

stone i)i situ or of dctrital matter mechanically accumulated ; on the other,

it is difficult to understand how this basis could have been removed so com-

pletely as to leave behind no trace of stone or bone. Sueili " ceilings " occur
iji the famous Brixham Cavern on the opposite shore of Torbay, but to their
lower surfaces there cling numerous stony and other relics of the deposits on

which they were moulded. After a careful study of the case, the Superin-

tendents of the exploration incline to the opinion that the "ceiling" was

formed as a floor on a deposit of fine earth which once filled the Gallery to

the necessary height, or, in other words, to the prevalent level of the deposit

in the adjacent Chamber; that this deposit, either by a considerable sub-
sidence or by being washed out, was completely detached from the floor which

overlay it ; and that subsequently a second and lower floor was formed in the
GaUery, and additions were made to both the upper and the lower sm'faees
of the " ceiling" or first floor. In support of this opinion, it may be stated

that the cream-coloured stalagmite forming the lower surface of the " ceiling,"
instead of being characteristic of the entire mass, is but a sort of " veneer,"

nowhere more than an inch thick. On being stripped off it is found that,

both in texture and in colour, it is strongly contrasted with the material to
which it was attached. The newly exposed sui-face, and the surface only,

has the exact colour of the cave- earth ; in fact it is soil-stained, and thus har-

monizes well with the hypothesis. Again, the abruptly truncated character of
its eastern end or commencement renders it not improbable that the " ceil-
ing " is a remnant of a floor which formerly extended eastward into the

Chamber, but which has there partially perished. Further, that a floor has

been destroyed, either wholly or partially, is conclusively proved by the fact
that a large number of fragments of stalagmite were met with, incorporated

in the existing floor and also in the cave-earth below, both in the Chamber

and in the Gallery.

   In each branch of the cavern yet explored, bones of various animals and
pieces of charred wood have been found in the stalagmite, but by no means

abimdantly. They have always been met with towards the base of the floor,

and generally in the brecciated portion of it. The statement made in the First

Report, that perhaps none of the animals represented in the stalagmite were
6 REPORT 1866.

extiuct, must be abandoned ; for several teetb of Jlycena spelcua, Rhinoceros

tichorhinus, and a species of Bear, probably Ursiis spelceus, have occurred in

--it within the last twelve months, and, with one exception, all of them in the

" floor " of the GaUery a fact of considerable interest in connexion with the

hypothesis that this floor is more modern than that found in the greater part

of the Chamber.

The ordinary red cave-earth, with a plentiful admixture of angular frag-

ments and blocks of limestone, has been met with everywhere beneath the

stalagmite. Nowhere has there been the least approach to stratification or

a symmetrical arrangement of materials. Nor has an instance occurred of

the black mould beneath the floor, or of its being commingled with the red

loam. In some localities the earth has been more, and in others less, abun-

dant than the stones. Indeed, in a very considerable portion of the Passage

of Urns the former was found very sparingly, the accumulation being almost

entirely small pieces and blocks of limestone lying loosely together. In such

cases the stalagmitic matter had occasionally infiltered between the stones to

a depth of from 1 to 2 feet, or even more, below its general level. Besides the

pieces of limestone, the red earth also contained fragments of rock neither

derivable from the cavern hiU nor, with the existing surface-configuration of

the district, capable of being carried into the cavern by natural agency. None

Aof them were angular, and most of them were weU rounded.  veiy large

proportion of them were pieces of diff"ercnt varieties of Devonian schistose

grit, prevalent in the district, and found in situ in Lincombe Hill, which,

immediately on the south-west, rises to the height of 372 feet above mean tide,

or upwards of 180 feet above the cavern entrances. Quartz -pebbles are also

more or less abundant, and, no doubt, were derived, commonly, from the vein-

stones which traverse the grits just mentioned. Amongst them, however,

there are one or two which, from the peculiarly vitreous aspect of the quartz,

Avere probablyderived from the ciystalline schists composing the southern angle

of Devonshire, and which, at their nearest approach, at the Start Point, are

upwards of fifteen miles from the cavern. Nor are these the only examples

of distantly derived materials, for weU-rolled flints are by no means rare, and

several examples of granitoid and other Dartmoor rocks have been met with.

Many of these fragments are too small to have served any useful purpose, so

that there is no probability of their having been selected by man. With the

exception of such as occur on the recent, as well as the raised, beaches on
the adjoining coasts, and occasionally in " pockets " and fissures in the lime-

stone hiUs, the nearest locality in which flints are found in situ is Milbern
Down, about five mUes distant, where, overlying beds of greensand, is a con-

siderable accumulation of supracretaceous gravel, mainly composed of flint and

Dartmoor detritus. There can be no doubt that the granitoid pebbles found

in the cavern were primarily derived from Dartmoor, which, where nearest,

is at a distance of not less than twelve miles. It is possible, however, that

these, and the rolled flint and fragments of vitreous quartz also, are relics of

gravel once widely spread over south-eastern Devonshire, and of which that
on Milbern Down, already mentioned, is the nearest existing remnant.

The uniform depth of foiu- feet below the base of the stalagmite, to which

the excavation of the cave-earth has been carried, by no means extends

everj^where to one and the same level. The lowest level reached is in the

GaUery, where the deposit presents some peculiar features. Whilst the first
and second foot-levels consisted of the ordinary red earth with the usual ad-

mixture of angular fragments of limestone, the third and fourth feet, though
UN Kent's cavurn^ Devonshire.  7

  not quite destitute of the red loam, were to a very large extent made up of
  the debris of the schistose grit, in the form of sand, small angular flakes, and

  pebbles occasionally 3 inches in diameter.
     As already stated, a large number of fragments of stalagmite were found

 embedded in the cave-earth. The first presented itself in the Chamber, at
  about 40 feet from the external entrance; and from tliis j^oint inwards to the
 extremity of the Gallery they were more or less abundant. In the Chamber
 they occurred chiefly, but not exclusively, in that southern portion of which
 the Galleiy may be regarded as the direct prolongation ; in other words, in
 that part where, if anywhere, the original ' stalagmitic floor had been de-
 stroyed and replaced by a more modern one. Some of these masses were of
 great size, occasionally.^measui-ing 5 feet long, 4 broad, and 4 deep, or 80
 cubic feet. They were generally composed of distinct laminae of highly

 crystalline prisms, having their longest axes at right angles to the plane of
 lamination. In one or two instances only were there any stony fragments
 incorporated within, or attached to, them. In the Gallery they were confined

 to the upper 2 feet of the deposit, but in the Chamber they occupied aU

 Anlevels alike. Portions of stalactite were also frequently met with.

 interesting case of this occurred at about 4 feet from the innermost end
 of the Gallery, where, within the first foot below the fioor, there lay a fine

 slab of old stalagmite, having incorporated vdthin it a fallen fragment of a
 conical pendant of stalactite, measuring 4 inches in diameter. Such ex-
 amples are wonderfully calculated to convince the observer that the time
 during which the cave-earth was accumulated, though probably very pro-
 tracted, was but a small portion of that represented by the entii'e history of

the cavern. The case just mentioned takes the mind back to a time when a
large stalactite, broken from the roof where it had slowly grown, fell on a
floor of stalagmite which, in process of sealing up a subjacent deposit of de-
trital matter, had attained the thickness of about an inch. The fallen mass

lay undisturbed where it fell, until the floor, increasing gradually, and with
periods of intermittence, to the thickness of 7 inches, succeeded in in-

vesting it completely. Subsequently, but how long cannot be determined,
the floor was brolten up by natural causes, and many of its fragments were
embedded in a new deposit. One of the broken masses, containing the

stalactite previously mentioned, was lodged in a comparatively narrow branch
of the cavern, and covered with about a foot of cave-earth. Over this accu-

mulation was formed a new floor of stalagmite, in which lay teeth of Ifyceiia
sjyelcea, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, and a species of bear. After this floor was
completed, a comparatively black muddy soil, averaging a foot in thickness,

was introduced.
   Though a large number of bones have been found since the First Report was

drawn up, they are by no means abundant everywhere. Thus remarkably
few were met with in the third and fourth foot-levels in the Gallery ; in
other words, they were almost cntiiely absent in that part of the deposit in
which cave-earth was but sparingly present. This is not ascribable to the
comparatively contracted character of the Gallery, or the distance from
the external entrances, for in the two upper feet they occurred in average
abundance ; indeed the last spadeful of true red loam found in the Gallery

contained a fine canine of Hijcemi spelcea. Again, in the Passage of Urns,
near, and lying between, the two external entrances of the cavern, where, as

has been stated, the deposit was almost exclusively made up of loose angular
fragments of limestone, there were but few bones, and the few which did
                                        --

occur lay in tlic small patclies of cave-earth -wliicli here and there, chiefly in
the lowest level, presented themselves. In sliort, though they occurred
almost exclusively in the higher levels of the Gallery and the lowest of the
Passa"e, in both they were found only -where the cave-earth was found.

Where the latter is present, but not elsewhere, bones may -with considerable

confidence be looked for.

   "Very many of the long bones have been split longitudinally, and, so far as
is known, all the bones thus split, as well as many others, are distinctly scored

--Avith teeth-marks probably those of the hyajna chiefly. It is difficult to

suiipose, either a priori or from an examination of them, that less than human

agency could have so divided them, and it is obvious that unless they were
gnawed soon after they were riven, they would scarcely be Avorth gnawing at

aU.

    So far as is at present known, the labours of the last twelve months have

failed to add a new species to the list of animals given in the First lleport.

llemains of Ilyajna still preponderate : the Horse and Ehinoceros are pro-
bably next in prevalence ; no bones of either Maohairodus, Hippopotamus, or

Man have yet been met with ; and, with one exception, the elephantoid relics

are those of small individuals. Three teeth of Elephant, probably EJcphas

^rrimiqenius, arc remarkable for their diminutiveness, even when compared
with the smallest of those mentioned last year. Indeed one of them is no
more than eight-tenths of an inch long. The others are somewhat larger,

but are interesting from being peculiarly narrow in proportion to their
lengths, and from their plates standing out in prominent ridges on the lateral
surfaces. They were all found in the fourth or lowest level, but in three

distinct parallels.

    Flint " implements " have been found in every branch of the cavern yet

--explored the Chamber, the Galleiy, and the Passage of Urns. In the last

they were just as numerous as in the other branches, occurring amongst the
loose stones, where bones failed to present themselves.

    Omitting mere chips and very inferior specimens, upwards of 70 " imple-
ments " have been found since the First lleport was drawn up, making,
with those mentioned last year, something more than 100 specimens since the
commencement of the exploration. About one-third of this total were met
with in each of the first and second foot-levels below the stalagmite, and
something more than one-sixth in the third foot. In short, up to this time,

--each level has been rather less productive than those above it a statement

 differing from the corresponding one of last year.

    The " implements " are divisible into three classes :
    1st. Mere ^rt/rf3, probably struck off in making the more finished tools, but
which, no doubt, would, from their sharp edges, be eminently useful for cut-

ting or scraping.

    2nd. Lanceolate " implements," pointed at one end and truncated at the

 other.

    3rd. Oval " implements," convex on both sides, and worked to an edge all

round the margin.
    The largest specimen of the first class is nearly 5 inches long, and

 in greatest breadth and thickness measures 2| inches and 1 inch
 respectively. It is a portion of a nodule of coarse-grained light-grey flint,
 and in one part retains the original unfractured surface. As in the case of
 several others of the same class, its edges are so sharj) and uninjured as to

 render it in the highest degree probable that it was struck off in the cavern,
ON Kent's caa^ern^ Devonshire.  9

and had neither heen used, nor exposed to the rolling or abrading action of
Avater in motion. It was found in the Chamhcr, 53 feet from the external
entrance, in the fourth foot-level below the stalagmite, which was from 12
to 15 inches thick and extended uninterruptedly for considerable distances

in every direction.

  --The lanceolate " implements " are of two kinds round-pointed and sharp-

pointed. They are widest near the posterior extremity, and one surface has

usually a central longitudinal ridge or keel, whilst the other is flat, or concave
lengthwise, but which, whether Hat or concave, appears almost invariably to
liave been produced at a single stroke. Of the round-pointed variety, a well-

formed specimen was found in the Chamber, 46 feet from the entrance, in the

upper part of the first level or foot of cave-earth, immediately below the
stalagmite, which, at this part, was from one and a half to three feet thick.
It measures about two inches long, and three-quarters of an inch broad ; it
is strongly carinated on one side, and longitudinally concave on the other.

A second and still finer " implement " measures nearly three and a half

inches long, rather more than one inch in greatest breadth, and four-tenths
of an inch thick. It diifers from the former in a few particulars. The cen-
tral longitudinal ridge, at about an inch and a half from the hinder end,
bifurcates symmetrically as if a small flake had been struck oft'. Hence the
carinated side has three distinct surfaces, each of which is very slightlj- con-
cave. There are several small facets, each produced, no doubt, by a separate
and wcU-directed gentle stroke on the rounded anterior extremity, which
seems too thick to render it probable that the "implement" could have been
 intended to be iised as a spear-head. Eut for these facets, the "implement,"
though beautifully and very symmetrically shaped, appears to have required no
more than four strokes for its formation ; but in order to do this, the fracture
must in each case have been remarkably clean. Indeed the beautiful smooth-
ness by which all the surfaces are characterized suggests a doubt as to whether

it may not have been produced by some degree of polishing. The small facets,

however, are perhaps scarcely in keeping with this hypothesis. Its posterior
extremity is not sharply truncated, but somewhat irregular, and both its
lateral margins are slightly broken. It was found very near the centre of
the Chamber, 2 feet deep in the red earth, and having over it a thick floor
of stalagmite. Like the specimen previouslj- described, it is formed of very

fine-grained flint of a light cream-colour. On one side it is longitudinally

concave.

    The " implements " belonging to the second variety differ from these not
only in being sharp-pointed, but in tapering more rapidly near the anterior
extremity, in terminating in a thinner point, near which the keel, instead of
being rectilineal, is gently curved, and the lateral margins, instead of being
symmetrical, are one slightly convex and the other concave, conforming, in
fact, to the deflection of the central ridge. In one specimen there are, on the
flat side and near the point, several very small marginal facets. This fine
" implement," or rather portion of one, is of whitened flint. It was found in
the Chamber, 48 feet from the entrance, in the third level, beneath a thick

floor of stalagmite.

    Amongst the lanceolate " implements " there is one sharply truncated at
 both ends, the point probably having been broken off. It is 3 inches long,
 but when entire must have measured another inch ; its greatest width some-
 what exceeds 1 inch. The flat side has been produced by a series of blows,
 and suggests the ideas that the stroke which detached the "implement"
--10 REPORT 1866.

from the flint core left this a somewhat irregular surface ; that a near approxi-
mation to flatness, and especially smoothness, on this side was essential to
the performance of the work for which the tool was to be used ; and that the
requisite character was produced by numerous minute chippiugs carefully
and skilfully directed. The obverse also contains evidence of a more than
usual amount of work. It has two somewhat irregular and rudely parallel
longitudinal ridges, as well as several facets. The lateral margins are not
quite symmetrical. It is formed of fine-grained flint, of a light lead-colour
inchning to whiteness ; and it was found in the Chamber, 49 feet from the
external entrance, 3 feet deep in the red deposit, and covered with a thick

stalagmitic floor.

   The only specimen of the thii'd or ovoid class found since the First
Eeport was lu'cscnted is quite the finest "implement" which has been
exhumed during the present exploration. It measures 4| inches long,

3| inches in greatest breadth, and about 1 inch in maximum thickness.

It is strictly oval in form, being wider at one end than at the other.
Like the fine "implements" of the same class described in the former Eeport,
it is formed of a somewhat coarse-grained greyish flint. The bilateral sym-
metry of its outline is sensibly perfect. Its opposite faces differ somewhat in
convexity ; each of tliem, and especially that Avhich is most convex, displays
a large amount of chipping. This splendid tool was found 55 feet from the
entrance, S feet from both the northern and the western wall of the Chamber,
in the fourth foot of cave-earth, or the lowest yet excavated, beneath stalag-
mite which was about a foot thick and extended without a break for several
yards in every direction ; and it was dug out in the presence of one of the

Superintendents and two gentlemen who accompanied him to the cavern.

   Besides the foregoing "implements," aU of which, as has been stated, were
found in the Chamber, there is one which was met with 8 feet from the inner
end of the GaUery, or 83 feet from the external entrance of the cavern ; and

--which seems to connect the lanceolate and ovoid classes, resembhng the first

in being pointed, and the second in being worked to an edge round its entire
perimeter. Its dimensions are less than those of any oval, and its breadtli,
in proportion to its length, exceeds that of any lance-shaped "implement"
which the cavern has yielded. It is 3 inches long, and in greatest breadth and
thickness measures an inch and three-quarters and four-tenths of an inch re-

spectively ; it is nearly an inch and a quarter wide at the broad end, attains its

maximum breadth about midway in its length, and has lost its extreme point.

It is formed of fine-grained flint of a cream-colour, and difl'ers from all the

other cavern " implements " in having what may be conveniently termed a

" varnished" or "glazed" surface. This "implement," which seems to have
experienced rough usage, was found in the second foot-level below the stalag-
mite, which, in the Gallery, as already stated, is the lowest composed of true

cave-earth.

    Though, as has been stated, the lower levels have, on the whole, yielded
fewer "implements" than the upper, it is stUl true that "those found in
the third and fourth levels are the most highly wrought ' implements,' " and
also that " those in the fourth or lowest zone are the most elaborately flnished
tools of the cavern series." In glancing over all that have been dug out

during the present exploration, it appears that whilst there are several inter-

esting tools from the first level, and a larger number from the second, neither
of these zones has yielded an ovoid " implement ;" that from the third belt
were exhumed the first oval and the two best lanceolate forms ; and that the

two oval tools found in the lowest level are very decidedly the most carefully
finished specimens which the cavern has yielded. In the present stage of the
investigation, the Committee think it neither desirable nor necessary to enter

into any arguments to prove the artificial character of at least many of the

flints which they have found. Indeed they speak for themselves ; and in
terms so unmistakeable that if they do not succeed in carrying con-s-iction to
the mind of the observer, any words that could be employed must certainly

fail also.

    It will be of interest, however, to call attention to certain other evidences

of human existence found in the cave-earth. As already remarked, it was

stated in the First Report that a whetstone had been found below the stalag-
mite. Very shortly after that Ilcport was drawn up a second stone was met
with, formed of a fragment of similar, though somewhat finer- grained, green-
ish grit. Its form is not quite the same as that of the first specimen. Mr.
Franks states that " it closely resembles some stones found in the Eruniquel
caves, in form and material." It was lying in the first level of cave-earth, 43
feet from the entrance, where the overlying stalagmite was 26 inches thick

and extended many yards in every direction.

    Several pieces of burnt bone were found in tlie cave-earth in the Gallery
some near the extreme, and others near its inner end. One of them was
fomid in the first, and one in the thii-d, but most of them in the second foot-
level. In each ease the deposit was overlain by a thick cake of stalagmite.
Burnt bones have been found in the red earth in several parts of the Chamber

also.

    In conclusion, the Committee would remark that the careful and unremit-
ting labour bestowed on the cavern during the last year and a half has pro-
duced a large accumulation of facts, consistent with one another and with
those recorded by the earlier explorers. Of the discoveries made, the uniform
testimony is that beneath a thick floor of stalagmite, so difficult to work as to
require excellent tools and untiring perseverance, there arc everywhere found,
inosculating with bones of extinct mammals, and undoubtedly inhumed at the

same time, human industrial remains, of a character so humble and so little

varied as to betoken a very low type of civilization.

Preliminary Report on the Chemical Nature of Cast Iron.

                  By A. MatthiesseNj F.R.S.

ly tlie Transactions of the British Association for 1863 it was pointed out, in
a " Report on the Chemical Nature of Alloys," that alloys may be, when in a

solid state,--

(1) Solidified solutions of the one metal in the other;

(2) Chemical combinations

(3)  Solidified mechanical mixtures
                                                                                                                            ;

(4) Or sohdified solutions of mixtures of any of these.

   It is important to clearly imderstand what is here meant by the term

" sohdified solution," for in speaking of alloys they are generally considered

to be either mechanical mixtures or chemical combinations. In the "Report
--

13 REPORT 18G6.

on the Chemical Nature of Alloys," I have defined the terms " solution of one
metal in the other, as one Hke that of ether and alcohol ; for these two liquids

may be mixed in any proportion, and they will not separate, by standing, into

two layers," and " solidified solutions as a most intimate mixture, such as
would occur in the sudden conversion of a solution of two liquids into a solid,

--and a much more intimate mixture than can be obtained by ordinary mecha-

nical means in fact a perfectly homogeneous diffusion of one body in another.

An excellent example of homogeneous diffusion is furnished by glass, which

is formed in a liquid state at a high temperature, and solidifies on cooling

Avithout separation of the different silicates."

   Before deducing the chemical nature of cast iron from what is already
known, it will be as well to compare the physical deportment of the alloys
of carbon and iron with that of other aUoys ; for instance, with those of tin
and copper, and zinc and copper. Pure u'on is said to be very malleable, so
is pure copper; iron alloyed with small quantities of carbon (malleable, wrought
iron) is less malleable and harder than the pure metal ; so is copper, when
alloyed with small quantities of tin or zinc, less malleable and harder than
the piirc metal. Iron alloj-ed with from 1 to 2 per cent, of carbon has

obtained its maximum state of hardness in conjunction with a certain

degree of malleability and ductility (steel) ; copper alloyed with certain
quantities of tin or zinc possesses similar properties, forming gun-metal

and brass.
   Again, increase the amount of carbon in the iron and the mass becomes

brittle and unworkable (cast iron) ; so also do the alloys of cojiper, and tin or

zinc, when the amount of the latter exceeds that contained in gun-metal or
brass by a few per cent.

    Leaving out of consideration the impurities of cast iron, let us first discuss

the alloys of carbon and iron, and these we find may bo divided into two

classes, viz. the white and the grey cast iron.

   Now the essential difference between these two forms is the state in which

the carbon exists in them. In the one (white) it is said to be chemically
combined with the iron, in the other (grey) mechanically mixed with the

iron. As these, the white and the grey iron, may be converted into one

another by re-fusion (for if certain sorts of white iron be fused at a low
temperature and allowed to cool slowly, grey will be produced, and conversely,
if grey iron be fused at a high temperature and cooled rapidly, white iron),

it follows that the chemical combination of carbon and iron may be made to

split up into its component elements simply by slowly cooling the molten mass.
Bearing on this point are the following experiments made by Karstcn : he took
a mass of cast iron and determined the amounts of so -called chemically com-
bined and uncombined (graphitic) carbon in it ; ho then melted it and cast it
in a mould, analyzed the outer and inner portion of it. The following are
the results he obtained :

                                  Carbon per cent.

                                  Combined. Uncombined.

   Now, can it be possible that the carbon is really chemically combined with

the outer portion of the casting and not in the inner ? if this be so, it is I

think the only case known of a chemical combination in which the elements
ON THE CHEMICAI, NATURE OF CAST IRON.  13

are so loosely held togcthei* that tiie various rates of cooling will determiuc
their combination or decomposition.

   From the analogy of tlic alloys of carbon and iron with other aUoys, it is

possible that the case is as follows ; namely, that the carbon and iron exist

--in the molten state as a solution of the one in the other when in the white

state as a sohdified solution of carbon iu iron, and when in the grey state as
a mechanical mixture of carbon and iron.

    If the above assumption be correct, then the conversion of white into grey

cast iron, and vice versa, may be easily explained ; for if in the liquid state the
carbon and iron be only a solution of carbon and iron, then we can easily
imderstand why the carbon, when the molten mass is heated to a high
temperature and cooled slowly, crystallizes out, and when cooled quickly, not

having time to crystallize out, remains homogeneously diffused through the
iron ; as it is very probable that molten iron will dissolve more carbon at
higher temijcratures than at lower ones.

    The two chief reasons for assuming that the carbon and iron exist in the

state of chemical combination are,

   (1) That when white iron is dissolved in dilute acids, the carbon combines

with the hydrogen, forming carburetted hj-drogen.
    (2) That different carbides of iron have been isolated.
    First, respecting the chemical behaviour of the carbon in the white

iron, the following remarks may be made. If it be assumed that the carbon

--in cast iron is homogeneously diffused through the mass, then it must be in

an exceedingly fine state of division in fact in just the state for combining

Avith other bodies; for it is well known that carbon as well as other sub-
stances possess properties, when in a state of fine division, which they do not
possess when in a more coherent form. Thus in the case of carbon, the more
porous it is the more active it becomes in dechlorizing liquids and absorbing

and condensing gases in its pores. Platinum is also a good example of this
fact ; in a dense form, as in foil, it only possesses the property of condensing
gases on its siirface to a very feeble extent ; in its spongy form it possesses
this property in a very marked degree, and as platinum-black possesses it to
 a far greater extent than the spongy modification.

    As another example of the influence of the chemical activity of bodies when
in a fine state of division, we may take the eases of iron, lead &c., these
metals, when in a coherent form, undergoing when exposed to the atmosphere
only a very slow oxidation, but when in a very fine state of division (reduced

 oxides) combining with oxygen instantly.
    The chemical behaviour of the constituents of alloys is sometimes diifei-ent

when in an alloy from what it is when alone ; thus platinum y^hon. alloyed
with silver dissolves to a certain extent in nitric acid. Now, taking the de-
 terminations of the eonducting-powers of alloys as a means of testing their

 cliemical constitution, I should with certainty say that there exists in the
 alloys of platinum with silver no chemical combination, for their observed
 and calculated eonducting-powers agree together better than for any other
series of alloys. The curves representing the eonducting-powers of the alloys
 of these metals with one another possess the typical form of the alloys of that
 class of metals to which these belong.

    2ndly. With regard to the definite chemical combinations which have been
isolated from cast u'on, it may be remarked that definite crystalline forms with

 alloys do not necessarily indicate chemical combinations. Cooke*, I believe,

                 * Memoirs of the American Academy (new series), vol. viii. p. 27.
----

14 REPORT 18G6.

was the first to point out this fact "with regard to alloys, in a paper on the

alloys of antimony and zinc. He showed that those containing 43 to 64 per

cent, of zinc all crystallize in the same foim, but differently from the other
alloys. With the alloys of gold and tin it has been shown* that well-de-
fined crystals are not limited to definite proportions of the constituents, but
are common to all gold and tin alloys containing from 27 to 43 per cent, of
gold; and that crystals and mother-liquor never are of the same composition.
Storer t has also experimentally proved that aU the copper and zinc alloys
crystallize in the same form.

    These facts show that the ciystaUine alloys of carbon and iron do not prove
the existence of chemical combination between them, more especially when
we consider that several definite crystalline compounds of carbon and iron
have been obtained. In all probability, by altering the conditions of cooling,

&c., crystals of iron containing various amounts of carbon may be obtained

from the same sample of cast iron. For the chemical combination theory of

cast iron we have
   (1) The evolution of carburetted hydi'ogens when white cast iron is treated

with dilute acids.
    (2 The existence of definite crystalline forms of carbon and iron.
    Against it
   (1) The analogy of the alloys of carbon and iron with the other aUoys.

   (2) The fact of carbon in such a fine state of division that it may exist in
white iron (solidified solution) and may be able to unite with hydrogen at
the moment of being set free (as in the case of platinum-silver alloys, where

a portion of the platinum is dissolved by nitric acid).

  We(3) know of no other case where with two elements the different rates

of cooling determine the chemical combination or decomposition (conversion
of white into grey and grey into white cast iron).

    (4) That with alloys definite crystalline forms are not necessarily chemical
combinations.

   That iron in a molten state will not dissolve more than about 5 ]ier cent, of
carbon is analogous to the cases of lead and zinc, bismuth and zinc, ii:ercury and
zinc. For it has been shown t that pure lead will only dissolve 1-0 per cent,
a pui-e zinc, and pure zinc 1 -2 per cent, of pure lead ; that pure zinc will
only dissolve 2-4 per cent, pure bismuth, and pure bismuth from 8-6 to 14-3

per cent, pure zinc§.

   Now, although no actual determinations have been made, we may stxppose

that the solvent power in the above-mentioned cases of the one metal for the
other at higher temperatures will be greater than at lower ones ; hence, for
instance, zinc (containing a small percentage of lead) might possibly be
made to crystallize from a molten alloy of lead and zinc, containing, say, from
2 to 2-5 per cent. zinc.

    Supposing the metals lead and zinc be melted together in equal parts,
what takes place ? The zinc (according to the temperature) takes up a cer-
tain amount of lead, and floats upon the lead which has taken up a certain
amount (according to the temperature) of the zinc. If these two alloys were

intimately mixed together (bj" stirring or shaking) and cooled rapidly, we

might suppose that under certain conditions an almost homogeneous mixtui-e

might be obtained ; or supposing we were rapidly to cool a solution of zinc

in lead, we should produce a solid mass similar to what we termed a solidified

solution.

    Again, if only a few per cent, of tin be added to the mixture, of, say, ten
parts zinc in lead, a perfect alloy will be formed.

   Applying these facts to the alloys of carbon and iron, we are led :

    (1) To look upon white iron (containing small percentages) as a solidified
solution of carbon and iron

                                                                                                                           ;

    (2) ^Tien containing larger percentages as a solidified solution of carbon
and iron, with carbon dilfused through the mass in a very fine state of divi-

sion
                    ;
    (3) "When containing large percentages of carbon, together with certain

other substances (manganese, to wit), as a solidified solution of carbon, iron,
and the other substances.

   And to look on the grey modification as a solidified solution of carbon and

ii'on, vnth. carbon (varying amounts of the graphitic modification) mechani-

cally intermixed.

   Another point in favour of the above may be mentioned, namely, that it
has been observed that the eonducting-power of the pure metal may be

deduced from that of the impure one, where the conducting-power of the
impure metal difi"ers from that of the pure one by not more than 20 per cent.
this has been foimd to hold good only in cases where solidified solutions

exist.

kinds of iron. The results obtained were as follows :

--16 REPORT 186G.

  --To see whether the above assumptions, as to the chemical nature of east

iron, are correct, it is proposed

   (1) To make some pure iron.
   (2) To alloy the pure iron with various amounts of carbon and to test the

physical and chemical properties of these alloj's.
   (3) To alloy the pure iron in ditferent proportions Avith other metals and

metalloids.

   From the forgoing considerations I expect to be able to produce analogous
alloys to iron and carbon with some of the other metals, having the peculiar
properties of cast iron, steel, and wrought iron ; and probably some may be
found to be much better adapted for certain purposes than the alloys of car-

--bon and iron for instance less liable to become crystalline by age, &c.

    (4) To alloy the pure iron with various amounts of carbon, and to add to
these alloys such substances as are found in the commercial irons so as to
study their respective effects on the physical and chemical nature of cast iron,
and more especially on their influence on the solvent power of iron for

carbon.

    It is intended to investigate carefully the action of dilute and strong acids

on the various alloys of iron and carbon, in order to see how far, and under
what conditions, the carbon is evolved as carburetted hydrogen.

   The experiments will be made on a small scale, fusion taking place in one
of De%ille's oxyhydi'Ogen furnaces, which gives an admirable means of experi-

menting with refractory metals.
   The pure ii'on will partly be prepared from the oxalate, and partly by the

electrotype process, and fused in lime crucibles.
   The experiments liave already been commenced, and I hope at the next

Meeting of the Association to report good progress.

Report on Observaiions of Luminous Meteors,\^Qo-(S(S. By aCommittee,

   consisting of James Glaisiier, F.R.S., of the Roijal Observatory,

    Greenwich, Secretary to the British Meteorological Society, S^c.

   Robert P. Greg, F.G.S., S^c. ; E. W. Brayley, F.R.S., S^c. ; and

   Alexander S. Herschel, B.A.

The Committee have the satisfaction to present in thcii' Report a marked

degree of progress over their success in former years. Observations of three
large meteors, at the Eoyal Observatory, Groen-n-ich, have been confirmed b}'
descriptions of observers at distant places, so that tlie height and velocity of
the meteors could be conclusively determined (Appendix I. 1, 2, 4) ; and the
accounts of meteors continually communicated bj- observers to the Committee
have led in other cases to obtaining the same satisfactory result.

   The Committee are particularly indebted to Mr. Warren De la Eue for a

collection of excellent descriptions of the detonating firebaU of the 21st of

November 1805, placed by Mr. "Warren De la Eue at the disposal of the Com-
mittee, by which the earth-distance, the velocity, and the direction of this

meteor in space could be determined.
   Exact determinations of the height, and other particulars of large meteors

in diiFerent parts of the globe, arc collected in this Ecport, following the

Catalogue, in Appendix II. llemarkablc statements regarding the large

detonating meteor which appeared over the Dover Straits on the forenoon of

the 20th of Juno 1S6G, with instrumental measui'emcuts of its ajiparcnt path

by Mr. Francis Galton, will he found in this Appendix.

The object of the Committee in providing star-charts to observers of the

meteoric shower of jS^ovember last, was attained ; and accurate observations

of luminous meteors under that date are presented in the Catalogue of the

lleport. The radiant-point of the meteoric shower, during the period of its

greatest activity, was situated within two degrees of the place which it oc-

cupied in the interval of the greatest meteoric activity of the same shower in

--the year 1833 a fact in itself demonstrative of the fixed uranographical

character of the phenomenon (Appendix IV. 2).
   The height of the November meteors is shown in this Eei)ort to be the

same as that of ordinary shooting-stars, or about sixty miles above the sur-

face of the earth ; Avhilst with regard to their speed, they are three times

swifter than those meteors which at the same time arrive from the direction

of the constellation Taurus.

Bearing in mind the strong probability that exists of the occurrence in the

present year of a more extraordinary meteoric shower, on the morning of the

]3th or on the morning of the 14th of November, than any that has yet been

observed at the English observatories, the Committee during the past year

judged it unadvisable to incur avoidable expense, or to exceed the means at
their command by lithographing the charts of general radiant-points of shoot-

ing-stars, exhibited two years ago at Bath, to the Meeting of the Ihitish

Association, and these they now suggest might be printed, and distributed

with advantage.

The occasion of the return of the great November shower being one of very

rare occurrence, the Committee, Avith the view of profiting by the opportunity

thus afforded of observing the spectra of luminous meteors, have this year pro-

vided themseves with spectroscopes, and have succeeded in aualj'zing the hght

of shooting-stars by means of their prismatic spectra. Two spectroscopes

were directed to be prepared by Mr. Browning, and were first used on the

AlUth of August last, and seventeen spectra were observed,  description of

the observations, together with the discovery of the yellow sodium-line as the

chief feature of tlie greater number of the train -spectra, will be found in the

last Appendix of tlic lieport.

                                   I. Meteors doubly obseryed.

                 (1.) 1865, September 24th, 7" 8TM 45^ p.m., G. M. T,

   The meteor observed at Greenwich, Kamsgate, and Hawkhiu'st (see Cata-
logue), commenced its course sixty-seven miles above the coast of France, in
the zenith of a place in N. lat. 49° 57', E. long. 2° 12', and disappeared

thirty-eight miles above the English Channel, in N. lat. 50° 26',_E. long. 0°
23'. Path ninety-one miles in four seconds, dii-ected from a point in E. A.
2°, N. Docl. 2°, near the first point of Aries. Velocity twenty-three miles

per second. The meteor is a good example, triply observed, of the group of
meteors directed from the radiant in Pisces or Cetus, described in the
Monthly Notices of the Eoyal Astronomical iSociety for December 9th, 1864.

                    (2.) 1865, September 24th, 8" 30" p.m., G. M. T.
   The meteor observed at Greenwich and at Manchester, at From e in Devon-
shire, and at Winchfield in Hants, commenced its course thu'ty-four miles in
the zenith of a place seven miles east of Bath, and disappeared thirty miles

above a point four miles south of Gloucester.

   The course of the meteor, prolonged onwards, would nearly touch lEan-
chester, where it was seen to descend with a slight inclination, and a short
course in the S.S.AV. This observation necessitates a small correction. The
course appears actually to have been from thirty-eight miles over Bath to

twenty-seven miles over Gloucester. Velocity twenty-four miles per second.
Path thirty-six miles in 1^ second, directed from some part of the C(mstellu-
tion Capricornus, not far from a point in right ascension 20'', south declination
30°, described by Dr. Neumayer, at Melbourne, as a point of the highest in-
terest, and deserving particular attention with the view of determining further

points of radiation.

                   (3.) 1865, September 26th, 8^ 55TM p.m., G.M.T.

   The meteor observed at Thirsk, in Yorkshu-e, and at Hawkhurst, com-
menced its course about 107 miles above a part of the North Sea, in N. lat.
54° 55', E. long. 2° 43', and disappeared seventy-six miles above the neigh-
bourhood of Sheineld. Path 200 miles in Si seconds. Velocity fifty- seven

miles per second. Direction from a point near Auriga, in right ascension 69°,
north declination 25°, This meteor is one of a group of meteors directed from

a radiant in Auriga, described in the last-mentioned Number of the Monthly

Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. It appears from this No., and
from No. 1 of this Appendix, that the velocity of the meteors from Auriga is
nearly three times as great as that of the meteors directed from Cetus or

Pisces.

    Notes of the meteor, seen by Mr. Harding, of the Eoyal Observatory, Green-

wich, on the evening of the 26th of September last, were received, first, from
Eastbourne, and second, from Weston-super-Mare, in Somersetshire. Over
the latter county it appears to have attained its greatest brilliancy ; but at
what altitude above the earth can only be roughly estimated from the obser-
vation at Eastbourne, compared with that near Greenwich. The height indi-
cated is from about fifty to about thirty miles above the surface of the earth.
The radiant-point, or direction of its flight, was from about the position
of Polaris, a region from which a wide group o| meteors take their course in

a remarkably definite manner during the month of August, and more especi-

ally in September.

                     (5.) 1865, November 13th, S^ 42TM p.m., G. M. T.

    The following account of the meteor is communicated by Mr. T. Crumplen.
" "When fii-st seen, it had the appearance of a star of the 3rd magnitude,

rapidly increasing in splendour until its maximnm light was at least equal to

three times that of the planet Venus. Numerous sparks were thrown off as

it passed along, the nucleus exploding just before it disappeared. Its flight

was certainly retarded during its passage ; it was visible over a large area,

obsei-vations having reached me from places as widely separated as Boulogne

and Market-Drayton.

   '· From these I conclude that the meteor was first seen about eighty miles
in the zenith of a place midway between Aylesbury and Stoney Stratford,
moving in a W.S.W. direction, passing south of Cirencester and just north of

--Cleveland, ending about the same height over Hartley Quay a path of some
--1G5 miles iu 2^ seconds. The velocity is certainly very great sixty-six miles

per second ; but I am convinced that it was not less. This will serve for a
sufficient indication of the height of these meteors, which we must consider

to be part of the great November zone."

   The height and velocity are both above the average. It should be borne

in mind that small errors of observation may sometimes lead to exaggerated

estimates, both of the height and velocity of a meteor's flight.

                           (6.) 1865, November 18th, 4" 30TM p.m.

   The appearance of the meteor seen in twilight by Mr. F. C. Penrose at
Wimbledon, is also announced from Cambridge (see Catalogue) among the hst
of meteor-observations for November, communicated by Mr. T. Crumplen.
Particiilars of the apparent path of this meteor at other places, if they can
still be obtained, would lead to determining its real height and velocity, and
of what meteoric shower the fii'ebaU formed a part.

(7.) 1865, November 21st, 6i^ 5TM p.m., G. M. T.

The eastern coast of England is for the third time visited by a detonating

meteor of large size, within a day before or after the date of the 20th No-

vember (i-. Eeport, 1865, p. 121). For the means of ascertaining its direct

distance from the earth, the path that it pursued, its velocity, &e., the Com-

mittee are mainly indebted to the accounts collected from distant places by

Mr. Warren De la Hue, by whom the meteor was observed near Cranford.

It was also seen, and the position of its point of disappearance was noted by
AMr. F. C. Penrose, F.E.A.S., at Wimbledon.
                                             loud report like that of a

cannon followed its disai^pearance, at an interval of 2 minutes and 20 seconds.

The meteor was observed by the Assistant at the Observatory of Cambridge,

Mr. H. C. Todd, and at Oxford and at Liverpool, as well as at other places more

near to the seat of the explosion, which was over the Thames valley. The

meteor traversed the entire length of the valley of the Thames, a distance of

about seventy-five miles, from the Nore (height about forty-one miles) to

Henley-on-Thames (height twenty-seven miles) in 6^ seconds, at a velocity,

therefore, of about eleven and a half miles per second. Sound, with its or-

dinary velocity in common air, would take 2 minutes 50 seconds to traverse

the distance from the latter point to the station where Mr. Penrose observed
the meteor at Wimbledon. The direction of the meteor was from a point in
the neighboxu-hood of the constellation Taurus, betv^'ecn Taiu'us and the head

of Cetus.
126 REPORT--1866.

   The meteor of the 19th November, 1861 (v. Ecport 1862, p. 79), as seen

--at Woodford, at first appeared stationary for two seconds at a point in Cetns.

The epoch of the 19th 21st November accordingly deserves attention,
partly as one for which the direction of the detonating meteors has been as-
certained, and partly because their frequent returns within very narrow limits
of time about that date makes it jn-obable that, like the meteors of the 10th
of August and 13th of November, they exist as a group of bodies revolving
in a fixed orbit round the sun.

                       (8.) 1866, January 6th, O" 59" p.m., G. M. T.
   The meteor seen and recorded at the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, ap-
proaches nearly in time and general description to that recorded at Sunder-

Hland and at Wisbeach. It is, however, distinct ; and the radiant-region L

roughly represents the general direction of the two meteors, Avhich was
from between Leo Minor and the Head of Leo.

                (9.) 1866, January 11th, 9" 55" p.m., Greenwich time.

  A meteor of very extraordinary length of path, generally observed in Eng-

land. Eeferred to the stars at Bedford, and at Hay (S. Wales), the visible

path appears to have been either truly horizontal, or otherwise slightly inclined
a little upwards, the meteor performing its transit at a height of eighty-five
to ninety-five miles above the earth. The direction of flight was from

E.S.E. to W.N.W., on a direct line from Po-ris to Cork, hut 2)>'ohalJi/ extend-
ing beyond tJie limits of either of those places at the beginning and end of
its luminous track. Assuming the distance of the meteor from Ticehurst to

have been only fifty miles (instead of ninety, as iviferrcd from the other ob-
servations), the altitudes (as measured at Ticehurst) of 1 5° at first appear-
ance in the east, and 10° at disappearance in the west, give not less than
450 miles as the length of the meteor's course. Half as long again as this,
or nearly 700 miles, would not be an exaggerated statement of the extrava-

gant length of path of this, certainly, very remarkable meteor. It may

be compared in this respect to the meteor of 1758, described by Pringle, and
to the meteor of the ISth of August, 1783. The meteor observed at the
Greenwich Observatory about the same time, or two minutes earlier, is
distinct, and crosses the path of the other at an angle. Both meteors were

directed from a radiant region L H, near the confines of Leo and Hydra.

 (10,) 1866, June 20th, 10'^ 45'" a.m., Greenwich time (see Appendix II. C).

    Notwithstanding this great aerolitic meteor appeared by day and in bright
sunshine, exact observations of its apparent path wore obtained at Ticehiu'st
by the schoolmaster of the village, Mr. E. Covington, and at Boulogne, by
Mr. F. Galton, the Secretary of the Eoyal Geographical Society. Instru-
mental measurements at those jjlaces show that the meteor first came into
 sight at a distance of fifteen miles above the town of Calais, and that when.
it disappeared near Boulogne (about midway between that town and the town
 of Montreuil, in Somme) its distance from the earth was only four and a half
 miles. The following statement which appeared in a daily journal, if correct,
 shows the violence of the shock which was felt at Boulogne. " The vibration
 caused by the exjilosion at that place was so great that an ill- constructed

 scafFokliDg fell to the ground, and one man at work upon the scaffolding was

 killed, and another seriously injured by the fall."
    Although the meteor was of unusiial dimensions, no meteorites are reported

 to have been found.

                      (1.) 1768, December 23rd, 7^ a.m. (local time).

  A very clear description* of the phenomeuon attending the faU of a meteorite

appears in the account of Cook's Voyage round the World, published under

Athe title of " Voyage round the World in His Majesty's Ship Endeavour,

in the years 1768-71 (London, 1771)." Professor Miller, of Cambridge, who

communicates the extract, accompanies it with the remark that "the passage
must have escaped the notice of Mr. Greg, and of aU other meteor historio-

graphers."

cured aU necessary supplies, we left Eio Janeiro, etc."
   Page 26, " December 23rd we observed an eclipse of the moon ; and about

7 o'clock in the morning a small white cloud appeared in the west, from
which a train of fii-e issued, extending itself westerly : about two minutes

after we heard two distinct loud exi)losions, immediately succeeding each

other like cannon, after which the cloud soon disajjpeared."

  A large meteor in bright daytime, seen in nearly the whole S.E. part of

Australia. The meteor was seen at sea, on board of the ' Constance,' thirty
miles S.W. of the Otway.

   From the measurements of Captain Sdrderbergh, and from various obser-
vations made thi-oughout the country, Dr. Neumayer adduces the following

facts relative to the occurrence :

Height of the meteor above the earth when first seen        miles.

No mention is made by Dr. Neumayer of any detonation having been heard.

                  (Paris Observatory Bulletins, Jan. 5th and 6th, 1866.)

   A fireball exploded at a height of thirty-eight miles over the mouth of the

Loire with a report likened to that of a cannon fired ofl" at a distance of a few
miles (at Vaunes), and to a slight shock of an earthquake at La Roche-Bernard.
The meteor was visible over an extent of the coast from Brest to Bordeaux,
whence M. Gruey obtains from observations the following approximate
elements of its path. The meteor jiroceeded, from a point about fifty-five
miles above the sert at Quimpcr, descending at an inclination of about 15°
from horizontal towards the E.S.E., a distance of eighty miles in 15 or 20
seconds, to the point of its explosion, thirty-five miles above the mouth of
the Loire. Velocity not less than ten miles per second.

   The diameter is reckoned by M. Gruey at ISO yards, but it is added that
the eff'ect of irradiation would Idc to considerably diminish this amount.

   No meteorites were discovered, although the explosion was considerable,

and the size and the luminosity of the fireball were quite unusual.

(4.) 1865, December 9th, 8" SO"' p.m. (local time).

At Charleston, South Carolina, U. S., the sky being overcast and a slight

rain falling, but unattended by thunder or lightning, a brilliant and strong

Alight was for a moment perceived.  sentinel waEiing his rounds was

enabled by the light to detect a boat with two persons leaving the fort, and by

leveUiug his piece to oblige it to retiu-n. Half a minute or a minute after-

wards, an explosion, and a loud jarring sound were heard ; the fireball itself,

if such was the nature of the phenomenon, was hidden by clouds.

W(5.)* 1866, March 11th, 0" 20'" a.m. local time:--
(March 10th,  50"' p.m., G. M. T.)

  A yellow or reddish fireball, half the apparent size of the full moon, fol-

lowed by a broad train of dull red colour, exploded into fragments near
Liibbccke (forty miles east from Miiuster) with a report loiid enough to be
plainly heard at Miiuster. People at Liibbecke were awakened from their
sleep ; the report 's^'as likened to a discharge of artillery followed by that of
musketry, and by a rushing sound Idee the arrival of a railway train. The
light was sufficient to have counted money : the meteor, as drawn by Pro-
fessor Heis upon a map, was visible in the surrounding districts of Liibbccke,

Westphaha, and Hanover.
   It commenced its course at a height of thirteen miles (British) above

Miete, terminating at three-and-a-half miles (British) over Oldendcrf in Liib-

W.becke. Path, thii-ty miles in four to five seconds, dii-ected from azimuth

from 8. 50°, altitude 20° ; velocity seven miles per second. At Liibbecke
the report succeeded its disappearance in little more than a quarter of a
minute. No meteorite in the neighbourhood is reported to have fallen.

me from here. I had a fine vieAv of it for about t^vo seconds as it skimmed

majestically across a bright blue portion of the sky, which was in other parts
covered by white clouds. I heard no sound, although I listened very atten-
tively for it ; but the wind was blowing through the trees, and so might have
drowned the sound to me.

   The brilliant orange-red with rose tint on the after part (h), and bright
white light at the forward end (a), gave it a most wonderfiil aspect when
surrounded by the blue sky.

   The drawing, although roughly made, is, I may say, generally faithful.

   The elevation was about 30° ; the inclination of the axis, about 5° ; the
length of the strikingly visible portion, about 1° 30' ; the white vapour veil,

perhaps 8° or 10° long, but, as it faded very gradually, one could not assign

an exact length to if. The red taU appeared to flame and flicker consider-

ably.

   If it had made its transit at night, it would have lit up the whole of
England ; but such a meteor seen in bright sunshine gives it a very special

character of interest.

   2. As seen at Brighton. (From Mr. Galton's MS.)

  "We saw T. point behind us; we turned, and saw a thing like a comet

passing through the air ; a bright ball of fire with a bright tail was what it
looked like. As it got near the cliif which lies to the east, it got smaller and
then vanished into space. Some people heard it go off like a gun when it
disappeared. T. says it was much larger at first ; it went fast and straight

across between us and the town.

  "A meteor passed over Brighton at 10|- a.m. on June 20th; it came from

N.W. and travelled rapidly, and disappeared S.S.E. The policeman on Kemp
Town slopes described it as shaped like a ginger-beer bottle ; one half of the

bottle was a strong blood-red light, the other half of the body was like a thin

white vapour, and the extremity of the object was a thin white cloud like a
comet's tail, but not luminous. So transparent was this tail, the blue sky
could be traced through it. The meteer burst, or rather deployed (spread

itself) and wholly disappeared ; no sparlcs, no sound.
   " The coastguard on drill at Signal Station, near Brighton, saw the meteor.

The body of it appeared liJfe a bottle, half of it a very remarkable deep-red
fire ; the rest of the body and a tail, a long train of very thin white vapour.

When it broke or spread and disappeared, the body, as the sailors call it, as-

sumed a sort of grey hue, which they think was the blue sky seen through
the thin white vapour. There was total absence of aU noise or sparks ; at the
moment when immediately over their heads, the " body " (the light part of it)
seemed to " quiver," but there was no pause in its course. The " quiver "

was, only, if possible, less than an instant."

more brilliant than the moon when seen in the day. Its flight was not rapid*,

and its motion smooth and regular, gliding as a heavy body might be sup-
posed to do. It was attended by a very short train, which i-apidly died out

and appeared to form a point behind. No noise or explosion was heard. Its

path was very slightly curved ; but I think there is no dependence to be placed
on this. The day was fine, but the sky was partially obscured by large bright
floating clouds, high above which was a stratum of a different kind cirrus

probably. The sun shone very clearly and warm at intervals, but for a few
days previously we have had strong west winds.

4. As seen at Boulogne.

                               To the Editor of the ' Times.'

--Sir, I was at Boulogne this morning at 11 o'clock (Paris time), when an

explosion followed by a low and continued rumbling was heard in the Hotel

des Bains, where I was then staying. The people in the house ran in alarm

from their rooms into the courtyard, asking one another what had happened

then observing through the gateway that similar crowds were also collecting

in the street and by the harbour, and were equally puzzled as to the source

of the noise, I went out and found myself in ample time to see the long,

naiTow, smoke-like train of a meteor hanging in the sky. The final puff' that

indicated the place of explosion was marked Avith perfect distinctness, but the

point where the train fiji'st commenced was hidden from my view by a block
of houses. I leisurely noted the necessarj' bearings, and then, running to my

--room, returned with a small travelling " altazimuth " I had by me, and

measured them. The results were : for the first point in the train that I

could see, altitude 62°, magnetic azimuth (E. from N.) Qb° ; for the final

puff, altitude 40°, magnetic azimuth (E. from N.) 195°.

I doubt the error in any of these observations exceeding one degree ; I feel

sure it does not exceed two degrees. The average breadth of the train of

Asmoke was about one degree.  comparison of these measurements with any
--set taken elsewhere and doubtless you wiU receive some other communica-
--tions will at least indicate the path of the meteor, and will accurately fix

its height above the earth at the time of explosion.

   5. As seen in France. (From the ' Morning Advertiser,' June 26th.)

   The meteor described as having shot through the clouds over Folkstone on
the 20th June, flamed amazement through all the toAvns in the northern

deiiartmeut of France. It crossed over Boulogne, Calais, Hazobrook, Aire,

Lilies, Bombourg and other places, and ultimately burst over St. Omer with
an explosion like the roar of artillery. The peaceful inhabitants imagined

an explosion of the neighbouring powder-magazines at Esquades. It is

known to have exploded between the towns of Boulogne and St. Omer;

but, though dUigent search has been made, none of the fragments have been

discovered.

   * One boy, who saw tbe meteor from first to last, was asked to point with a stick towards
the place whence it appeared to him to move. Moving the stick as the meteor appeared
to him to do, the time in which he described the whole course of the meteor's flight, up to

the point of disappearance, was 3j seconds.

   6. The explosion at Calais. (Extract from a letter to the ' Times,' from
H. B. M. Consul at Calais, Beaumont Hotham.)

 --Sir, The information of the explosion of a powder-mill near St. Omer,

though transmitted by telegraph from St. Omer to Calais, and though officials
here were informed of the " explosion," and the St. Omer fire-engines were
actually sent for, turned out to be incorrect. The meteor was of a very ex-
traordinary description ; but the powder-mill, at least, was a canard.

        (7.) 1866, July 17th, &" 52'" p.m. (local time), Eidfjord, Norway.
   It was quite light when the meteor appeared, far too light for any stars to
be visible, and yet the meteor was ^^eiy bright. I have no doubt it would

have given very much more light than the moon, yet it was only about one-

third the apparent diameter of the moon.
   I first saw it at an altitude of perhaps 45° ; and after that it went aboiit

50°, increasing in brightness as it went. The latter part of its course was
at an angle of 45° downwards to the right. It had a bright tail 5° or 10°
long, of a different colour from the head, I think fiery ; it vanished with the
head ; but I very soon saw a white train, perhaps 20° long, somewhat ser-
pentine, exactly like white smoke, doubtless illuminated by dayhght alone,
as I do not think that it was at aU self-luminous. It was consequently very

faint to my naked eye. Some of the party saw it before I did, and say that

it was simply curved and not serpentine.
   It rapidly became more serpentine, and perhaps two minutes after the

disappearance of the meteor was of this shape :

same time a similar report was heard at 8aro\\'li, twenty-four miles south of
Erinpoorah, and a borah then saw what he took for a baU of fire pass over
his head. The same loud noise was heard at the same time in Aboo, distant
fifty- four miles south of Erinpoorah ; and there it was followed by a second
report, or, as is more likely, a loud reverberation of the first. Some men were
digging a tank at the time near the village of BheenwaU in Marwar, about
thirty-eight miles from Aboo, when they were suddenly alarmed by a loud
rusliing noise and a ball of fire near them, throwing up the earth like a shell.
Of course they aU bolted, but, finding that nothing further occurred, retm-ned
to the spot, wlicre from a hole three or four feet deep they dug out this aero-
lite : weight 3:j lbs. The appearance of this stone exactly corresponds with

proceeding from a cloud in the air. The stone then fell, penetrating in fallow

                   (Comptcs Ecndus, 1866, June 18th, vol. xlii.)

  A reddish meteor, drawing a long train of red fire, as seen from Nangis

and Bray-sur-Seine, burst over the " banlioue '' of St. Mesmin. Its disap-

pearance was followed, at intervals of about twenty seconds towards the E.,
and of three, four, or five minutes towai'ds the W.S.W., fi'om which quarter

the meteor came, by three cannon-like reports. After a clattering noise and

a noise like rolling thunder that gradually died away, an aerolite 1 pound

in weight strack the earth with a loud shrieking noise* in a railway-cutting

at Haute de la Garenne, two yards from the rails, and penetrated 9 inches

Ainto the sloping bank.                          second, nearly half a mile from the first, was dis-

covered at Bas-le-Brun, which weighed 5 pounds ; and a thii-d, weighing

4 pounds, fell one mile from the other two. An indentation, about half an

inch in width with a fresh surface, upon the smallest, is covered -with thin

thread-like lines of the perfectly fused dull black crust, where an angle of the

meteorite is supposed from this circumstance to have been broken oft' during

its flight in the air.                    The  specific  gravity  is  3-56                    and the stones contain 5 or

6 per cent, by weight of metallic iron combined with nickel. Protosulphuret

of iron and chrome-iron ore are also present. The earthy portion of the me-

teorites consists of about 60 per cent, of a mineral which is impure olivine,
and about 40 per cent, of highly siliceous mineral unattackable by muriatic

acid.

   Two scientific persons, commissioned by the government from Pesth, after

inquiry upon the spot into the circumstances of this stonefall, gave their
report, of which the foUoAving is the substance :

   The stones struck the earth in great numbers on an area 1200 yards in
length, in lat. 49° N., long. 22° E. from Greenwich. The meteor was seen
at distances varying from thirty to seventy-five miles from the place of fall.
At Eperies, fifty-five miles west from Knyahinya, it presented the appear-
ance of a burning birch-rod. The handle, which was directed foremost, was
deep red : and the meteor shot over Saros and Zemplin to a point due east,
where it burst, scattering its fragments in aU directions, and houses shook

with the explosion. At Knyahinya the report was like that of a hundred

cannons.

  A dense cloud, ten times the apparent width of the sun, marked the path

of the fireball, extending itself towards Unghvar, a distance of twenty-five

miles S., 5° W. from EJayahinya ; and it remained visible for fifteen minutes.
Two or three minutes after the report was heard, a rattling sound came from

the direction of the streak, and labourers at work in the fields saw stones fall.
These, when picked up, were ice-cold, and emitted a strong sulphurous odour,
that might be perceived at a distance of a mile round the place of fall. At
least sixty stones were found, and the largest buried themselves obliquely at
an angle of 30° or 35° to the horizon. Thirty-five fragments of the aerolite
were sent by the Commissioners to Pesth.

  A perfectly incrusted stone was forwarded to Dr. Haidinger at Vienna,

who cites the stonefall of Knyahinya, with that of Stannern, as a proof that
aerolites, in their native orbits, occasionally consist of a swarm of separate
stones, bound together by their mutual gravitation, while yet revolving in an

orbit, like one body round the sun. The stone is marked by depressions upon
its surface, like a perfect aerolite, and in its interior parts presents a marbled
appearance, like the stones of ParnaUee and Assam. The specific gravity is

3-520.

    The exact date of the October shower is not fixed, but varies between the
15th and 26th of October. On the 18th of October 1864, and again on the
20th of October 1865, shower-meteors were observed at Hawkhurst, diverg-
ing from a particularly weU defined radiant, at v Orionis, which preserved its
place almost fixed in two successive years. The following is a comparison
of the meteors mapped with those of other showers. The Table shows that
a large percentage of the meteors mapped in the October shower were far
more conformable to a radiant-point than was the case with the meteors in
any of the other well-known and previously-examined showers. The initials

                 (2.) Meteoric shower of 1865, November 13th, a.m.

  --Mr, W. H. Wood reports at Weston-super-Mare : On the night of the

12th of November, from b^ to 8'' p.m., and again at 11'' 30TM p.m., the sky
was clear at intervals, but no meteors were seen. After midnight the sky

continued overcast untU the morning. On the night of the 13th, imtil l*" a.m.

on the morning of the 14th, the sky was partially clear, but no meteors were
scon. It then clouded over completely until 4'' 30'" a.m., when personal
watching was abandoned, no symptom of a meteoric shower having appeared
up to this time. From o** 30'" a.m. until sunrise the sky was clear (commu-
nicated), and orange -coloured meteors appeared, falling at the rate of 12 per
hour, from a general altitude of 25^ in the N. and N.N.W., vertically down.

  --Mr. H. Holiday reports at Torquay : On the night of the 12th of No-

vember, at 9'' P.M., Cassiopeia was visible through a break in the clouds.
The sky was afterwards examined at intervals throughout the night, and was

foimd constantly overcast. On the night of the 13th the sky was very cloudy,

--and watching on this night was abandoned.
    Mr. T. Crumplcn reports at London : " This morning [the 13thJ the sky
became almost cloudless at l"" 15"" a.m. There were fewer meteors than one

might expect to see ; but those I saw were of all magnitudes, varying from
Venus at its brightest to fifth-magnitude stars. The radiant in Leo came out

very well ; I also suspect a radiant near o Taui'i."
    Mr. George Knott thus describes the meteors on the morning of the 13th

of November, at Cuckfield, in Sussex (see Monthly Notices of the Man-

--chester Lit. and Phil. Soc, Phys. and Math. Section, Dec. 7th, 1865) : Two

observers watched the southern half of the sky. " Between 12'' and l** a.m.

we counted 39 meteors, giving an average of rather more than 0*6 per minute
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the next 55 minutes added 61 to the number, giving an average of 1*1 per

minute. After half an hour's interval we resumed our watch at 2'' 25"" a.m.,
and between that hour and 3'' 5"' a.m., when we ceased observing, we noted
55 meteors, showing that the average had risen to 1-4 per minute. The ob-

servations of the last 40 minutes showed very clearly that the radiant-point

--was in the immediate vicinity of the star ^ Leonis, or perhaps between that

star and e and /( of the same constellation the neighbourhood, in fact, of what
the Rev. C. Pritchard happily terms the " apex of the earth's u<ay." The
paths of a few meteors seemed to suggest a second radiant-point in the neigh-
bourhood of /3 Tauri, but the observed flights were too few to afford satisfac-
tory evidence on the point."

 --Mr. K. P. Greg reports at Manchester : " On the night of the 12th, during

the hour from 11'' to 12'' p.m., I saw only two meteors. It then clouded over,
but became quite bright again a few minutes before 1'' a.m. Between 1'' and
2'' A.M. I saw a considerable number, of which I mapped some 20 or 30, but
had not time to enter all the particulars. The radiant-point was not quite
a definite one, some nearer Leo Minor than Leo. Hardly any were visible,
except near the radiant-point ; say from Ursa Major to Canis Minor. These
November meteors were very phosphorescent, in fact nothing else,-- even tlie
larger ones. I saw two from Cassiopeia, the regular radiant, as different as
possible in appearance. At 2'' ^.m. it clouded over."

   Observations of the same shower, by Mr. T. P. Barkas at Newcastle-upon-
Tyne, Mr. S. H. Miller at Wisbeach, and Mr. S. B. Kincaid at Streatham,

   On the morning of the 13th of November, the meteoric shower was ob-

served at the Greenwich and Cambridge Observatories, and at Hawkhurst,
with a view to determining the heights and velocities of the meteors. The

hourly number of the meteors is stated by Mr. Glaisher and Professor Challis
to have exceeded all before recorded at either of those two observatories.
JSIore than 2.50 meteors (279) were recorded at Greenwich, from shortly after
midnight until shortly after 5"^ a.m.

    Nearly a thousand meteors are computed to have been visible at Greenwich
during the hours from 1'' to 5'' a.m., appearing in greatest abundance diuing
the hoiir from 1'' to 2" a.m. Nearly two-thirds (172) left Imninous trains
visible for several seconds after the disappearance of the meteors. Their
unusual number, and the appearance of leaving luminous streaks, agree with
Olmsted's description of the famous meteors of the 13th of November 1833,
and leave no doubt that the meteors were a partial return of the meteoric
shower of that year.

   The number of meteors of the first class (16) recorded at Hawkhurst dming
the hour from midnight to 1 o'clock on the morning of the 14th, was nearly
equal to the number (17) recorded, imder equally favourable circumstances,
during the same hour on the morning of the 13th.

   The following are the hourly numbers of meteors observed at -the three
places during the progress of the shower :

20°, and tlie latter more than 100° removed from the " apex of the earth's
wai/," it follows that the earth's motion of translation is plainly recognized
as the result of observation, by its effect of increasing the speed of the meteors
from the former radiant-point to 55| miles per second, and diminishing the
speed of the meteors from the latter radiant-point to nineteen miles per

second.

   The position of the radiant-point in some part of the constellation Leo was

   The January and April showers, in 1866, as shown by observations con-
tained in the Catalogue, were completely in default.

                     (4.) Meteoric Shower of May 18th, 1866.

   Meteors of the first class (7=lst-mag., 2=2nd-mag., 3=3rd-mag. stars)
were observed at the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, towards midnight, on

the 18th of May 1866, falling at the rate of 12 per hour. The radiant-point,
although somewhat indefinite, was distinctly the radiant Q^ (No. XXa) of
Dr. Heis and Mr. Greg, between Corona and the Head of Hercules. The date,

on account of the possibility of a connexion existing between shower meteors

in May and the star-showers of November, merits attention, with the view of

determining further points of radiation.

           (5.) Meteoric Shower of August 1866.

A period of about 103 years, noticeable in the returns of the August

meteors, would bring two star-showers of the years 830 and 833 a.d., cited

by Biot from the Chinese Annals, into immediate relation with the pheno-

menon of the 10th of August, 1863, to which the first or second of these star-

showers might correspond.

The hourly niTmber of meteors on the night of the 10th of August, 1800,

Awas not greatly above the ordinary scale of the phenomenon.  large meteor

appeared in daylight over the south of England at 8'' 15TM p.m., on the even-

ing of the 8th ; and a large fireball was oliserved at Hawkhurst at 0'' 42"',

on the morning of the 10th.

At the Iloyal Observatory, Greenwich, the sky was clear on the 7th, and

175 meteors were observed. Two meteors were observed through a break in

the clouds on the 8th. The sky was again clear on the 9th, and 113 meteors

were mapped in a few hours. On the night of the 10th, 24 meteors were

observed through breaks in the clouds. The radiant was in Perseus.

At Eichmond, near London, on the night of the 1 0th of August, the clouds

began to break at midnight ; and the sky was completelj^ clear at 0'' 15TM a.m.

on the 11th. Between the hours of 11" 55"" p.m. on the 10th, and l"* 5"" a.m.

--on the 11th, Mr. J. Browning counted 26 meteors six fii'st-class, leaving

Atrains (3 blue, 2 yeUow, 1 white).       third part of the sky was in view

throughout the time.

At London, Mr, T. Crumplen reports meteors very scanty on the 9th. There

was a tluinderstorm on the 10th, with cloudy and unsettled weather until

ll*" P.M. The sky v\'as afterwards clear at intervals. Electrical-looking

clouds and distant lightning were conspicuous through the night as in pre-

Avious years.  few meteors were observed radiating from B Camelopardi and

a Lyras.

 --At Birmingham, Mr. W. H. Wood reports : " The present return of the

August meteors has exceeded the ordinary scale of the phenomenon in point

of numbers, and exhibits a radical and probably a physical difference in the

nature of the substance composing the meteoric shower, as compared with that

of August 1864. In the latter, various tints of j-eUow and red were its cha-

on the night of the 10th was for the most part cloudy, and all attempts to
catch the spectrum of a meteor pi'oved in vain.

   Spectrum observations were begiln at Hawkhurst on the evening of the 9th
and the sky proving remarkably clear for this kind of observations, they were
continued, imtil daybreak, on the following nights of the 9th and 10th.

   No difficulty was found in mapping the coiu'se of the meteors in the spec-

troscope by the stars, of which a whole constellation, as for example the seven
stars- of Ursa Major, are seen in the instrument at once. The brightness,
duration, and length of path, and whether the meteor left a streak upon its
course, could also be noted in the instrument as readily as with the unassisted
eye ; so that by this means the apparent paths of 17 meteors were noted in
six hours, of which all, or all but one, diverged from Perseus and Cassiopeia.
The proportions of magnitudes were as follows :

=Sirius.  =l8tmag.  =2nd mag.  = 3rd mag.  == 4th mag.

    2         4                     4            2

   The spectroscope being so held that the cpurse of the meteors was parallel

to the refi'acting edges of the prisms, the appearance of their meteoric spectra

was found to be, in general, altogether different from the view of the same
meteors obtained by the naked eye. N'evertheless in one instance (No. 8)
the appearance of a meteor in the spectroscope was unaltered, being that of
an ordinary bright shooting-star, leaving a slender yellow streak upon its
course. In some cases (of the most conspicuous streaks), the appearance of
the brightest and last fading portion of the streaks in the spectroscope was
the same as to the naked eye, being a bright-yellow-coloured, slender line.
Lastly, when the spectrum of the meteoric streak was diflPiise, a bright-yellow
very slender line was frequently observed in the spectrum on the side towards
the red, which either faded away simultaneously with the diffiise portion of
the spectrum, or, more commonly, remained visible alone after that portion
of the spectrum had disappeared. The bright-yeUow line was observed in
eight cases among 1 7 meteoric spectra. Its presence in a very conspicuous
form in many of the streaks leads Mr. Herschel to the conclusion that the
metal sodium is abundant in the 10th of August meteors. The following

account of the original discovery of a yellow line strongly resembling that
of sodium in the train-spectra of the August meteors, is taken from Mr.
Herschel's description of the observations, in the ' Intellectual Observer
for October, 1866, where it is accompanied by a tinted plate :

    " All the necessaiy preparations having been made, and with the prospect of
a considerable meteoric shower at hand, a watch for meteors was commenced,
in order to observe their spectra, on the night of the 9-lOth of August last.
Expectation on the first night was not destined to be disappointed, and six
meteors were observed to pass across the field of view. Notes of the peculia-
rities were made, and of the general appearance of their spectra, and are

--briefly as follows :
    " Auc/ust 9th. No. 1, S'^ 40" p.m. About equal to a fourth-mag. star.
Passed across the body of Cygniis in half a second, leaving no streak. The
spectrum exactly resembled that of a fourth-mag. star (o Cygui), close to which
the meteor passed, the conclusion being that the meteor might be a solid body

--heated to ignition.
    " August 10th. No. 2, 0'' 27" a.m. Nearly as bright as Sirius. Com-
menced near Polaris (in the field of view), and shot 15° or 20° (beyond the

 field of view) along a line dii'ected from Cassiopeia, leaving a streak on its
whole course for four seconds. The latter part of the meteor's course was

of the streak were visible, one refracted, and one accidentally reflected at the

side. These two images of the meteor and of its streak could not be distin-

--guished apart, at least in their general appearance, the conclusion beiug that

the hght, both of the nucleus and of its luminous streak, was homogeneous,

and that its luminous suhstance was a gas.

Aseconds.      cloud unfortunately dimmed the streak. In the spectroscope,

as far as cloud would permit any judgment of the streak to be formed, its

aspect was the same as to the unassisted eye. The light of the streak was

therefore probably homogeneous, and the strealc itself prohaUy a luminous gas.

ing a streak for half a second on its course. In the spectroscope, the general

appearance of the meteor and of the streak in the field of view was the same

--as that of the purely reflected image by the side, the conclusion being, as

before, that the light, both of the meteor and of the streak, was homogeneous,

or that the luminous substance of the meteor was a gas.
   " No. 5, 1*^ 40" A.M. About equal to a second-mag. star. Passed slowly

through a short path near (d Tauri, directed from Cassiopeia ; duration one

second, leaving a streak at the place for three seconds. The spectrum of the

meteor and streak was qiiite equally diffused over a space about |° in width

change, the conclusion being that in this case tlie train might, like the nuclem,

" No. 6, 2^ 15TM A.M. Equal to a first-mag. star. Shot on the same course

as No. 2 ; duration one second, leaving a bright streak for four seconds. The

spectroscope was turned towards the streak before it disappeared. The train

was widened by the prisms to a greyish-white band, somewhat greater than

a quarter of a degree in breadth. It faded from sight without further change,

the conclusion in this case also being that the train might possihly he composed

of heated sparks.

" Three spectra in the foregoing observations appeared homogeneous, like

that of a luminous gas (Nos. 2, 3, 4) ; and three were continuous or diffuse

(Nos. 1, 5, 6), like that of an ordinary spark. The question, accordingly,

whether luminous meteors might or ruight not contain solid substance, re-

mained undecided, when daylight beginning to appear put a stop to further

observations.

   " The following night observations could fortunately be resumed ;, and the
perplexing appearance of the meteor-spectra on the previous night received a
truly surprising and most satisfactory explanation, in the repeated aj^pear-

ance in the spectra of the streaks of a yellow line, unmistal-eahhj that of the
metal sodium in comhustion.

" Two observers being'engaged to watch on this night, one checked the ob-

servations of the other with the naked eye. The troublesome reflected image

in the spectroscope could accordingly be dispensed with, and it was kept out

of sight ; so that the views obtained of the meteor-spectra came as nearly to

perfection as could be wished.

ever, was brought into the middle of the field of view, where it occupied an

excellent position (parallel to the refracting edges of the i)risms) for viewing

caused it to appear somewhat bent, like a bow, across the field of view. The

spectrum presented the appearance of a narrow line of light, exceedingly

brilliant, of a golden-yellow colour, and not more than 5' in width. It faded
gradually along its whole length, and disappeared in about two and a half or

--three seconds. Its description, noted in the register, kept for the purpose at

the time, was "neither double, triple, nor midtiple, nor continuous, hut

--'purely and positively monochromatic."

orange-yellow line of no appreciable breadth, without any continuous spectrum

near to it, or any other neighboirring bands or lines. It was very bright,
remaining in sight two seconds, and it gradually faded away until it vanished.
The spectrum of the nucleus appeared to be undisttnguishably the same as

that of the streak.

width, with a yellow line included in it o>i the side toiuards the red. The
yellow line and the diffuse band disappeared together. The spectrum of the

nucleus appeared to be appreciably the same as that of the streak.

way along the course of the preceding meteor in half a second, leaving no

streak. The spectrum of the nucleus was a concentrated point of yellow

light, having all the appearance of an ordinary yellow shooting-star.

gbuli to ri Piscium in one second and a quarter, leaving a streak for four seocuds
on its course. In the spectroscope the meteor slowly crossed the middle of

the field of view, on a course directly parallel to the refracting edges of the

prisms, producing a very superb spectrum. The spectrum of the nucleus was
red, green, and blue, extremely brilliant. The tryin-spectrum was diffuse,

1° in width, in which a thin bright orange-yellow line was plainly seen on
the side toiuards the red. The diffuse portion of the train-spectrum faded in
about two seconds, apparently following the nucleus. The sodium line re-
mained extremely bright for not less than two seconds longer, and faded
gradually along its whole length, when it also disappeared. The singular
characters of this spectrum were most distinctly and beautifully seen, and the
long endurance of the sodium line, after the rest had disappeared, was leisurely

M^atched.

3° below Polaris in three-qviarters of a second, leaving a bright streak for

three seconds. The meteor first appeared in the field of view, and passed out

of it. The spectrum of the early portion of the streak, behind the nucleus,

was a greyish diffuse baud |° in width. The spectrum of the nucleus was

appreciably the same. The brightest part of the streak, before it faded, was

brought into the field of view, weU situated parallel to the edges of the

prisms, and in the middle of the field for about two seconds. Its appearance

was that of a golden-yellow line of light about 5° iu length, some 4' in width,

tapering gently towards the ends, and perfectly sharp and well defined. It

was unaccompanied by any continuous spectrum, or any bands or other lines,

and it so disappeared from the ends towards the centre.

dromedse in three-quarters of a second, leaving a streak for two seconds.

The train-spectrum was a diftuse greyish-white band, |° in width, and about

6° or 7° long, and faded away without any further change. The spectrum

of the nncleus showed prismatic colours.

" No. 16, 2*^ 16" A.M. Equal to a second-mag. star. Shot from 6 Cassio-

peiae to /3 Andromedis iu half a second, leaving a streak for two seconds and

a half. The meteor was seen «'ith the unassisted eye. The last-fading por-

tion of the streak was examined in the spectroscope, where it appeared more

widely difi^used than when seen with the naked eye. Its colour in the spec-

troscope was a dull greyish white.

" No. 17, 2'" 27"* A.M. Brighter than a first-mag. star. Shot from a Cas-

siopeise to o Honorum, leaving a streak for two seconds and a half. The

train-spectrum was a diftuse greyish-white band |° in width, not sensibly

brighter in any part, and it so faded. The spectrimi of the nucleus was

bright red and green.

" Daylight at this time began to appear, and observations were obliged to

be discontinued ; the streaks of the August meteors might, however, already

be plainly divided into two classes. In the majority of cases, a bright yellow

line, having the unmistakeable appearance of the sodium line, was clearly

visible in the spectrum. In a smaller number of cases the spectrum was

merely a diff"use and greyish light band, or orcUnary spectrum of weak inten-

sity, resembling the spectrum of the glowworm's light. It will be interesting

to observe this form of meteoric spectrum, should it be more common among

the " phosphorescent " streaks of the November meteors than it was in August

last, when only five such purely "phosphorescent" streaks were noticed

entirely free from sodium light.

" The spectra of the meteor-nuclei were seen in a few cases only Avith

distinctness, as they were in general overpowered by the brightness of the

sodium light whenever that was present. When the streaks were phospho-

rescent only, and free from sodium light, the nuclei in general presented

highly-coloured spectra, Hke the spectrum of solid matter at a glowing white

heat, or like the spectrum of an ordinary gas-flame containing white-hot

solid particles of carbon. A better night for observing nucleus-spectra would

be the 12th of December, when meteors leaving no trains are plentiful; and

they are for the most part very biilliant, radiating from some part of the

constellation Gemini.

" That which spectral examination of the August meteors has most certainly

brought to light is the existence of an extraordinary quantity of the vapour

of sodium in their luminous streaks ; so that many of the streaks, especially

the most conspicuous and the most slowly-fading amongst them, consist of

nothing else but soda-flames for a great proportion (that is to say, the latter

portion) of the time that they continue visible. Their condition is then

exactly that of a flame of gas in a Bunsen's burner, freely charged with the
vapour of burning sodium, or of the flame of a spirit-lamp newly trimmed

and largely dosed with a supply of moistened salt.

   <' Itis difficult to believe that the vapour of the metal sodium exists in such

considerable quantities at the confines of the atmosphere. It is much more

reasonable to suppose that it is brought into the atmosphere by the meteors
themselves, so as to be deposited in the luminous trains that mark their

course. The material of the August meteors is, therefore, probably a mineral

substance in which sodium is one of the chemical ingredients. Such is the

rather satisfactory termination of an experiment which it will be very easy

to repeat whenever an abundance of meteors on the night of the 10th of

August offers an equally favourable opportunity for examiaing their spectra

by the aid of the meteor spectroscope.
   "The connexion believed by adherents of Chladni to exist between shooting-

stars and aerolites is now shown, at least in August, to extend itself in some

measure to their chemical composition. The meteorites of Aumale, which fell

on the 25th of August 1865, were found, on analysis by M. Daubree, to con-

Atain soluble salts (chloride and carbonate) of sochum.  circumstance so un-

common in the composition of aeroUtes, allies the meteorites of Aumale very

closely with the sodium -bearing streaks of the meteors of the 10th of August.

   " In this manner, each new acquisition of knowledge, however unforeseen

may be its origin, tends to support the theory of Chladni, and to confirm the

belief that shower-meteors and shooting-stars are actually aerolites of small

dimensions. In whatever manner aerolites and shooting-stars are related to
each other in their astronomical and other peculiarities, they wlH evidently

require a vast number of further experiments to unfold their real source."

Report of the Committee appointed to Investigate the Alum Bay Leaf-

  Bed. By W. Stephen Mitchell^ LL.B., F.G.S., Caius College,

    Cambridge.

Thk bed known to geologists as the " Leaf-bed," or " Pipe-clay bed," of
Alum Bay, is the band of white clay which occurs in the lower Bagshot beds
in Alum Bay, about 200 feet from their base (No. 42 in Memoir of the

Geological Survey). It is about 6 feet thick ; but one portion only, a few

inches in thickness, contains the plant-remains. No other oi-ganic remains

whatever have been noticed.
    The occurrence of these plant-remains was first observed by Mr. Prestwich

(see Geol. Soc. Journ. 1847, p. 395), and since then collections have been made.
    Dr. P. de la Harpe, of Lausanne, examined these, and gave a notice of

several species in a paper on the " Flore tertiaire de I'Angleterre," which
appeared in the ' Bulletin de la Societe Yaudoise des Sciences NatureUes
for June 1856. In December 1860, in conjunction with Mr. J. "W. Salter,
F.G.S., he prepared the list which is published in the memoir of the Geological

 Survey of the Isle of Wight.
    This list includes the collections from ' the same strata worked at Bourne-

mouth and Corfe Castle, in Purbeck, Dorset ; " yet for the compilation of it
                                                                        ON THE ALUM BAY LEAF-BED.                                                         147

the total number of specimens that could then be brought together from the
three localities was but about 300.

   It is therefore no matter of surprise that in larger collections since made
many fresh forms are met -with.

    At our last Meeting at Bii-mingham I exhibited drawings of some few of
the most striking new forms, and mentioned that both Dr. P. de la Haroe
and Dr. Oswald Heer urged the importance of a more careful examination of

this flora.

   A committee for this purpose was appointed, and the sum of ^20 was

placed at our disposal. Through the kindness of Professor Sedgwick and

the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, we obtained the services
of Mr. H. Keeping, now at the Woodwardian Museum, who has had much

experience in the working of this bed.

   I went down to Alum Bay last September with Mr. Keeping, and remained
there during the working to note the appearance of the leaves when first

turned up.

In the majority of instances, not only the outline, but the venation, even
the most delicate, is at first clearly visible, though a few houi's' exposure to
Athe air almost obliterates the more dehcate marks.

mens on which I partly traced the venation with pencil as soon as they were
exposed

part not pencilled is harcUy, if at all, to be made out. It is much to be
regretted that there is this difficulty in preserving the specimens, and we
shall be very glad to receive suggestions for their treatment. All our speci-
mens have had the usual isinglass wash, though I fancy it somewhat
obscures the character of the surface of the leaves. I cannot speak with
certainty on this point ; for, as I had not anticipated such a result, I did not
record the character of the surfaces among the notes I made on the spot
btiU, from comparing the recoUection I have of the appearance of the leaves

when first turned up with their appearance now, I am ahnost certain this is
the case. This I the more regret as the character of the surface of a leaf is

often a useful help in determining its genus . I hope to have an opportunity
of again examining this bed ; and I shaU endeavour to take both drawings
and complete descriptions of the leaves before the air and light
                                                                                                                                               have   in  an^v

WeAfter a fortnight, bad weather put a stop to our work.                                                                                       had, however,
succeeded in obtaining a good collection, numbering altogether some 470
specimens. The leaves are, on the whole, well preserved, but the bed in one
part yielded forms so indistinctly marked as to be ahnost worthless.

mI have in course of preparation descriptions of aU the leaves in                                                                                     this, as

   I decline to attempt to fix the mimber of new species, or even genera, which,
we are able to add to the list in the Survey Memoir ; for not only is the deter-

mination of fossil leaves at all times very unsatisfactory, but that list was not
intended for a monograph, and has neither drawings (except a few) nor the
exactness of description requisite for identification. Then, too, the nomen-
clature of fossil leaves is very unsettled, the same leaf having often half a
dozen different names.

   With regard to the species of fossil leaves, I believe the word " form "
might often with advantage be used where "species" is now universally
employed. "Species" is applicable only to the entire plant; "form" is

applicable to individual leaves. When we consider the variation often met
with in leaves growing on the same tree, I think we see reason for great

caution in determining what " forms " represent the existence of distinct
" species."

Report of the Committee appointed to make Experiments on the differ',
   ence between the Resistance of Water to Floating and to Immersed
   Bodies. The Committee consists of John Scott Russell, C.E.,
   F.R.S. ; James H. Napier; Professor Rankine, C.E., F.R.S.;

   and W. Froude.

The following Heport describes the experiments made by the Committee.
   The Committee held sevei'al meetings in the course of the winter and

spring of 1864-65, and agreed to a programme of experiments, of which the
following is a summary :

   " 1 . Two models to be made of painted wood, designated respectively as

A and B.

    " 2. The models to be ship-shape, and each of them to consist of two equal
and similar halves joined together at the middle water-line.

     A" 3. Model to be in two parts, joined at the circular midship section, so

   that by turning the after-body through a right angle about a longitudinal

   axis the water-hnes can be converted into buttock-lines, and vice versa.
      " 4. Experiments to be made according to the method formerly put in prac-

   tice by Mr. Scott Russell, in which the uniformity of the propelling force is
   maintained by means of a regulating weight hanging from a pulley, under
   which the hauling cord passes ; the model to be guided in a straight course
   by means of a stretched wire.

      " 5. Those experiments to be made principally at speeds not exceeding the
  natural speed of the wave corresponding to the length of the model, viz.
   about two knots per hour, or 3-38 feet per second; but a few experiments
  may be made at higher speeds.

      " 6. The experiments to be made on each model under two circumstances,
  viz., with the model immersed as nearly as may be to the middle water-line,
  and with the model totally immersed."

     The programme of experiments having been thus drawn up by the Com-
  mittee, the superintendence of its execution was undertaken by Mr. Scott
  Eussell, as being the only member of the Committee resident in or near

  London.

      Full-sized drawings of the models having been prepared in conformity

  with the programme, the models were made from those drawings*.
     The actual execution of the experiments was entrusted by Mr. Russell to

  Mr. J. Quant, Naval Architect, who performed that duty with a skill and

  assiduity which the Committee desire to acknowledge in the highest terms.
     The experiments were made upon a lake in Blackheath Park, the use of

 which for that purpose was liberally granted by Dr. Joseph Kidd.

    A platform was laid down near the water's edge, and on it was erected

 a trestle ; in the crosspiece at the top, two brass wheels were made to
 turn in sheave-holes ; on the outside and against the platform in the water
 an oak pole was fixed, on which pole, a little above the water, another brass
 wheel was made to turn, care being taken that the inside of the rim of this
 wheel was in a perpendicular line with the outer rim of the outer wheel
 in the top of the crosspiece ; from the oak pole to a length of about 98
 feet, where another pole was fix;ed in the water, was stretched a wire,

 about 9 inches above the surface of the water, to act as guide for the model

 when running, two forks being fixed on the model for that purpose. At a
 distance of 20 feet from the outer pole was driven a stake into the bed of the

 lake, exposing its top above the water ; at 25 feet from the fii'st stake, a
 second was driven, and at 25 feet from the second, a third. In commencing
 an experiment, a silk cord was passed over the wheels, and, when geared
round the lower wheel, the end was fixed by a hook to the model. The
model was then drawn, by means of another cord, to the outer pole ; and on
its arrival there this cord was unhooked, and the model held by a boy seated
on the top of the pole. The propelling weight was then suspended between
the two top wheels in the trestle on the platform, by means of a pulley
under which the cord passed ; and whilst the boy yet held the model, the
propelling weight was hoisted up to a height of 6 feet fi-om the ground. The
word " go " was then given, the model set free, and the propelling weight
allowed to fall to within a few inches of the ground, and there held by
steadUy hauling in the cord till the model arrived at the platform. While

the model was running, observations were taken as to the time when it

passed each post*. The first 20 feet were intended to enable the model to

acquire a uniform speed by the time it arrived at the first jjost.

  A drawing of the apparatus just described was shown at the Birmingham

Meeting.

  AAs the form of model when half immersed is of itself unstable, it was

partly hollowed out, and made stable by the help of leaden ballast. It was

found impossible to make satisfactory expeiiments with this model at deep

immersions, because it then became too heavy to be trimmed with that de-

gree of delicacy which was requisite for the experiments. With model A,

therefore, the bow and stern were combined in various ways ; and the under-

water experiments were made with model B. This model floated exactly at

half the depth when sohd, and with that immersion the experiments were

taken as given in the following Tables. It was afterwards hoUowed out, and

then loaded to such an extent as just sensibly to tend to sink. Some runs

were taken with this model as deep as 15 inches ; and at that time it was to

a slight extent hanging on the wire, so as to meet with a little additional

friction : these runs are marked with an asterisk.

   WhUc model B was being hollowed out, the run was lengthened to 150 feet,

so that iu each subsequent experiment four observations of speed could be

made.

The following Tables show the observations as made when the models were

running.

The first column gives the number of the experiment ; the second column,

the weight suspended as before mentioned, plus the weight of the pulley and

spindle, the sum being called the " propelling weight." The resistance of the

model iu each case was of course approximately oiu-lmlf of this proj)elling

weight.

The third and fourth columns give the times occupied by the model to run

thi-ough the first and second spaces of 25 feet each ; the fifth column gives
the mean of the two former coliunns ; the next three columns are the three

preceding  reduced  to  speed  in  feet  per  second                               the next column is the  mean

Report on Muscular Irritability and the relations lohich eoeist between

        Muscle, Nerve, and Blood. By Richard Norris, M.D.

Muscular irritability is commonly recognized and defined as that property
of niiiscular tissue by virtue of which it contracts under the influence of

stimuli.

  This property is said by Du Bois Reymond to bear a definite relation to its
electromotor powers. He says, " the diminution of the muscular current

after death is proportional to the diminution of the excitability of the muscle;

both the electromotor force and the excitability have the same tei'mination,

'('. e. in the rigor mortis, caiised, as Brueck has proved, by the coagulation of

the fibrin contained in the muscles external to the blood-vessels." As a
general summary of his researches on this question, Du Bois Reymond again

says, " the electric power of a muscle is always proportioned to its contracti-
lity, inasmuch as those agents which do not influence its contractility exert
no influence on its current."

Matteucci has asserted " that the muscular current continually decreases

after the death of the animal, or after the sejiaration of the muscle from the
body " *.

Taken in concert, these statements of Matteucci and Eeymond amount to

this                            muscular        ii-ritabiHty continually decreases                                                       after  the  removal of                                                                                   a  muscle
                             :

from nervous and blood influences. This view of the gradual decline of

muscular irritability after somatic death is concurred in by physiologists

generally. Certain researches in which the author of this paper has been
long engaged, have led him to doubt the accuracy of this conclusion as a ne-
cessary and fundamental truth.

As the consideration of the subject opens up a considerable range of ex-

* By the death of an animal the author of this paper understands the loss of the pro-

perty of excitability or neurility on the part of the ganglionic nervous masses, without

power of restoration, in fact molecular death of the vesicular nervous tissue. It is certain

that the phenomena of life, as manifested by animals, may be again aroused into exhibition

BO long as the ca-pacity for molecular life ))ersists in the nervous system, notwithstanding

that both respiration and circidation may have long ceased. In a chapter on death, p. 905

-- Aof Carpenter's ' Principles of Human Physiology,' the following passage occurs: " surer

test, however, is afforded by tlie condition of the muscular substance ; for this gradually

loses its irritability after real death, so that it can no longer be excited to contraction by

electrical                                  or  other  kind of  stimulation and the                                                      loss of irritability is succeeded bv the
                                                                                                                                      ;

appearance of cadaveric rigidity. So long, then, as the muscle retains its irritability and

remains free from rigidity, so long we may say with certainty that it is not dead ; and the

persistence of its vitality for an unusual period affords a presumption in favour of the

continuance of                                  some       degree of vital action  in  the                                               body generally                                                                               whilst, on  the  other
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

hand, the entire loss of irritability and the supervention of rigidity afford conclusive evi-

dence that death has occurred.

On this the present writer would remark that although the persistence of muscular

irritability affords strong presumptive evidence of the existence of .systemic life, yet it

cannot be invariably relied upon, inasmuch as the irritability may in cases of excessive inter-
stitial change increase after the molecular death of the nervous masses and the final arrest
of the. Mood-current. On the other hand, universal rigor mortis, the result of the absence

of blood or suitable nutritional plasma, is a certain evidence of death whenever the circum-
stances of the case imply that the nervous system has also been subjected to a simultaneous

absence of itsjiroper nutrition, inasmuch as it appears to be a law without exception, that,

if muscular and nervous tissues be simultaneously shut off from their source of nutrition,

the molecular life of the nervous tissue is the fli-st to succumb. It is, however, possible

to conceive of certain spasmodic affections of the minute arteries supplying muscular
tissue in warm bloods inducing rigor rapidly, in the same manner as deligation of arterial

trunks                                      and if at the  same time it  should happen from any collateral circumstance                                                                                                                                that
                                         ;

this condition of vascular spasm did not extend to the nervous masses, somatic death

would not necessarily be implied even by the existence of rigor. Universal putresceuce is

therefore the only absolute evidence of death.

mainly derived from the study of phenomena which are best and most con-
stantly seen in cold-blooded animals, but which nevertheless, under favour-

able circumstances, may be observed in warm-bloods, and, in special patho-
logical conditions, in the case of man himself :

   1. That the property of ii'ritabihty in muscle is capable of a high de^ee
of exaltation above the normal standard, and that the highest degree of sus-
ceptibility is attained in cold-bloods long after death, or under conditions
tantamount to death, as before defined.

    2. That the forces of nerve and muscle, the neimlity of the former and
the irritability of the latter, are not only independent of each other for their
existence and maintenance, but actually possess an antagonistic relation;

that is to say, nerve-tissue, instead of producing, is, when in action, constantly

concerned in maintaining a condition of things which diminishes muscular
irritability, and that not simply when it is engaged in the production of
motion. Hence muscular tissue, relieved from the operation or influence of
nerve-tissue, gradually acquires exalted contractile powers either in the pre-

sence or absence of the blood.
    3. That the blood, or the nutritional plasma derived therefrom, not only

furnishes the materials by which musciilar irritability is maintained, but is
likewise the determining cause of that polar arrangement of the muscular
molecules which maintains or restores the elongated or relaxed state.

    It is a well-obsei'ved fact in physiology, that after the death of animals the
irritability of the muscles frequently exhibits itself in an abnormal manner.
In the living animal or the amputated limb, the contractions which are in-

ducible by the application of stimuh, such as galvanism, pinching, or striking,

are of a pulsatory character ; that is to say, the contraction is limited in extent

and speedily gives place to relaxation ; but in the cases where the peculiarity
alluded to is present, the contractions following on such stimuli are more ex-
tensive and persistent, and simulate very perfectly contraction induced by
volition. The same pecuHar exalted susceptibility has also been witnessed in

man after death from certain forms of disease, more particularly in cholera

and yellow fever.
    Dr. Bennett Dowler, by experimenting upon amputated limbs, proved the

dependence of this phenomenon upon muscular irritability alone. It is as-
serted, not only that in some of these cases the movements can be excited by

mechanical stimulation, but that they not unfrequently occm- spontaneously,
and strongly resemble the actions of the living state. Carpenter quotes the

--case of an Irishman, aged 28, in whom the following series of movements took

place spontaneously not long after the cessation of the respiration : " First

the left hand was carried by a regular motion to the throat and then to the
crown of the head ; the right arm followed the same route on the right side ;
the left arm was then carried back to the thi-oat and from thence to the breast,
reversing all its original motions, and finally the right hand and arm did exactly
the same." This hyper- irritable condition of the muscular system attracted
the notice of Dr. Brown Sequard, and he found it to present itself more con-
stantly in young animals. This experience of Brown Sequard's is conform-

able with my own ; but I have also been fortunate enough to observe it in
cold-bloods with sufficient frequency to enable me to study it. It is well

known that in many particulars the young of warm-bloods are analogous to

 the cold-bloods ; and one of these is the length of time that muscular irrita-

 bility persists.

   I will now cite two or three experiments in illustration of this exalted

state.

    AApril 7, 1863.-- frog carefully etherized, was placed upon his back, and

  the heart was excised. The frog was then left till the following morning, a
*period of 13 hours. At this time the webs and toes were in a diied stale

 n^but the muscles responded with extreme readiness to slight blows, but were
        thrown into contraction when pinched by forceps. They were very
  susceptible to weak galvanism. These observations on the muscular system
  having been made, the nervous system was tested by removing the head and

  attempting to irritate the cord. Galvanizing the cord would not excite the

  muscles even when a copper wire was thrust low down into its substance.
  The cord, in fact, seemed quite incapable of either initiating or conveyin^^
  any stimulus to the muscles. The sciatic nerve was now raised upon a glass
  tube, and it was found that it could not be excited by the strongest galvanism
  The neurility or special life of the nervous system was in fact gone; ivMle
  the peculiar life of muscular structure, viz. its irritability, had become preter-

  naturally exalted.

Another frog having been etherized till incapable of exhibiting any reflex
phenomena (that is to say, until the nervous system was temporarily extin-
gmshed), the muscular system was stm, under these conditions, highly sensi-
tive to galvamsm. The frog did not recover from the etherization. It was
aUowed to remam aU night
                                                                                                                        ;  and its  muscles were stiU foimd  susceptible to

galvanism in a high degree, but not to other modes of stimulation. The
mnervous matter of the cord was now broken down and removed, and the body
placed  a little water to prevent desiccation. It was again left aH nio-ht ·

and on the foUowmg morning the muscles were found to be exceedinqh, sus-

ceptible to slight bloivs or pinchings including not only the skin but also a small
portion of muscular substance. These motions simulated in their extent and
power volitionid movements. They were excited with the utmost ease, and
seemed to ordinary observers to be purposive acts resulting from sensation.

found ordinarily sensitive to galvanism." It is necessary to state that the
limb exhibiting these effects had been paralyzed, so far as nervous influence
is concerned, for 63 houi-s, and deprived of blood for at least 6.

  We have here, then, three examples in which this phenomenon has been _
·produced artificially, and one iu which it occurred naturally. In all of them

the leadinrj feature is, that the nervous and vascular functions ceased to e,vi^

--long prior to the production of the exalted state of the muscular system i]lj#^

case 13, in another 15, and in a third 36 hours ; and in the last example

Wenervous influence had been absent for 63 houi'S, and blood for 6 hom-s.

must not hastily infer from these experiments that it is simply necessary to

destroy these functions iu order to secure this hyper-irritable condition of

the muscular system.

   It is needless to say that cold-bloods may be destroyed in numerous ways

which altogether prevent the exhibition of this peculiarity. Thus, if the head
be cru-ihed, the condition of the nei-vous system, which arrests suddenly the
action of the heart, appears also to impair the powers of the general system of

muscles, and causes rigor to supervene at a comparatively early period.
    Again, in death by stiychnia the irritability of the muscles is diminished

and they pass quickly into the state of rigor, the flexors of the lund limbs

prior to the extensors.

    In death by CO" the irritability is depressed and rigor comes on quickly.
    Muscles subjected to chlorine lose their irritabiUty very quickly indeed,
and the state of rigor follows more rapidly than in any of the other cases.
    Prolonged action of weak ether vapour removes every trace of irritability,

and paves the way to early rigor.

     Again, if after the section of the spinal cord at the junction of the atlas
 and occiput the creature can still control his limbs (as frequently happens

 with frogs), the post mortem exaltation of the muscles will be much less
likely to occur than if the section was lower down, so as to completely

 paralyze them*.

* In the existing condition of neural physiology it may perhaps be desirable to offer some

explanation of the above remarks. To those who are pi-actically engaged in physiological

experiment, it must be apparent that our present views of the functions of the cerebro-

spinal system await considerable modification, if not reconstruction. Certain it is that to

deprive" some vertebrates of their entire cerebral organs is by no means to destroy their

capacity for wilHng and feeling. To Mr. Gr. H. Lewes belongs the credit of having first

prominently brought forward this highly important fact, in an admirable and logical essay

on the nervous system, to be found in his second volume of ' The Physiology of Common

Life.' Since perusing this essay I have repeatedly made experiments upon the matter, both

myin private and publicly before  class and colleagues, with the most unequivocal results.

The matter is so important that I may be pardoned the insertion of an illustrative experi-

ment. On March 30, 1863, 9.50 a.m.', I struck ofi', with a sharp chisel, the head of a frog.

At 10 o'clock the creature spontaneously drew up its extended limbs into the normal flexed
position beneath its body, and then moved itself round in a circular manner three or four

times. It then remained quite stUl for five minutes, and then again turned round a fourth
of a circle after the fashion of the unmutilated animal. At 10.8 made another turn, and
afterwards commenced to r/iove freely about the table as ifveri/ little had happened. " 10.40.

This frog has executed several S2)ontaneous leaps. At 11.45 I found it still crawling about.

If in leaping it came down on its back, which it seemed liable to do, by struggling it soon
righted itself. 1.20. This frog is even more vigorous, and leaps and moves about more

freelv than before." I now cut off the upper portion of the spinal column and included cord;
the trog was tremulously convulsed, but after a short time drew up its limbs, and moved

again spontaneously. The removal of the last portion put a stop to the action of the

larynx. Of such experiments as these I possess numerous records ; but the above is suffi-

cient for our purpose. It will'occur to the reader that Marshall Hall laid particular stress

upon what he deemed to be a cardinal fact in neural physiology, viz. that no spontaneous

movements ever occurred in decapitated animals. On the truth of this observation he based
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              :

                                                                                                                    ON MUSCULAR IRRITABILITY.                            161

The general deduction -warranted by the experiments seems to he, that

any mode of death which tends to inteifere with the processes generating

muscular force, either by acting directly on the muscular tissue or indirectly

by exciting the nervous tissue to the consumption of muscular force, is op-

posed to the production of this exalted state ; on the other hand, modes of

death which quietly destroy the nervous system by sedation or by with-

hoMing its nutrition (blood), and at the same time do not interfere materially

with the muscular system, seem favourable to its production.

The extensive character of the contraction which takes place during this

exalted state of muscular tissue appears to result from a propagative action

e. g., in the most sensitive state it is simply necessary to include the smallest

portion of a muscle within a pair of forceps, or to touch a single spot with the

point of a fine needle, to excite contraction in a considerable portion of the

muscular mass. As in the case of the heart, a few fasciculi immediately

subjected to stimulation contract, and in the act excite contraction in con-

tiguous fasciculi                                                          and                                      in this way the effect  rapidly spreads  throughout  the
                                                                        ;

muscle, and, by calling into i^lay a large number of elements, induces a marked

and continuous contraction allied to that produced by the medium of the

nerves.

   The nervous stimulus seems to differ from other modes of stimulation in
the effect produced, mainly in the fact that it can call at once into effective

action considerable masses of muscular structure by virtue of the minute
distribution of its filaments among the muscular elements. In the ease be-
fore us a similar effect seems to be brought about by a preternatural degree

of exeitabihty on the part of the muscular tissue itself.

   In dealing with my second proposition, it is not my intention to recapitu-

late the many arguments which have been adduced to" show the independence

of muscular iriitability of nerve-force. I wish simply to demonstrate that

in all cases where nerve-influence may be considered in active operation
there is a diminution of muscular irritability, and that, conversely, when

that influence is cut off from muscle, there is a tendency in the muscular
force to accumulate. In all animals there is a marked distinction in the states
of the nervous and muscular systems during mental activity, and the condition

his theory of reflex or excito-motory action. The arguments of Dr. Hall may be briefly
summed up thus:-- If cold-blooded animals or the young of warm-bloods be decapitated,

or their brains removed, irritants applied to their bodies will still induce movements. That

the animals have lost the power of volition is maintained on the ground thai they perform

no spontaneous movevients ; and inasmuch as volition is the secojid link in the cliain of which

sensation is the first and motion the last, the creatures cannot possess sensibility ; there-
fore the movements which follow irritation, however purposive or adapted to ends they

may seem, are not the result of either sensation or volition, inasmuch as these are proper-

ties of the brain alone                                                                                             therefore  they result  from a purely mechanical arrangement, the
                                                                                                                 ;

principle of the operation of which is that any excitation applied to the extremities of

sensory nerves is conveyed to the nervous centre and there reflected on to a motor nerve,

which in its turn stimulates muscle into action, no sensation whatever being perceived. In

respect to these opinions of Dr. Hall, I would remark that, whether or no the absence of
spontaneous movement proves the absence of volition, it is quite certain that the converse

is true, viz. that the presence of spontaneous movement proves the existence of volition
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and, as seen in the above experiment, the decapitated trunk gives all the evidence we can

have or ever do have of the possession of both volition and sensation : the whole theory of
Marshall Hall is completely disproved and subverted, and the brain can no longer be re-

garded as the exclusive seat of these powers. In order to secure success in this expe-

riment, certain precautions are necessary. 1. No anesthetic should be used, as it materially

decreases the chance of recovei-y. 2. The hemorrhage must be trifling. 3. Tiie nervous

tissue must be cut, not crushed. To achieve these conditions, the angles of the mouth

.should be slit sufficiently far back to allow of the removal of tlie head by means of a sharp

chisel                                 the lower jaw, tongu?, and principal vessels are then uniutcrfered with.

in wliich volition is cut off from its nervous associations. Ey the state of
mental activity, I mean simply the waking state of an animal, in contradi-
stinction to the condition which obtains dming profound sleep, fainting, or

complete etherization.

   During the waking state the muscular sj'stcm of an animal is maintained,
through the medium of the nervous, in a condition of slight contraction, in
which the muscles firmly balance or steady each other, and thus the will
holds firm possession of the muscular organism. It would appear that this
active volitional state involves a constant expenditure of neuro -muscular
force. In profound sleep and allied conditions this psycho-neui-al influence
ceases to operate upon the muscular system ; hence we find the head falls
forward upon the chest, the arms sink down, the fingers relax ; if the person

is standing he may fall down, or if sitting slide from his chair ; the eyes

become closed, &c.
    In fainting and death the same powerless, flaccid condition of the muscular

system is seen in excess ; yet in all these cases the elasticity and irritability
of the muscular system still exist.

    Sleep, fainting, deep etherization, and death seem to represent different

degrees of what may be called functional neural paralysis, in contradistinc-

tion to purely muscular, iu which the irritability of the muscular tissue is
diminished or gone, while the nexirUity of the nervous centres and nerves

remains.

   When we reflect that the mere waking state of animals involves a con-

stant expenditure of both nervous and muscular force, the importance of
sleep for their reaccumulation becomes obvious. It is not, therefore, alone
in the production of motion that the will consumes ueuro-muscular force,
but also in the maintenance of the normal position of the animal ; for few
muscles of the body are during the waking state iu a condition of non-con-
trol or laxity; most are subjected to continuous stimulation of a mild form.

In the tremulousness of old age, or after exhausting disease, we mtness the

effect of deficiency of this tonic power.

    Whenever the mind has to make a greater effort than usual for the accom-

plishment of an act, it is an evidence that the forces of the sj^stem are below
par, and do not respond with their accustomed delicacy to the influence or

stimulus of the Avill ; in such cases the animal is said in common parlance to

be tired or fatigued.

   The degree of stimulation exercised by nerve upon muscle may be normal

or abnormal ; and in proportion to the severity of the stimulation will be
the rapidity ^vith which irritability -nail be cojisumed and rigor mortis

supervene.
    There appear to be three conditions of nerve in resjiect to the muscular

tissue :

    1. It may exist as a mere structure, i. e. functionally inactive.
   2. It may be in that condition vrhich enables an animal so to control its

limbs as to maintain any required position.

    3. It may be concerned in producing actual movement.

    The two latter conditions appear to be degrees of the same kind of action.

   We wish to ascertain by dii'cct experiment whetiier all or any of these

 conditions of nerve are concerned in exhausting muscular irritability.

    This is by no means an easy matter ; for although we have abundance of

experimental evidence from the negative stand-point, that u-ritability is ex-

 alted, in the ahsence of nerve-influence, it is difficult to devise reliable experi-

 ments in siipport of the positive proposition. The reasons of this wiU become

 more obvious as we proceed to review the interesting experiments which
 clear the ground. It will be well to bear in mind the conditions necessary
 to a successful experiment, as the bearing of the after remarks wiU be more

 apparent.

    1. The source of irritability, viz. the blood, must be cut off from two sym-
 metrical limbs of the same animal.

    2. The possibility of nervous supply must be cut off in one limb and

 retained in the other.

    Three animals (in all respects similar) so situated must be taken.
    One must be placed under conditions which enable the limb with the nerve
intact to remain in a flaccid, uncontrolled state, equivalent to the condi-
tion of volitional paralysis ; another must be caused to maintain continuous
 control over the limb, without the induction of motor acts ; the third to

exercise the Hmb and contract the muscles.
    These conditions being achieved, we have to note in which of these cases

rigor mortis of the limb supplied with nerve sets in earlier than in the other
limb deprived of both nerve and blood. This will furnish us with the com-
parative rate at which the irritability is exhausted in limbs so situated.

    The next question is, whether such an experimental combination is pos-

sible.

    At the very threshold an insurmountable obstacle meets us in the tase of
warm-blooded animals ; for in them to cut off the supply of blood is to induce
immediate paralysis, which is rapidly succeeded by the condition of rigor
mortis. This is weU illustrated in the effect of deligation of the abdominal

aorta. Diu-ing the early stages of the paralysis thus induced in the hind

extremities, both the nerves and muscles are susceptible to the stimulus of

galvanism, and sensation is likewise perfect. Why, therefore, is it that

volition is unable to influence these limbs ? The same, and similar experi-

ments upon cold-bloods enable me to answer this question. I find that if, in

these creatures, the cii'culation be cut off from a limb in which the nerve is

--still allowed to remain, the paralysis is not immediate in fact, does not come

on for a period of from one to three hours, the frog during this interval being
able to xise the limb ; but at length we get the same condition of complete
paralysis which obtains at once in the warm-bloods. The following experi-

--ment will Ulustrate this :

  --August 11, 6 P.M. 1866. ^A large frog was taken and thoroughly ether-

ized. The arteiy supplying one of the hind limbs was taken up and tied,
and then cut below the ligature. The hgature was applied to prevent
general bleeding. The nerve was then raised up out of the way, and the
whole of the structui-es of the thigh were cut through to the bone, leaving
the nerve intact. The skin was then brought together with sutures. In
rather over an hour the frog began to respire, and I found he possessed
sensibility in the Kmb, and was also able to move it a Little. 10 p.m. The
frog seemed to have complete control over the partially amputated limb in
all those muscles still possessing bony connexions. 8 a.m. Aug. 12. The
limb was found to be completely paralyzed, but quite flaccid. It possessed

--very little irritability quite a marked difference in this respect between the

two Umbs. The limb is now dragged after the body at full length. Its
sensation api^ears ferfect. 4 p.m. The paralyzed limb is now void of all
in-itcdnlity, as tested by galvanism. It is, hotuever, still flaccid, and the sen-
sibility to pain normal. 9 a.m. Aug. 13. The paralyzed limb is now in a

state of riyor, and there is an entire absence of sensation.

   In this case, as in others of the kind, we observe there is a gradual dimi-

                                                                     m2

nution of muscular irritability. But this wiU not account for the paralysis

for we have many examples in which frogs would move their limbs by voli-

mtional effort, where the uscles are far less irritable, and rapidly passing into

a rigid state ; such examples are furnished by certain stages of thermal
tetanus. The following experiment wiU throw light upon the real causes of

the paralysis.

    August 10, 4 P.M. Compression was exercised upon the abdominal aorta
of a frog. It was then ascertained by the microscope that the cii'culation in
the limbs was completely arrested. The sciatic nerve of one limb was then

divided. The paralysis of this Umb was complete. The creature had per-

fect control over the limb deprived of blood, hut with the nerve intact. In
about an hour afterwards it was observed tliat, although quite vigorous, it
had lost all control over this limb. I tested the muscles of both limbs for
irritability, and found them in both cases tolerably sensitive. The distal
extremity of the cut nerve is also ii-ritable. 10 p.m. The limb possessing
its nerve remains perfectly paralyzed, and is, with the other limb, dragged

after the frog at fuU length. The tourniquet was now removed from the
 aorta, and the creature placed in water. At this time the muscular irrita-
 bility was at a very low ebb. At 8 a.m. Aug. 11, the frog was much in
 the same condition ; the limb in possession of its nerve and artery was still

 completely paralyzed, although the muscles of both limbs had acquired in-

 creased susceptibility to galvanism. On examining the webs, I fomid a free
 circulation now going on in both limbs. The sensation in the skin of the
 paralyzed limb possessing the nerve is perfect. 1 p.m. No return of motor
 power in the anatomically perfect Umb. 9 a.m. Aug. 12. The limb is stiU

 paralyzed, but the muscles are very irritable, in fact, more than normallij so.
 At 8 a.m. Aug. 13, the firog was placed under the influence of strychnia, to
 ascertain if the nervous impulses generated by the drug would pass over the
 nervous obstruction and contract the highly irritable muscles. Not the
 slightest effect, however, was produced.

    This experiment shows that in thus ciitting off blood from a limb we in-

 terfere seriously with the functions of the motor nerve ; and as in animals

 deprived of blood the excitability of nerve-tissue is always first to perish, it
 is legitimate to assume that this degradation of the nerve is the primary
 effect of cutting off the blood from a limb, and therefore the cause of the
 paralysis. This functional degradation of the nerve being brought about

 immediately in warm-bloods and gradually in cold bloods, is consistent "with
 aU our knowledge of the differing degrees of vital persistence possessed by
 these classes respectively. This experiment further proves that the nerve

 may sufter past restoration by prolonged absence of blood, but that the mus-

--cular irritability may be completely restored in fact, exalted.

     The question as to the part of the motor neive (tlie trunk or the terminal
 branches) concerned in the paralysis is one of extreme interest. Inasmuch

 as the sensory fibres still convey their impressions, it seems probable that the
 defect in the nerve must lie in its ultimate distributions to the muscular

 tissue ; otherwise we should have to consider that the motor fibres of the

 trunk of a nerve are dependent upon the general circulation of a limb for
 their integrity, and that the nutrition of the sensory fibres of the same trunk
 is maintained in some other way. There seems to be a remarkably interesting
 analogy between this form of paralysis and that induced by the action of the

 woorara poison*.

    How* is it that the terminations of the motor nerves in muscles are so interfered with,

  wliile neither the trunk or its ramifications, nor the muscular tissue, appears to be affected
                                                                                                         ON MUSCULAR IKKIT.VBlLITy.  165

   Comprehending now more fully the nature of the paraljsis which results
from depriving limbs of blood, we are in a position to see that whatever in-
fluence nerve may exercise in exhausting irritability, when the source of its

replenishment is cut off, must necessarily he exercised prior to the accession of
the paralysis ; for this form of paralysis affecting the ultimate distributions

may be regarded as equivalent to the absence of nerve-tissue ; and under

such circumstances the irritable muscular tissue represents the condition and

capacity of living muscle freed from nerve-influence.

It is clear, then, as the terminal distributions of the nerves to the muscles

of warm-bloods hecome at once insensible to the stimulus of volition, that the
nerve in these cases can have no influence in hastening rigor by exhavisting

irritability, and the accession of rigor mortis here must therefore be referred

entirely to absence of the blood ; for in these cases we are not even distiirbed
by speculations as to the possible influence exercised upon the muscle by

the mei-e jjresence of living nerve-tissue in a state of inaction.

  We see, then, that the question with which we started is one capable of

solution only by experiments upon cold-bloods carried out in the manner

previously indicated                                                                                     for in these only is it possible for nervous influence to act
                                                                                                      ;

uponmuscidar irritability in the absoice of the blood, and in. these tor a limited

period only, but, nevertheless, sufficiently long to prove whether or not the

mere presence of inactive living nerve climinishes muscular irritability, or

whether the loss of irritability is appreciable only when the muscle is either

controlled or induced to contract by nervous influence. Space will not permit

me to recite the complicated experiments by which the necessary conditions

were achieved, and I must content myself in this place by briefly stating the

deductions arrived at.

1. Mere presence of living nerve in a state of inaction neither hastens nor

retards the accession of rigor, and therefore has no influence on irritability.
   2. The condition of nerve concerned in simple muscular control and in

contraction leads to earlier rigor mortis, and therefore possesses the power of

exhausting irritability.

   Leaving now this aspect of the question, we proceed to inquire what
evidence do we possess that muscular irritability is capable of abnormal ex-

altation in the absence of nerve, or in those uncontrolled powerless states of

the muscular system which, from the absence of volitional impulse, are equi-

valent thereto.

First, we have the fact that if one limb of a frog be paralyzed by sec-

tion of its nerve, after a certain jyeriod has elcqised it will be found more

susceptible to the various forms of external stimulation than the other limb
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and if such an animal be killed or happen to die, the limb in which the nerve

is intact «dll lose its irritability, and pass into the state of rigor, long prior

to the limb the nerve of which has been divided.

   Dr. Radclrffe remarks, " Many experiments might be mentioned, all of

which seem to show more or less clearly that the disposition to convulsive
muscular contraction is inversely related to the supply of nervous influence
to the muscles." Vide ' Lancet,' 1863, vol. i. p. 321. This is in the main cor-
rect, but it renders no support to the inhibitory theory of nervous action as
propounded by its talented author. The readiness tvith which muscle contracts
is cdwuys in direct proportion to the amount of force accumulated in its struc-

ture, or, in other words, to its irritability. It is not that the absence of nerve

past restoration? Is there any intermediate tissue differing from nerve or muscle -wjiich
forms the bond of union between them ?
                                                                                           ;

produces a greater proclivity to contraction in the mnsele, but that tLe muscle
in the absence of nerve can accumulate the force on which irritability depends.
In all the experiments in which muscle contracts more readily in the absence
of nerve, the element time is an important ingredient ; for if its influence be
excluded, the opposite condition, viz. tJuif 7in(scJe contracts more readily in the

presence of nerve-injluence, is the normal law, as I hope shortly to show.
    To the fact that muscle relieved from nerve-influence acquires additional

contractile energy I add the further important observation, that it retains its

irritability not uufrequently for days after its fellow has passed into the

state of rigor mortis.

    The experiment just cited also tends to show that the presence of nerve in
action keeps down muscular irritability and initiates rigor mortis, as before
demonstrated ; for we see that when blood is circulating equally thi-ough two
limbs, the irritability of the one cannot be maintained at the same standard in

the presence of the nerve. If rigor mortis could be regarded as a contraction,
it might be supposed, in accordance with old notions, that the dying nervous

system had something to do \\'ith its premature induction ; but as rigor is a
mere setting of the muscular tissue, this idea has not a shadow of probability *
besides the rigor will supervene in the limbs simultaneously in cases in which
the death of the animal succeeds immediately the section of the nerve.

    Dr. Brown Sequard has fui-nished us with a most beautiful experiment which
bears intimately upon the present question, and which also has been used by

 Dr. Eadcliffe to siipport the proposition, " that the state of muscular relaxation
is more readily disturbed by contraction, and tliat the contraction itself is more

powerful when the muscles are receiving a diminished supply of nervous in-

--fluence." The experiment is as foUows : Two frogs (A and B) are taken and

their spinal cords divided low down in the ccr^ical region so as to remove the
 lower limbs from the control of the brain and medulla oblongata. In such
 cases the reflex (?) contractions induced by pinching the toes are capable of
raising heavier weights than could be raised by the hind limbs when the
 frogs were in their normal condition. Thus they raised before division of the

 cord GO grammes. Immediatdy after division A raised 20 and B 10 grammes
Aonly. In five minutes raised 45 grammes and B only 30 ; thus they pro-
ceed increasing rajndly in power, till in four hours A can sustam 140 grammes

 and B 130. At the cud of twenty-four hours they are found to have reached
 their maximum point, \\z. 150 and 140 grammes respectively.

    The first point worthy of notice in this important experiment is, that a

Adegree of shock was produced by the operation in frog measured by a loss

 of power equivalent to 40 grammes, and in frog B to 50 grammes. This

 diminished power would be entireh" due to loss of nervous force and muscular

--irritability, chiefiy the former, partly the direct result of severe injuiy to the

 nervoTis centres, and partly of loss of blood and depression of the heart's

 action.

   ASecondly, it would be at this period, wheu could raise but 20 and B 10

 grammes onlj' while suffering from shock, that the nervous influence would
 he at its lowest ebb ; and if the muscles possessed a fail' amount of irritability
 (which they certainly do) after such operations, this should be, if Dr. Rad-

 cliife's views are correct, the period at which the (jrealcd weights conld be

 raised ; for the period of profoundest nervous shock admitting of neural ex-

 citement of the muscles would be the one in which the miuimum degree of

 nervous influence exists.

      But it is evident that the muscular and nervous systems progressively
  acquire force from this shock -point, stopping not at their normal amount,
  but reaching a marvellously abnormal degree of exaltation, and this under
  the very conditions 1 have pointed out as leading to nervous and muscular

  exaltation, viz. the absence of the exhausting principle of volition or nerve

  in action.

    We see, then, by these experiments that muscles possess no abnormal

  powers immediately after they are liberated from nerve-influence, as in section
  of the sciatic, or after they are removed from the influence of the upper part

 of the cord, but that these are gradualhj acciuired, many hours being con-
 sumed in reaching the maximum degree. The correct explanation, therefore,

 of Sequard's experiment would seem to be, not that muscle contracts more
 readily in the absence of nervous influence, but that, in the absence of voli-
 tional or other excitement, both the nervous and muscular systems can accu-
 mulate their own special forces, and that to an extent that can never become
 apparent under normal life conditions. Thus, in the experiment, 60 grammes
 measure the nervo-museular force of the frogs when unmutilated. After the

 operation the frog B suflers more from shock, and the sum of its nervo-

 muscular force is represented in consequence by just half that of the other,

 Aor one-sixth of its normal force ; possesses after the operation one-third of

 its normal force. The nervoiis system gradually recovers from the influence

 of shock, but is no longer stimulated by volition, and therefore no longer

 controls the muscles in the usual way ; consequently they remain flaccid or
 paralyzed, and this gives them an opportunity of accumulating force, which

 they gradually do till they acquire nearly three times their normal amount.
 The exact proportions in which this acciimulated force is divided between the

 nervous and muscular systems is a delicate subject for future consideration.
    The fact is here broadly stated, that the psychical principle of volition do-

 minates and exhausts both the nervous and muscular systems, and that in the

 absence of this influence they acquire exalted powers*.

    I propose now to turn for a short time to a consideration of the part which
the blood plays in connexion with muscular contraction. The following is

the proposition which I shall endeavour to maintain :

    That the blood or nutritional plasma derived therefrom not only furnishes

the materials by which muscular contractility is maintained, but is likewise
the determining cause of that polar arrangement of the muscular molecules
which maintaius or restores the elongated or relaxed state.

    * In June 1866, Professor Frankland read a paper to the Eoyal Institution of Great

Britain " On the Source of Muscular Force," which contains the following passage :
" The combustible food and osvgen coexist in the blood which courses through the muscle

Ahut when the muscle is at rest there is no chemical action between them. command is sent

from the brain to the muscle, the nervous agent determines oxidation. The potential
energy becomes active energy, one portion assuming the form of motion, another appear-
ing as heat. Here is the source of animal heat, here the origin of muscular foioer. Like
the piston and cylinder of a steam-engine, the muscle itself is only a machine for the
transformation of heat into motion." The reader will at once perceive that tliis idea of
muscular force being generated only during nervou,s action is quite incompatible with tlie
experiments and views of the author of this paper. There can be no doubt that chemical
action is constantly taking place between certain elements of muscle and blood, and thctt
force is being continuously stored, nervous action being concerned in its consumption, and
discharge ratlier than its formation. As to heat, it is certainly generated in other portions
of the body besides the muscidar structures ; and if nervous action is necessary to oxidation,
how is this heat produced ?

   The piston and cylinder are a means of regidating mere repellent force ; but muscle is a.
mechanism having the power to convert some fluid, which is either electricity or a close
correlate, into a source of botli repellent and attractive power ; for it is only by assuming
two such forces that the phenomena of elongation and contraction can be explained.

168 BEPORT--1866.

   Last year, when treating iipon the question of rigor mortis, I drew the

attention of the Section to a form of muscidar contraction induced in cold-
bloods by the irritant action of such vapours as ether, chloroform, bisulpliuret
of carbon, amylene, &c. I pointed out that they were the most extreme
forms of contraction of which these muscles were capable. The persistent,
in most cases permanent character of the contraction at once associated it
with the forms of tetanus induced by water of certain temperatures and by
the discharge from Ruhnikorft'''s coil. The extreme delicacy of this mode of

exciting muscular contraction by ethereal vapours has enabled me to perform

some very interesting and instructive experiments.
    I have succeeded in proving, by experiments in which the nervous

system has, as far as possible, been removed, and, better still, by experiments

on isolated muscles, (1) that both chloroform and warm water act directli/

vpon and produce universal contraction of the muscular tissue, which, accord-

ing to the circumstances of its induction, may or mail not he permanent ; (2) that
when the nervous and vascular systems are present they complicate the

result, and furnish us with illustrations of most important physiological prin-

ciples.

   Taking first Tiieemal Tetaxfs, I find two normal limbs ((. e. supplied with

both blood and nerve-influence) contract simultaneously. Two limbs de-

prived of both blood and nerve-influence also contract simultaneously. Of
two limbs, the one having neither nerve nor blood, and the other both nerve
and blood, the latter contracts first. Of two limbs, the one having
neither nerve nor blood, and the other blood only, the former contracts fu'st.

    In CnLORoroKJi Tetaxus the same holds good as in the first two examples
of thermal tetanus ; but of two limbs, tlie one having neither blood nor nerve,
and the other having both blood and nerve, the former contracts first. Of
two limbs, the one having neither blood nor nerve, and the other nerve

but no blood, the latter contracts first.

   An analysis of these various results shows that both v»'arm water and chlo-

roform exercise an excitant action upon the nervous system of the frog,

which tends in both cases in the direction of muscular contraction, but which
of itself alone is too weak to bring about such an affection of muscle, and,

further, that the warm water is more powerfid in this respect than the chlo-

roform. It also aftbrds evidence of the important i)rinciple, that certain
elements of the blood in the interstices of the muscular tissue oppose a

powerful obstacle to such agencies as tend to throw muscular tissue into a

state of contraction.

   Mxiscle when dynamically perfect is related, on the one hand, to certain
stimuli, as nerve and external agents, which tend to induce contraction, and,
on the other, to some of the elements of blood, which bring about its elongation

but its degree of proneness to fall into contraction appears to be directly pro-

--portionate to the amount of force generated in it by the blood in other

words, to its irritability ; and although the galvanometric evidences of the

existence of force are masJced during contraction by the derived electro-

motor currents taking on the negative variation, yet this by no means

proves (as some suppose) tliat the hlood-gcneratcd forces are absent; for we

have previously seen in explaining Scquard's experiment that the contractive

energy, i. e. the tendency of the molecules of muscles to approach each other,

may be increased two-and-a-half times, which is at once proof that they do

not approach by virtue of any lyermanent force which they possess as mere

physical atoms                                                                for such force would be a fixed and not a varying quantity.
                                                                           ;

It is evident therefore that both the power of contraction and of elongation

is derived from the blood; and not the elongating force alone; and we must

not, with Dr. Eadcliife, fall into the error of considering that muscle neces-

sarily passes into a state of contraction in the absence of an elongating force;

for experiment shows that the most perfectly relaxed state of muscle is com-

patible with the absence of every trace of irritabilitj'.

I shall nowproceed to narrate several experiments in which the relation

which blood bears to muscular tissue is more fully displayed, and by which it
is made evident that the blood gives the poAver by which the elongated or,

--Arelaxed state of muscle is maintained.
Exp. 1.                       frog is moderately chloroformed; when removed from the

vapour, particular note is made that the limbs are perfectly flaccid or relaxed,

and that the heart is beating. The heart is now exposed and excised, and in

a few seconds or miautes, accorchng to the amount of chloroform imbibed by
the tissues, the Umbs ivill spontaneoushj extend and become rhjidhj tetanic.

   Another fi'og was slightly chloroformed, and the observation made that

the heart was still actiag, and that the whole of the muscles were quite
flaccid. The structures of one thigh Avere then cut through to the bone, so

as to sever all nervous and vascular connexions. The muscles of this limb
gradually commenced to contract, and in a fcAV minutes the leg and foot were
extended and the webs stretched out. The muscles of the other limb and

the trunk generally remained in a completely relaxed state. After the lapse

of some minutes I observed a tendency in the unmutilated hmb to extend,

and in the fore feet to approach the central line of the body, and to clasp,

as in tetanus of the male frog. Directing my attention to the heart, I

could not detect any pulsation, and I therefore removed the parietcs of the

chest ; the access of air reexcited the action of the heart, and very quickly

the muscles of the unmutilated limb and general trunk became again flaccid.
The heart again losing power, the condition of contraction a second time

came on, and gradually became more and more complete. On reexamining

this frog after the lapse of an hour, I found that the muscles had again
become flaccid--this time not only in the unmutilated limb, fore feet, and
muscles of the trimk, but also in the limb which, as far as its soft parts were
concerned, was completely amputated. Not the slightest trace of irritability,

however, was now detectable. Nothing could be plainer than the teaching

of this experiment. The muscular tissue was subjected to a dual influence :--

first, the chloroform tending to excite it to contract; secondly, the blood,

or certain of its elements, tending to maintain it in the relaxed or elongated

state                    and  accordingly  as  one  or  other  of  these  influences prevailcct, the
                      ;

muscles became alternately contracted or relaxed. After the cessation of the

circulation the antagonism was feebly continued bctAvecn the evaporating

traces of the chloroform on the one hand, and the interstitial juices of the

muscle on the other, the balance of power being so nicely adjusted that the

interstitial nutrition Avas just capable of restoring the relaxed condition, but
incapable of conferring the slightest degree of irritability upon the muscles.

It is rarely that we obtain this exact balance of the influences ; for if the
amount of chloroform in the muscles is too large, the condition of permanent

contraction obtains ; and if too small, there are shght evidences of returning

irritability after the muscle has become elongated.

   Another satisfactory mode of exhibiting this function of the blood is to
compress the abdominal aorta of a frog, and, having ascertained by the

microscope that the circulation in the lower limbs is securely arrested, oil all

parts of the body, Avith the exception of one limb, expose this to the vapour

of chloroform, protecting as much as possible all other portions of the body
from its influence. This limb wiU after a time shoAV a disposition to con-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;;

  tract. It should then be removed from the vapour ; and when it has become

  fully extended, the tourniquet should be taken off; the blood will then

 gradually find its way into the limb, and restore the flaccid elongated con-

  dition.

     In this experiment we have the contrast of two limbs without blood, one
 of which is under a contracting influence ; and we get an excess of chloro-

 form in the tissues of one limb and protect the animal to a great extent from
 being generally aiFected. As might be expected, this state of contraction

 is never so easy to produce when an animal possesses its full complement of
 blood ; for although the blood may be stagnant in the vessels, it will supply
 for a considerable time the elements which oppose the coutracting-powers of
 the chloroform ; hence, if we would produce the state of contraction under
 such conditions, an amount of chloroform is demanded in the tissues which
 ordinarily destroys the animal. But by adopting the plan of allowing the
 ingress of the chloroform only through the limb which Ave wish to afl'ect, we

 overcome this obstacle and retain the heart in such a condition that the

 circulation can be restored and the contractive state dissipated when the

 mechanical impediment is removed from the aorta.
    In concluding this paper, I propose to take a hasty survey of the various

aflections of muscular tissue as they have presented themselves in my expe-

 riments.
    Let us take as an illustration the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog in the

elongated or uncontractcd state. 1. It may exist in this elongated or un-
contracted state mth all its dynamical powers in a state of integrity. This
is its normal condition, as we see it in the absence of stimuli. 2. It may
exist in this state when deprived of dynamical power, or, in other words, in the
absence of irritability. 3. Both these conditions of elongation may be asso-

--ciated with softness or flaccidity of the muscular structure, the former neces-

sarily so ; the latter not, as the fixity of rigor may prevail.

   Now let us take the same muscle in a state of complete contraction.

1. It may exist in this state of contraction with its dynamical powers per-

fect. This is true in those normal contractions which quickly give place to

relaxation. 2. It may exist in this state when deprived of dynamical power,
as seen in the forms of permanent contraction induced by warm water and

ethereal vapours. 3. In a state of softness, or in a hard coagulated state.
The soft state is represented by normally contracted muscle, severed from
one of its attachments. The hard state is induced by ethereal vapours and
extremes of temperature.

    As with the state of elongation, so with that of contraction, the truly

dynamical state is one of softness.

   The dynamical conditions on which irritability depends may therefore
exist both in the elongated and in the contracted state, and may also be non-

existent in both of these states. Properly speaking, irritability is no more the
tendency which a muscle exhibits to contract than the disposition it shows
to relax or elongate subsequently to contraction ; in fact a comprehensive
definition must include both these conditions. Nor is either of these states
to be regarded (as far as muscle alone is concerned) as conditions of rest
for they are both active states so long as the muscle is a vital structure, and
both inactive when the dynamical power of muscle are absent.

   As yet there seems to be no reliable experimental evidence to show that
muscle per se, ever contracts spontaneously, i. e. in the absence of a stimulus
but there are plenty of indications that the same agent is a greater stimulus
at one time than another ; nor is there anv evidence to show that muscl&
ON MUSCULAK IKRITABILITV.  171

will contract on the -withdrawal of elongating inflnences, but abundance to
the contrary in the fact that it will remain in the elongated state in the ab-
sence of all susceptibility. Contraction and elongation would seem both to
be dependent on the existence of polar forces, which have a certain relation,

--on the one hand, to excited nerve and external stimuli, and, on the other,

to some of the elements of the blood, excited nerve and external stimuli in-
ducing the attractive, which involves contraction, and the blood the repulsive

polar attitude essential to elongation.

    The attractive state of the muscular molecules which represents contrac-
tion, is the condition in which force is exhausted by the association of unlike
polarities ; while the state of elongation being that in which every molecule

is opposed to every other, force may be accumulated. In proportion to the

amount of force accumulated in the molecules Avill be the intensity of their

--contractive or elongative energy ; and also in proportion to their charge will

be their proclivity to disturbance in other words, their susceptibility to

 stimuli.

   When a stimulus can no longer act, it is because the force is exhausted.

If the chemistry of the muscle be not absolutely arrested, the power to
contract under a stimulus will return. If at the moment of its action a
stimulus be so excessive as to induce the attractive state of the molecules,
 and at the same time to destroy the force-producing powei's of the muscle,
the molecules will remain in the state of approximation, simply because there
is an absence of any power to rearrange them. Conversely, if the force-
producing powers be destroyed during the state of elongation, the molecules
 remain apart.

     Muscle, therefore, as a dead structure, has no tendency to remain in either
 one or other of these states preferentially. The loss of irritability is the first

evidence we possess of a series of chemical changes which culminate in such

 a coagulation of the muscular juices as to cause fixity, or setting of the

 muscle. When these changes take place in the elongated muscle, the fixed

 condition is produced which we recognize as rigor mortis ; when, on the

 other hand, they take place in the contracted muscle, they induce the fixed
 hard condition of the muscular structure seen in ethereal and thermal con-

 tractions.

    Substances which affect muscular tissue may be classified as pure stimu-

 lants, stimulo-coagulants, and depresso-coagulants. All substances possess-
 ing the coagirlant property arrest the chemical reactions between the mus-
 cular tissue and the blood, by which the fluid on which irritability depends
 is generated. The stimido- coagulant class is represented by the irritant
 action of chloroform and the ethers generally, and by extremes of tempera-
 ture ; the depresso-coagulant by chlorine, carbonic acid gas, and the sedative
  action of very dilute ether- vapour.

      It is possible, therefore, to have rigor mortis, or coar/ulative setting, in both

 elongated and contracted muscles.

    While, therefore, my researches contradict the theory which refers the

 phenomena of living muscle to statical electricity as an elongating power
 simply, contraction being regarded as due to an inherent attractive power of
  the muscular molecules, they are singularly in accordance with the con-

 clusions of Du Bois Eeymond, who regards every elemental part of muscle

  as a centre of electromotor action, containing within itself positive and

 --negative elements, arranged in a dipolar series, and seem to fiU iip a gap, by

  showing that the repulsive attitude of this series is maintained hy the blood.

Beport on the Physiological Action of certain Compounds of Amyl
  and Ethyl. By Benjamin W. Richardson, M.A., M.D., F.R.S.

In two previous Eeports to the Association, I dwelt especially on the action
of certain of the compounds of amyl. The first Report dealt exclusively

with the substance known as the nitrite of amyl. The second lleport had

further reference to the same body, and also to amylene, amylic alcohol, and
the acetate and iodide of amyl. In some degree these Reports were com-
plete as far as they went ; that is to say, the facts presented Avere sufficient
to demonstrate what visible physical influences -were exerted on dead and on
living matter by these representatives of the amyl scries ; and as I care-
fully separated the facts from the speculations that were fairly to be founded

on them, the Association expressed its satisfaction by requesting me to con-

tinue researches in the same direction but with a wider object. I was de-
sired in the next Report to repeat what might require repetition, but specially
to pay attention to the etlii/l-comjyounds, with a view to determine, if that
were possible, whether there was any analogy in physiological action between
the analogous compounds of the two series.

           SUMMARY OF PAST RESEARCHES.

Before I enter on new ground, it will be advisable for me to recall the

main facts described in previous years and bearing on the amyl series.
   1. It was shown that the nitrite of amyl when inhaled was the most poAV-

erful excitant of the circulation at the time known. It was demonstrated

that during such inhalation the action of the heart was doubled in rapidity

in thirty seconds, in men and warm-blooded animals : further, it was proved
that this intense action was immediately followed by deep suffusion of the

skin, by Lreathlessness like that produced by runnhig, by a peculiar sensation
of fulness and throbbing in the head, and ultimately by failure of muscular
power of the extremest kind. It was also proved that there was no destruc-
tion of the nervous sensibility, that in animals there was an obvious expres-
sion of sensibility up to the moment of death. Lastly, it was shown that in

--cold-blooded animals, such as frogs, the nitrite of amyl suspended animation

for hours, and even days, and that, in young warm-blooded animals, after

exposure to it until they seemed to be dead, the action of the heart continued

for so long a period as eigliteen hours.

   2. In respect to amylene, it was shown that the vapour of it was antiseptic,

even when  freely admixed  with  air              physiologically  tested on living animals,  it
                                               ;

is found to be capable of administration by being inhaled. It does not provoke

local irritation, but it rapidly produces collapse and total insensibihty to

pain. At the same time it seems to interfere less with consciousness than

other narcotic vapours. This fact is of peculiar interest, because the appa-
rent consciousness exhibited by the subject is not shared in by himself, it
is an objective, not a subjective phenomenon. The person under the influ-

ence of the vapour may perform acts which have all the semblance of conscious

acts ; but when he recovers he has no recollection of anything that has oc-
curred. The state thus induced is very much like the phenomenon of som-
nambulism ; and I ventured to suggest that in this experiment we had a
key to tlie cause of the disease somnambulism, viz. that there was possibly

formed in the body of the somnambulist, by a faulty digestion, a substance

of similar action to an aniyl-compound. Am3'lene I showed was a good

anaesthetic, and many surgical operations have been performed under its in-
ON THE PHYSIOLOOrCAL ACTION OF AMYL ANP ETHYL COMPOUNDS. 173

fluence, but it enters into no chemical combination with the tissues. This is
due to its great insolubility in the blood and animal fluids. Amylene requires

9319 parts of water for its solution.

   3. Of ami/lic alcohol it was shown that, like amylene, it was antiseptic.

When the vapour of it is inhaled, it produces first irritation of the nostril,

and next drowsiness and a kind of coma, but without insensibility to pain.

In this comatose state there is developed a peculiar muscular action, a series

of rigors which increase  in force under any degree of excitement                                                                                                                                                                          but it is
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

almost impossible to destroy life by its means. Animals brought to the verge

of death and seeming past all recovery begin to rally so soon as they are

placed in the open air.

   4. The acetate of amf/l was shown to produce the same kind of symptoms as
those produced by amylic alcohol ; it also preserves organic substances from

putrefaction. It is used for flavouring-purposes under the name of essence

of pears.

   5. The action of the iodide of amyl was shown to be somewhat difierent

from that of any of the other compounds. When inhaled it induces mixed

symptoms, resembling in part those produced by the nitrite of amyl, and in
part those produced by amylic alcohol. It causes excitement, great tremor

of muscles, and during recovery a singular motion of the animal in a circle
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

it also excites salivation, and renders the extremities of the animal red and

vascular during inhalation.

In the discussion which followed the reading of the papers named above,

Aone special point attracted most attention.  question first was asked by
--Dr. Heaton, of Leeds, and afterwards by Professor Wanklyn : Whether the

difierences of symptoms observed in dealing with diff'erent compounds of the

amyl series turned actually on a change in the base itself, or on the combi-

nation of the base with a new compound. To take an illustration : was,

for instance, the nitrite of amyl so peculiarly active simply because it was an

amyl-compound, or because it was the nitrite of amyl ?

This question is one of the chief (if not the chief) questions answered in

--the present Report. It was considered in the last Report in the following

terms : " The base amyl is, if I may use the expression, the keynote ; but
variations are introduced as new elements are added. The order of varia-

Wetion is most interesting.  take a simple hydrocarbon, the hydruret of

amyl, and we have an almost negative body, acting not unlike nitrogen, and

Wepartly destroying motor force and consciousness, but no more.                                                                                                                                                                            introduce

the element oxygen into the inquii-y by using the hydrated oxide of amyl

or the acetate, and there is added to the above-named phenomena violent

and persistent tremor. We move from this to another compound, and brin»

iodine into the field, and the phenomena now"embrace free elimination of

fluid from the body, vascularity of the extreme parts, with increased action of

Wethe heart and of respiration.  change the combination once more to bring

nitrogen and oxygen into operation with the base, and the vascular action is

raised beyond what is seen from any other known substance, to be followed

by a prostration so profound that the still living animal might for a time

pass for dead."

                          NEW EESEARCHES.

   In the past year I have repeated the experiments conducted originally with
the compounds of amyl, the compounds themselves being most accurately made.
The result has been to confirm the facts previously observed, in all their

integrity. In two directions I have extended these researches, with the
174 REPORT 1866.

object of trying to make the substances under notice of practical utility to

mankind.

          Nitrite of Amtl as a Remeby.

   I first experimented to ascertain whether nitrite of amyl, which, as we have
seen, exerts so decided an effect in quickening the action of the heart when it
is inhaled by the living animal, might be turned to account as a means for

stimulating the heart into action in cases where that organ has suddenly

ceased to beat, as in cases of fatal fainting, in drowning, in sunstroke and
lightning-stroke, in death by chloroform, and in suffocation from other nar-

--cotic vapours. To test this, the substance was introduced into the body in

two ways by artificial respii'ation, and by transfusion directly into the heart
through the arteries. By neither of these methods could any decided effect

be produced. By the first (the artificial respiration) a spasmodic action of the

diaphragm and a peculiar action of the muscles of the nose are produced for a

short time ; but the effect is very transient. By the second, the effect seemed
to be that the action of the heart was the more decidedly and rapidly para-

lyzed. In one case, in connexion with my friend Mr. Gay, after repeating in

the dissecting-room the experiment of the injection of a dead limb of the

human subject with oxygenated blood, I introduced a free current of a blood
containing one minim of the nitrite of amyl to the eight ounces. The muscles

were by this means evenly and steadily injected, and the odour of the amyl-
compound was distinctly perceived ; but there was no sign of muscular action
in response to the injection, and muscles laid bare and subjected to irritation

were still quiescent.

   For these experiments I invented a new instrument for transfusion, which
works so simply and effectually that I may be excused, perhaps, if I diverge
for a moment to describe it : the practical physiologist wiU find it of great
value in many inquii-ies. This instrument, as shown in the diagram, con-

sists of a glass cylinder (A), with a flexible tube (B) running from its lower

part or chamber, for insertion, by means of a quill or hoUow probe, into the

vein to be injected : the upper part of the cylinder is provided with a stopper,
through which a tube passes, connected vnth. a small pari- of hand bellows (D).

Within the cylinder is a small hollow ball (E), or safety-valve regulator,

which floats if there be fluid in the cylinder ujitil the fluid allows it to descend

to the constricted lower part of the cylinder, when all fm-ther passage of fluid
is prevented. The flow of fluid along the escape-tube can be checked, or set
at liberty at pleasure by the clip (C).

In using this iustiniment, first place the fluid to be injected in the cylinder

(A) and let a little run through the escape-tube (B) to displace aU the air ; next

close the escape-tube by means of the clip (C) ; then, having opened the vein

or artery, whUe it is being pressed upon from above, insert and fix the quill

or hollow probe at the end of the escape-tube, and, when all is ready for the

fluid to flow, remove the clip and raise the cylinder two or three feet above

the subject. The ordinary liuid-pressure will now usually suflice to carry the

fluid into the  body equably and gently                                                                                                                              but if there be any obstruction, the
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

merest pressure of the lower ball of the hand bellows will remove it. As the

fluid descends, the hollow ball goes down with it to within three inches of

the bottom of the cylinder, where it is opposed by the constricted neck, and

where it effectually closes in all that is below it, so that no air can possibly

get into the blood-vessel.

Eeverting to the experiments related above, they, although negative as

regards the particular object in view during their performance, teach an

interesting and usefid physiological lesson. They illustrate that when in the

living body the nitrite of amyl, after its inhalation, excites the heart to such
vigorous action, producing suffusion of the skin and the other extreme
symptoms of excitation, the effect is conducted solely through the nervous

system. I believe that the action of the nitrite, telling, at the moment of

inhalation, tipon the extreme filaments of the olfactory nerves, as well as on
the pneumogastric tracts, communicates a peculiar and rapid motion, which
traverses them and, without any indirect action on the blood, reaches the

heart, giving to it impulse and vehemency of action.

 ^ The expciience of every-day life tells us that the heart may be thrown into

similar activity by impressions or influences communicated from the external
world to the senses, and through them to the heart. The influences of
sounds, harsh or melodious, of sights, appalling or fascinating, are well known,
from the manner in which they come upon us. From their invisibility of

action, if I may be allowed such an expression, we are prone to look on them

as immaterial agents: they are not so; thoroughly understood they are
as material as a physical blow, or the impress of a liquid or gaseous sub-

stance.

Nitrite of amyl is one of those substances which enable us to realize this

connexion between the really material and the seemingly immaterial influences

Wewhich surroimd us.        take an appreciable quantity of it, say, half a grain,

and inhale it from paper, and at once we feel a quickened action of the circula-

tion so decisively that we trace the effect immediately to the cause: we could,

if we Hked, quicken the heart to absolute silence by pushing the cause far

enough. Here there is no mistake, no possibility of mistake. But we can

modify the experiment and refine upon it. By admixing the vapour of am-

monia with that of amyl, and difiPiising the combined vapours through a large

space of air confined by walls and closed windows, we can charge a room

with a compound which the olfactory sense, as such, does not detect, but which

teUs with active and peculiar force upon the heart. In this way an invisible

and, as it would seem to the unlearned, an immaterial agency acts by known
rules and in obedience to the human will*.

   The day will soon come when we shall know the mode bj^ which these agencies
act upon the body through the nervous expanse : we shall follow out the living
organism as so much matter moveable and transformable or transmutable,

built in, and I had almost said upon, a refined medium, itself unchangeable,

all-pervading, and establishing a bond of union between our own material

Weparts, ourselves, our planet, our ^^niverse.  shall see how this fluid, itself

physical, subjected to various influences, is disturbed, and how it communi-

cates such disturbance to the grosser matters which it permeates ; then a

vast number of strange and, as they now appear to us, conflicting phenomena

will resolve themselves into a single and simple law, and physiology, in its

wholeness, the science of the sciences, will be the most useful and the most

exact.

I have said that when the motion of the heart has once been stopped, the

influence of the nitrite of amyl ceases ; that the nitrite can quicken the living

action, but cannot restore the lost action. These are the facts as they stand

at the moment ; but I must add as a qualification that the negative result may
perchance be due to inadequacy of experiment, and that new and continuous
experiment may change the argiiment.

                                 The Amtls as Antiseptics,

   The second new line of inquiry to which the amj'l-compounds were
subjected, was to determine whether they could be turned to account, practi-

cally, as antiseptics. I had already found that every one of the series is
preservative, and I therefore took one (the acetate) and subjected it to special
inquiry. The reason for taking the acetate (essence of pears) was that it
is most easily obtainable, is comparatively innocuous, and is removed entirely
from any organic substance by the process of cooking.

   The experiments Averc made in the following manner :--
   1. By placing organs of soft texture of dead animals, such as the spleen,

kidneys, and liver, in lightly closed earthenware chambers, in which the
acetate of amyl was also placed, in a small open dish, or in cloth or sawdust.

   2. By painting over the substance to be preserved with a mixture of size

and acetate of amyl.

   3. By injecting the body of a rabbit through the arteries with a fluid con-

sisting of glycerine, water, and acetate of amyl.

   4. By subjecting the quarters of a sheep to a solution of acetate of amyl,

and then burying the parts in melted fat or melted size.
    The results of the experiments are as foUow :

   By the first method, animal substances may be preserved fresh when the
temperature is below 46° Fahr. for three weeks ; and when the tempe-
rature is above 46° and under 65° for a week. When the temperature is

over 65°, the eftect of the acetate is very uncertain. The change that takes
place in the meat when the effect of the acetate ceases, is a change differing
from ordinary putrefaction ; it is a process of white odourless softening.

    The second method, that of painting over the surface with a gelatinous
 envelope containing acetate of amyl, was not successful.

    The third method, that of injecting the tissues by the arteries, is a good
method. The body keeps well, even when exposed to the air at 60°, for four-

   * I could make every heart in a room rise ten beats, at least, within a minute without
diffusing a detectable odour, as surely as I could vary the motion of a steam-engine by
movins tlie lever.

teen days. I liave no doubt that animals injected in this way might be

transported wholesale, if enclosed in boxes, during a voyage of three weeks
or a month.

   The last method, that of bringing the structure into close contact with the
amyl-compound, was not successful. I gathered from all these experiments
that as antiseptics the amyls require to be so applied that they diffuse through
the tissues, and that they continue to act until they are carried away.

    ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF SOME COMPOUNDS
                          OF THE ETHYL SERIES.

   Turning from these amyl-compouuds, I have next to rej^ort on some of the

bodies belonging to the ethyl series. For many centuries the ethers have
been known and studied as substances possessing peculiar powers over animal

bodies ; and of late years their use as anaesthetic substances for general and
local i)urposcs has given to them additional interest.

   The compounds of ethyl which I have specially studied are the oxide, the
acetate, the nitrite, and hydrofluoric ether.

       Oxide of Ethyl.

   The first of these, commonly known as pure ether, rectified ether, or
sulphuric ether, is a substance that has been of great intez-est to the modern

physiologist, owing to the fact that it has been applied largely for producing
general insensibility to pain by the process of inhalation, and more recently
by the local process of evaporation.

   Although largely demanded for the first of these processes, the oxide of
ethyl that has been sold for the purposes of the medical physicist has been
most imperfect. The absurd rule of the Pharmacopoeia, which allowed a cer-
tain small admixture of alcohol with ether, was the loophole through which
the most flagrant abuses were permitted to find way. In fact, when at the
commencement of the present year I required oxide of ethyl on a large scale,
I could not for many weeks obtain any pure specimen that was not specially

made for me : there was Jio uniformity either in respect to specific gravity,

boihrig-point, or reaction. These facts fully accoimt for the great diversity of
the opinions that have been expressed- relative to the action of ether on the

bodies of men and animals. The process for obtaining a pure oxide of ethyl

is nevertheless very simple, and demands only care, patience, and honesty.
Since February last, two thousand pounds weight of absolute ether have been
sent out from one London house alone, that of Bobbins and Comj)any of
Oxford Street.

   The piire substance is a colourless, almost inodorous fluid ; its specific

gravity is 0-716 to 0*720 ; and 88° Fahr. may be taken as its mean boiling-

point.

"With a pure and reliable oxide of ethyl, I have been enabled to study

the physiological action of the substance with a precision not before attained.

To produce a decided efiect on the body of a warm-blooded animal by

means of ether, it is best to administer the substance in the foz-m of vapour,

charging the air with from twenty to twenty-five per cent., and sustaining

the supply steadily. The sensations produced are from the first pleasurable

there is expansion of idea in relation to space and to objects, then confusion

with a peculiar sensation of sweetness in the mouth, and at last oblivion.
The ether being withdrawn, recovery is very rapid indeed, so rapid that there is

scarcely any perceptible stage of recovery : it is a sudden awaking to complete

consciousness. In this respect ether closely resembles amylene in its action.

1866.                   If
178 REPORT--1866.

    If inferior animals bo subjected to absolute etber, and the influence of the

vapour on their lungs, heart, and blood be carefully obscryed, we find that the

lungs undergo a slight congestion, that the heart is filled with blood on both its
sides, and the venous blood in its transit through the pulmonic circuit ceases
to become arterialized. At the same time there is no destruction of the parts
of the blood, and the process of coagulation is unaltered. T\Tien death is
induced by pure ether, the event occurs by arrest of respiratory power. It

occurs much in the same way as in death by drowning or by suffocation in

carbonic acid. It is a great point to state, and it is most strictly true, that
absolute ether has no directly poisonous action upon the heart. I have seen
good pulsation of both sides of the heart for forty-five minutes after what

may be considered the death of the animal. For this reason the action of

absolute ether contrasts most favourably with chloroform. Chloroform kiUs

by its paralyzing action iipon the heart : hence when chloroform becomes

deadly, it is inevitably deadly because it becomes impossible to remove it from
the parts on which it acts to destroy. Ether, on its side, when it begins to
cause embarrassment, is acting simply xipon the respiration; and it is only
necessary to cease to administer it to ensure recovery.

   On the whole, after a most careful comparison of the action of absolute

oxide of ethyl with the action of other volatile substances possessing

ansesthetic properties, I claim for it that it is the safest of all known anaes-

thetics, that any indifferent effects arising, in past times, from its employ-
ment were due to badness of the article, and that science, not less than regard

for human life, bids us, when a general ansesthetic is absolutely necessaiy,

go back to ether as the safest agent.
   In order to ascertam what would be the effect of actually impregnating

the whole body of an animal with absolute ether, I injected one ounce of it
into the aorta of an animal (a rabbit) already rendered insensible by the
vapour. The result was that the fluid injected began to boil rapidly in the
tissties with a free escape of ether-vapdm-, followed by a sudden, almost in-
stant stiffness affecting the muscles of the whole body. This effect was due
to the rapid extrication of heat from the tissues. It was a kind of general

freezing of the tissues.

                     Acetate of Ethyl and Hydeoflttoeic Ethee.

   The acetate of ethyl and hydi-ofluoric ether are chiefly remarkable for
their powerful solvent action on all the tissues of animals. They, can neither

of them be safely administered by inhalation, but both of them may admit of

being largely and usefully employed for the destruction and removal of
morhid growths. Directed on the blood they break it up absolutely, destroying
alike the corpuscles, the fibrine, and the albumen. In short, hydrofluoric

ether may be looked on as a universal solvent of the animal tissues ; nothing

escapes its action except the gelatinous structiires, and these not altogether.

                                              iSTiTEiTE OF Ethyl.

   The nitrite, or more correctly the hyponitrite of ethyl, nitrous ether, is
made in a similar manner to nitrite of amyl, the difference being that the
nitrous fumes are passed through ordinary alcohol. The fluid when pure is

of a light amber-colour ; the specific gravity is U-OoO, and the boiling-point

G0° Fahr. The physiologist who would work with it, should mix it with

--absolute ether in fixed proportions say, of ten, twenty-five, or fifty per cent.

It is so volatUe that without this precaution it cannot be readily employed.

   The action of nitrite of ethyl, as Professor Wanklyn suggested last year,
                            --

         STRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOSSIL CRUSTACEA. 179

is closely analogous to the action of nitrite of amji. Inhaled in quantities
of not less than a grain, it induces the same sensation of fulness of the head,
rapid action of the heart, and some suffusion of the skin. Animals subjected
to it in the proportion of fifteen minims diffused as vapour through a cubic
foot of air, die almost instantaneously from sudden failure of the heart, but

even up to the moment of death they retain their consciousness and sensi-
bility. The nitrite, consequently, is in no sense to be regarded as an

anaesthetic.

   Precisely as the nitrite of amyl, nitrite of ethyl, when it kills, leaves the

lungs entirely collapsed and so perfectly white that one could assume they
had been carefully washed free of blood. This effect is due perhaps to the
rapid contraction of the pulmonary capillaries. The blood is changed in
colour, the arterial blood being rendered very dark, and the venous of a deep
chocolate tint* ; the muscles are also all left blanched, as if the death had
occurred from loss of blood.

    It will be remembered that, in describing the action of nitrite of amyl, I ex-
,plained that in cold-blooded animals the substance suspended their animation,

and that frogs that had been rendered powerless by it, and to common obser-

vation inanimate, would sometimes spontaneously recover even so long as nine
days after the administration. This same phenomenon I have observed with
nitrite of ethyl, together with another even more singular. It is this. If a
young animal, say a kitten, be subjected so suddenly to the nitrite as to fall
senseless and to appearance dead in or within the minute, it will remain in the
same state for six or even ten minutes, yielding no evidence of life : it will
not breathe, and the most delicate auscultation will fail to detect motion
of the heart. But after a. period vaiying from six to ten minutes it wUl
spontaneously recommence to breathe, and with every movement of expiration
a breath sufficient to dull a mii-ror wlU pass from the nostril. As the breath-
ing recommences, the heart also begins its work, making a series of distinct
intermittent strokes. This condition, looking like an actual return of life,
will last so long as half an hour, and will then cease gradually, the animal

 lapsing again into a state of actual inertia or death.

    In concluding this Report I would place the facts I have collected, in

respect to the ethyl series, as follows :

    1. Oxide of ethyl, or pure rectified ether as it is commonly called, is the
best of all known agents for the production of general anaesthesia by

 inhalation.

    2. The peculiar difference of action between the oxide of ethyl and the
nitrite of ethyl is due to the introduction of a new element, nitrogen, into
the latter compound. This difference of composition makes the nitrite approach,
in action, bodies of the alkaloidal class, strychnine and its analogues.

Second Report on the Structure and Clafisification of the Fossil

           Crustacea. By Henry Woodward, F.G.S.

I HAVE now to submit a Second Report upon the Fossil Crustacea, which

have for some years past occupied my attention. Since the last Report

made to the British Association in Birmingham in 1865, I have described and

180 REPORT--1866.

--^ger Marderi a genus hitherto characteristic of the Soleuhofen Slates of

Bavaria*.

   The following new genera and species of Crustacea were communicated
by me to the Geological Society on the 23rd May last, and will appear in the

next part of the ' Quarterly Journal' of that Society :

   " 2. ' On a new Genus of Phyllopodous Crustacea from the Moffat Shales

(Lower Silurian), Dumfriesshire.'
   " The fossil described consists of the disk-shaped shield or carapace of an

Apus-like Crustacean, the nearest known form to it being Peltocaris apty-
clwkles, Salter, from which, however, it is at once distinguished by the

absence of a dorsal furrow.

  A" line of suture divides the wedge-shaped rostral portion of the shield

from the rest of the carapace, the two parts being seldom found together.
From its strong resemblance to Discina, the author proposed for it the generic
name Biscinocaris, and named the species Bron'mana, after Mr. D. J. Brown,

who first drew his attention to it.
   " 3. ' On the Oldest known British Crab (Palceinachus hngijies, H.W.) from

the Forest Marble of Malmesbury, Wilts.'
    " The author stated that three genera and twenty-five species of Brachy-

urous Crustacea had ali-eady been described by Professor lleuss and H. von
Meyer from the Upper White Jura of Germany ; but as no limbs or abdo-
minal segments had been met vd\h, it was more doubtful where to place

them than the species now described, which had nearly all its limbs in situ,

and a portion of the abdomen united to it. Palmmichus closely resembles
the common Spider-crabs (the Maiadce and Lejptopodidce) living on our own

coasts.

   " 4. ' On the Species of the genus Eryon, Desm., from the Lias and Oolite

of England and Bavaria.'
    " The g(;nus Eryon of Desmarest was established for certain extremelj'^ broad

and flat forms of Astacidce found in the Soleuhofen limestone near Munich,
and first described in 1757. The late Dr. Oppel has recorded fourteen
species, two of which, E. Barrovensis and E. (C'oleia) antiqims, are from the

Lias of England. Mr. Woodward gave descriptions and figures of E. Barro-

vensis, M'Coy, and five other species, namely: E. crassichelis, E.Wilmcoiensis,
and E. Brodiei, from the Lower Lias ; E. Moorei, from the Upper Lias of
Ilminster ; and E. Oppeli, from the lithographic stone of Solenhofen."

    The plates exhibited form (with one other) the first part of the Monograph
on the Merostomata for the Palceontographical Society, and wUl be published

shortlyf.

    I have lately had the opportunity to examine specimens of Limuli from

the Coal-measures of Kilmaurs, Dudley, and Coalbrook-dale, and am happy
to state that they have enabled me in the most satisfactory maimer to de-

monstrate the connexion between this division of Crustacea and the older
Euriipterida on the one hand and the recent King-crabs on the other. (See

Eeport, Section DJ.)

    The forms which occur in this zone (the Pennystone Ironstone) differ
from Limulus in the less anchylosed condition of their segments and the
possession of three well-marked divisions, representing the head, thorax, and
 abdomen, the latter being represented by three anchylosed segments, and
 having the intervening segments of the thorax free and unarticulated.

    The best example of this is the Belimtrus regina of Baily, from the Irish
Coal-measures ; then follows the B. trilobitoides, of Bnckland, the B. an-
thrax, Prestwich, the B. arcuatus, Baily, and lastly, the B. rotundatus of
Prestwich. By placing these forms in the order indicated, we find a gradual
change from the less to the more anchylosed condition of the body-segments,
which attains its greatest concentration in the recent Limulus.

   But besides these, we have in Hemiaspis a form more separated into distinct

segments than is Belinurus regina ; so that the passage from. Eurypterus to
Belinurus, and from that again to Limulus proper, seems capable of being

bridged over, and we are justified in placing them in the same order, though

separated into distinct subdivisions.

  We have adopted Dr. Dana's name of Meeostomata for the order, making

the first suborder, EtriiTPTEBinA, to contain :

vast, then, must have been the period represented between the lifetime of the

BeUnunis of the Coal-measures and that of the Limulus of the Oolites ! and

yet we should be unwilling to doubt their relationship by descent. Each an-

tecedent period, then, must have been infinitely greater as we recede to the

Wenlock, where the first traces of Pfenjgotus occur.

Second Report on the " Menevian Group" and the other Formations at

   St. David's, Pembrokeshire. By H. Hicks, and J. W. Salter.

    F.G.S.

Tnn work of the past year has not been confined to procuring fossil speci-

mens, although that object has been kept steadily in view.
   The extent and direction of the various beds has been particularly noted

and a much greater area than was formerly suspected has been found occu-

--pied by the respective lower fossil groups Menevian, Ffestiniog, Tremadoc,

and the great Arenig or Skiddaw group formations which have only of late
years been accurately explored.

   Above these rocks, and forming their upper limit, we have in the St.

David's promontory the Llandeilo flags, a formation that does not need a

special description, since it is already well known to us in the ' Silurian
System,' and under the name of Lower Bala in Prof. Sedgwick's works.

   The fossU-bearing strata in the neighbourhood of St. David's are mostly
exhibited in coast sections ; and the grant has been very useful in enabling
Dr. Hicks to employ boat-service in the work. Without boats, indeed, it
would be impossible to make sure of the succession, so much have the strata
been disturbed and faulted, and also in many parts covered by drift. But
the series, once accurately defined by this examination, could be tested by
reference to roadside and brook sections, where the beds are weathered ; and
hence we can now offer a tolerably accurate map of all the formations, and
extend it over a larger part of the district. Moreover in all about sixty-five

                         ON THE MENEVIAN GROUP.  183

or seventy new or partly described species have been found peculiar to this

region, and these wait for description.
    That the additions to the geology of St. David's during the last few years

may be more clearly understood, it is well to state what formations are now
known to be present in the promontory that forms the north shore of St.
Bride's Bay. The Sui'vey Map does not profess to subcUvide the slate-rocks

and volcanic grits, but only to separate these as a mass fi'om the purple aud
grey sandstones coloured as Cambrian rock (the Harlech group of Professor

Sedgwick).

   In ascending order we have then :
   1. The Harlech Group (Sedgwick), consisting of purple and greenisli-grey

sandstone, passing above into grey sandstones (not grits) which arc fossili-

feroiis.

   This mass of piirple and greenish-grey flags forms the axis of the promon-

tory, thrown into a violent anticlinal along the line of the so-called
" syenite," which is partly altered Cambrian rock, and partly crystalline

rock, perhaps syenite in some places.

2. The Menevian Group, 1500 or 1600 feet thick, of dark-grey (and even

black) flags and shales, alternating in its upper and larger portion with sand-

--stone. This is the great fossUiferous group.
   3. Ffestiniog Group (Sedgwick). Hard siliceous sandstone with grey flaky

--slate, containing LinguleUa Davisii.
   4. Tremadoc Group. Sandstones and earthy slates, much like those of

--Athe Ffestiniog group, but of a bluish-grey colour and more uniform texture.
5. Arenig or Sliddaw Group.            thick series of iron-stained slates and

flags, interlined throughout by felspar hues and felspathic ashes, containing

large Trilobites and shells of new species, and Graptolites like those of

--Skiddaw.
   6. Llandeilo Flags. Black slates, with felspar beds and interbedded trap,

fossils abundant.

"We may now give a few explanatory details, as brief as possible, respecting

each of those formations :

   1. Concerning the Harlech group, it must be noted that the sections on
the south coast (Caerbwddy for instance) show a distinct passage down-

wards into the central syenitic mass, so gradual as to induce the belief that
the mass of rock is no other throughout than altered Cambrian beds. jSTear
St. David's the same thing is visible. Altered purple beds close to the town
are succeeded by rock apparently crystalline, but showing distinct rounded

grains cf quartz (as minute pebbles) throughout the mass. It is e\-idently

a slightly altered grit or conglomerate. In other places further east, the

rock is certainly melted in its central portions, but passes so gradually into

olive shales thi-ough hardened flinty beds and horustones, that no true

boundary can be traced.

   The series of sandstones, purple, green, and grey, which succeed arc laid

down with tolerable accuracy on the Survey Map (except where bounded by

the prevailing faults). All the accessible localities have been searched for

fossils, but with no success until the highest portion was reached ; immediately

above the topmost purple bands, 160 feet or so of these top beds contains

fossils, not many species, but of the geneva, Faradoxides, Conocoryphe, Ag-

nostus, Them, and a new genus, Oyrtotheca.

These are of much the same character as those of the next group, though

--the Trilobites differ specifically.
   2. Menevian Group. The list of fossils belonging to this group is now

extended to more than forty species. Their distribution remains precisely
the same as that elaborated in the last Eeport. The greater number of
species occur with the largest Parado.vides, P. Davklis, -which is the upper-
most of the three forms knoTvn ; P. Ilulsii occurs at the base of the really
dark shnles, close upon the grey beds of the Harlech group just mentioned,
in which group, 200 feet down, lies, as before noted, the P. Aurora.

    It is worth notice that these three species, with their accompanying
smaller forms {Conocornphe, Theca, Agnostus with each), keep close to their

own particular domains, the species of Paradoxldes being never found mixed
together. This may serve to show how veiy perceptible a change of fauna
may occur within moderate limits ; for the section is perfectly continuoiis, and

yet these TrUobites are confined to narrow bands and do not reappear.

  A species of Orthis, Avith few large plaits, has been found this year, the

minute predecessor of aU the OrtJiis tribe. Hitherto nothing but horny
species of Brachiopods {Lingida and Dixcina) has been known to occiu- in
these old beds ; and one or other of these go dovra to the very base, while the
Orthis is only found above the limit of the highest Panidoxides-hc(is.

   [Tlie fossils exhibited gave a general idea of this old fauna ; a much
larger series is sent to the British Museum and Jermj-n Sti-eet.]

   .3. "With respect to the Ffestiniog group, or true Lingula-flag beds, we find

this formation occupying its right place, at the very top of the Mencvian
group. It occurs in a faulted patch in A\Tiitesand Bay ; and forms a bold but
narrow syncUual at the mouth of Solva Harbour and the Cradle Eock. It
also occurs, of diminished thickness, in the district lying between the granite
of Brawdy and Asheston and the syenitic axis. Upon it lies a trough of

   4. Trcinadoc Ucds, or what we regard as such. They have only this
year been worked out fully. And lying as they do upon the ti-ue Lingula-

fiag and under the Arenig or Skiddaw slate, they can hardly be anything
but Tremadoc beds. They graduate by insensible degrees from the Lingula-
Sandstones, first as bluish-grey slate, and then earthy grey thick-bedded rock
of a peculiar tough texture, and contain the following fossils :

    C'ahjmene, 2 species.
    Homalonotus, 1 species.
    Asaplius, a giant species and a smaller one, the former all but undistin-

           guishable from the Asaphus Homfragi of the Tremadoc rocks.
    OrfJioceras, with peculiar arched str'je.
    jS'ucida or Ctcnodonta, 2 or 3 species.
    Orthis Carausii, a coarse-ribbed fossil, highl}- characteristic of these beds.

     Orthis, a fine-ribbed species like 0. elcgantula.
    Bellerofhon, Lingida, Obolella.

   Now this fauna is wholly unlike the deep-water fauna of the Tremadoc

region. It is evidently a thin formation, depoeited in much shallower water
and this may be the reason of the great change in the fauna.

    But there is something peculiar in the absence of the recognized ujjper beds
of the Lingula-Jlags as they exist in North Wales. Instead of a recurrence
of black slate for the Upper Lingida-jlags and lower portion of the Tremadoc
grovp (forming a very thick set of formations deposited in deep water), we
have only a thin series of comparatively shallow water accumulatioiis,
marked by abundance of worm-tracks, and the fossils above quoted. This
gives a marked character to the series, and indicates the following succession
up to this point :

vertical beds of black shale, seen in Whitesand Bay, and occupying also more

than half of liamsey Island, where they lie in a clistinct trougli of Tremadoc

and Lingula-jlags; and everywhere characterized by the following fossils :

^glina, 2 species.

Ogi/gia, 2 large species. 0. peltata and 0, hullata.

And, lastlj', branched and twin Graptolites, viz. Dendrograpsus and Di-

dgmograpsus.

No Graptohtes occur beneath the Skiddaw group in Britain. And though

all these species, except the Graptolites, arc distinct from the fossils of the
same strata in North Wales and Shropshire, the probable reason is, that the

latter were in shallow water, while ours is evidently, like the Skiddaw slate,

Wea deep-water series.  may therefore expect these species to be found in

Cumberland.

Eamsey Island is worth a visit ; for the exhibition of the three sets of rocks

(Lingida-JJag, Tremadoc, and Arenig) is very complete on the north side of
the island, and fossils are abundant.

G. To complete the geology of St. David's, one must go to the overlying Llan-

dcilo flags of Abereiddy Bay. These line slate-quarries are full of fossils.

Trilobites of well-known forms, familiar to us at Builth and LlaudeUo, crowd

the slaty bands, and Graptolites in myriads, principally the species called

the tuning -forhgraxytolite {Didym. Murehisonce). The chief TrHobite is Ogygia

Biichii ; but there are many other Builth species, and some very rare ones,

ABarrandia Cordai, for instance.  few words on the faults of the district,

which are literally innumerable.

E. and W. faults, sometimes of large amount, but not much indicated on

the surface.

   N.N'.W. ones, more conspicuous as lines of valley and marsh; often shift-
ing the strata much, and gi^Hing outline to the coast.

N.E. faults, freqiient, but not of very large amount ; have not been well

observed.

N. and S. faults, believed to be the latest, and they give much impress to

the features of the district, forming short valleys, and shifting the strata, but

less than the others.

                        Summary of the facts stated.

    1. AVe have two axes of elevation in the promontory, viz. the granite of
Brawdy and Asheston on the south-east, and the so-called St. David's syenite
in the centre. The latter is chiefly altered rock.

   2. Between these two axes, and on either side of them, the purple and
grey Cambrian rock forms a steep trough, supporting black shales of the
Menevian group, followed by Lingula-flag and Tremadoc rock, and on the
north side of the coast Arenig or Skiddaw rocks covered by Llandeilo Aug.
186 KEPORT-- 1866.

   3. The conditions of deposit seem to be, that the Harlech group was
nearly uniform with that of North Wales, but, being of finer grain, indicates

a somewhat deeper-water deposit. The Menevian, Linfjula-Jlacj , and Trema-
cloc rocks are all much thinner, and, as a rule, of more even deposit, than in
North Wales. They, too, seem to have been formed far out at sea, but pro-

bably in no great depth of water.

The depression in the Arenig and Llandeilo groups seems to have been

greater, and particularly in contrast with the conditions of deposit in North

Wales and Shropshire, where shore accumulations were being everywhere

laid down. But in this respect they are more like the Skiddaw slates, some

of whose fossils they include ; and the presence of repeated beds of lava, ash,
and ashy slate lends no countenance to the idea that these beds were subject

to the oscillations of a shallow sea ; for the deposits are remarkably tranquil,

fine-grained, and regular. Beds of fossils occur at intervals only in the

Ai'enig and Llandeilo rocks, and are then plentiful, as in other deep-sea de-

posits. But the Tremadoc rocks, being apparently laid down on a stationary

sea-bed, present us with conditions wholly unlike those of the same period

in North Wales, and, perhaps as a consequence of this, with a very different

set of organic remains.

   The Harlech, Menevian, and Ffestiniog group have each large and well
stratified beds of true contemporaneous volcanic rock, as well as many in-

traded beds.                                                            j ^y SALTEK.

              Report on Dredging among the Hebrides.

                    By J. GwYN Jeffreys, F.R.S.

This exploration lasted nearly two months, viz. from the 24th of May to the

14th of July in the present year. It comprised Sleat Sound, Lochs Alsh,

Duich, Slapin, and Scavaig, and the Minch from Croulin Island to Loch Ewe.

I had a good cutter yacht, the master of which had been emploj'ed by me for

many years as dredger and took considerable interest in the work, an active

and willing crew, four serviceable di'edgcs, 300 fathoms of new rope, ma-

chinery for hauling up the ili-edges, a large tub, sieves, and various other

apparatus. The Hydrographer of the Navy obligingly supplied me with such

charts as I required, to show the depths and nature of the sea-bottom in the

district which I proposed to examine ; and these were of great use in dredging,

as well as for navigation.  The weather was too  fine                   we Avere often  becalmed
                                                                     ;

for many hours together : and instead of steady breezes, we had too many of

those squalls which are so prevalent, and occasionally dangerous, in the He-

brides.

   The Hebridean seas have been often searched, but not explored, by zoolo-
gists. Their great extent, and the number of lochs and inlets which indent
the coast in every direction, would render necessary an immense deal of
money, time, and patience for a complete investigation. There is little pro-

bability that the subject of the present Report will ever be exhausted.
   The Invertebrate fauna of this district is of a northern character, although

there are a few exceptions. Such are, among the Mollusca, Troclms umhili-

caluis, Phasianella pidla, liissoa caiiceUata or cvcmdata, Odostomia lactea or

Ohemnttzia elegantlsshna, and Phurohranchus ^lumula. These may be re-
garded as southern forms. The first and third occur as far north as Storno-
"way ; the second ranges to Dunnet Bay in Caithness ; of the fourth I dredged
a single specimen in the upper part of the Minch ; and the last lives between
tide-marks in the Isle of Mull. As a set-off to the above, I would mention
the following species, which have now for the first time been found so far
south as the Hebrides, viz. Jlontacuta tumidula (a new species, which I

will presently describe), Troclms occidentcdis, var. pura, Jeffre)/sia (jhhidaris,

and Odostomia eximia. The first is Swedish ; the second is Zetlandic, Scan-
dinavian, and North American, although it has also been prociu-ed in the

Orkneys and on the Aberdeenshire coast ; the third is Zetlandic, and the

foui'th Zetlandic also and Norwegian. It must be borne in mind, as regards

the extent of geographical distribution, that the southern extremity of the

Shetland Isles is distant about 200 miles from the northern extremity of the
Hebrides, " as the fish swims." Besides the four last-named species, the

following seem to reach their most southern limit in the Hebrides : Lima

elliptica, Lcda ijygmcm, and Troclms Groenlandieus. Leda pygmcea has

indeed been dredged on the coast of Antrim ; but I am now inclined to re-

gard the specimens thus obtained as quaternary fossils. Tethea cranium (a

sponge not before known south of Shetland) occurred in tolerable numbers

on the Ross-shire side of the Minch. Species of Mollusca, inhabiting the

Hebridean seas, which are in the main northern (although they have been

found somewhat further south, and some of them occasionally even in the

Mediterranean), are Argiope cistellida, Pecten striatus, Mytdus phaseulinus,

Modiolctria nigra, Crenella decussata, Nunda tenuis, Leda minuta. Area pec-

tunculoides, Montacuta ferruginosa, Oyamium minutum, Cardium minimum,

Cypritia Islandica, Asiarte compressa, Tellina pusilla, Scrobicidaria nitida,

CThracia convexa, Mya arenaria, M. truncata, Chiton Hanleyi,  alhus, C.

PunctttreUa Noachina, Emarginida crassa, Scissurella crispata, Trochus

diaphana, J. opalina, Odostomia minima, 0. albella, 0. inscidpta, 0. diaphana,

Velutina plicatilis, V. laevigata, TricJtotropis borealis, Purpura lapiUus, Buc-

cinum undatum, Trophon Barvicensis, T. truncatus or Batvffius, Fusus anti-

quus, P. gracilis, JVassa incrassata, Mangelia turricida, Defrancia scabra,

Cylichna nitidida, Amphisphyra hyalina, Philine scabra, P. pruinosa, and P.

quad rata.

   Por certain species, which are almost peculiar to the Hebrides, I am not

I

aware that any locality has been recorded between that district and the

Mediterranean. Such are Axinits ferruginosus, Poromya granidata, Necera

abbreviata, N. costcdata, and Cylichna acuminata. The iirst three of these

were described by the late Professor Edward Forbes, in the Report to the

Association in 1843 on ^gean Invertebrata. Another Hebridean species

{Nucula sidcatci) is not found southwards nearer than the coast of Spain.

Some of our most conspicuous and prized shells, that are also of a

northern type, are wanting in the Hebrides. Saxicava Norvegica, Natica

Groenlandica, Buccinum Humphreysiayium, Buccinopsis Dcdei, Fusus Norve-

gicus, F. Turtoni, and F. Berniciensis, are in this category. All the above

(with the exception of Buccinum Humphreysianum, which inhabits Shetland

and the coasts of county Cork) are met with on the Dogger bank ; and the

first two are fossil in the Clyde beds. Six out of the seven being univalves,

I would venture to surmise that their non-existence in the western seas of

Scotland may ha^c arisen from the circumstance that the diffii'i'iou of uni-
 188 REPORT-- 1866.

 valves is slower than that of bivalves. The spawn of the former is attached
 to the spot Avhere it is shed, or in a few cases (e. g. C'cqnthis and Caljiptra'a)
 it is hutched within the shell of its sedentary parent ; so that the fry form
 a colony, and need not roam to any distance, provided their station yields a
 sufficient supply of food and has the other requisites of habitability. Not so
with hivalves. These shed their ova into the water, or else (as in some of the
KolUa family) hatch them within the folds of the mantle, whence they are ex-
cluded on arriving at maturity. Their fry swim freely and rapidly by means of
numerous encircling cilia. The metamorphic state lasts many hours. During

that period they can voluntarily traverse considerable distances, or they maj-

be involuntarily transported by tidal and oceanic currents. Time is the only
element necessary for their widest dispersion over the adjacent seas, if no bar-
rier intervenes. Should, however, such an obstacle present itself, whether in
the shape of previously existing dry land, like that which separates the North
Sea from the Atlantic, or from an iiphcaval and drying-iip of the neighbour-
ing sea-bed by geological or cosmical causes, the further diffusion of any

marine animals in that direction must necessarily be stopped. An opposite

result would doubtless be produced by a sinking and submersion of dry land
below the level of the sea, whercljy the diffusion of such animals would bo
greatly facilitated. This appears to have been the fluctuating course of

--events since the formation of the Coralline Crag, which was probably the cradle

or starting-point of our moUuscan fauna a period long antecedent to the
last glacial epoch, and incalculably far beyond the advent of man, unless his

origin is much more remote than it is at present supposed to be. I am not

inclined to attribute the northern character of some of the Hebridean mollusca
to the persistence of wliat have been called " boreal outliers.'' The idea
savours more of poetry than of philosophy or fact. The boreal or truly
arctic species whicli once flourished in this district have become quite ex-
tinct, probably in consequence of one of those revolutions above suggested, by
Avhich the sea-bed was converted into dry land. These boreal species consist
chiefly of BliynchoneUa psittacea, Pecten Islandlcus, Astarte crebi-lcosiata or
depressa, Tellina calcaria, Mi/a tnincata,\ax. Uddevallensis, Trochus cinereiis,
and Asti/ris IloIhbUii. ; and I have lately, as well as on a former occasion,
dredged them on the coasts of Skyo and West Eoss, at depths of from 30 to
60 fathoms, or 180-360 feet. They had a semifossilized appearance. Not

one of the above-named species has ever, to the best of my knowledge and

belief, been found in a living or recent state in any part of the British seas.
All of them occur in post-tertiarj' or quaternary deposits on the west coast of
Scotland, from a few feet above high -water mark* to 320 feet above the present
level of the seaf. The greatest subaerial height (320 feet), being added to
the greatest submarine depth as above (360 feet), gives an extent of elevation
and subsidence equal to 680 feet. But as Pecicn Islandicus, for example,

now inhabits the arctic ocean at depths varying from 5 to 150 fathoms, let

us take the average of these depths, viz. 77g fathoms or 465 feet, and add
it to the 680 feet. This would make 1145 feet, and probably represent

the height at which the sea-level may be supposed to have stood when P.

Islandicus lived on the highest fossiliferous spot noticed by Mr. Watson.
The non-fossiliferous boulder-clay, indicating the simultaneous presence of
arctic land which was also subject to glacial conditions, is stated bj' Mr.

Watson* to be about 800 feet higher than the mean deposit. The height of
the layer of sea-shells on Moel Tryfaen in Carnarvonshire (evidently the

remains of an ancient beach) exceeds that of the similar deposit at Cardigan
by more than 1300 feet ; and the difference of height observed in the case of

other fossiliferous deposits in the north of England (e. g. Manchester and

Kelsey Hill) shows that the disturbing movement has been iinequal, and pro-

bably not synchronous, over the same area. It would seem that the extent of

such oscillation has not altogether amounted to 2000 feet in the British Isles,

taking Moel Tryfaen as the greatest height, and the Shetland sea-bed as the

greatest depth, at which quaternary shells of recent species occiu-. The

former are chiefly arctic, and the latter merely northern. Whether other

parts of the North Atlantic sea-bed have undergone a much greater change

of level since the tertiary epoch is not so well established. Dr. G. C.

WaUich, in his admirable and philosophical treatise t, with which all marine

zoologists and geologists are, or ought to be, familiar, believed that certain

starfishes which he had procured at a depth of 1260 fathoms (7560 feet) in

lat. 59° 27' N., long. 26° 41' W., about halfway between Cape Farewell and

the north-west coast of Ireland, were originally a shallow-water species, but

had gradually, and through a long course of generations, accommodated them-

selves to the abnormal conditions incident on the subsidence of the sea-bedj.

The starfishes in question, which he refers to the OpMocoma yramdata of

Forbes {Asterias nigra of 0. F. Miiller), appear, however, to belong to a diffe-

rent species, which inhabits deep water. In an important paper by Professor

Sars, on the distribution of animal life in the depths of the sea§ , he states

that Ojyhiocoma nigra (0. granulata, Forbes) is certainly found in shallow

water, viz. from 2 to 30 fathoms, on the coast of Norway, but never at a

greater depth so far as is yet known, and that it does not range north of the

firth of Drontheim. He is of opinion that Dr. Wallich's species is Ophiacantha

spinidosa of MiiUer and Troschel, a well-known and Groenlandic species,

which is not littoral, but rather a deep-water kind, viz. from 20 to 190

fathoms                                      and  he  infers  from  Wallich's  own  account  that  the  last-named

species, instead of Ophiocoma nigra or granulata, was the one taken by the

* Bulldog '-sounding in 1260''fathoms. Dr. Wallich also adduces his discovery,

at a depth of 682 fathoms (4092 feet), in lat. 63° 31' N., long. 13° 41' W., of

two testaceous Annelids, which he assumed to belong to " known shallow-

water forms," as further evidence of an extensive submergence of the North

Atlantic sea-bed. These Annelids were named by him Serpula vitrea and

Spirorhis naiitihides. But Professor Sars disputes their being shallow-water

=species. The former he identifies with his Serpula polita ( Placostegus

tridentatus, Fabricius) ; the latter is referred by Morchlj to the Serpula

spirorhis of Linne. The one is regarded by Sars as a deep-water and not

littoral species, being found on the Norwegian coast in 20-300 fathoms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                the

of the Sjnrorbis, and that it belongs to another species than that to which

cured living starfishes fi-om a depth of 1260 fathoms, under the circumstances
which he has described (viz. " convulsively embracing a portion of the
sounding-line, which had been paid out in excess of the akeady ascertained
depth, and rested for a sufficient period at the bottom to permit of their
attaching themselves to it"), no reasonable doubt can be entertained. I have
myself seen a number of Antedon (or Comatula) celtieus clinging to the rope
several feet fi-om the dredge when it was taken up from about 60 fathoms.
These starfishes must have crawled up the rope while the di'edge was in
motion or being hauled in, because no part of the rope had lain on the ground.

Dr. Carpenter teUs me that Antedon rosaceiis has the same habit of crawling

up and clasping a rope in shallow water.
   The greatest depth marked on the Admiralty charts in any part of the

Hebridean sea-bed which I examined is 132 fathoms. Here I got several
kinds of living Foraminifera. Xineteen years ago I di'edged near the same
ground, in 116 fathoms, a fine cluster of one of the compound Tunicata,
Diazona Hehrid'iea, of a greenish-pink colour. I do not mention this as a
great or even considerable depth. 8ars* and Korenf have done much more
on the coasts of Norway ; their dredging-explorations extended to 300
fathoms. In the paper from which I have extracted the above remarks as

to the distribution of animal life in the depths of the sea. Professor Sars has
enumerated no less than 52 species and distinct varieties of animals found by

--him at the depth of 300 fathoms. They may he thus classified : Porifera

(Sponges) 2 ; llhizopoda (Foraminifera) 19 ; Polypi (Actinozoa) 7 ; MoUusca
(Polyzoa 8, Tunicata 1, Mollnsca proper 10) 19; and Yei-mes (Annehda) 5.

He has also specified several Euhinoderms, Cirripeds, and Crustacea as in-

habiting somewhat less depths, viz. from 200 to 2.50 fathoms. The obser-
vations of the learned Norwegian zoologist confirm those of Sir James Ross
and Dr. AYallich, namely :

    1st. That the temperature of the sea is uniform (39°-5 Fahr.) over the
whole globe, below a certain line which forms an isothermal curve, with but
slight oscillations caused by changes of the atmosphere. This curve has its
greatest depth at the Equator, but reaches the surface of the ocean in lat.
56° 62', and dips again as it approaches the pole from this point.

   2nd. Although the pressure of the water is enormous at great depths, and
in 300 fathoms is equal to about 56 atmospheres or 840 lbs. on the square
inch X, yet the most brittle and delicate animals (such as Polyzoa and Polyps)
inhabiting such depths do not appear to suffer the slightest injuiy. Their
structui'e is porous and permeable by liquids, or accessible to an endosmotic
influence by which the pressiu'e is easily resisted.

   3rd. The want of light has always been considered an obstacle to the exist-

--ence of animal life at great depths not so mucli because light is dii'ectly

essential to animal life, as on account of its indirectly contributing to its
maintenance. It is generally supposed that animals are dependent on vege-
table life. This latter (as is well known) cannot exist without light, under
the influence of which the absorption of carbonic acid and the evolution of
oxygen are eftected. Light, however, exerts no such influence on animal life.
Sea-weeds (the true Alga)) disappear in about 200 fathoms ; and the only
vegetable organisms which descend to a greater depth, say 400 fathoms, are

DiatomaceEe. It may be observed, with respect to the action of light in
producing colour in animals, that although intensity of light may produce

a corresponding intensity of colour \inder ordinary cii'cumstances, yet the

diminution or absence of light in the sea is not necessarily followed by a

diminution or absence of colour in marine animals. Those taken from con-

siderable depths have frequently vivid colours. The animal of Lima excavata

(a comparatively gigantic species), from 300 fathoms, is of the same bright
red colour as those of L. Loscombii and L. hians from shaUovs^ water. It has

been shown that violet and blue rays of light (and probably actinic rays)

penetrate deepest in water. I will not here repeat what I have already

published* on this interesting subject; but I may add that all the animals

recorded as living at great depths are zoophagous, none of them phyto-

phagous. The deep-sea di-edgings of the Swedish Expedition to Spitz-

bergen in 1S61 yielded some valuable results. Adjunct-Professor ToreU

and Professor Keferstein communicated some short and imperfect notices to

the no^.thern journals ; but Professor Loven has lately given us fuller infor-

mation, which is published in the Transactions of Scandinavian Naturalists

Aat their ninth meeting held in 1863 1.  Brooke's lead and a ' Bulldog

machine, with several improvements, were used on this occasion. Depths

from 6000 to 8400 feet (1000-1400 fathoms+) were thus explored. The

sea- bottom at these depths was covered with a fine greasy-feeling material

of a yellow-brownish or grey colour, rich in Diatomacete § and Polythalamia,

and nearly devoid of sand. Professor Loven was furnished with the notes of

Messrs. Chydenius and Malmgren, made during the expedition, and with all

--the animals discovered in those great depths. The latter comprised : Anne-

lida, viz. species of Spiochcetopterus and CirratuJus ; Crustacea, viz. a Cuma

which appeared to be identical with C. rubicunda, LUljeborg, and an Apseudes

Mollusca, viz. a Cylichna ; Gephyrea, viz. a fragment of Mijriotroclms RinTci,

Steenstrup, and another allied form with large and fewer star-wheels, and of

smaller wheels of the Mi/riotrocJws-typc ; a species of Sipunculus resembling

8. margaritaceus, Sars ; and, lastly, a sponge, in which were found a Cope-

Cpod or Ostracod, and a fragment of a Cuma resembling nasica. In the

opinion of Loven these animals indicate, so far as can be judged by so small

a number, that in the abysses of the glacial seas there lives a fauna which

does not greatly differ from that which lives on the same kind of bottom at

much less depths. Proceeding upwards to the surface, from 50 or 60 fathoms

the regions or zones have a greater variety of animals, even over the same kind

of bottom. Taking this into consideration, and also recollecting that in the

Antarctic seas, at measui'able depths, there are forms of Mollusca and Crus-

tacea which exhibit partly generic, partly almost specific identity with north-

em and hyperborean forms, the idea occurs to him that, in depths of 60-80

fathoms and thence down to the greatest from which we hitherto know any

animal life, at least wherever the bottom is covered with a soft and fine mud

or clay, there exists from pole to pole, in all latitudes, a deep-sea fauna of the

same general character, many species of which have a very wide distribution.
He also thinks it probable that in the vicinity of both poles such a uniform

fauna approaches the surface ; while in tropical seas it occupies the depths

of the ocean, the coast line there being represented by vast regions of distinct

faunas, the circumferences or areas of which are much more limited. The

   X The Swedish foot makes only 974 English foot. The Scandinavian fathom is 6 feet.
   § This does not quite agree with the accounts of Wallich and Sars, which give 400

fathoms as the limit of vegetable life ; but it does not appear that the Diatomacese ob-

served by Loven had actually lived on the sea-bottom. They might have been pelagic
and floating kinds.

sea-bottom, at cousiderable depths, differs in its composition. Professor Sars

noticed that large Erachiopoda, stony corals, and Poljzoa, as well as certain

Mollusca (e. g. Anomia and Saxicava), which are peculiar to a hard or even

to a rocky bottom,  inhabit a  depth of 300 fathoms                                                                                               and Dr. Wallich found

a living Scypula attached to a stone at the depth of 682 fathoms. Captain

Beechey's dredgings off the Mull of Gallowaj', in l-iS fathoms (as reported

by the late Mr. Thompson of Belfast in the Annals and Magazine of

Natural History for September 1842, p. 21), yielded live specimens of Chiton

fasc'icidaris, C. cinercus, Trochits miUegranus, and Tnplion Barvkenf^is, all of

which are inhabitants of hard or stony, and never of soft ground, besides dead

shells of the same and similar species. The Hebridean sea-bed, at very

moderate depths (which Dr. Wallich would call " shallow water "), mainly

consists of a soft and more or less tenacious mud, mixed with stones of dif-

ferent sizes, and resembling in its composition the boulder-clay or 'glacial

--drift of Scotch geologists. It tells us of rocks ground down by glaciers year

after year in an arctic region of the mud produced by such attrition being

carried into the sea in the thawing-season by overwhelming floods, " non sine

montium clamore " (see Dr. Kane's description of the great Humboldt gla-

--cier) of its dispersion over the sea-bed by the action of tides and currents

of the deposit thus formed being inhabited by a variety of animals of a high

--northern tj'pe during a long and quiet course of time of the sea-bed being

elevated by slow degrees above the surface of the water by an agency which

we cannot satisfactorily explain, but which may have been volcanic or perhaps

--caused by steam * of the consequent extermination of these marine animals
-- --of an interval during which the raised sea-bed was dry land of a gradual
--amelioration of the climate of another oscillation of the earth's crust in

a downward direction, when the surface of the land, covered by its former

--deposit, again became the bottom of the sea and of a fresh succession of life,

which is still in existence. Thus a cycle of similar events continually recurs.

Nothing is lost or altogether perishes ; all the old materials are iiscd iip, and

assume new forms. It is the fashion to quote Lucretius. I will only indulge

in two lines ; they seem not to be inapplicable to the present subject :

" Hue accedit uti quicque in sua corpora rursum

  Dissoluat natura neque ad nilum interemat res."

   The kind assistance of Mr. Alder, Dr. Carpenter, the Rev. A. M. Norman,

--Messrs. Henry and George Brady, Dr. M'Intosh, and Mr. Peach all of them

--experienced zoologists enables me to supplement this report with notices of

other departments of the invertebrate fauna, which have resulted from the

last grant made to me. Several new species, especially among the smaller

Crustacea, have occurred ; and our knowledge of geographical distribution has
been not a little advanced by the work. Mr. Norman's services especially

deserve acknowledgment.

   Habitat. Muddy ground in the Minch, off the north-west coast of Eoss-

shire, in 50-60 fathoms. I there found only a single dead specimen ; but
twenty years ago I dredged another in Skye, which I deferred noticing until
quite satisfied of its differing from M. bidentata. [Since this Eeport was
presented, Mr. Dawson has found two more specimens in some of the di-edged

sand which I had sent him.] Among the shells procured by Professor

LiUjeborg in Bohuslan, on the south coast of Sweden, I observed two or three
specimens of the present species, one of which he kindly gave me.

   This shell is smaller than M. bidentata ; it may also be distinguished from

that species by its narrower shape, being convex instead of compressed,
having a glossy surface, and by the posterior side being extremely small, with
almost a perpendicular truncation. That side in 31. bidentata is invariably
squarish, and more or less angulated. The teeth in the right valve of M.
tumidida are much smaller, and less widely separated by the cartilage-pit
they are triangular instead of leaf-like, and slightly incline inwards instead
of being erect.

   M. truncata of Searles Wood, from the Coralline Crag, is a comparatively

large, squarish, and flattened shell, and has long cardinal teeth.

Report of the Committee appointed for the purpose of Exploring the

 --Coasts of the Hebrides by means of the Dredge. Part II. On the

    Crustacea, Echinodermata, Polyzoa, Actinozoa, and Hydrozoa.

   By the Rev. Alfred Merle Norman^ M.A.

Mr. Jeffreys having, in his Eeport upon the MoUusca, already given to the
Association an account of the district investigated by the Committee, aud of
the scope of their dredging-operations, it is unnecessary that I should add
more on that subject; and I shall therefore proceed at once to lay before
you a brief summary of the results of the dredging with respect to the Crus-
tacea, Echinodermata, Polyzoa, and Ccelenterata,

   Although the Hebridean seas had been frequently dredged by the natu-
ralists who were well acquainted with the Mollusca, they had been scarcely
at all examined by any one conversant nith the other branches of the marine
invertebrate fauna ; aud the result of the recent investigations has thus been
most important. This will be at once evident when it is stated that, in addi-

194 REPORT--1866.

tion to the knowledge which has been gained in the extension of the range

of many rare and local species, not less than seventy-two species are in the
present Report for the first time announced as members of the British fauna.

These additions to our lists include 63 species of Crustacea [Macroural,
Stomapoda 2, Amphijioda 8, Isopoda 1, Cladocera 1, Ostracoda 37, Cope-
poda 13], 6 of Polyzoa, 1 of Actinozoa, and 2 of Hydrozoa *.

   The Crustacea obtained number two hundred and twelve species. Among

them were two well-known southern forms, Xantho florida and Xantho rivu-

losa, which we little expected to find so far north ; the latter, however, has
been met with by Prof. Loven in Sweden, though neither had previously been
found on any part of the Scotch coast. They occurred in company between
tidemarks at Tobermory, and X. rivulosa was also found at Oban. Another
southern species, Cmngon sculptus, which had not before been found north of
Arran in Ireland,' was dredged in the Minch ; and with it was associated
Crangon serratus, ISTorman, described by me at the British Association Meet-
ing in 1861, from two specimens procured on the Haaf off Shetland. This

species had not again been taken in our seas until the present time ; but it
has been redescribed by Professor Sars, from the Norwegian coast, i;nder
the name of Grangon ecMnulatus f. X\\ Hippolyte, also dredged in the Minch,
appears to be an undescribed species. It approaches to //. turgicla of Ki-oyerJ,

but differs in many particulars, and especially in the telson, which has no

less than nine pairs of lateral spines, and terminates in thirteen spines, of
which the nine central are subequal in length and ciliated on both margins.
Dorypliorus Oordoni (Bate), which has hitherto been regarded as very rare,
occurred in abundance. Of the Cumacea there were found two species,
recently added to our fauna, Diastylis hispinosa. Say (=Z>. hicornis, Bate),

and Ihidorella (Endora) emarginata, Kroyer, together with two new forms,
one a Diastylis allied to D. hiplicata, G. 0. Sars, the other a new Iphitlwe,
which has a crest of from 13 to 20 spines on the dorsal line of the cara-

pace.

    Several Norwegian Amphipoda, including some genera of great interest,
were for the first time met with in our seas, namely, Ampelisca carinata,
Bruzelius, A. macrocepluda , Lilljeborg, and A. tenuicomis, Lilljeborg, Eriopis

elongata, Bruzelius, and Mara Loveni, Bruzelius. There were also found an

undescribed Anonyx, and two forms which it is impossible to assign to any
genera which have been hitherto established ; for these I propose the names
Euonyx cJielatus and Microprotop^is macidatus. The genus Euonyx is allied
to Anonyx, but is distinguished by having the first pair of gnathopods fur-
nished with distinct chelaj, and the second pair more strongly formed than
the first, with a weU-devcloped subchelate hand. This is a parasitic species
living on Echinus esculentus. Microprotopus is allied to Microdeuteropus,
but has the first gnathopod feeble, the second largely developed in the male,
and subchelate, and the last uropods single-branched.

   Three parasitic Isopoda were taken Gyge Hip)polytes, Kruyer, Ph-yxus

* If to these we add Montacuta tumidula, n. sp., described in Mr. Jeffreys's Eeport, and

the Poraminifera eninnerated by Mr. H. B. Brady as occurring for tlie first time in our

seas, viz. Lagena Jcffrcysii, H. B. Brady, n. sp., L. Lyellii, Sequenza, L.j)idchella, H. B.

Fauna in this expedition.

ahdominalis, Kroyer, and PUurocrypta GalatJiece, Hesse : the first was found
imder the carapace of Doryplwrus Gordoni ; the second under the abdomen of

Hippolyte securifrons, Norman, and H.pusiola, Ki'oyer ; and the Pleurocrypta

=was buried under the carapace of Galathea intermedia, Kroyer ( (?. dispersa.

Bate).

Ostracoda were obtained in extraordinary abundance, and inchided no less

than sixty-five species. This number will, perhaps, be the more appre-
ciated if I refer to the fact that the total number of forms of this order of

the Crustacea described in ' Baird's History of British Entomostraca ' only

amounts to nineteen. Mr. G. S. Brady, who is engaged in preparing a mono-

graj^h of these bivalve Crustacea, will present a separate report on the species

met with ; but I may here mention that thirty-seven are either wholly new
to science, or, what is stUl more interesting, species previously known as
Tertiary and post-Tertiary Fossils, and now for the first time met with in a

recent state, or such as have been described by Norwegian naturalists from

the Scandinavian seas.

  A number of Copepoda recently described by Clans, were also met with.

--These include many genera which were previously unrecognized in our fauna :
   the genus Dactylopus, represented by tishoides, Stroemii, tenuicornis, cinctus,

and hrevicornis ; Thalestrls, embracing mysis, Helgolandica, harpacticoides,

and  hngimana                                               Longipedia  coronnta (a very curioi;s  and interesting  form),
                                                         ;

Eupelte gracilis, Clefa serrafa, and PorceUklium Jimhriatum and dentatum.

At Tobermory was discovered Dyspontius striatus, Thorell, a very remarkable

genus with an enormously developed proboscis, which is almost equal in

length to the rest of the animal.

  A small freshwater loch near Stornoway contained, among other species,

Drepanothrix hamata, G. 0. Sars, a genus allied to Macrothrir, which may

be at once distinguished from aU allies by the presence of a largely developed

spine in the middle of the dorsal margin of the carapace. It is now first

announced as British, but has been previously taken by myself in Darden

Loch, Northumberland, and by Mr. G. S. Brady in St. Mary's Loch, Selkirk-

shire.

The Echinoderms number thirty-four species. In addition to the common

Antedon rosaceus, Linck, Antedon Celticus of Barrett was procured in deep
water, both in the Minch and in Sleat Sound. This very fine species was
previously only known to us from the two type specimens dredged by Messrs.
MacAndi-ew and Barrett ten years ago in the Sound of Skye, and described
in the ' Annals of Natural History ' *. It is the largest member of the genus

found in our seas, and is distinguished at a glance from rosaceus, Milleri,

and Sarsii by the great length of the slender dorsal filaments, and also by
the vertical position which the arms assume. In this pecuharity it resembles

Antedon Eschrichtii, but diflfers from the other English species, in which the

arms are always carried horizontally, or nearly so, and are incapable of
being brought into contact with each other throughout their entire length.

Only a few specimens were met with in Sleat Sound, and these were as-
sociated with A. rosaceus. In the Minch A. Celticus occurred gregariously,

living in about sixty fathoms, in company with another rare British Echino-

derra, Holothuria intestinalis, Ascanius. The only previously known British
example of this species was procured many years ago by Professor Forbes

near tlic same spot ; and as his figure and descviptionf were scarcely sufficient

for positive identification, the rediscovery of this Holothurian is important.

Lepralia-Y\kc state of Eschara Lnndshorovii ; another remarkable on ac-

count of its much elevated collar-like peristome ; a new EscJiara, and an

Alecio allied to A. dilatans. There is also an uudescribed Alcyonidium : but

the species of this genus are very difficult ; and not having examined the

present form in a living state, I have not attempted to define it. One or two

small fragments of Brettia pellucida, Dyster, give a second locality for this

Polyzoan, at a considerable distance from Tenby, where the type was found.

Several rare northern Polyzoa, which had not previously occurred to the
soiith of Shetland, are now traced southwards to the Minch C'aherea EUisii,
Fleming, Lepndia polita, Norman, Leprcdia laqueata, Norman, Idmonea At-
lantica, Eorbes, Hornera horecdis, Busk, &c. ; and on the other hand we were
greatly surprised by the well-known Eschara foUaeea turning up ia this

northern locality, since it is an- essentially southern species, which has not
previously, I believe, been noticed to the north of Cape Clear.

   Turning to the Actinozoa, the neighbourhood of Skye is the well-known

habitat of Pavonaria rpuidrangularls, although the only place which produced
it during the recent dredging was Loch Alsh. The rediscovery of Rhizoxenia

-- --agglomerata, Forbes* although a mere fragment was obtained is well

worthy of special mention ; but perhaps the most interesting of all the results

of the expedition is the occurrence of a second species of Pennatida in oiu-

seas, which will be described by Mr. Alder under the name of Pennatula

mollis.

The Hydi'ozoa are not numerous, amounting to only thirty-two species,

Sertidaria (data, Hincks, and Calicella fastlgiata. Alder, had up to the

present time been regarded as peculiar to Shetland ; the little Sertidaria

fusiformis, Hincks, and the pretty Phimidaria tuhidifera, Hincks, not known

previously on the Scotch coast, have now their range considerably extended

northwards                                                    and  in the Appendix there                                                                                                                                                           are characters of two Halecia, new

to science, one of which, Halecium genictdafum, is remarkable on account of

its flexuous hydrosoma, which is bent alternately right and left between the

hydi'otheca;, and on account of the great length of the simple tubidar hydi-o-

thecae ; the other, Halecium sessile, may be distinguished by its very small

and perfectly sessile hydrotheca;, and by the veiy large non-retractile poly-

pites.

The Sponges have not as yet been determined. It is, however, worthy of

mention that three species peculiarly characteristic of the Haaf of the Shet-

land seas were living in the Minch, enjoying the companionship of many

other of their northern friends. These species were Tetliea cranium, Midler,

Isodictya infund ibuliformis, Linn., and Phal-ellia ventiJahrum, Linn.

 --Mcde. Eye small, round, crimson, situated on a lobe between the bases of

the two pairs of antennae. Antennte subequal, superior having peduncle
reaching a little beyond the peniUtimate joint of the peduncle of the in-

ferior antennte ; basal joint stouter than, but equal in length to, the second;
third joint shorter and more slender than the preceding ; appendage minute,
two-jointed, not so long as first joint of filament, which consists of nine or

ten articulations, and is of about equal length with the peduncle. Inferior

antennae stronger than the superior, and, as well as the superior, furnished

with scattered hairs, but no spines. Mandible with a three-jointed palp.

First gnathopods having the hand of equal length to the wrist, but broader,

"widening from the base to the extremity, palm oblique, concave ; nail well

developed, simple, extending rather beyond the palm. Second gnathopods

having the wrist very short, hand greatly developed, as long as, or even longer

slightly concave, with a tooth-like process (wanting in the young) at the

base, and two large teeth on the distal third ; finger large, strong, curved,

fully as long as the hand; the inner margin under a high power of the

microscope is seen to be finely crenated, or, rather, rasped like a file. Uropods

 blunt ; ovicell globular, smooth, inclining inwards ; vibracular capsules of
 moderate size, erect, bUobed ; vibracula long, arising from between the lobes
 of the capsules. Height half an inch. Dredged in deep water in the Minch,
 also at Shetland. Differs from S. scrvposa in haying the cells larger, not
 furnished with sjnnes, and in the vibracular capsules, which are propor-
 tionately large, and the mandible of the avicularia being shorter and blunter.

                              Eschara quincuncialis, Norman, n. sp.

     Polyzoary white, smooth, polished, cylindrical. Cells distant, in linear series,

regularly arranged in quincunx, swoUen, mammiform. Apertures keyhole-
shaped, rounded above, with a small sinus below, immediately beneath which
a small inconspicuous avicularium is sometimes present. Ovicell small, with
1-4 round perforations.

    The specimen described is apparently a fragment, and is not more than a
quarter of an inch long. It is, however, manifestly distinct from aU the
Eschane with which we were previously acqiiainted. Dredged in deej) water
in the Minch.

                                 LepraUa coJlans, Norman, n. sp.

    Cells small, crowded, linearly arranged, not in quiucimx, granular, not

punctiu'ed round the margin ; mouth arch-formed, rounded above, truncate
below ; peristome greatl}^ elevated into a frUl-like plate which surrounds the
sides and lower margin of the mouth, within which there is no denticle

ovicell globular, of moderate size, punctate.
    In small patches on old shells and stones from the Minch, coast of Antrim,

Guernsey, and Shetland. It will be evident from the foregoing list of
localities that this species is widely distributed on our coasts. It has been
hitherto mistaken (Ijy Mr.Busk, Mr. Alder, and myself) iov L. eximia, Hincks,

in common with which species it has the peculiar collar-formed peristome
but having recently had an opportunity of examining Mr. Hiucks's typical
and onlj' known specimen of L. e.vimia, I found it to be a wholly different
form from that which is now described.

                              Lepralia crystallhui, Norman, n. sp.

    Cells short, obovate, of moderate size, and moderately tumid, not regularly
arranged, nor separated from each other by raised lines, nor areolated at the
margin ; white, crystalline, punctate, punctures round, few, equally distri-

buted on aU parts of the ceU ; mouth triangular, lateral walls much raised,

margined above with five spines (rarely present), a small avicularium at the
lower angle of the mouth, with short rounded mandible directed downwards
a bifid tooth-like process within the mouth ; oviccU globular, crystalline,

punctate.

   On shell and stone in very small patches. The Minch and Shetland in deep

water. Nearly allied to L. Landshorovii, as compared with which the cells
are smaller, shorter, more convex, less regularly disposed, not separated from
each other by distinct raised lines, more regularly pimctate than is usual in
L. Landshorovii, in which the punctures are often absent from the centre
of the cell ; the mouth also is more angular.

                       · Alecto compacta, Nonnan. n. sp.

    Polyzoary narrow at the base, thence rapidly widening and irregularly
ramifying, branches wide and short, their terminations rounded ; remarkably
flat, and closely appressed to the shell. Cells very small, irregularly scattered
and separated from each other, shortly tubular, scarcely raised above the
                                                                                      ;

level of the polyzoary, all inclining towards distal extremity of branches,
thouo-h bending slightly towards the side of the polyzoary to which they are

nearest. Colour white. On stone and shell. The Minch and Shetland in

deep water.
   A. conipacta approaches more nearly to A. dilatans than to the other de-

scribed species, but is much smaller and more delicate in all its parts, and

depressed flat to the surface instead of being raised in a swollen cushion-like
manner. A. dilatans is usually tinged with violet, while A. com^acta is

always white, and approaches in many respects to a Diastopora.

Class Htdrozoa.

                           Hahciimi c/enicidatiim, Norman, n. sp.

   Hydrosoma slender, branching, the branches (in tyi)e specimen) all in the
same plane ; branchlets flexuous, bending alternately right and left between
the hydrothecfe (as in Laomedea genicidata) ; one hydrotheca to each internode;
the internode terminating immediately above the hydrotheca and marked by
a single stricture, or more rarely two. IIydrotheca3 diverging at about an
angle of 45° from the ccenosarc, miich elongated, simply tubular, fully two-
thirds as long as the internodes of the coenosarc, and 3-6 times as long as
their own diameter ; a constriction near the base, at the point where the more
strongly developed chitine of the base of the hydrotheca is exchanged for a
membrane of more delicate structure. Height an inch and a half. Dredged
in deep water in the Minch.

Ilalecium sessile, Norman, n. sp.

   Hydrosoma slender, irregularly branching, branches not in the same plane
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

branchlets having alternate hydrothecte, and a single constriction above each
hydrotheca. Hydrothecae very short and perfectly sessile, not rising at all
separately from the hydrosoma, of the lateral projections of which they are
mere openings, without being raised into any tube. Polypites large, not re-
tractile, very narrow at the base, where they rise from the hydrotheca, thence
gradually widening to near the summit, where they suddenly swell into a
wide campanulate mouth surrounded by long and slender filiform tentacles
the polypites rise above the hydrotheca to a height (exclusive of tentacles)
which is not less than five times its diameter, and far overtop the level of the
succeeding hydrotheca. Height ijrobably an inch and a half, though the
fragments obtained are not more than half that length. Dredged in deep
water in the Minch.

--P.S. It will be observed that the Hst of Ostracoda given in the foregoing

Eeport differs from that of Mr. G. S. Brad_y. This arises from the fact that

the Reporter has had an opportunity of revising the lists at a much later
period (May 10, 1867), when further time had allowed a more complete exa-

mination to be made of the material collected. The present lists, in the
drawing up of which he has been assisted by Mr. Brady, have thus been

rendered more full and more correct.

Notices of some Invertebrata, in connexion with the Report of Mr,

   Gwyn Jeffreys on Dredging among the Hebrides. By Joshua

   Alder.

A Serpula lately dredged by Mr. Jeffreys in the Hebrides, on the fragment

of an old shell, possesses some interest in a physiological point of view, on
account of the peculiar character of its shell. It is slender and strongly

carinated through the greater part of its length, not unlike the common

Serpida triquetra, but rather more slender. Near the mouth, however, there
is an oblong bulbous swelling of the same substance as the shell, but rather

less compact and more brittle ; this terminates in a double arch in front. On

examining its structiire, we find that this bulbous portion consists of two
cells, divided from each other by a thin wall of shell, and that the triangular
tube of the general body is continued through its base, with the mouth of the

tube opening generally immediately below it. In one instance, however, the

tube is continued for a short distance in front of the sweUidg. Mr. Jeffreys

suggests that this protuberance may be an egg- ease, which I think is very

probable, as there is a small external aperture in front of each partition,

which apparently communicate with the tubular portion posteriorly. I am

not aware that any similar structure has been before observed in the tabular

Annelids ; and I therefore now take the opportunity of bringing the circum-
stance under the notice of naturalists, in order that it may be investigated

by those more immediately connected with the study of this department of

zoology. The species appears to be a new one ; but it is impossible to speak

with certainty in the absence of the animal inhabitant of the tube. In one
individual two of these protuberances have been formed, one behind the other.

                                    Pennatfla mollis, n. sp. 5^ .5I 'l? ^ · * f " 2-

    Pohjpary 4 or 5 inches long, of a brick-red colour, variegated with darker

red streaks, slender, rather soft and flaccid. Stem slender, rovmded, smooth,
and very slightly bulbous at the base, occupying from one-third to half the
length of the compound body. Rhacliis smooth in front, except an undu-
lating line of tubercles running at the base of the pinnae on each side ; the
back of the rhachis has a smooth groove in the centre, on each side of which it
is set with small pointed granules, smaller and less crowded than ia P. plws-
fliorm. Pinnce compressed, flaccid, slightly fusiform, about half an inch long
in the centre of the rhachis, but decreasing towards each end ; these terminate
in a rather obtuse point at the apex, and diminish gradually to minute pro-
cesses below ; they are placed a Httle further apart, are less triangular, and
have a narrower base than those of P.pTiosjpliorea. Polype-cells cylindrical, set
in a single row on the front margin of each pinna, and terminating as usual
in eight denticles ; they are rather shorter and less spiculose than in P. phos-
pTiorea, and number about twelve in each row of the longer pinnee. This species
has considerable resemblance to the Pennatula phosphorea of our coast, the

difierences between them, though weU marked, being only comparative. It
is larger, more slender, and much softer and more flaccid in all its parts than

that species. This latter character arises principally from the fewer spicula
in its composition, from which cause also it is of a paler and duller red, the
colouring-matter being principally confined to the spicula. The pinnae are not
so crowded as in P. pliosphorea, and are less fii-mly and broadly set on the
rhachis, leaving a little more space in front.

   It is probable that this may be Pallas's Pennatula rubra, var. /3, of which

he says, " Datur varietas, in oceauo praesertim, longior, gracilior, pianis
angustioribus, magisque distantibus, caliculis pinnarum rarioribus et promi-
nentioribus." There can be little doubt, however, that this species is distinct
from the P. rubra of Pallas, which is the P. p>7iosp7iorea of British authors, and
probably also of Linne. The differences between them are as great as is
usual in other species of this genus.

    This is an interesting addition to our faiina, one species only of Pennatula

having been previously known as British,

inhabitants of other seas, and one {Ciitheropteron irlcorne) is now for the
first time noted as occurring in a recent state. It should, however, be men-
tioned that, of the fifteen species here named as new to our seas, eleven were

previously represented in my collection by specimens (unrecorded) from other

parts of the British coast.

  A sjiecies closely allied to Ihjohates pratexta (/. r/lacialis, MS.) has been

found by Messrs. Crosskey and Robertson pretty abundantly in the fossil

state in the oldest deposit of glacial clay which has come under their

notice, and it is worthy of remark that the recent species now dredged is
much smaller and apparently more poorly developed than the fossil one,
though in general character and appearance so much like it as to make me
suspect that the one may possibly be the lineal descendant of the other. If

this be so, it forms an interesting contrast to C'>/theridea jp^'P'^^osa, the

living specimens of which are mostly much finer than those of the tertiary

--period. C. ixtpRlosa is an abundant species in many districts in Loch Fyne,
--for instance, it occurs in immense numbers and of fine growth while Ihj-

ohates prcetexta appears to be rare, and is probably confined to our uorthern

Weseas.  may therefore infer that the one species is verging towards ex-

tinction, at least in our latitudes, while the other is thriving, and for the jire-
sent successful in the " struggle for existence.'' Of the sixty species here

catalogued, thirty-two are known to occur in the glacial clays of Scotland
these are marked with an asterisk, and it may be noted that the two sjiecies

which perhaps occur most abundantly in the older clays, Cytlieridea punc-

tillata and CyOiere concinnci, do not appear to be of frequent occurrence at

the present day, and are confined to northern habitats.

   As to the geographical distribution of the various species, it may be re-

marked that sixteen of the number are essentially northern in their range, so

far as our present knowledge extends ; these are Bairdia obtusata, B. compla-

wita, Ci/there concinna, C. angidata, C. Dmielmensis, Cytlieridea papUlosa,

C Cpunctillata, inermis, C. dentata, Ilyohates prcetex'ta, BytJiocythere sim-

plex, B. jlexuosa, Pseudocy there caudata, Cytherella lavis, C. Scotica, and

Cypridina MacAndrei. None of these have been found (except one or two

specimens of Cytlieridea punctillata) in any locality south of the Dogger

Bank, and most of them are confined to the shores of Scotland. On the

other hand, our list includes one species which attains its highest develop-

ment in more southern localities, such as the seas around the Channel

Islands, the south coast of England, and the south-west of Ireland. This is

Cythere emaciafa, of which only one specimen, and that a poor one, has been

detected in the Hebridean gatherings.

It is impossible at present to institute any satisfactory comparison between

the recent Ostracoda of our seas and those of the Continent, as, except in

Scandinavia, scarcely anything has been done amongst this group by conti-

nental natiiralists. In general terms, however, it may be said that the

Ostracoda of the K^orthern British seas exhibit a close approach to those of
Norway.

                   Report on Dredging in the Moray Firth.
        By the Rev. Walter Macgregor and Robert Dawson.

The Committee appointed by the British Association for the Advancement
of Science for dredging the Moray Eirth engaged the same vessel as they
did last year, and sailed from Macduff on the 13th of July. They contmued
at sea for fifteen days. During the whole time the weather was most im-

favourable, and in consequence the dredgings were in a great measure con-
fined to the western part of the Eirth. So stormy was_ the weather on the

18th, that the vessel was obliged to run into Cromarty Eirth.
   In the Eeport laid before the Association at their Meeting of 1865, the

number of MoUusca belonging to the district was set down at 259. Smce

                                                                                                             p2

--that ileeting 13 species have been added to the Est, distributed as follows :
    Of the Cephalopoda, EJedone octopodia, Sepiola Rondeletii, Lollgo vulgaris,
and Bepla officinalis ; of the Prosobranchiata, Mangelia hrachystoma, M. ne-
bula and M. lipvigata (besides M. pjiramidalis in a fossil state), Defrcmcia
purpurea, ani liissoa costata \ of the Laniellibranchiata, Area pectunculoides
and Leda pygnicm (two valves of each), both dredged off the Ord of Caith-
ness, and Scrobicularia nitida.

   It may be worth mentioning, that in Cromarty Baj- the dredges were put
down in four fathoms of water, and brought up alive Rissoa costuta in

abundance, Natica Alderi, Leda minuta, Arinus jlexuosus, iScrohicuJaria
nitida, Corbula gihba, and Panopea plicata.

   Of the Crustaceans (Brachyura) found on this and former occasions, maybe
mentioned Hyas coarctatus in spawn (July, October, and November), Eury-

nome aspera, Portunus puher, P. depurafor, P. marmoreus, Ebalia Pennantii,
E. branchii, Atelecyelus heferodon in groat numbers, and Lithodes Maia.

    Of Anoraoura are the following : Pagurus lo'vis, Porcellana platychelex
(one specimen) and P. hngicomis in great abundance, Galathea strigosa and
G. disperse, Munida liondeletii, CaUianassa suhterranea, Gebia deltura, Ca-
loearis Macanlrea>, Nephrops norvegicus, and Pandalus annidicornis.

    The examination of the Stomapoda has yielded Vaunthomsonia cristata,
Ewlora, n. s., and Bodotria arenosa.

    The Amphipoda normalia, so far as examined, have given Ampelisca
 Gdimardii, Urothoii viari)ius, Ampliitho'e rabricata, and Corophium BonelU,

Many of this class remain unexamined.
   Of the Isopoda aberrantia may be mentioned Tanais Dulongii. The Iso-

poda are Cerolana hertipes, u^ga bicarinata, and Rocinela Banmonieiisis.

  A Holibut was caught, and off it was taken Lepeophtheinis Idppoglossi.

    The Annelida are as yet unexamined.

   Few species of the Echinodermata came up, the only noteworthy one
being Bi'yssiopjsis lyrifer. One specimen of Uraster rubens may be men-

tioned for its size. It measured 18| inches across.
    The Polyzoa and Hydrozoa yielded nothing worthy of remark, except a

fine specimen oi Rhizostoma pulmo.
    The only specimen of the Actinozoa dredged was a very young Adamsia

palliata. As the ActinioB, not contained in the former Keport, are mentioned
in the 'Actinologia Britannica,' it is deemed unnecessary to enumerate them.

    The Committee have to return their warmest thanks to Dr. Gray, 3Ir.
Bate, Dr. Bowerbank, and the llev. A. il. Norman. Without their help, so
freelj- and so kindly given, this Keport, as well as the former, would not have
been half so complete. The Committee have to express their regret that the
weather was so unpropitious, as they have every reason to think that much
more would have been accomphshed had they reached one or two of the
banks on which they were anxious to dredge.

 Report of the Committee on the Transmission of Sound- Signals under
                                                         water.

At the last Meeting of the Association a Committee, consisting of the Eev,

Dr. Robinson, Professor 'V^Tieatstone, Dr. Gladstone, and Professor Hennessy,
was appointed to Report on the transmission of sound-signals under water.

    In the year 1826 M. Colladon made acoustical experiments in the Lake of
Geneva, which it is unnecessary to further describe, as a detailed account of
                                                                           ;

them lias been given by Professor Hennessy in a Report, printed in the volume
of the Eeports of the Association for 1801*.

   If these experiments should lead to an available means of communication
between two ships in company at sea, or between a ship and the coast during
foggy weather, an important purpose would be accomplished.

   At first the attention of the Committee was directed to repeating M. Col-
ladon's experiments, substituting for the bell he employed cyHndrical bars of

steel, from 6 to 8 feet in length, and from 1 inch to 1| inch in diameter;
these were supported on, or suspended from, their nodal points, and struck
with hammers of different weights at one of their ends, so as to excite them
longitudinally. These experiments were made in the large water-trough of

the Polytechnic Institution, and subsequently in the ornamental waters of the
Eegent's Park : the available distance in the former case was about seventy
yards, in the latter about half a mile. Employing CoUadon's ear-trumpet,

the sounds were very distinctly heard, and even at the short distance in the
Polytechnic, the sounds through the air were separated from those heard
through the water by a distinct interval. The character of the sound was,
however, very different in the two cases ; that transmitted through the water
being more abrupt, though in both cases they were mere blows or impulses, as

the method of excitation was not intended to produce continuous musical

sounds. Though the sounds were not of a character produced by any musical

instrument, yet a pitch could be recognized in them in the same manner as a

pitch can be perceived in blows made at different parts of a table. By select-

ing two bars of different lengths, the sounds produced by each might be com-

bined in the different orders of succession, which constitute the telegraphic

Wealphabet.  did not extend these experiments further on account of the

expense which would be incurred by the purchase of a sufficient number of

bars to enable us to ascertain the best dimensions for the effective production of

the required sounds, and also in the expectation that we might, by the opera-

tion of some members of the Association, obtain the temporary loan of such

materials.

Professor Hennessy, who resides on the sea-side, near Dublin, is willing to

undertake such further experiments as would be required for testing the

application of sound-signals in extensive spaces out at sea. On this point Dr.
Gladstone has already made a few experiments at Eastbourne. He and his
children had taken two boats when there was considerable movement on the

surface, and the sounds were produced from one boat while they were listened

for from the other. Musical sounds appeared to be immediately stopped, while

a blow struck end ways on an iron bar could bo heard at a great distance.

Soimds produced in the air did not seem to penetrate through the water

but the sound of breaking waves on the shingle of the shore was distinctly

heard throiigh the water. This noise heard through the water resembled a

series of sharp ticks, and could be easily distinguished at a considerable dis-

tance. The detection of this kind of sound is manifestly interesting with

reference to the guidance of vessels approaching a coast during the prevalence

of a fog. Such noises, though extinguished in their passage through air

during a fog, would still be transmitted through water, so as possibly to act

at certain parts of the coast as a natural fog-signal.

The attention of the Committee has been specially directed to the produc-

tion of musical sounds under water. The instruments which appeared to be
most available for this purpose were Cagniard de la Tour's Syren, and pipes

or whistles, in which the vibrations were caused by currents of water in masses

ot the same liquid. "WTieii limited volumes of water were employed, powerful

sounds were obtained in both cases ; but in large reservoirs we met with
an unexpected difRculty, for we found that musical sounds, which could be

heard through considerable distances in air, became totally extinguished at
very short distances from the point of origin in water. Even when sounds
were produced with considerable intensity in a confined vessel, as a pail or

tub, when the vessel was plunged in a large reservoir the sound communi-
cated to the air became remarkably deadened, and the intensity was more
diminished as the instrument was placed at a greater distance beneath the
surface of the water. The rapid extinction of musical sounds in water ren-
ders it almost hopeless to employ them for communicating signals in that
medium. 'SVe must therefore, if this investigation is to be continued, revert
to experiments similar to those of M. Colladon, and confine ourselves to the

transmission of shocks or impulses communicated to bars or pieces of metal
of various forms and dimensions.

Report of the Lunar Committee for Mapping the Surface of the Moon.

   By W. R. BiRT, at the request of the Committee, consisting of

   James Glaisher, F.R.S., Lord Rosse, F.R.S., Sir John Herschel,

   Bart., F.R.S., Professor Phillips, F.R.S., Warren De la Rue,
   F.R.S., Rev. W. R. Dawes, F.R.S., Rev. T. W. Webb, F.R.A.S.,

    J. N. LocKYER, F.R.A.S., H. S. Ellis, F.R.A.S., Herr Schmidt,

   and W. R. Birt, F.R.A.S.

In the Eeport which I had the honour to present to the Members of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science at Birmingham, the
steps taken by the Committee appointed at Bath for ensiu'ing as full and
accurate a Register of Lunar Objects as could be obtained, wei'e described in
detail with the Forms issued by the Cominittee for obtaining this object, to
which were added a few notices of the more remarkable features of the Lunar
Siu'faee which had presented themselves in the course of observation.

    It was in the first instance proposed to construct an outline 5[ap of the
Moon's Surface foiu- times the area of that of Beer and Miidler, or 75 inches

in diameter ; every object entered in the Eegister to be inserted on the Map :
the outline of a Map of this size was exliibitedto the Section.

   In the Resolution reappointing the Committee, tlie object expressly men-
tioned, is that " of making further progress in mapping the surface of the
Moon ;" and while the Committee has not lost sight of the objects contem-
plated in its original appointment, it has, in consequence of some remarks
of the President of the Association, Professor Phillips, when the Report was

read, mainly directed its eflfbrts to the construction of an accurate outUne Map

of 100 inches in diameter.

   In noticing the progress made in this department of its labours, it may be

well to glance at the materials at present available for the purpose. These
are, well- determined positions of the First Order, and existing Photographs.

    In Appendix I. will be found the rectangular coordinates of all the posi-

tions of the fii'st order determined up to the time of Beer and Miidler. I am

not aware that any have been determined since, unless Herr Schmidt, of

Athens, may have added to the number, but his measures are as yet un-

publisned.
                                           ON MAPPING THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.  215

Of existing photographs, I am a^yal·e of only ouo that can be emploj'ed

in connexion with positions of the first order for obtaining an approximation

to the true places of unmeasured points ; but this, which was taken by "Warren

De La Eue, Esq., on October 4, 1865, at 9'' 0"^ 4% G. M. T., represents

the disk at an epoch so near that of mean libration, which occurs only once

Xin three years, that the abscissas may be measured on it without appre-
Yciable error, and the ordinates require but a small correction. I now

proceed to notice the work done under these heads.

  My first step was to project orthographically on one sheet of paper a

.quadrant of the moon's disk of 50 inches radius. The quadrant chosen as

the most convenient was the fourth. After laying down the meridians

and parallels, I inserted in this quadrant all the points of the first order,

amounting only to twenty-three (see Appendix I.). It is greatly to be regretted

that these points are so few, and that the triangles of which they form

the points are so large, as in employing photographs taken at any other

epoch than that of mean libration, or, indeed, by using any method, so far

as I am aware, except determinations of the first srder, libration enters so

extensively, that even at short distances from these points the results of

measures become very uncertain ; and as the formula; for computing the

existing libration at any given epoch are only available for determining the

selenographical longitude and latitude of the centre of the apparent disk at

that epoch, and do not assist in the determination of the position of any other

point except by the aid of direct measures and the computation of certain

angles, it is the more important to augment the number of positions of the

first order. With this view, I have prepared from Lohrmann's work, ' Topo-

graphic der Sichtbaren Mondoberflache,' compared with Beer and Madler's

' Der Mond,' a modification of the forms adopted by those selenographers for

this purpose according to the method of Encke, which necessarily includes

the computation of the libration. (See Appendix II.)

The twenty-three points of the first order in Quadrant IV. were carefully

laid down by du-ect measurement from the equator and first meridian, and

checked in every case by measuring from point to point the sides of the

triangles formed by them, and given by Beer and Miidler in ' Der Mond,' pp.
80-82. Taking the moon's semidiameter equal unity, the greatest error (a

solitary instance) amounted to -0008, which is much less than errors arising

from contraction &c. of the paper employed. In addition to points of the

first order, several of the second order have been inserted.

The coincidence of the equator of the photograph of October 4, 18(35,

enlarged to 10 inches in diameter, with that of the moon was next ascertained.
At mean libration the moon's equator is projected on the disk as a straight
line, and if the i^hotograph be taken at the exact instant of mean libration,

the moon's equator will coincide with a straight line across the disk equally

distant from each pole. The appearance of the moon Avhen full difi'crs, as

is well known, fi-om that which is presented at the various phases ; many

prominent objects quite disaj^pcar, and it is not so easy to pick out those

that can be seen as when they are near the terminator. I was able, how-

--ever, to ascertain, with some degree of precision, the following points : South

--of the Equator--Messier, Theophilus, Dollond, Albategnius, Herschel, and
Gassendi                                   North of the Equator  Picard, Dionysius,- Linne Aristillus, Pico,
                                        ;

and Kepler. Appendix IV. contains the measures of these points from the

apparent equator on the photograph, and the comparison of them with the

abscissse of the same points given by Beer and Miidler. The mean diff'erence

for those south of the equator is -0019, and for those north of the equator
216 REPORT--1866,

=·0052, moon's scmitliamctcr 1-0. It is consequently assumed that measures

for latitude south of the equator will not involve any great error in trans-

ferring them to the larger scale of 100 inches. The lihration in latitude

= + --_0° 20' ; in longitude 0° 40' +,

   The measures of the above-named points, fi-om the apparent central meri-

dian for longitude, were, as might he expected from the greater amount of

lihration in longitude,, not so accordant with the ordinatcs as those for latitude

Avere with the abScissDe ; the mean of the most accordant differences west of

Athe meridian amounts to as much as -OlOo, while east= -007.  correction

of -020 has consequently been applied to all measures west of the meridian.

Under these circumstances, it is considered that as close an approximation as a

combination of direct measurement with measures on photographs taTien at or

near the epoch of mean lihration will afford, has been obtained for the basis of
the Map. Still, for obvious reasons, it would be well to augment positions of

the first order, especially as outlines laid down from a photograph taken at

full moon differ materially from those furnished by a photograph taken at an

earlier or later phase.

   Among the forms issued by the Committee last year was one (Form No. 2)

for aiding in the formation of a catalogue of lunar objects by symbolizing

them (see Report, 1 865, p. 288), by means of which each area of 5° of latitude

and 5° of longitude is distinguished by a distinct symbol, IV A", IV A/^, &c.,

for example. Every object discernible on the photograph of October 4, 1865,
between 0° and 15° of longitude and 0° and 10° of latitude, has been carefully

measured, and inserted on the projection of Quadrant IV. above-mentioned,

the areas included being IV A«, IV A.^, IV Ay, IV A ?, IV A-J, and IV A^. The

angular points bounding the portion of the surface thus measured are as

--follows : The centre of the moon's visible disk in mean lihration, and the

region between Ptolcmaus and Albategnius on the east, and Dollond and

Theon Senior on the west. This region forms part of the mountainous

district between the Sinus Medii and Hare TranquiUifatis, and is characf

terized by great diversity and irregularity of surface. As the direction in

--which the light is received from the moon when full is nearlj' the same but
--reversed as that in which it falls upon the surface from the sun, it is clear

we have on the photograph of the full moon the " ground markings " on the

visible disk destitute of all hypsometrical affections, and the light and shade

indicate the reflective power of the surface only. There are a variety of

degrees of reflective power ; but from an attentive consideration of the pho-

tograph, they maj' generally be regarded as Jive, from the bright white surface

Asurrounding many craters to the dark surfaces of the Maria.  tracing of

the markings thus laid down has been executed, in which a conventional

mode has been introduced for distinguishing the variety of tints. This

tracing is very useful for comparing the features of the full moon with those

observed at earlier and later phases, and some interesting results have been

obtained, to which allusion will be made presently.

If the features of the full moon only were laid down on a map, the student

would be utterly unable to recognize any of the minute details which are

·seen near the terminator. In the absence of a photograph taken sufficiently

near the epoch of mean lihration for the coordinates of each object as seen

near the terminator to be measured, that it maj- at once be transferred to

its proper place on the Map (opportunities for obtaining such a photograph

will not occur until 186S),the mode that presents itself for dealing with the

more minute details is to measure on another photograph such details from

the nearest point of (he first order, having identified as nearly as possible the
ON MAPPING THE SURFACE 01' THE MOOX.  217

corresponding prominent featiu-es in the two photographs. As before re-
marked, the photograph of October 4, 1865, is that of full moon ; the one
employed for the smaller and more striking detail is that taken by AVarren

De La Eue, Esq., on February 22, 1858, enlarged on glass to 8-75 inches in
diameter. On neither of the six ai'cas above mentioned does a point of tho

first order occur, and the nearest to areas IV A*, lY A^ is the central moun-

tain of Albatcgnius in IV A-^. From the veiy nature of the apparent changes

effected in the visible disk by libration, it is clear that such measures as those
just alluded to cannot possess much claim to accuracy when referred to the
mean projection, except ivhen made in the immediate neighhourlwod of a point
of the first order, or near a point that has been well identified ; all other
positions can only be considered as approximate ; indeed, when the lines
measured approach the tenth part of the moon's scmidiameter in length they
are quite useless; still, with a proper amoimt of care the approximation

capable of being attained may be sufficiently close for all the purposes of a

map, especially if all well-detcrmiucd positions be distinctly indicated. The

reader may easily convince himself of the difiiculty of combining portions of
photographs taken at differing intervals from the epoch of mean libration by

simply making enlarged tracings of such portions and supervising the one on
the other ; he will soon see they will not fit ; added to this is the effect
produced by variation of distance ; two photographs taken at mean libration
will not quite agree, the features of that taken at perigee will manifestly be
larger than if it were taken at apogee.

    Notwithstanding these difliculties, numerous objects have been inserted on

AAreas IV A«, IV A.^, IV ^, and IV An from the photograph of February 22,

1858, and other sources, and a drawing made of the area IVxi^. This has

=been enlarged to a scale of 400 inches moon's diameter*. Each object, as

it is inserted in the map and drawing, is entered in Form No. 3. (See Eeport,
1865, p. 296.) Appendix III. contains a catalogue of these objects. The num-

--bers in each of the above-named areas are as follows: IV A", 88, IV A/^, 21,

IVA^, IMjIVAi, 25.

   There are a few points of interest which attach to the features thus in-
serted. It is well known that Tycho is the centre of the most magnificent
system of rays or lucid bands on the moon's surface, and that this system is
seen to the greatest advantage at the time of full moon ; accordingly, the
photograph of October 4, 1865, furnishes the best means for depicting under
that aspect, the rays emanating from Tycho. Three of these rays cross the

areas above-mentioned; the two eastern rays cross the areas IV A«, IV A?,
and the west ray crosses the areas IV A/^, IV A''. These rays Avill be referred

to in Appendix III., which contains an abbreviated catalogue of the objects

alread}- mapped and inserted in the drawings ; nevertheless it may be proper

to mention here that all three are coincident with ranges of high land, as seen

in the photograph of Febniary 22, 1858, which in some places are much
broken, and in others rise into rocky eminences. The middle of these rays

passes along the east border of Albatcgnius, and the western along the west
border. The west border of Ptolempeus forms part of the eastern ray.

   Another feature bearing remotely on the above-nam.ed areas is the exist-
ence of two " raj-- centres" in the neighbourhood of Fvirncrius. These ray-
centres are depicted bj^ Hevelius in his Sclenographia, figs. and P, similar
as Beer and Mitdler remark to two pairs of crab-claws, the rays going north-

                                           * It was exhibited at the Meeting.

ward. It appears from ' Der Mond/ p. 375, that Boer and Miidlcr not only

Asaw one of the northern branches extending from Furnerius about fifty-five

English miles, but also traced a southern and hrvjhtcr branch from this crater
extending as far as ninety English miles. They appear to be silent as to

any radiating streaks. Beer and Miidler also speak of one near Stevinus. I
have not yet been able to identify Beer and Miidler's positions. These " ray-
centres " are quite perceptible on the photograph, and the rays can be well
traced as far as the neighbourhood of Godin and jigrippa. The rays from

the easternmost centre bend round, and form branches of parabolic curves.

In areas III A^, IV A^, and IN Ayi, there is a considerable parallelism be-

tvreen several of the mountain-ranges and valleys, and these are seen on the

photographs, taken when Copernicus is near the terminator, gradually to fall
into the curves formed by the rays from the east centre. The valleys and
mountain-ranges are particvilarly specified in Appendix III.

   The occurrence of" light-centres," hitherto, I believe, unnoticed*, is another
feature of much interest. There are in the mountainous district before men-

tioned, between the Sinus Mcdil -AnAMare TranquiJlitaiis, four such centres.
They appear to be subordinate to ray-centres, are generally in immediate
connexion with craters, the interiors of which are very bright, and the light
spreads more or less regularly on all sides of them, as if the surface around
them consisted of strongly reflective materials. The north border of the

crater and light- centre IV A'' ·^, which is very deep, is cracl-ed, and the crack

appears to penetrate the depth of the crater. This crack forms the south
part of the rill Xo. 362 of Schmidt's Catalogue, and is connected with a
"fault" which extends as far as and dislocates the west border of Rha^ticus
in the neighbourhood of the equator. If the crack, rill, and fault ori-

ginated at an epoch when IV A'' ^ was in a state of activity, the con-

vulsion of the interior must have been considerable, IV A'' " being about 7°

south of the equator, although nothing in comparison with that which
produced the bands issuing from Tycho and the two ray-centres in the south-

west.

   * During the passage of these sheets tlirongli the press, the Kev. T. AY. Wobb called
my attention to Beer and Miidler's remarks on the crater "Euclides," as showing that it
belongs to the class of " light-centres." Mr. Webb has kindly favoured lue with a trans-
lation, and Beer and Miidler's observations arc so much to the point that I gladly insert

them. For the original consult ' Der Mond,' p. 313.
    " Euclides especially distinguishes itself among the liyId-surrounded (which are by no

means to be confounded with the radiating) craters. It is encompassed by a very bright
lumuious area, rather triangular than circular, brightest at its foot, but losmg itself in-
definitely on eveiy side. It may be perceived as far as Iv and £, aud consequently about
6 miles (27'6 miles English) away to the north. The whole lucid spot is quite flat and
hes in tlio level of the Mare, witli the exception of some vei-y inconspicuous hills that are
 of no importance iii comparison with the wall of Euclides.

    " This altogether peculiar icliitish nimbus sliows itself only near a few craters of the
moon's surface, of which not one has more than li mile (about 7 miles EngUsh) in dia-

Tmeter, and they almost aU lie between 30' and 46° of longitude, and between the

equator and 15° of latitude. The radiating ring mountains are coUectively much larger,
 do not show their gi-eatest brightness immediately at the foot, and extend this brightness

 in long streaks. Craters with a brighter neighbourliood, which generally arises from sur-

rounding terraces, show themselves in abundance, but we may soon convince otu-selves by
mere inspection that this has nothing in common with the here mentioned appearance.
 The craters belonging to this class are collectively very deep, strictly circular, never less

 than 1° bright, little differing in respective magnitude, and extremely obvious under every
 iUummation. The luminosity near Mosting c is quite of another natui-e, and that near
 Lichtenberg does not show itself on every side, is fainter, and light-red rather than

 whitish."

   In the Eeport presented at Bii-mingham, allusion A^as made to the measure-
ment of the diameters of craters for the determination of magnitude. It is
worthy of remark that measures have been taken of some of the larger craters

inserted in areas IVA/^ and IV A*?, and upon comparison these measures have

been found to agree nearly with those taken from the photograph.

During the past year Herr Schmidt, of Athens, has issued a catalogue of

425 rills ; 278 of these have been discovered by himself. They consist of

rills, crater-rills, crater-rows, and valleys with some faults.                                                                                                         In the cata-

logiie of objects on area IV A^, which forms part of Appendix III., are ei"ht

not to be found in his printed catalogue. Four of these have been disco-
vered since July 20, 1866. The great fault crossing the area from Tycho is
not included.

   The number of series of observations of the moon's surface as described in
the last Eeport (Report, 1865, p. 303), now amount to 490. The progress of
the actual work as regards the registration of the objects observed, and others

of a conspicuous character on the moon's surface during the past year, is
shown in the following digest.

At the Bath Meeting 386 objects were symbolized and                                                                                                                     registered                                             at  the

Birmingham Meeting 785 ; and at the jN'ottingham Meeting 1321 ; of these

536 were symbolized and registered in the fifty weeks betM-cen the Meetings

the walled formation Posidonius, and the Mare Crisium, especially the craters

on its surface. (See Ptcport, 1865, pp. 292, 293.) On Quadrant II. the

Teneriffe Mountains, Plato, and its neighbourhood, and the valley J. J.

Cassini. On Quadrant III. the walled plain Gassendi, and the tableland

" Terra Photographica " (De La Rue).

   The extension of the Register by the addition of 536 objects during the

past year, has reference, first, to the symbolization of points of the first

--order. Beer and Miidlcr have expi-essed these points in their Hst which I
--have of course followed too vaguely, and it requires some searching in the

topographical part of ' Dor Mond ' to find the exact object intended. By
appending the symbol, as I have done in Appendix I., when the Register is

sufficiently advanced for publication in a consecutive from, the identification

of each point will be easy. Second, the mapping out of the areas IVA",

IVA/5, IVAT',_IVA^, IVA'', and IVA^, has necessarily involved the symboliza-
tion of the objects on this part of the moon, so that to the above-named regions

that of Hipparchus and its neighboui-hood may now be added.

   * The reader -will find a description and symbolization of these areas in the Eeport of
the Lunar Committee presented at Birmingham. (Eeport, 1865, p. 287 et seq.)

 pole and 108° east longitude, and Gioja a within 2° of the pole and 7° east

 longitude ; the last comes within the orthographical projection mean libra-
 tion, the others are not visible in mean libration. The drawing of these and
neighbouring points (without the parallel and decUnatiou- circles) forms
Table I. of Beer and Miidler's ' Beitriige zur physischen Kenntniss der himm-
lischen Kor2)er im Sonnensysteme.' The observations and results are recorded
on pp. 6G and 67. The best time for comparing the drawing with the moon is
when she has high south latitude.

    LiBRATiox nr lATirrDE arises principally from the northern and southern
parts of the lunar globe coming alternately into view in consequence of the
inclination of the plane of the moon's orbit to that of the ecliptic.

    LiBKATioN IN lONGiTTJDE aiiscs from thc same hemisphere of the moon

being constantly directed, not towards the earth, but towards the other focus

of the elliptic orbit of the moon, in conseq.uence of which, while the moon
describes the perigean portion of her orbit, the first meridian, from which

all seleuographical longitudes are reckoned, is gradually transferred from
west to east. The same meridian is transferred from east to west during the

period that the moon describes the apogean part of her orbit. The same

hemisphere being directed always towards the other focus of the elliptic orbit,

is the result of the uniformity of the rotation of the moon on her axis.
    Geocentric latitude and longitude of the moon's centre is the latitude

and longitude of the moon's centre as seen from the earth's centre reckoned
from and on the ecliptic.

    Selenocenteic latitudes and longitudes are latitudes and longitudes of
points on the moon's surface as seen from the centre of the moon. Lati-
tudes are reckoned from the moon's equator, and longitudes are reckoned
071 the moon's equator from the point at which the moon's equator intersects
the ecliptic. This point, which is the ascending node of the moon's equator,
is rigorously identical with the descending node of thc moon's orbit.

   Belenogeaphical latitudes and longitudes are the latitudes and longi-
tudes of points of the moon's surface reckoned as on the earth's surface
from the equator of the moon and the fii-st meridian. See fig. 6, p. 228.

                                                  General Principles.

 --1. The great importance of augmenting the number of points of the first

order for the purpose of mapping the surface of the moon on a large scale,
and more especially for drawing up monograms of special portions on a still
                                                                         --

larger scale, in each of which, there should be a point of the first order

being apparent, this Appendix contains a form of computation based on

Encke's method, and modified from Lohrmann's and Beer and Miidler's

works, and as libration enters as a necessaiy element into the calculation, it
is preceded by an investigation of libration in latitude and longitude. For

the MS. from which the greatest part of this investigation is taken I am in-

debted to A. C. Eanyard, Esq., of Cambridge. I must, however, remark that

the formulae are derived from the ' Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch fiir 1843.'
   2. The investigation of libration consists of three parts, viz., that of the

angle C, or the angle which the meridian passing through the middle of the
moon's apparent disk makes with the circle of declination ; that of libration
in latitude and that of libration in longitude. The meridian passing through

the middle of the apparent disk should be carefully distinguished from the

fii'st meridian on the moon's surface, from which all selenographical longi-

tudes are reckoned both east and west.

3. It wiU greatly assist in the conception of libration if the following

principles be borne in mind.

Three planes being supposed to pass through the moon's centre, viz. the

plane of the moon's equator, the plane

of her orbit, and a plane parallel to the              Fig. 1.

plane of the ecliptic, the last will lie               moot's Orbif
between the others, and will intersect

them in the line in which they in-

tersect each other.

In consequence of this law the

longitude of the ascending node of the                 ^foon's jSquator
moon's equator on the ecliptic always

diflfers by 180° from the longitude of

the ascending node of the orbit. The inclination of the moon's equator to

the ecliptic is 1° 32' 9", the inclinatioji of the plane of the orbit is about 5° 9'.

   This last quantity is obtained by adding 180° to the longitude of the

ascending node of the orbit given in p. 242 of the ' Nautical Almanac' If

the sum exceed a whole circumference, 300° must be subtracted.

of i being due to the motion of the moon's nodes. It does not change sign

with the changes of sign of I' and V . It is positive when the northern part

of the circle of declination is to the west of the moon's meridian.

   These formulae are employed in the following computations for determin-
ing the angle C and points of the first order.

Investigation of Libration,

12. In mapping the surface of the moon the orthographical projection ia

iised in which the centre is charactemed by 0° of latitude and 0° of longi-

tude. This point, of course, is that in which the moon's equator and first

Wemeridian intersect each other.  have consequently to deal with two points,

a- or the centre of the apparent disk, which is the only point recognized in

the computations of libration, and the point of intersection of the first meri-

dian and the equator. These points coincide only when the line joining the
centres of the earth and moon passes through the centre of the apparent disk

in mean libration, which occurs in periods of 2-997 years.

   13. At any other epoch than that of mean libration the point <r is removed
more or less from the point of intersection of the equator and first meridian,

consequently as tr is the only point of the moon's surface turned towards the

earth to which the comiratations of libration refer, libration in latitude =: the

selenogi-aphical latitude of the apparent centre, and libration in longitude

the selenographical longitude of the same point.

   14. When the moon passes the ascending node as seen from the centre of

the earth, the moon's equator appears as a straight line on the apparent disk,

and may be thus represented on the orthographical projection. Libration in
latitude then=0°. As the moon passes from the ascending node to the
greatest north latitude, the southern parts of the moon come into view, aiid

the equator is projected on the apparent disk as the lower segment of a

narrow ellipse, as given in an inverting telescope. All the appearances de-

scribed in this Appendix are inverted, lower for upper, &c. The east limb or
margin of the moon is seen in the telescope opposite to the right hand. The

= +greatest libration in latitude the moon's latitude the inclination of the

moon's equator to the ecliptic a b, fig. 1, p. 223. Were the moon a transparent
globe and the equator marked on it, the equator would be seen as a long,

narrow ellipse, widening and closing up between the passages of the nodes, so

=that at the passage of the descending node the libration is again 0°.

                                  Kg. 4.

   The same phenomena take place as the moon describes the portion of

her orbit south of the plane of the ecliptic, but in the opposite sense, the

northern parts coming into view. From this it will be seen that libration in

latitude changes its sign every lunation at the passages of the nodes.

pcentre of the apparent disk, and the point the abscissa on the moon's
equator, to which it is referred, so pthat a- is equal to the perpendicular

dropped from the centre of the apparent disk upon the moon's equator. This

angle is equal to the distance of the moon's apparent centre from the

moon's pole, minus 90°, and is consequently equal to 0° when the moon is

in either node.

    18. Libration in longitude, or the selenographical longitude of the appa-
rent centre of the disk, is equal to the angle formed at the moon's pole
between the first meridian, or that from which all selenographical longi-
tudes are reckoned, and the circle of latitude (Moon's pole a-p'Lin fig. 6)
passing through the apparent centre of the disk. This angle is equal to the

                                                                  Fig. 6.

 selenocentric longitude of the apparent centre of the disk, reckoned on the
 moon's equator from the ascending node of the moon's equator on the
 ecliptic (which is equal to the longitude of the ascending node of the orbit

 + 180°), minus the distance of the first meridian from the same point (see

 fig. 6), where ?S (K^ fig. 2, p. 223) represents the ascending node of the

 moon's equator on the ecliptic, L the selenocentric longitude of the apparent

 centre «r, and L' the distance of the first meridian from ?g , or its seleno-
 centric longitude. The distance of the first meridian from the ascending node
 of the moon's equator on the ecliptic is, from the uniformity of the moon's
 rotation, at all times equal to the moon's mean longitude, minus the longi-
 tude of the ascending node of the orbit, or plus the supplement of the longi-

 tude of the ascending node. Libration in longitude vanishes when the moon
 is in the Kne of the apsides.

The distortion on the orthographical projection arises from the greater

foreshortening of objects near the limb, as seen from the earth, than the

true orthographical projection will represent.

20. During the passage of the moon from perigee, at which point her

motion is quickest, to apogee, where it is slowest, the motion in her orbit

is shiver from day to day, while her motion in rotation continues uniform

the consequence is, that while passing from perigee to mean distance the

first meridian is transferred eastwardly (see fig. 7), which is inverted, where

Wbeing its intersection with the first meridian,

 is projected as a curve east of the centre of the apparent disk. At the point
 of mean distance the two motions coincide in value, but only momentarily
 so, the greatest libration towards the east is attained, the orbital motion
becomes slower than the axial, and the first meridian returns westwardly,
attaining its mean position at the passage of the apogee. In consequence of
the small difference of the period of the revolution of the apsides and half

that of the nodes, the equator will not appear as a straight line across the

apparent disk, when the first meridian returns to its mean position, and

therefore the point of 0° latitude will not be found at the centre of the appa-
rent disk ; the divergence will be greater at the end of every period either of
the passage of the nodes or apsides, increasing for a period of about eighteen
months, after which the divergence will decrease during another period of

eighteen months, and at the end of three years (nearly) the state of mean
libration wiU be again attained.

    Libration in longitude from apogee to perigee is the opposite to that above
described, from which it foUows that libration in longitude changes sign

every lunation.

   21. The mathematical portion of this investigation may be treated under

two heads, viz., the method adopted in the ' Nautical Almanac,' and that
adopted by Lohrmann. Eor the method adopted in the ' Nautical Almanac '

the following computations of points of the First Order.

   The principal part of the libration in longitude is l--\ (see section 9),

which, besides changing sign in each lunation with respect to east and west,
changes sign also with respect to north and south by the motion of the moon's

apsides.

  Application of the foregoing investigations to the motion on the apparent disk
             of the point at ivhieh the Equator i^ifersects the First Meridian.

   23. It now remains to inquire how the point of intersection of the moon's

equator and first meridian will be affected by the changes in latitude and
longitude which the centre of the apparent disk is perpetually undergoing ;
for as only the latitude and longitude of this single point are determined by
the formulae for computing the Hbrations, we do not appear to have at pre-
sent the means for tracing out on the moon's disk the curves representing

the moon's equator and first meridian for any other epochs than that of mean
libration, when, as before mentioned, they cross the disk in two straight lines
intersecting at the centre ; and this inquiry is perhaps the more important as
showing how necessary it is, for accurately mapping the surface, to have good

determuiations of points of the first order. Taldng, therefore, the spot on
the moon's surface at which the equator and first meridian intersect each

other, we may inquire the path it will describe on the apparent disk during

the changes of libration through one revolution of the nodes.

displacement of o being in the line o o', the libration of the centre of the appa-
W Nrent disk /T will be
in longitude and in latitude. It is easy to see that

the path of the point of intersection of the equator and first meridian, a short

time before and after the epoch of mean libration, wiU be in a very narrow

ellipse, the line o' o" being the major axis, which does not, however, retain its

position on the apparent disk, but revolves around the central point.

25. This eUipse opens out and undergoes changes of form proportional to the

interval elapsing from the epoch of mean libration until the epoch when the

greatest excursion of libration in longitude towards the east (of the point of

intersection of the equator and the first meridian) coincides with the passage

of the ascending node when the equator is represented as a straight line

cEmacross the apparent disk and the first meridian by the curve  in fig. 10^

                        Fig. 10.

where the libration of the centre of the apparent disk is nothing in latitude,

but west in longitude. When the first meridian returns to its normal posi-

Ntion, the eqiiator is represented by the curve E" q (fig. 10), and the point of

intersection is situated at o" (nearly) ; the libration of the centre in this case

is nothing in longitude but south in latitude.

26. At this epoch, intermediate between two of mean libration, the path

of the point of intersection of the equator and first meridian may be re-

presented by the four diagonals, of which o' o" (fig. 10) is one, or, perhaps more

correctly, by a wavy ellipse ; for as the values of the two librations diiFer in
W NEamount, the circle
                        S is not a true representation of the excursions of

NEthe intersecting point and W, and S ; so when the greatest deviation

from mean libration occurs, the real path of the intersecting point on the
apparent disk is a wide ellipse, which gradually contracts to a narrow ellipse
as the epoch of mean libration is approached. This will be the case propor-
tionally with every point on the apparent disk, and the displacement will be
in every possible direction and at every conceivable angle with the centre of
the apparent disk. This suggests that by far the most effective mode of de-
termining positions on the moon's surface is by measures for points of the
first order ; for let x' y' represent the measures in right ascension and decli-
nation from the east and north limbs of the point E, x and y wiU be the

corresponding rectangular coordinates necessary to determine the selenogra-

phical position when the librations of the centre and the other elements are

ascertained.

                                                         Measures.

   In order to compute the selenographical coordinates of a point on the moon's
surface (its latitude and longitude), the following measures are necessary :

   Between five and ten measures of the distance of the point from the illu-
minated north or south limbs ; also from the Uluminated east or west limbs as

the case may be.
   The moon's diameter in the direction of the line drawn through both cusps,

which may be assumed perpendicular to the ecliptic as the moon seen from

the sun, departs at the utmost only 50" from the plane of the ecliptic.
    These measures require to be corrected for refraction according to the fol-

lowing formulae.
   The measured diameter in micrometer revolutions, which call D, is to be

multiplied by the factor ( l-|-^^^-^iii in which w'= the angle which the
                                                                                                                        J,

line of the cusps makes with the vertical circle passing through the moon,

dr= the difference of refraction in seconds for 10' in the altitude of the moon
(within the narrow space of the moon's disk the difference of refraction may be
assumed proportional to the difference of altitude) ; dr may be taken from the

' Connaissance des Temps.'

   The formulae for correcting the measured distances (also in micrometer

revolutions) of the point from the moon's limbs are as follows :

    In the declination circle,

                                           AA . dr . cos n

   Having obtained these measures and corrected them, the following elements
for the time of observation should be taken from the ' Nautical Almanac'

   Having determined the selenographical latitude and longitude of the appa-
rent centre of the moon's disk, and also the angle which the meridian of the

middle of the disk makes with the circle of dechnation, we may ascertain the

latitude and longitude of the measured point by the aid of the arc yu (fig. 12)
on the spherical surface of the moon, which connects the measured point with
the apparent centre M.

     British Association Outline* Map of the Moon, Zones II and IV,

                                   Areas IV A" and IV A^.

   The present portions of the map include areas IV A*, IV A^ and parts of

IV A^^ and IV A'' ; they are in outline on a scale 200 inches, equal to the
moon's diameter. On these portions upwards of 200 objects are distinctly

specified, and, as indicated below, their relative degrees of visibility pointed

out. The scale of 200 inches to the moon's diameter appears to be the
smallest that can be used with advantage in the present state of selenography.
It allows every facility for inserting synonyms as well as various numerical
data, also for exhibiting with clearness the relative position of each object.
In some few instances objects, the precise nature of which is doubtful, are
inserted without a numerical reference, and some mentioned in the catalogue
are omitted, as their outhnes require careful determination. In the spaces
more or less blank there are small objects which await insertion when they
have been observed with adequate power, and their relative positions ascer-
tained. Without doubt much of the outline requires modrftcation, as it is

difficult to catch in the small intervals afforded for observation that correct-

ness in fonn and outline which is desirable, and instances of fine definition
in which it might be attained are rare, and occur at varying states of libra-
tion, and at different degrees of illuminating and visual angle : while, how-

ever, much may be achieved by the aid of photography, yet the evident relief

indicating heights and depths, and the diversity of light, shade, and shadow
interfere to no little extent in fomitng a judgment of the true outline, espe-
cially as no two photographs are Hkely to exhibit the same object under similar
circumstances ; still it is hoped the following catalogue of objects on areas

IV A" and IV A^, and the map will be mutually intelligible, and contribute to

a closer study of the moon's surface, if it be only to detect the errors in either.
    These portions of the map, as well as the accompanying catalogue, contain

all the known objects, 202 on an area of 50 superficial degrees, as shown
in existing photographs, and ascertained by personal observation. They are

issued with the twofold view of assisting observers in becoming acquainted
with the physical aspect, and also for enlarging the boundary of our know-

ledge of the moon's surfiice. They are printed red that observers may the

more readily insert additions and corrections in hlach.
   The basis of the map, as AveU as the principle upon which it is constructed,

is fully explained in the Report presented to the British Association at its

Meeting held in Nottingham, 1866 ; it may, however, be important to men-
tion that all positions, except those of the first order, are derived from Mr.
De la Rue's photograph of October 4, 1865, which was taken so near the
time of Mean Libration, that the coincidence of the Equator of the photo-
graph with that of the moon is sufficiently close to allow of direct mea-

   * This map is not intended to be a perfect or complete Lunar IVfap, but only a guide

to observers in obtaining data for the construction of a complete map.

sures of every object on the photograph. In the case of the first meridian,
a small correction has been applied. The points of the first order, which
are most scrupulously regarded, are found in Appendix I. of the above-

named Keport. In laying down those in quadrant IV., the greatest error
discovered in checking them amounted only to -0008, the moon's semi-

diameter being equal to unity.

   The following abbreviations are employed on the Map.

 --The Arabic numerals, except in cases of measiu-ement, refer to the area of

twenty -five superficial degrees indicated and in quoting to be preceded

by the symbol of the area (see Brit. Assoc. Report, 1865, p. 288).
   The small Greek letters refer to the same objects indicated by them on

Beer and Madler's Map of 37 inches diameter. The Roman capitals and

&small letters preceded by B. M. are of similar import.

    Dotted lines in some instances indicate the bases of mountains, the crests
being shown by continuous lines, also the lowest parts of valleys ; in others
the interior feet of crater slopes as in HaUey, where the dotted line points
out the base of the interior E. slope, in others lucid markings or streaks
which require further observation.

   Some attempt has been made to indicate differences of level by inscribing
on the map the words " high level," " higher level," " lower level," and " low
level ;" thus the level S. of HaUey is very much higher than that of the floor
of Hipparchus N. of HaUey, and that of Albategnius marked "low level" is
the lowest ; the words higher and lower being comparative bettveen high and
low. This difference of level is brought out in a very marked manner by an

oblique illumination.

   The space between every 5° of latitude north and south constitutes a

zone numbered from I. to XXXVI. (see Report, 1865, pp. 288-290).
For the employment of the map, each zone may be divided into five sub-

zones of 1° ; and if to every observer tivo were allotted, so that half of the

area selected by each were to overlap half of the adjoining areas of two sub-
zones, observations, additions, and corrections will be received from two in-
dependent observers. As it is very probable that in some instances ob-

servers may have but little previous acquaintance either with the aspect of

the moon's surface as regards " detail " or with methods of observation,
the following instructions for observing the objects, also for correcting and

adding to the map and catalogue, are drawn up upon this probability. The

localities of IV A« and IV A? may be easily ascertained by reference to exist-

ing maps, the large formations, Hipparchus, Albategnius, and Ptolemsus,
being sufficiently indicated.

    The plate contains a portion from Beer and Madler's map corresponding to

areas IV A« and IV A^. The smaU circle above on the same scale represents

one degree at the centre of the disk in mean libration. The large circle be-
low represents a similar area on the scale of 200 inches to the diameter, that

of the British Association Outline Map. It contains 279-27 square miles

    It jf ojily at the centre of the disk that one degree is seen under an ano-lc

    The very high probability, if not certainty, that the crater " Linne " has

undergone a physical change since it was first figured by Riccioli in 1653,

induces the belief that if lunar objects were observed upon a regular system

from time to time, other instances of {)iferre<l physical change may be detected,

especially among the smaller features. With this view, the objects in each

area of two subzones, arranged in the order of their visibility, as far as ascer-

tained, are specified, that observers may have as little trouble as possible in

selecting objects for observation.

   The folloflning numbers refer to the accompanying catalogue. Those
marked vrith two asterisks (**) are conspicuous, those with one (*) are easy,
those with a dagger are difficult (f), and those with a double dagger (J) are
very difficult, and but rarely seen. Nearly the whole of the objects recorded

In this manner every object may be sought for, and either identified, or if

it be beyond the power of the telescope to show it, recorded as such, and so

far as the pair of subzones extends, the capability of the telescope to reach

--only certain objects determined. These may be arranged for the ielescope

employed in classes of conspicuous, easy, difficult, veiy difficult, and invi-

sible; and in thus becoming fully acquainted with the objects in the paii" of

subzones he has selected, tlie observer will find that he has employed his

time to great advantage                                                                                                    indeed he will be surprised that, by regularly exa-
                                                                                                                        ;

mining his portion to identify the objects already on record, he has become

thoroughly acquainted with all the prominent features of the region.

In work of this kind the observer will find it very advantageous to exa-

mine his subzones under similar conditions of illumination, which recur

roughly in periods of fifty-nine days, but more acciu'atcly in fifty-nine days

eighty-eight minutes; and these periods -uill afford an interval of about eight

months, during which, in eveiy alternate month, should the sky be clear, he

will see the objects similarly illuminated (very nearly). The numbers in the

sixth column, headed " days elapsed of the Julian Period," on p. xx of each
month in the Nautical Almanac, wUl facilitate the computation of these

periods. Thus, if on January 13, 1867, at 6 p.m., he notices the Terminator

or Light boundary to pass over any particular spot, 5Q'^ V" 30TM afterwards

the Terminator wiU very nearly be on the same spot. Now the day elapsed

of the Julian Period (written short D. J. P.) on

    Upon referring to the column for March it will be found that on the 13th,
at 7'' 30" P.M., the same phase will recur ; and in a similar manner it may

readily be found that on May 11th, 9'' 0", July 9th, 10'^ 30", and September 6th,

12'' 0", the Terminator -will be nearly in the same part of the disk, so that on

those evenings the observer can resume his examination or other kind of

--observations under nearly similar cii'cumstances.
    Corrections. ^When he has become familiar with his ground, the ob-

server may proceed to examine the map and catalogue critically. For ex-
ample, he may carefully ascertain if the relative position of the objects on
the portion of the map furnished him be correct, and whether the alignments

generally agree ; for this purpose, a pair of cross wires in the field of the eye-

piece, by which he can readily determine objects in tlie same line, wiU be

found useful. It is important to notice particularly the outlines of objects,
as should he be satisfied after observing them under differing circiunstances
of light and libration * that correction is needed, such correction should be

--made on the map either in ink or a different colour from that of the map.
   New Objects. As the Terminator passes over the portions of the sub-

    * Libration, in a popular sense, signifies the displacement of an object as regards its

mean position on the moon's surface, in which it can be observed only once in three years.

When the moon has north latitude, all objects appear north of their mean places, and
when she has south latitude south of them. When the moon is passing from Apogee

to Perigee they are west, and when she is passing from Perigee to Apogee they arc east
of their mean positions.

   Measurements. The most important are for determining points of the
first order, and consist of mcasiires taken with the micrometer between the
apparent east or west and north or south limbs of the moon and the object;
the subject is fully treated with an example of the computation in Ap-
pendix il. Report, 1866. The mountain IV A? 29^ ^nd the craters IV A?'',

IV A^ ^, and IV A? ^^, appear to be very suitable as points of the first order.
   Measures may also be taken for magnitude : see Report, 1 865, p. 295.

The following measures of Halley in a dii'ection perpendicular to the paral-
lel, the object being made to run between the wii-es, may serve as an

example :

   The magnitude is determined by dividing the measure of the object by

=that of the standard, thus: Halley =-2982, and Dionysius *2317, therefore

                                        2982
the magnitude of Ilalley=------ =1-287.

   In reading the micrometer head, the value of the fixed wire from which
the positive readings are made, is reckoned equal to ten revolutions, there-

+fore the negative readings are equal to nine revolutions the readings of the

micrometer head, and as the diftereuce between the two readings will equal
twice the measure of the object, it follows that the mean of the positive

--the mean of the negative readings divided by 2, will equal the measure of

the object.

   For the reception of the observations above specified copies of Form
No. 1 (Report, 1865, p. 287) will be supplied, and when corrections and
additions have become sufficiently numerous, duplicate copies of the map
wiU be furnished.

  --Each observation should be accompanied by references to the following

data : Greenwich mean time ; day elapsed of the Julian Period (D. J. P.)
the moon's latitiido to the nearest minute, and the moon's nearest distance
from Apogee to Perigee with the sign-- before or -|- after. At the time of
the observations given on p. 242, the moon had passed Apogee 92 hours and
wanted 201 hours of Perigee. Objects were therefore west of their mean

positions.

    It is desirable that returns should be made at specified intervals not ex-

ceeding six lunations.

                                                     Catalogue.

   In the following Catalogue every feature seen on the photographs (as well
as some of the more minute detail discoverable by the telescope) is described.
The descriptions include all the points of interest that have presented
themselves in the examination of this part of the moon's surface, either by
the aid of photographs or by means of personal observation ; and some at-
tempt has been made to assist in obtaining a more correct representation of
the moon's surface, by giving the measures in seconds of arc of the objects
catalogued, and in the case of craters the deduced apparent magnitudes, the
crater Dionysius being considered as the standard. These measures and de-
duced magnitudes can only be regarded as roughly aj^prosimate, the epochs

being mean distance and mean libration ; they cannot consequently be ex-
pected to coincide with any actual measures ; for as the epoch of mean libra-
tion cannot be coincident with that of mean distance, measures made at mean
distance wiU not agree with those made at mean libration. The basis of

--measurement is as follows : the semidiameter of the moon 15' 32"*27, as

given by Oudemans from occultations and direct measurements by the helio-
meter (see Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, vol. xxvi.
p. 260), has been adopted, and as this gives lS64"-54 for the diameter, a
scale has been adapted to the datum 100 inchcs=18G4"-54. Eutherford's
photograph, from which the measurements have been taken, is 20-875 inches
in diameter, and as the measures are readily convertible from 20-875 to
100 inches, thej^ are at once referred to mean distance, irrespective of the
actual position of the moon, either as to distance or libration, and, as before
stated, can only be considered as approximate ; nevertheless it is hoped they
may be of some service both in obtaining a better acquaintance with the moon's
surface, and also contributing to its being more accurately represented.

   The magnitudes /or the epoch of the photograph have been deduced as de-

scribed in my last Eeport (Eeport, 1865, p. 295), but the values are pro-

bably too small, as the measured diameter on the photograph of Dionysius
appears to be excessive, the crater being surrounded by a fringe of light*.
As most of the measures for magnitude have been made in a direction at
right angles to a line joining the north edge of Dionysius and the south edge

of Agrijjpa, the deduced magnitudes may be easily corrected at any futui-e

time by measurements in the same direction.
   It is proper to remark that the positions have been laid down and the

magnitudes in the first instance determined by a scale, radius =50 inches, all

measures being expressed in parts of this scale, radius=umty. For the
expression of aU quantities in seconds of arc the measurements have been
re-made, and directly referred to the scale, 100inches=1864"-54, quite irre-

=spective of the scale 50 inches radius. The magnitudes have been deter-

mined on both scales, and the resulting mean adopted ; some discrepancies,
however, will be found between the mcasiircs in seconds of arc and the
magnitudes, which, as before stated, are the resiilts of two sets of measures,
while the value in seconds of arc depend on one only. The greatest number
of differences in this respect occur amongst those objects that range between
3" and 4", but as they do not materially interfere with the gradations of
magnitude which range between 0'"-00 and 0"-70, it is considered best to

    * This fringe of light appears to vary in size, the differences in above 70 sets of mea-
 sures of the diameter of Dionysius in various directions inchidcd hy an angle of 50"
amounting to about G" or 4" more than can be accounted for by the varying distances of
the moon.
346 REPORT--1866.

give the resiilts of the measures as they stand; especially as the object is to

indicate to sclenographcrs the work to be done, rather than to claim for the
present work anything like perfection ; stOI it is hoped that no little progress
is now being made in selenography.

   Wherever the word " crater " is used in the catalogue, it invariably signi-
fies a pit, cavity, or more or less round depression, in which at sunrise or
sunset a well-marked interior shadow is seen on the side next the sun, the
opposite side reflecting more or less strongly the sun's rays. It is also
retained with the same signification for all those objects designated craters
by previous selenographers.

    It has been suggested to employ the term " cratcrlet" for the round white
glistening objects which are so numerous, particularly in the mountainous
regions of the moon, associating with it the idea of a more recent formation
than the larger objects. These small objects frequently occur in rows, as
mentioned by Schmidt (see Appendix to last Report, 1865, j)p. 305-307), and
called by him crater-rills. It is in rills and crater-rills that Herr Schmidt

is disposed to seek for new formations (see Eeport, 1865, p. 299), and recom-
mends the particular study of them with this view. As it is important to

have some distinguishing feature between ordinary craters (including even
large formations) and craterlets, I would suggest for this purpose size or
magnitude, all pits having a smaller diameter than mag. 0-3 or 5" being re-
garded as " craterlets ;" bright craters exceeding 5" will form a class inter-
mediate between " craterlets" and " light-centres."

    In a few instances objects are mentioned as bright or lucid spots, the exact
nature of which it is difficult to determine. The recent obscuration or pro-
bable filling up of the crater " Linnc " on the Mare Serenitatis, and a lucid
spot having been seen in its place, suggests that such objects should be cai-e-

fully observed, especially when the Terminator is near them. IV A^^'',

ly A^^^, and IV A^ '"^ may be specified as examples.

ever, of an extent sufficient to remove the point 0° of longitude so far to the

west as to require a correction of -020 to all measures on the photograph be-

tween 0'^ and 15° of latitude. On making this correction for the ordinates Y,

taken from the photograph, of Messier, TheophUus, and Dolloud, the south

half of the central meridian exactly coincided. The central mountain of

Albategnius diff'ered from the three ordinates above-mentioned -OlO. There

does not appear to be any error in the mean of Lohrmann's seven measures,

Yor in the computation as given by B. & M. of the ordinate of the central

mountain ; still in this respect the photograph diff'ers from the computed

quantity. The central mountain in Thcophilus lies in nearly the same

Yparallel as that of Albategnius, the computed difi'erence of being '36659,

the measured -37400, which also gives the position of the central mountain

in Albategnius more castwardly than the computed. As the central moiui-

taiii of Albategnius is the only ijoint of the first order south of the equator
between 0° and 15° of south latitude and 0° and 10° west longitude, all posi-
tions in this and the neighbouring areas are measured from it either directly

or indirectly on the photograph (glass) of 1858, February 22 (De La Rue), this
giving the features near the middle of the disk more distinctly than that of the

full moon. It is to be regretted that points of the first order are so few ; the
method of determining points of the second order involving a certain amount
of inaccuracy, very few are found to coincide with the positions as given by

measurements on the photographs. B. & M.'s points of the second order

are indicated thus, x 7, &c. The crater IV A* * and the mountain-peak

IV A^ 2^ on the east of Halley, may form suitable points of the first order for

the areas IV A" and IV A^. There should at least be one point of the first

order in each area.

   In the greater portion of this area three distinct levels may be recognized

under suitable illumination ; that on the south-west consists of the northern

part of Hipparchus. The central level is that surrounding the crater IV A* ^j
it is lower than that of Hipparchus ; the surface of Eeaumur constitutes the

third level ; it is on the east of the area.

   Two great lines of disturbance from Tycho can be traced on this area, of

which the western is the most prominent, and appears as a lucid ray in full
moon. It presents the character of a gently sweUing raised land across the
smoother fioor of Hipparchus in the southern part of the area, and rises into

somewhat lofty cliff's on the western borders of IV A" "^, and Rhaeticus in the
northern. The eastern line of disturbance can be well traced to Tycho

along the western borders of Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus through Arzachel,
having in its interior produced a ridge on which a crater is opened, it is
thence continued along the west border of Thebit and east border of Purbach,

and crosses IV A" ^ and IV A* ^. In areas IV A", IV A^ a portion only of

this line of disturbance apjiears lucid at the time of full moon.

--**1. EniETicus. Lohrmann's map, 234, Sect. I., K. The part south of

equator.

Ehseticus is a well-marked walled depression, apparently of a nearly tri-

angular form, situated on the equator. It is one of the few formations

that can have both the sun and the earth in its zenith. Its walls are per-

fect with the exception of two passes, one at its south angle, the other at its
north-west. The west wall, which is the highest, is nearly straight, and

forms part of the high land which appears in the full moon as the " Ray

from Tycho" passing through the east border of Albategnius. This wall is

dislocated by the fault IV A"? l^, IV A^ 20^ ly A« 72, ^nd it is near the point

of dislocation that the north-west pass is found.

The north and east walls form a somewhat semicircular mountain-range,

but the north being the flattest, tends to impart to the formation a triangular

figure, and this is increased by the more gentle slope of the north interior as
compared with the interior slopes of the east and west walls which arc steeper.
The exterior slopes, although rugged, are much more gentle than the interior.

The north wall is disturbed by the same fault that has dislocated the west,

the effects of which may be seen in the crater Triesnecker.

The level of the floor of this interesting formation is the lowest between

jY^alO and the Sinus Medii. B, & M. mention and delineate a central

mountain in Ehaeticus. Lohrmann also gives it. I observed and sketched
it 1864, April 14, and again 1867, April 1]. On the west and south, and

including the valley IV A" ^^ on the east, Eha^ticiis may be said to be partly

surrounded by a second wall nearly equidistant from its centre, and about the

same distance from the east and west walls as the length of the east and

west diameter of Ehaeticus. The portion of the second wall on the west is

parallel with the west wall of Eha?ticus, and is also the highest.

     --3. HipPARcnrs.- Lohrmann's map, 233. The north-east part.

   This formation, which is very strongly individualized by Lohrmann in his
Section I. {Topoc/rapMc der Sichtharen Mondoherjlache'), and nearly as much

&so by B. M., can hardly be said to possess so distinct a character, for it is

onlj' when the terminator is in its neighbourhood that its real features are
well seen. Indeed, B. ife M. describe it as an assemblage of diverse lunar
forms, rather than a general T^hole, which arc onl}' seen to advantage near
the time of sunrise and sunset ; for at these times, especially at sunrise, the
interior surface, of a dark-grey and furrowed through by long shadows, sepa-

rates itself distinctly from the brighter environs. According to later obser-

vations, it appears to consist of a tract of land between two depressions,

Albategnius, and the low land IV A" ' , which surrounds the crater IV A" ^.
                                                                                                                                                                                               '

Of these depressions Albategnius is the lowest. The surface of Hi2)parchus

is slightly convex, the highest point being near the formation IVA^^^. Its

boimdaries differ vcrj- considerably from the ordinaiy boundaries of walled

plains, so much so that it can scarcely be regai'ded as a formation of this class.
As figured by Lohrmann and B. & M., its S.W. boundary commences near the

bright crater IV A^ ·'^, and is continued in a nearly straight line to the valley

IV A'' *'. This boundary is really that of the mass of high laud in which

Halley, Hind, IV A** ^ and IV A'' ^, are opened, and which appears to be the

highest in this part of the moon; and the boundary is continued as a high

steep range of mountains E.S.E. along the steep crater rill IV A^^'^ on the

north of Albategnius to the junction of the S.W. and west borders of Ptolc-
ma^us and Alphonsus. The west border of Hipparchus coincides with the

"fault" IV A'' ", IVA/5-", IVA« '2 (this fault extends as far as or beyond

Triesnecker). The north boundary differs in a ver^' marked degree from the
S.W., inasmuch as the land on the S.W. rises to a considerable elevation.

while on the N.N.E. it is depressed. The north boundary consists of cliffs
which do not appear to rise much, if at all, above the surface of Hipparchus,

which occasions the evanescent character of Hipparchus, so that in about
forty-eight hours after the terminator has passed it, this boundary is no

longer discernible. It is in the neighbourhood of IV A" ' that the cliffs be-

gin to rise to any extent above the surface of Hijiparchus, and it is here that

the east boundary commences. This boundaiy passes through IVA*'^,

IVA^30^ the mountains IVA^37 and IV A^"', the west slope of IV A^^'^ to

IV A^^"', where the S.W. boundary commences.

   The south angle of Hipparchus is filled with the formation IV A^ -^, which

is shghtly depressed below its level, the land filling the angle between Alba-

tegnius and Ptolemtseus being higher.

             Shown by Lohrmann.

    This crater, although neither large nor bright, is yet sufficiently conspicuous

to form a point of the " First Order." Its position, second order, x 4, as given

&by B. ]yi., is ·0145 west of its position as measured on the photographs.
   This crater is very interestingly situated on the depressed land IV A* "

extending between Ilhaticus, Horrox, and Ecaumur, and is surroimded by
mountains and cliffs disposed in a nearly circular form at an average dis-
tance of 24"-73. These mountains, however, must not be regarded as
b)' any means intimately connected with the crater ; for the ranges of
which they form parts have over a very extensive area a general direction

S.S.W.-Jf.jSr.E. ; but the interesting feature is, that with the exception
of those to the N.E., the summits of the mountains in the neighbour-

hood of IV A* ^ attain their greatest altitudes at or about the distance

Weabove named.  are not without numerous instances of craters being

accompanied by strong evidences of their ha\'ing been centres of considerable

disturbance ; and although but few radiating marks are foimd characterizing

IV A" *, yet they are not entirely wanting, as doubtless large apertures wiU

show ; so that it is not unlikelj' that while the general mountain formations
originated by the operation of a force of a very extensive character, the out-

burst which produced IV A* '^ might within its range of action have modified

the surrounding surface. It is noteworthy that IV A* * and the group IV A* "^
are opened upon a " Eay from Tycho," which is coincident with the high

ranges forming the west borders of Ptolcmocus and Alphousus, and also with
the crater and ridge on Arzachel. It is probable some of the highest peaks'in

the central portion of the southern hemisphere may be found on this ray. Its

Adirection is S.S.E.-N'.N.W., and, as mentioned under IV ^, is to be referred

to a more recent convulsion than that which produced the lines of disturbance
having a general direction S.S.W.-N.N.E.

    This depression, which is a very conspicuous and well-marked object on the

photograph of February 22, 1858, is hardly if at all recognizable on B. & M.'s
map or Lohrmanu's, Sect. I. Its form is sufficiently remarkable to arrest

the attention. The southern part presents the appearance of a crater which

is elongated, and contracted towards the north, from whence a valley IV A" ^^

extends towards Rhaeticus.

The south end of IV A* '" forms a somewhat high cliff, IV A* ^*, as com-

pared with its interior. The valley IV A* ^^ is excavated in this cliff; IV A* '^

is more particularly described imder IV A" ^^^

The west border of Rha3ticus, and also that of IV A* '^, the cliffs passing

cast of Horrox and crossing Hipparchus with the formation IV A^ 2^, and the

mountains continued as far as the crater IV A^ ^ on the east of Albategnius,

together form a line of mthcliffs gently sloping faces towards the west by

south. This line of cliffs comes out in the full moon as a " Ray" directed
towards Tycho. It is weU marked, and more or less continuous, although in
many places it suffers interruptions.

depressed surface ; at other times, except that of sunset, it is scarcely if at
all distinguishable from the surface of Hipparchus.

their origin, for they rather appear to be Jiolhws in the E.S.E. side of the

chain of low mountains or cliffs running towards Hipparchus. Two summits

unlike " craters," as a single glance at Horrox will sufficiently indicate. They

appear to fill the space between two ranges of mountains which diverge from
a point south-east of llhasticus. This space attains its greatest width in the

neighbourhood of the mountain-range IV A" ^^, which nearly crosses IV A* ^^,

This interesting " Fault," which is of considerable extent, takes its rise in

the crater IV A" ^, the north border of which is cracked by it. The fault

has dislocated the S.E. end of the mountain-chain TV A" i^, and produced

the long narrow vaUey IV A" 1 1.      About  the  middle     of  IV A"  1        it  is  inter-
                                                                           1

sected by the faiilt IV A*' ^^, which taking its rise on the east border of Hind,

can be traced nearly as far as Godin. This fault, IV A" ^^, is coincident with
the " Ray from Tycho" which passes through or along the west border of

Albategnius, and also crosses the Mare Sereuitatis. It is on this Ray that

Bessel is situated. Just north of the point of intersection of the two faults

the ground rises, the crater IV A'^ i^ being included in the angle formed by

the intersection.  Ifear  the  point  of  intersection  the  fault  IV A"  1     enters  the

area IV A'^, in which it is designated as IV A'' ^^. On the extreme edges of

the chffs formed by IV A/^ 20^ the smaU craters IVA/^^i and IV A/3 1^ have

been opened. From IV A'^ 1 ^ the fault proceeds directly to the west border

of Rhceticus, having dislocated IV Ai^ ^^, the west portion of IV A"' '^^. The

west and north borders of Rhseticus have suffered very marked dislocations

by this fault. Its effects are 7iot visible on the smooth surface south of

-- --Triesnecker, which as well as the crater Uliert has suffered by it, and

much disturbance occurs in the same line as far as the Apennines.
   An interesting question as to priority of epoch suggests itself in coniiexion

Avith these faults. The neighbourhood of IV A^ ^6 indicates that of the two

the ray from Tycho, on which the fault IV A" ^^ occurs, is nearly parallel with

the one on which IV A^^^ is found, and it may be of nearly the same age.

Is the fault IV A" 23 more recent than the ray from Tycho on which it

             Introduction.

   The greater i)ortion of this area, which possesses much irregularity of

-- --surface, is principally oecupied by four groups of objects, viz., those on the

rocky laud partly surrounding a plain in the angle formed by the N.E.
border of Albategnius and the N.W. border of Ptolemseus; the crater group

in the north angle of Albategnius ; the slightly depressed surface IV A^ 25 ;

and the lower land north of the crater- row from IV A^ ' to Ptolemasus.

These groups occupy nearly twenty superficial degrees, or about 6953 square
miles. The remainder of the area, about 1857 square miles, is occupied with
the much more level surface of the south part of Hipparchus and the region

east of it.

   In the four groups of lunar objects above named there are no large craters

the largest is IV A^', which measures 10"-94, mag. 0-70.  The following

   These two craterlets complete the record of the crater-row from IV A^

to IV A^ ^''. Mr. Knott considers that IV A^ '^ is not a craterlet, but only

a rise in the groimd, which produces a craterlike appearance.

   This crater-row may now be considered as well determined, and with the

dimples IV A^ ''', IV A^ ^, will constitute a crater-rill, according to Schmidt,

although not found in his catalogue. It is noteworthy that it occurs on the
line of cliffs extending from Halley to Ptolemaeus, which is broken by.

IV A^', IV A^^. IV A^^- is common to two lines of cliffs, which cross
each other nearly at right angles. The magnitudes of IVA^'^, IV A^ ,

    Ai20. fuiTOW on the interior slope of the S.E. rim of IV A^^ length

                  10"-94.

    This furrow was discovered on the 6th of December, 1864, by the Rev.

T. W. "Webb, who thus mentions it in a letter under date of the 7th of
December, 1864. Speaking of the row of craters extending from IV A^

to Ptolemy, he says, " There are but four, or at most five craters in their

[B. & M.'s] row of six. I could readily count them but for the great

 agitation of the air ; the S.W. one, which seems to be Albategnius f of
the map, is the largest ; they decrease somewhat towards Ptolemaeus. The
direction S.W. is carried on by a furrow (I presume one of your dimples)
through the wall, and visible on its interior slope to the junction of the

Xtwo subcraters on the S.W. side of (IV A^^)."

   On the 5th of January, 1865, Mr. Freeman at Mentone, the Alpes Mari-

times, examined this locality, but could not find the furrow. Of the crater-

row he says, " The four were too nearly in a direct line with IV A^ ^ to
enable a furrow witliin the ring of 235 (L.) to connect them."

    On February 22, 1866, I obtained at Hartwell, with the equatoreal of
o-9-inches aperture, a view of Mr. Webb's furrow; my observation is thus
recorded : " I saw also distinctly Mr. Webb's furrow on the interior of the

XS.E. border of (IV A^ ^), which is a continuation of the crater-row, in which

 at least there are five craters."

    The existence of this furrow is accordingly confirmed, although it would

                                                                                      s2

seem that its appearance or visibility is rare, being seen, as many other

objects are, only under particular angles of incidence and visual ray. Mr.

Knott examined the locality on the 23rd and 24th of February, 1866. He

does not mention it in his record, but says that '· Mr. Freeman's description

of this region tallies better with my own seeings than that of Mr, Webb."'

  XIt is not unlikely that the S.E. rim of Lohrmann's (IV A'' ^) may possess

such a configuration as sometimes to throw the furrow out of sight. This
might be produced by the interior slope being presented to the eye nearly in

a vertical line. It clearl)- appears that this object may be placed amongst the

most delicate and fugitive of the lunar features.

observation of them, and remarked that B. & M. gave only the east crater.

I, however, find in theii- map, close to the west border of IV A^^, a very
small crater, and if the two be intended by B. & M. for the craters seen by

Mr. Freemau and by me, the position of one, if not both, requires to be more
accurately determined. They are given on tlie map as they align in the

photograph. B. & M.'s craters lie S.E. and N.W. Mr. Freeman and I give

them as seen in the telescope, east and west. 1867, March 15, seen as on map.

        23. The highest (?) point of the west border of Ptolemteus.
    Well shown by Lohrmann both in his map and Section I., but indifferently

by B. k, M. The mountain presents a fine, bold and steep front W.N.W. to

the high land situated in the angle between Albategnius and Ptolemseus,

and extends N.N.E. to about the middle of IV A^^^. Length from the west

"edge of IV A^ ^^ to the promontory opposite IV A^ 13"-79. At its W.N.W.

 foot is a valley, IV A^ '^, somewhat wide at first, but which gradually con-

 tracts towards the N.X.E., and terminates at a point where the rill, IV A^ '^>

 which furrows the slope of IVA^^^, also terminates.

    There are several objects on this plain. See p. 279, IV A^ ''^*, &c.
    **25. The formation between Ilalley IV A'''' and IV A^^.

     This is a very individualized formation on the south part of Hipparchus,

 measuring N.N.W.-S.S.E. from IV A'^^^-IV A^ ^2 j^jji^gi^.e^ 37"-09, and

 W.S.W.-E.N.E. from IV A? -"^-XS A^ ^ inclusive, about 34". Its boundary

 on the S.W. and south consists of a mountainous border, springing from the

 mountain IV A^ ^^ on the east border of Halley, which forms the N.W. part

 of the mountain-chain separating Albategnius from Ptolemteus, and of which

 the mountain IV A^ '-<' is the highest point. The N.W. (IV A^ 27) ^^^1 j^jg.
 boundaries appear to be depressed below the general surface, the N.W. some-
 what in the nature of a riU with two elevations, IV A^^^, IV A^^", on the
  S.E. side ; the N.E. has somewhat the appearance of a crater-row, two cra-

 ters being very apparent, IV A^^" and IV A^'*''; in addition there are two

  mountains, IV A^ ^^ and IV A^ "^^ At the east extremity of this formation
                                                                ;

is the crater IV A^**, which is opened up in the rising and elevated ground,

forming the east boundary. This elevated gToiind fdls the angle between
Albategnius and Ptolemasus, and is marked " higher level."

   The interior surface of IV A^ ^'^ is slightly depressed and irregular. It
is marked "lower level (2)," indicating that it is lower than the surface of
Hipparchus "lower level (1)." On the west portion are two conspicuous

mountains, one, IV A^ ^°, in the angle formed by the S.W. and N.W. boun-

daries, and also in a line with the mountain IV A^ ^^ and the crater IV A^ "
the other, IYA^^\ J^.E. of IVA^^°, and forming with it two elevations

nearly parallel with the depression or broad rill, IV A^^',

The mountain IV A^ ^^ forms the continuation of the east boundary from

IV A^ *'. There are two (apparently) elevations, one nearly between IV A^ ^^
and IVA^32 (IVA^^^), the other between IVA^^l ^^^^ lYA^^.

   There are three conspicuous craters on this formation; one, IV A^^'*,

S.W. of IV A^^ and two N.W. of IV A^^ viz. IVA^^s ^^^ IV A^ ''6, at

          and M. 3543 English feet or 1080 metres ; it has a spur towards
           the N.E. ; length of spur 7"-13.

This mountain is very suitable for a point of the first order. The spur

towards the N'.E. inclines very considerably to the level of the valley IV A^ ^^.
As the sun rises upon it, it is seen as a fine line of light.

   This mountain is longer than shown in the photograph. It is situated on

the line of cliiFs from Tj'cho, and extends nearly as far north as IVA^"-

It is the N.E. spur of Lohrmann's 20, Sec. I. East of and parallel with it is

a crater-rUl containing three adjoining craterlets, IV A^^**, IV A^^', and

This crater, of nearly the same superficial extent as IV A^**^, which adjoins

it on the south-east, differs from IV A^ ^^ in an important particular

IV A^^^ has a narrow border, and appears to be deejjer than IV A^^^, which
is a shallower pit in a broad border, a class of crater of rather common occur-

rence on the moon's surface. The magnitude of IV A^^^, 0-42, includes the

broad border. IV A^ ^^ is remarkable for its apparent priority to the crater-

riU IV A^ '^'^, which cuts completely through it, rendering the north part

brilliantly white, while the smface tint of the south part is dark. It would

appear that the north part of IV A^ "^^ has been raised, the crater-riU IV A^ ''^

occupying the very summit of the waU of Albategnius (see IV A^**^), from

which the south slope is very steep. The crater is shown by Lohrmann.

may probably be connected with the easternmost of the two " Eay-contres"

in the neighboui'hood of Furnerius. This System of liays appears almost to

rival that from Tycho in magnificence, but as it is nearer the Umb than

Tycho, the rays which issue from the centre are not so apparent. There is

also this peculiarity: a ray, which may be regarded as central, passes in a

nearly rectiliueal direction towards the central part of the visible hemisphere,

passing the north of Fracastorius and between Theophilus and CyriUus to
Alfraganus, and is lost apparently in the light ground that surrounds

Alfraganus ; but many of the irregularities of the smface, even as far as the

rocky land bordering the smoother surface on which Triesnecker is opened,
partake of the same direction, /. e. mountains and ridges in the neighbom--
hood of Godin and Agri2)pa are directed towards this ray-centre, and even
the lateral valleys of the Apennines manifest the same general arrangement.

   The rays issuing from the ray-centre above-mentioned towards the north
and south bend so as to form branches of parabolic curves, and it is this
feature which constitutes the peculiarity before alluded to.

   The paraUeUsm of the vaUeys IV A*/ '^ lY A^ ^^, and III A^ 2 appears to
connect them with this system ; for although the general direction of these

valleys is not immediately towards the ray-centre, yet they appear to form
portions of the prolongations of rays that converge to it.

    There is great reason to believe that this formation is an ancient and partly

    This crater-rill forms the N.E. boundary of the group of craters in the

extreme luhitencss, as compared -with the surface in its neighbourhood, the
steepness of its S.S.W. and N.N.E. sides, and particularly its cutting through

the crater IV A^ ^ , testify to the comparative recent epoch of its formation.

                  elevations forming the JST.E. border of IVA^25 ^xaxe

apparently slightly heaved the line of cliffs, and probably produced the rill,

have them to the north, facing steeply the E.N.E. as well as "W.S.W. on the

The earlier discovery of this rill, combined with the brightness and steep-

ness of IV A^^^, which Schmidt did not discover until February 3, 1865,

appears to point to a probable brightening and raising of IV A? "'' within the

twenty-two years, otherwise the oversight of IV A? ^^ by Schmidt in 1843 is

A97. deep hollow of a very irregular form in the high land between

Albategnius and Ptolemseus. It is situated, west to east, between

the north rim of IV A^ ^^ and the high land between the east bor-

der of Albategnius and the S.W. border of Ptolemaeus. Its inte-

rior W. and N.W. slopes, which are very rugged, form the pre-

cipitous descents from the summits of IV A^''^, the S.E. rim of

IV A^ ^2, and the broken portion of IV A^ ^2; the west front of

      IV A? 17^ which does not appear to be so rugged, forms its interior

                         Area IV A". Full-Moon Aspect.

   One of the most interesting features of this area under the full- moon as-
pect is the portion of a " ray from Tycho," which traverses it from N.N.W.

to S.S.E. , and is coincident with the surface west of lihasticus, and also west

of  the  depression  IV  A"    O-  The mountains IV A" "^ the  cliff IV A* 1 *, and the

                             '

south-west extremity of the valley IV A«^^ are crossed by this ray as well as

the west boundary of IV A" '". As the ray passes east of Horrox and crosses
the floor of Hipparchus, it is intersected by a short ray from Horrox towards

E.S.E., which includes the depression IV A" ''.

   The depressed surface IVA*^' around the crater IV A"*, which is a

blight spot at the time of full moon, exhibits a variety of middle tints that
appear to be unconnected with any definite objects, as none are found corre-

sponding with them when IV A" ' ^ is near the terminator.

368 REPORT-- 1866.

Between IV A« 1 ' and the " ray from Tycho " is a dark strip interrupted by

the slope of IV A* ^^. This dark strip passes over the west of Ehscticus and

extends south from Ehreticus to IVA'^'". It is resumed in the depression

IV A" ''^ it crosses IV A" ^^, and part of the valley IV A* ^s, traverses the

western interior of IV A"'", crosses the middle of the valley IV A" ·'^, the

south-west part of the depression IV A" '^, and is continued east of the bright

ray from Tycho into the area IV A^.
   The interior of lieanmur is dark in the full moon. The south-west part

is crossed by a strip somewhat lighter than the general surface ; the west and
north-west mountain border is also somewhat lighter.

From the mountain IV A" ^ on the border of Reaumur the tint character-

izing the mountain border extends as far as the spot IV A* ^', and includes

the mountain IV A* ^8. The crater-row? IV A«^ IVA«22^ and IV A« 23,

with the spot IV A* '", IV A^'^^j appear as a large bright spot, from which a

portion of a line of disturbance from Tycho appears as a ray which extends

to IV A^ '^^ This bright ray is skirted by a dark strip, which is very promi-

nent, in consequence of a light-ray parallel with that which extends from

jY^a7 ^Q lYA^^^. This parallel light-ray appears to take its rise from

IV A"*, and crosses IV A" 21, between IV A«'* and IV A" 2"; it is narrow,

but  from  IV  A''  2          it becomes broader and brighter as it traverses the surface

                            '

mountain-arm IV A^ '*^ in area IV A^,

   This area is crossed from N'.N.W. to S.S.E. at the time of full moon
by a portion of a "ray from Tycho" sensibly parallel with the "fault"

IV A" 2^*, which is just cast of, and thus nearly coincident with, the next

westerly "ray from Tycho." Both rays traverse uneven ground of the
nature of cliffs, having their slopes towards the west. In passing over the

broken ground of IV A^ ^'^ the east ray is much broken, but it recovers its

brightness in traversing the uneven rocky interior of the north-east wall of

AAlbategnius.                  lucid arm from the crater Hallcy traverses the south-west

               26                                   in which IV A^^'' is conspi-

crater IV A^^'', which appears to be the most elevated point of the north-

east border of Albategnius. The crater IV A^*" appears as a bright spot
just east of the "ray from Tycho," while the group of craters IV A^ '^^, IV A.^^^,

IV A^'^*, IV A^'^", IV A^'", IVA^^°, IVA^'52 ^^ ^^^ north-west angle of

Albategnius presents a tint intermediate between the darker portions of the
siirface of this area and the bright rays. East of the " ray from Tycho" pass-

ing over IV A^, both the high land in the angle between Ptolemseus and

Albategnius, and the surface east of the cliff IV A^ ^^ on the floor of Hippar-

chus, present the darkest tint, as well as a strip which, from the west of

IV A^"*", extends to the west border of Ptolcmoeus. The east part of the

mountain-arm IV A^ ^'^ is bright in full moon. Between the dark spaces just
mentioned we have bright spaces intermingled -with middle tints ; a bright

streak not unlike a " ray," extending from IV A^ ^^ (a bright spot), crossing

jY^?48^ where it becomes brighter than usual, still further crossing the

crater-row east of IVA^^, and proceeding to the high mountain IV A^'''

on the west border of Ptolemseus, has been identified with a portion of a line

of disturbance from Tycho. The group IV A^ ' , IV A^ '^, IV A^ ^, and IV A^ ''

is also bright. It is worthy of remark that the general direction of these
light and dark spaces is towards Tycho.

Directions of EiUs, Crater-rills, Crater-roivs, Valleys, Mountain-chains, ^"c.

Since the year 1786 several endeavours have been made to render certain

featm-es of the moon's surface especial objects of study, particularly the rills,

--the first of which--the remarkable wedge-shaped valley of the Alps was

discovered by Bianchini on Sept. 22, 1727*. Lohrmann, Miidler, Kinau, and

Schmidt have carried on the study of rills during the interim, and the number

now known exceeds 425. In the admirable ' Catalogue of Eills ' lately published

by Schmidt, not only has the class been considerably augmciited by including

large valleys, of which the first- discovered rill may be regarded as the type,

but the dii-ection of each has been given in a very clear and distinct manner.

I am not aware, however, that any attempt has been made to classify the

" rills " according to direction, which may have an important bearing on the

subject of the manifestation of the effects of those forces which have modified

the surface                                          for there can be  no doubt  that while the  crater-form is appa-
                                                  ;

rently by far the most prominent feature, the directions of the rills, valleys,

crater-rows, and mountain-chains indicate the lines in which the forces mo-

difying the surface operated, it may be over wide-spread areas around foci

of disturbance, such as Tycho, and other ray-centres; consequently an arrange-

ment of these directions may in some degree contribute to our knowledge of

the operation of forces on a minor scale which may have modified the features

of smaller portions of the surface.

myIt IS not                                          intention to imdertake a classification of the directions of

Schmidt's 425 riUs, but simply, as this work proceeds, to arrange under each

artificial area of 5° of longitude by 5° of latitude the directions of rills, cra-

ter-rows, crater-rills, vaUeys, mountain-chains, or any feature that indicates

the line in which the action of either upheaving or depressing forces has been

manifested, thus laying the foundation of a more enlarged generalization at
some future period.

   In the following Table of lines of upheaval and depression in areas IV A"

and IV A^ the directions are expressed by the two opposite points of the

lunar compass between which the line lies, regarding throughout the meridian
as the starting line, and passing from south by west to north. In Qua-

mdrants I. and IV. the arrangement will be from the meridian westward, and
    Quadrants II. and III. from the meridian eastward.

* Schmidt, in his ; Catalogue of Kills', ascribes the discovery of this interesting formation
to ScLroter, who noticed it 1787, October 1, and delineated it in his Selenotopograpliische
l-ragmente; but it was carefully observed by Bianchini on the date given in the te^t, and
described and figured by Inn. in his ' Hesperi et Phosphori Nova Phtenomena,'
itome in lilii. Eianchini mentions it as indicated in Cassini's chart.                           printed  at

                                     depression was due exclusively to the out-

                                     break that produced IV A^ ' and its sur-

                                     appear that the whole line of upheaval and
                                     depression resulted from the operation of a

                                     force that exerted itself over a much greater

                                           This is the main line of fault crossing the
                                       area. It appears as a portion of a lucid
                                       ray from Tycho in the full moon.

                                           It is noteworthy that these five lines of
                                       upheaval and depression are found in this

 --General Remarks. The most interesting feature resulting from this dis-

cussion, confined as it is in extent, is the almost rectangular area of greatest

disturbance on IV A^ crossed by two main lines of fault which intersect each

other in the point IV A?36 . o^g, W.N.W.-E.S.E. No. 2 (IV A? 67, jy A? 8^),

coincident with the north-east wall of Albategnius, having several craters
opened on it, and running parallel with the S.S.W. and N.N.E. boundaries
of the area; the other, N.N.W.-S.S.E. No. 5, which breaking through
W.N.W.-E.S.E. No. 2 at the point of intersection, leads strongly to the
conclusion that the line N.N.W.-S.S.E. No. 5 is the most recent, and this
--

line of fault appears to be connected with Tycho. It does not appear at pre-
sent that W.N.W.-E.S.E. No. 2 is connected with any centre or point of

outbreak, unless it may be with lY AJi^, of which we may have to say more in

treating of that area. Another disturbed area occurs on IV A." between the

lines W.N.W.-E.S.E. No. 2, N.W.-S.E. No. 1 ; it is bounded on the west by
the line S. by W.-N. by E. No. 4. The lines of disturbance at right angles
to W.N.W.-E.S.E. are the most numerous, nearly 30 per cent, of the whole
on the two areas, equal to 17688-35 square miles Enghsh ; and there is some

reason to believe, as mentioned under IV A^^'', that the whole set maybe in

connexion with the easternmost of the ray-centres in the S.W. portion of the
moon, but a more extensive examination is necessary before this can be de-
cided. Arranging the whole of the directions according to a percentage scale,

276 REPORT-- 1866.

                             --PosTSCEiPT. 1867, April 12.

   In order to avoid any bias in the production of the outline, or in drawing
up the catalogiie, I purposely abstained, except in a few special instances,

from consulting either B. & M. or Lohrmann, so that the work, so far as it has

proceeded, is perfectly independent of the labours of previous selenographers
but while the foregoing sheets were passing throiigh the press, and after the

areas lY A* and IV A^ were engraved, I very carefully compared them with

Lohrmann's sections (the reader can make his own comparison with B. & M.,

the corresponding portions of their Map being given in the Plate). As it is

not unlikely that some of the notes may be of interest, I take this opportu-

Anity of adding them.        few have already been inserted.

--IV A". 2. Eeaumur. Neither B. & M. nor Lohrmann give any objects

on this plain.

7. The mountain-range on which this crater is opened is continued by

Lohrmann towards his mountain 34, Sec. I. (IV A^"^*^), where he gives an

opening into the plain west of IV A^-"* (Lohrmann's "W. Sec. I). IV A* '^,

IV A^ ^^ is in the direction of this mountain-chain, and it may probably be
the craterlet which Lohrmann shows on or near its south end.

   12, 13 are shown by Lohrmann as valleys opening into Hipparchus. In

his ' Topographic der Sichtbaren Mondoberflache,' Sec. I. p. 45, he says,

"The vaUey between 32 (IV A* ''*') and 33 (IV A" ^8) unites the interior
floor of Hipparchus with the plain of the Mare vaporum."

 --I have not met with an opening certainly not with one that would easily
--strike the attention in the line of cliifs forming the N.E. boundary of

Hipparchus. If I have interpreted Lohrmann's language correctly, it would
appear that he considered that the floor of Hipparchus and that of the Mare

vaporum (Sinus Mcdii, B. & M.) were at the same level. Now in my obser-

vations of the region around IV A" '^ I found it depressed below Hipparchus,

the line of cliffs forming the partition. The only valley which I have given is

IV A-'^a^ south of IV A" '^ 1867, April 11, 1 found an opening in IV A* ^^
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

Query. Is IV A" ^^ UocTced towards IV A" , as shown by Lohrmann, by

the mountain which appears to be the east side of the valley IV A* ^^ ?

   20. The mountain on the west of the south portion (IV A*"') appears to
be figured by Lohrmann at the mouth of the valley between 32 and 33 of his

Sec. I., but he does not in the slightest degree indicate the depression to the

east.

   25. This appears to be the N.W. side of the valley which Lohrmann men-

tions and figures in See. I. 87.

   32. This valley is shown by Lohrmann with a mountain-range within it.
The interior mountain-range I have not seen. Lohrmann shows the S.W.

mouth of the valley open, and exactly in the line of the valley TV AJ> ^^.
   43, 58. These formations are partially shown by Lohrmann with at least

two additional mountain-chains ; IV A" '*^ appears, according to Lohrmann, to

stand in a valley ; IV A* ^^ is ill figured.

   47. This cleft is well shown by Lohrmann, as well as the dark colour on
the surface which is very marked in the photograph.

    53, Lohrmann, in his text, p. 55, speaks of this valley as connecting the
ON MAPPING THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.                                                     277

 plain W. Sec. I. (IV A"^, IV A^24^ ^jj-j^ g^ pj^^-^ ^^^^ ^^ Hipparchus. He

 gives four openings (valleys) in the mountainous border of this plain, viz. 88,
 89, and 90 of Sec. I., and another, which do not by any means appear pro-
 minently in the photograph.

    59. Lohrmann gives this as the N.E. extremity of a long mountain-range

 parallel with IV A* *^.
    61. Lohrmann gives a short low mountain-range which lies in the direc-

tion of this ray ; or it may be IV A* ^^.

     72. This " Fault," which under a suitable illumination is quite apparent,
is not indicated by Lohrmann, neither are the marked dislocations of the
border of Rhaeticus shown.

    75. The north portion of this valley, with apparently a low mountain-

range separating it from IV A* ''^, is shown by Lohrmann in Sec. I. 25. The
valley IV A" ^^ as it enters IV A" ^^ has a darker tint in Lohrmann.

    77. Lohrmann shows a plain here.

    79, 81. Are these the two craterlets which Lohrmann places at the entrance
of his vaUey, Sec. I. 87 ?

    80. Lohrmann mentions (p. 55) and delineates in this neighbourhood (pro-

bably the lower part of the slope of IV A* ^^) a valley, 87, Sect. I., 7 German

miles (.32-2 English miles) in length. This valley, with the individuahty

ascribed to it by Lohrmann, has not arrested my attention. I am neverthe-

less disposed to regard it as running between IV A"'''' and IV A* ^^. Lohr-
mann also mentions and shows two craterlets at its entrance.

   The following objects occur in Lohrmann's Section I., 15, 30, 68, 69, 70.
   The following objects are not found in Lohrmann's Section I., 23, 38, 39,

40, 41, 46, 57, 60, 64, 65, ? 66, 71, 73, 74, 82, 83, 84.

 --IV A^. 25. This formation is alluded to, although not individually de-

scribed, by Lohrmann under 28, Sec. I., p. 44. The N.E. boundary is

exceedingly iU figured by Lohrmann, and 34, with its two mountain-peaks,

IV A^^' and IVA^'^'', is placed too far to the east. The valley IV A^^'

between IV A^^' and IV A^^' is blocked on the S.S.E. by Lohrmann.
   27. This vaUey is well shown by Lohrmann. In it, just JST.W. of his

mountain (IV A^^*^, IV A^^' shown as one), he has placed a craterlet, which
I have not found, nor am I aware that it is mentioned in his text.

   31. This mountain is sho-vyn in Sec. I. of Lohrmann, but the semi-crater

jY^?S8 jg absent.

   32. This mountain appears to be the N.E. spur of Lohrmann's 20, Sec. I.,
the south part of which he places in the position of Schmidt,'s crater-rill 355.

VI have not detected his N.W. spur, unless it be I  A^ ^                  which  is  a  difficult
                                                                      ',

object. Lohrmann gives four craterlets on the east side of the N.E. spur.

I have seen three of them, viz. IV A^^O, IV A^^^ and IV A^^^^

   33. 68. Both given by Lohrmann on Sec. I, IV A^^^ between his 48 and
20, and IV A? ^** on his 20.

   40. It is uncertain if Lohrmann has this craterlet ; he indicates a very

small depression of a similar nature not far from its locality.

   42, 43. Both these craterlets are given by Lohrmann on his mountain 19,
Sec. I. I have not yet met with this mountain.

47. Lohrmann shows IV A^ *^ as connected with a range running towards
278 KEPORT-- 1866.

IV A^ ' (X of Sec. I.). This does not appear to be the case from the photo-
graph. The whole of this portion of the map requires to be very carefully

examined under good atmospheric circumstances at the telescope. I have a
record 1864, July 24, of the valley 88, Sec. I. between the range above men-
tioned and a parallel one.

   52. Shown by Lohrmann, hut not at all cori-ectly. It is quite detached in
Sec. I. from the moimtain 20, on the south edge of which it is evidently

situated.

   56, 57. Lohrmann gives these mountains as one, which he describes as the
highest of the mountain-ranges near 28 of Sec. I.

    58. Lohrmann, Sec. I. p. 44, classes 25, 26, and 27 together as apparently
belonging to low luall-mountains ; 26 I have not found ; 27 I describe as an

ancient and partly filled crater (IV A^^^) with a slightly depressed surface;

and 25 is the depression IV A"'*' in the valley IV A^**^.

59. Lohrmann shows at the extremity of the mountain-arm IVA^ »

which he extends further to the S.W., a craterlet ; this is probably IV A^ ^^.
   67, 82. Schmidt's crater-rills 354 and 355 are situated respectively upon

the S.W. edges of Lohrmann's two mountains 19 and 20, Sec. I., which
he places in the mountain-border of Albategnius. These mountains he

separates in the Hne with IV A^ '"', IV A^ 9', and IV A^ ^^. IV A^ *^, which

he places on the south part of his mountain 19, is a little too far east as com-

pared with mine ; and IV A^ ^^, which he places incorrectly with regard to

IVA^'*2 (inasmuch as it is on the S.W. of TV A^'^% he throws a little

^too far to the east of the line IV A^ ^0^ IV A^ ^' , IV A^ ^2  jg ^j^^, grater

IV A^**^ which separates the riUs, and Lohrmann shows it with IV A^''*

lower than the mountain-border and on the floor of Albategnius. There is
no point of upburst indicated by Lohrmann such as is evident on the photo-

graph.

   78. Given by Lohrmann opening into a plain at a higher level than the

floor of Ptolemseus. On this plain Lohrmann places IV A^ '^^. This plain

is entirely wanting in the photograph. 1866, Sept. 17, 8'' to 10'', I recorded

the appearance of a plateau between IV A^'^^ and IV A^"^, intermediate in

level between the high N.E. border of Albategnius and the low floor of
Ptolemaeus, which I afterwards found was the summit of the mountain

IV A^^^, and between it and the mountain IV A^*^^ was the deep hollow

IV A^^^, seen very distinctly on the 19th of Sept. 1866. I have not met

with Lohrmann's plain. The deep hoUow IV A^ ^^ is entirely wanting in

Sec. I., in which the plain occupies the position of IV A^ ^^.
   84. Lohrmann shows this valley as hlocTced by a portion of the border of

Ptolemseus between his 16, Sec. I., and the plain west of Ptolemaeus, i. e. "be-

tweenIVA^l'^andIVA?23.
   The following objects, some very imperfectly, are found in Lohrmann, Sec.

I., 10, 17, 26, 29, S3, 87.

   The following objects do not occur in Lohrmann, 30, 54, 79, 86, 88, 89.

6"-33, breadth 3". It is inserted from Lohrmann's sections, but does not
appear on the photograjDh. 1864, July 24, I saw and sketched it. The in-
strument used was the Hartwell Equatoreal, power 118, the eyepiece being
furnished with a diaphragm having a narrow sUt, along which the object was

    The careful study of the lines of upheaval and depression is particularly
recommended to lunar observers as full of promise. It is not at aU unlikely
that several of the " Rays from Tycho " will be found to possess the charac-
ter of lines of volcanic energy. It is an interesting fact that the two points
of upburst, IV A^ ^^ and IV Ay ^^, on the " ray from Tycho " crossing the area
IV A^ occur in localities where several lines of upheaval and depression in-

tersect each other.

                                                 Concluding RemarJcs.

   We would again call attention to the Note on p. 239, to the effect that the

present Map is not intended to be perfect or complete ; and we are the more

anxious on this point, as various suggestions have been offered with the view

of rendering it more efficient, with which we most cordially agree. At pre-
sent the engraved portions of the Map are in outline, and will doubtless re-
quire considerable modification, as observers work at the subzones (see pp.
241, 242) which they may select. One suggestion, and a very important one,

is, " that as the craters on the moon's surface are the leading objects, catch-
ing the eye first, and giving points of reference to the region under obser-

vation, it would greatly facilitate the work of observers if the craters were
rendered more conspicuous in the engravings." The present imperfection of
our knowledge of " detail" interferes materially with adopting any conven-
tional mode of distinguishing one class of objects from another, further than
as explained on p. 240 ; but as the Maps are intended for working-purposes, and
are printed on paper that mil bear colouring, we would strongly recommend
that each observer should, before commencing his observations, tint with a
suitable colour the craters in his pair of subzones ; and if a few other conspi-
cuous objects, as mountains, were desirable as points of reference, they might
be tinted, but with a colour as much in contrast as possible. The portion of
Beer and Madler's map, referred to on p. 241, does not accompany this Re-

 port.

severance, and the aid of a portion of the press, the number has been raised
until there are now more than 1200 places whence returns are regiilarly re-
ceived. Still I know there are many more, probably hundreds, who have
either never heard of the establishment of a central depot to which copies of

aU rain records should be sent, or they have been too diffident to send them.
It is of paramount importance to gather these, and make the Tables yet more

complete. I therefore beg leave through your columns to ask every reader

to think for a moment if he or she knows of any one who keeps, or has kept,

a rain-gauge ; or who has any tables of rainfall (or old weather journals) in

their possession. And if they do know of such persons, I ask them on behalf

myof science, of my fellow-observers, and on  own behalf, to use eveiy effort

to secure theti- assistance, and to favour- me with their names and addresses.

We want old records, we want records for the present year, and from many

parts of the coimtry we want returns for the future, if a few persons will

notify to me theii' willingness to assist, and to pay 10s. 6d. for the very

cheap and simple gauge now supplied.

To prevent needless correspondence, I annex a list of the places in Bedford-

shire whence returns have been already collected for the years mentioned in the

last column, and shall be very glad of any additions or corrections. Other

counties, or the complete list for the whole countiy, shall be sent to any one

willing to make good use of it. I may add that an influential committee of

the British Association has been appointed to superiatend and assist in my
investigations, and that they cordially support my present application.

                                                         regret to say that

absolutely nothing has been done in searching the Library of the Biitish Mu-

seum during the past year. Eecords once there being safe, it has been judged

more expedient to secure those from other quarters, where their safe custody

--is always uncertain ; the observers die, and the records are too often destroyed.
   Examination of Rain-gauges. Ever since Mr. Symous's rainfall investiga-

tions were commenced, he has made it a principal aim to visit as many as

possible of the gauges actually at work, and by conversation with the ob-

servers, and by examination of the accuracy of their gauges and the suitability

of theii- position, to secure at once stronger personal intei-est in the work,

and greater uniformity and accuracy in the mode of carrying it on. It is

therefore with much pleasure that the details of 166 such visits are annexed

to this Eeport, di'awn up, it is hoped, in such a manner as to afford a good

general idea of the position of the gauges, and absolute knowledge of the

degree of accuracy of each gauge at different points of its scale. Without

entering at present on a minute analysis of the results of these examinations,

it may be affiimed that they are on the whole immensely beneficial. As a

rule, the gauges are found to be in error less than two per cent. ; and though

now and then he comes upon gauges which are a disgrace to those who made

Athem, these cases are altogether exceptional. more frequent source of error

is the proximity of trees and tall plants ; it cannot be too strongly impressed

on observers, that they must keep a clear open space round their gauges.

 --Inclined and Tijjping Funnelled Gauges. At the last Meeting of this

Association it was suggested by Mr. Varley and Prof. Phillips that we should

ascertain the indications of a gauge whose mouth instead of being horizontal

Weshould be inclined, and kept face to wind by a vane.      are happy to be

able to announce that Mr. Chrimes of Eotherham has erected, and regularly

observed, a most exhaustive set of instruments for the investigation of this

question. They are erected on a piece of exposed high land in the subiu-bs

of Eotherham, and the gauges are read daily and 5 monthly.

The instruments are

A1. gauge similar to one employed many years ago by Prof. Phillips,

having one horizontal and four vertical funnels, facing E., W., N., and S.
Of course if the rain is absolutely vertical it will only enter the horizontal

funnel ; if coming absolutely horizontal, and from, say, due east, it wUl only

enter the funnel facing east ; if at any intermediate angle, it will partly fall

into two or three funnels, each being provided with separate pipes and taps

the quantity caught by each is known, and the angle and point whence the

rain fell can be easily calculated.

   2 to 5. Four gauges revolving by vanes, and having their funnels tilted

towards the wind at angles of 22^°, 45°, 67|°, and 90°.

  A6. gauge similar to the above, except that the tUt of the gauge is not

fixed, but, being supplied with levers, &c., varies with the pressure of the wind.

In a dead calm the funnel is horizontal, and in a gale it will, it is hoped, be
tilted to an angle of 70° or 80°. It should thus be always at right angles to
the wind, and catch more than any other gauge in windy weather.

  A7. Eobinson's anemometer, to give the horizontal motion of the air.
   A8. set of gauges at different elevations-- 10 feet, 15 feet, 20 feet, and

25 feet above the ground ; two at each height, one for daily and one for
monthly measurements. These, and also the above-mentioned gauges, are
all 5 inches diameter.

284                                            REPORT 1866.

    The observations were submitted for discussion to Mr, Baxendell, F.R.A.S.,

who reports as follows :

   Note on Mr. Chrimes's Rain-gauge Experiments, by Joseph Baxendell, Esq.,

--F.R.A.S. Comparing the quantity of rain received by the horizontal mouth

of the five-mouthed gauge with that received by the 90° iuclined gauge, I

find that the mean monthly angles of deviation from the vertical of falling

rain were             ,,,                                                    o,                                o,

    The mean derived from the entire series of observations (not the mean of

the monthly means) is 42° 13'. This value is greater than I was prepared

to  expect,  but  is  borne               out  by  the  results of  the          other  gauges                                 thus, the
                                                                                                                            ;

greatest quantity of rain was, in every month, received by the 45° incUned

gauge ; and comparing the results of all the inclined gauges, we obtain the

following monthly values :

                                       o       May         o                              o

           April .... 56                                53 June                         37

   The mean daily movement of the wind on rainy days was 149 miles.
Arranging the rainy days in two groups, the one including all the days when
the movement of the wind was above, and the other all those when it was
below the mean value, we find that with a mean daily movement of 103-8

miles, the rain fell at an angle of 33° 38' from the perpendicular, and with

a mean daily movement of 227-4 miles the angle was increased to 58° 21'.

    The five-mouthed gauge was in use two months earlier than the series of

inclined gauges, and the mean monthly horizontal direction of the rain de-

duced from its indications was as follows :

                  · June

    If I understand the construction of the tipping-gauge aright, it ought to
receive more rain than any of the other gauges, but the observations show
that while in general it receives more than the horizontal and vertical
gauges, it receives less than the gauges whose orifices are inclined at angles

of 22|°, 45°, and 67|°. On days when the velocity of the wind is less

than the average, the tipping-gauge receives less than either the 22^° or
45° inclined gauge, and more than any of the other gauges ; but with the
velocity of the wind above the average, it receives more than the horizontal
gauge and less than any of the others. It appears therefore to be irregular
in its action, and to require some modification before its results can be used

with confidence in rainfall investigations.                                      Josh. Baxendell.
   Cheetham Hill, Manchester, August 17, 1866.

 --p.S. So far as I can see at present, Mr. Chrimes's experiments do not

throw any fresh light on the question as to the cause of the differences in the

amounts of rain received by gauges at different elevations.

 --Influence of River Mists on the Amount of Rain collected. An observer of

great practical experience once marked on his return " affected by a large

pool adjacent to the gauge." Mr. Symons at once began speculating how
much this could amount to ; and it has also often been questioned by those

who, from an elevation, have seen the mist hanging over the windings of

a river, so marked and well defined that its course can be traced for miles.

Is it to these mists, or to the percolation of the water through the river

banks, that their luxuriant vegetation is to be ascribed ? If to the mists,
ON THE RAINFALL IN THE BRITISH ISLES.  285

should we not find the rainfall in the places they cover above that of neigh-
boiiring stations ? By the cooperation of the Thames Conservancy Commis-
sioners and the observer at Weybridge Heath (W. F. Harrison, Esq.), three

gauges have been erected -with a view of testing the point*. There w'as
obviously some little difficulty in deciding on the best mode of fixing the
gauge in the middle of the river, yet where it should be safe from injury by
the barges or mischievous people. Eventually it was fixed on the top of one
of the guard piles protecting Shepperton Weir ; Mr. Symons felt at the time
that, elevated 6 ft. above the water, 150 ft. from either bank, the gauge would,
from its exposed position, catch too little, less even than the ordinary fall at
that height, because of the great exposure, still he did not then see any better

arrangement. On receipt of the following report from Mr. Harrison we are
inclined next year to try if we can have the gauge moored floating on the

stream, with its mouth only a foot or so above it.

    Rainfall Observations at three Stations at and near Weybridge, Surrey.
286 REPORT--1866.

   With tlie double object of cheeking these experiments in the upper por-
tions of the Thames valley, and also of ascertaining how serious were the
errors incidental to a rain-gauge on board ship, a gauge was, by the cour-
tesy of the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, placed on board the Nore
light-ship, and its indications have been checked against the returns from
the land stations at Sheeruess, Shoebuiyness, and llochford. The result
again seems to be a less amount in mid-stream, but neither set of experi-
ments have gone on long enough for generahzation.

          First Approximation to Fluctuation of Rainfull, 1726 to 1865.
   In Mr. Symons's last annual Report he gave " a few particular's respecting
the rainfall of the last fifty yeai-s," and exhibited the smaller of the two
diagrams accompanying this Report * ; that investigation he expressly stated
was temporary only, and if he had consulted only his own inclination it
would have remained for a few years longer the solitary examination of the
question ; his reason being that the importance of the question of the secular
variation of rainfall is such that temporary and partial investigations are

unworthy of it. On the other hand, no sooner were the previous data pub-

lished, than he was urged to give some approximations to the truth for pre-

--vious years, to see if older records gave any indication of droughts equal to

those of the ten years ending with 186.5 to see, in short, what facts can be

discovered in this hitherto untrodden branch of inquiry. He thought that

if he persisted in maintaining that this second series, like the first, was but
a partial discussion of the question, curiosity would be partly allayed, and
there would be less occasion to hurry on the final work, he now therefore

submits the results of the following process.

 --(1) Eight of the longest and most complete registers were selected, most

being for periods of over fifty years, viz.

Southwick, near Oundle, Northamptonshire (George                  yrs.

Lynne, Esq.)                                      1726 to 1739 14

Lvndon, near Oakham, Rutland (T. Barker, Esq.) . . 1737 to 1798 62

Chatsworth, Derbyshu-e                            1761 to 1813 53
Manchester, Lancashire (Dr. Dalton)               1794 to 1840 46
Derby, Derby (Mr. Swanwick)                       1809 to 1835 27

Eadcliffe Observatory, Oxford (the Radcliffe observers) 1815 to 1865 51

Cobham Lodge, Sui-rey (Miss Molesworth)           1825 to 1865 41

Mean of ten stations as given in last Report      1815 to 1865 51

   (2) The mean of each set of observations having been taken, the fall in
each year was divided thereby, and thus its i-elation to the mean of the

whole period was converted into a ratio independent of the amount of fall.

    (3) These values being therefore strictly comparable, have been tabulated
in parallel columns, and in order to connect all together, and to reduce all
to one unifonn base, the means were taken of each overlapping portion, and

--the corrections thereby deduced having been applied, the ratios were thus

reduced to the following bases : Mean of 51 years at Oxford ; mean of 31
years at the ten stations quoted in last Report ; and mean of 41 years at

Cobham Lodge.
    Of course identical results could not be expected from stations so widely

separated, now that we know how rarely is a year uniformly wet or dry

throughout the kingdom ; but Table III. showed results so similar, that he
felt no hesitation in constructing the large diagram, showing a " first ap-

proximation to fluchiation of rainfall, 1726 to 1865." Although unprepared
for the extraordinary drought between 1730 and 1762, he is not at present
inclined to impugn the accui-acy of the returns*.

   It wiU be seen that the drought of the years 1854 to 1864 is far exceeded
in intensity by that at the commencement of the century, and still fui'ther
by the extraordinary one previously mentioned as occurring between 1730
and 1762. It does not seem expedient to enlarge at any length on the
many remarkable features of this diagram, but rather to leave the facts
ready for all, and not be too precipitate in drawing conclusions.

   One satisfactory point may be mentioned, viz., that in Mr. Symons's last

--Report the following remark was made : " On carrying the investigation

back to 1800 the faU then seems to have been less than it was about 1815."
  This wiU be seen to be amply confirmed by the present extended investigation.

Report on the best means of 2'>rovidhiy for a Uniformity of Weiyhts

   and Measures, ivith reference to the Interests of Science. By a
    Committee, consisting of Sir John Bowring^ The Rt. Hon. C. B.
   Adderley, M.P., Sir William Armstrong, C.B., F.R.S., The
   Astronomer Royal, Samuel Brown, W. Ewart, 31. P., Dr. Farr,

Your Committee have much pleasure in reporting that during the year steps
of great importance have been taken to promote the adoption of one common
decimal system of weights and measures, both at home and abroad. In
November 1865 a second Conference was held at Frankfort, of official dele-
gates from different German States, including Austria, Prussia, Eavaria,

Saxony, Hanover, Wurtemberg, Baden, Hesse, Mecldenburg, Nassau, Olden-
burg, and the Hanse Towns, with a view of determining the basis of a
uniform system for the whole of Germany, in confirmation of what had been
agreed upon in 1863, on which occasion, however, Priissia was not repre-

sented. By a protocol of the 28th of November, the delegates resolved to take

the metre as a unit of measure with the other portions of the metric system,
allowing the coexistence of the foot of 3 decimetres, the inch of 3 centimetres,

and the line of 3 millimetres. It is much to be regretted that by thus com-

bining two otherwise antagonistic systems, the Commissioners have thrown
an impediment to the absolute introduction of the metric system ; but the
question will doubtless be subject to further consideration. The war which
has taken place in Germany has delayed the consideration of this and other
measures of progress ; but it is gratifying to learn tliat one of the first
conditions laid down in the preliminaries of peace was the establishment of a
uniform system of weights and measures, not only over the north for Germany
under the immediate influence of Prussia, but over the southern portions

also.

    In the United States of America considerable advance has also been made.
Seizing the opportunity of Mr. Yates Thompson's ^asit to the States, your
Committee desired him to ascertain what steps were taken on the subject in
that country ; and it is gratifying to learn that the Americans seem prepared

to advance further and much more expeditiously than we have done, Mr.
Thompson, whose able Report we have the pleasure to append (p. 355-363),

informed us that on the recommendation of a Select Committee on weights,
measures, and coinage, appointed by the National Academy of Science, two
Bills were introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives, one rendering
the use of the metric system lawful in the United States, and the other
authorizing the use in Post-offices of weights of the denomination of grammes ;
whilst joint resolutions were passed, enabling the Secretary of the Treasury
to furnish to each State one set of the standard weights and measures of

the metric system, and authorizing the President to appoint a Special Com-

missioner to facilitate the adoption of one uniform coinage between the
 United States and foreign countries. These resolutions passed the House of
Representatives with little or no opposition. The two Bills have passed into

law.

    The approaching Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1867 appeared to your
                                                           UNIFORMITY OP WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.                                                                                                                                                       353

Committee a most favourable opportunity for promotiug uniformit)- in weights

and measures, and they have suggested to the Imperial Commission an Ex-

hibition of the weights, measures, and coins of all countries, and the hold-

Aing of an International Conference on the subject at the same time.

similar request was sent to the Imperial Commission by the International

Decimal Association, and in union with them we deputed Professor Leone

Levi to proceed to Paris to put himself in communication with M. Le Play,

the Commissaire-General, with a view to the advancement of the object.

Professor Levi has fully succeeded in his mission, and a Special Committee of

the Scientific Commission has been appointed. Your Committee indulge the

hope that the proposed Exhibition with the International Conference will

greatly promote the desired uniformity, and they are most anxious for the

success of an undertaking in initiating Avhich they have taken an active part.

Professor Levi's report on the subject is appended (pp. 363-365).
   The International Statistical Congress, which met last at Berlin in 1863,

proposes to hold its next Meeting in Elorence in October next. At all

its previous meetings the question of uniformity of weights, measures, and

coins, in their character as statistical units, formed the subject of grave

discussion                                            and  although  the  Congress  has                                                                                                                                        not  only repeatedly  expressed
                                                   ;

its opinion in favour of uniformity, but made specific recommendations

with a view to its attainment, it is most desirable that it should on this

occasion also, when many of the Southern States of Europe are likely to be

there represented, give its authoritative voice in favour of uniformity in

weights, measures, and coins, both for statistical purposes, and the general

progress of scientific and social intercourse among nations. The British

Association has never yet been represented in that Congress, and it seems

befitting that the section of Statistics and Economic Science should seize the

opportunity for the discussion of a subject in which both that Congress and

this Association have taken such lively interest, and for the establishment of

a correspondence and mutual representation likely to prove most beneficial to

Statistical Science ; and Italy, whose contributions to science and art and
political economy have been so valuable, wiU doubtless heartily welcome the

representatives of this great and eminently progressive Association.

The state of weights and measures in India has been brought before your

Committee in two pamphlets, one on Indian weights and measures, by Mr.

Gover, Principal of the Military Male Orphan Asylum of Madras, and the

other by Mr. James Bridgnell, Head Accountant of Her Majesty's Mint,

Calcutta, entitled, " Suggestions for a Decimal System of Measures, Weights,

and Money for India." Having regard to the great importance of extending

to that empire the same advantages of uniformity as we are labouring to

promote in other parts of the world, your Committee have sent an address

on the subject to the government of India. The question is now under their
consideration; but much difference of opinion exists between the Madras
and Bombay Commissions on the respective merits of the decimal and binary

systems. It is most important that India should neither be separated from

nor remain behind any country in the world                                                                                                                                                                                     and we trust that at the forth-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

coming Exhibition and International Conference to be held in Paris she will

send copies of aU her weights, measures, and coins, and be duly represented

in the French capital, especially as her trade with countries using the metric

system is becoming more and more extensive.

It is much to be desired that a measure for legalizing the use of metric

weights and measures, similar to that passed in the United Kingdom, should

be introduced in all tlxe British Colonies, and your Committee would be alad
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ''

to obtain the cooperation of Her Majesty's Secretary for the Colonies in so

important a matter.

At home, the only legislative measure recently passed bearing on the sub-

ject, is o]ie for transferring to the Board of Trade the department of weights

and measures, previously connected with the office of the Comptroller of the
Exchequer. Your Committee regret that no provision has been made in the

Act for authorizing that Board to provide themselves with a copy of the

standard metric weights and measures, with a view to the stamping of the

metric weights and measures in common use. The law on the subject is in

a very anomalous state. Although the Metric Weights and Measui-es Act of

1864 has rendered permissive and legal the use of such weights and measures,

the inspectors of weights and measures are by law bound to seize any such
weights and measures not duly stamped ; and since no means are now afforded

for stamping them, the Act is rendered inoperative. Seeing that the system is

being extensively introduced in many arts and manufactures, and in com-
merce goucrally, it is much to be desired that the law on the subject may

speedily be amended. A deputation from your Committee waited on the

late President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Milner Gibson, on the subject, and
he promised to consider the introduction of a separate measure to remove the

anomaly. But the session was too far advanced, and nothing has been done.

Among the means by which Her Majesty's Government could promote such

introduction, we might mention the preparation of all statistical documents

by the Board of Trade in the terms of the metric system as well as in the
imperial, and the publication of the British Tariff in a similar manner. The

International Statistical Congress has strongly lu'ged the former of these

measures, and we see no reason why the Board of Trade and the Board of

Customs should not supply these additional facilities, both to statists and

British merchants. Although the articles now subject to Customs duty are

very few, stiU the operation of the British Tariff is most perplexing to those

accustomed only to a decunal computation.

Tour Committee have given their earnest consideration to the procuring

of a Mural Standard as a means for diffusing information ; and they have

appointed a Subcommittee to ascertain and report on the best form and

material in which such standard can be constructed. The Subcommittee

have devoted much time to the subject, and they have finally succeeded in
obtaining from Mr. Casella a model of a Metre and Yard combined, which

seems to fulfil all the conditions necessary for the proper exhibition of these

Ameasures in the most conspicuous places.    special report on the subject by

the convener of the Subcommittee, Mr. James Yates, is appended (pp. 305-367).

The Committee propose purchasing some copies of such standard; and as the
cost is five guineas each, the sum already voted by the Association wiU be

barely sufficient for this item alone.

   Your Committee are anxious to see school instruction made more operative

towards extending the knowledge of the metric system among the young.

To promote this object, they have addressed themselves to the President of

the Committee of CouncU on Education, for the purpose of suggesting the intro-

duction of the metric system into the examination of teachers in the training
schools supported by parliamentary grant, and a conference with teachers and

others interested in education was held on the subject at the Lecture Theatre
in Jermyn Street. Great difficulty is, however, experienced in inducing
teachers to give due prominence to the metric system, so long as the use of

it is only permissive, and all the tables of weights and measures according to

the imperial system are still to be taught.

UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.  355

   The measures and weights of the metric system having been almost
universally adopted by scientific chemists, there seemed to be every reason
to expect that they would be adopted in pharmacy also. This has been done
in some countries which have not yet introduced the system into commerce.
The Swedish Pharmacopoeia is constructed on this principle, and in the
United States of America prescriptions are written in terms of the metric
system. In this country the change has hitherto been opposed by the
General Council of Medical Education and Eegistration, which issues its
decrees under the authority of an Act of Parliament. In these circumstances,
the Metric Committee of the British Association resolved to address the
Medical Council, suggesting that " the objection formerly urged to the intro-
duction of the metric system side by side with the imperial in all the formulas
for the preparation of drugs and chemicals, that the metric weights and

measures were not yet sanctioned by the Legislature, is now removed by the

passing of the Metric Weights and Measures Act," and expressing the desire

of the Metric Committee that the system may be introduced into the forth-

coming ncAV edition of the Pharmacopoeia. Hereupon the following resolu-
tion was passed : " That the General Medical Council are not prepared to
adopt, in its full extent, the suggestion of the Metric Committee of the
British Association ; but the Council will direct that a complete comparative
table of metric and imperial weights and measures, with instructions for
their mutual conversion, shall be inserted in the forthcoming edition of the

British Pharmacopoeia."

    Your Committee thought it probable that great advantages would arise
from the introduction of the metric system in the carrying department of
railways. On this question Professor Levi consulted some of the officials at
the Clearing-house in London, and Mr. Louis d'Eyncoiirt, a member of the
Council of the International Decimal Association, embraced the opportunity
of a visit to Boulogne to make inquiries regarding the goods traffic by rail-
way between England and France. But although the evidence thus obtained
was important and decisive, it appeared that the Eoyal Commission on the
Railways in Great Britain and Ireland was not disposed to proceed with the

inquiry.

    Your Committee have reason to believe that they have already exercised
considerable influence in the promotion of an object of so wide and general
importance as the uniformity of weights, measures, and coins in all countries
and, in conclusion, they would recommend the reappointment of the Com-
mittee with similar powers, and another vote of at least fifty pounds towards
the purchase of copies of the Mural Standard, and more especially in con-
nexion with the forthcoming Universal Exhibition and International Statis-

tical Cong*or^ess.

Report on the Progress of tlie Metric System in the United States of America.

                            By H. Yates Thompson, F.S.S.

--Gentlemex, In accordance with your letter to me, dated 17th February

1866,' I took occasion, on a visit to the United States of America in May and

June last, to ascertain what steps are being taken by friends of the Metric
System of Weights and Measui-es to promote its adoption in that country.

    It appears that ever since the settlement of the Constitution in 1789,
wherein it was declared that Congress should have power " to fix the standard
of weights and measures," there has been a continual effort, which has

hitherto been without practical result, to obtain a uniform and decimal

                                                                       2 a2

system of weights and measures for the United States. In 1790, in accor-
dance with a recommendation of President Washington, Mr. Jefferson, then
Secretary of State, reported elaborately on the subject; and it is probable
that one or other of the plans proposed by him would have been carried into
effect, had not the proposals of the French Government for an international
system inclined the American Legislature to wait and watch the result of
the efforts made in Franco before initiating any radical changes in their

own Aveights and measures. The adoption of the metric system in America

does not seem to have been urged till very recently. During the early part
of the century that system was still an experiment in France, and by adopting
it the Americans would have sacrificed, what was then more important to
them than now, uniformity with England. But its inherent merits were so
great, and its ultimate success was becoming so probable, that, although
Mr. Jefferson in 1790 recommended the seconds pendulum as the standard

of measure, Mr. John Quincy Adams, to whom the matter was referred by
the Senate in 1817, and who reported in 1821 in probably the most ex-

haustive essay that has been written on the subject, advised a suspension of

all innovation at home until an international scheme could be adopted by
America in conjunction with foreign nations. Though Mr. Adams did not
recommend in so many words the adoption of the metric system, there is no
doubt that that was the system which he most admired. Indeed, in one re-

markable passage, he almost puts off the gravity of the statesman to anticipate

with rapturous enthusiasm the time when " the metre will surround the globe

in use as well as in multiplied extension, and one language of weights and

measures will be spoken from the equator to the poles.''
   The plan which he did recommend consisted of two parts, the principles

of which were
    1. To fix the standard with the partial uniformity of which it is sus-

ceptible, for the present excluding all innovation.

   2. To consult with foreign nations for the future and ultimate establish-
ment of universal and permanent uniformity.

   The first part of Mr. Adams's plan has been in a great degree accomplished.
I visited at Washington the building in which are deposited the standards of
the weights and measures of the United States, under the charge of J. E. Hil-
gard, who is now Acting Suprintendent of Weights and Measures in place
of Professor Bache. From this central office of Weights and Measures, full
sets of standards, including most beautiful and accurate balances, have been
furnished to all the States and Custom-hoiises of the country. Each State

Government in its turn directs the distribution of standards to its counties

and in States where the further subdivision of towns exists, as, for example,

in the State of New York, the authorities of each county are instructed by a

law of the States to provide each town with standard weights, measures, and
balances, and to compare them with the count}- standard once in every five

years.

    The office of Weights and Measures at Washington contains, moreover,
several copies of the metric standards which have been from time to time fur-
nished by the French Government. The first of these were sent to Congress
in 1795, being copies of the provisional metre and kilogram. The latest
addition was made in 1852, and consists of three different series:

   A1. standard metre of steel upon a bronze base and a standard Idlograra

              of brass gilt.

   A2. graduated brass metre and a litre, both by Gambey.
   A3. complete and valuable collection of the whole apparatus composing
UNIFOUMITY or WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.  357

            in France the assortment of a bureau of verification of weights and

            measures of the first order.
    It will be seen, therefore, that the ximerican Government has not only

brought its present system for the manufacture and distribution of its own

standards to a considerable degree of perfection, but is already amply pro-
vided with copies of the metric standards.

    With regard, however, to the second of Mr. Adams's suggestions, viz. " to
consult with foreign nations for the future and ultimate establishment of
universal and permanent uniformity," no progress has yet been made. The
subject has been commended to Congress on two occasions by Secretaries of
the Treasury ; in 1847 by the Hon. E. J. Walker, and in 1861 by Mr. Chase,
who is now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Scien-
tific men generally throughout the country had been for some time gradually
coming to the conclusion that the metric system was that which ought to be
adopted ; but it was not till the International Congresses, postal and sta-
tistical, held at Paris and Berlin in 1863, that the idea took a practical form.
The United States was represented at the Paris Postal Congress by the Hon.
J. A. Kasson, and at the Statistical Congress in Berlin by the Hon. S. B. Rug-
gles. Both these gentlemen were deeply impressed Avith the advantages of
the metric system. They participated in the strong resolutions adopted at both
these Congresses in favour of its general adoption ; and in December 1863
Mr. Ruggles forwarded to the Secretary of State a Eeport on the subject,

Debate in the House of Commons on the Metric BiU of 1863. This docu-

ment was republished by the State Government of New York at Albany in

1864, and was in such request that a further issue was required in 1865.
At the same time, the Legislature of the State of Connecticut (it is to be
remembered that only State Governments in America have to do with educa-
tion) had recommended to all its school officers that the metric system be

taught in the schools of the State.

  We must bear in mind that during the above period, from 1863 to 1865,

the civU war was raging, and it is therefore not surprising that the leading
American statesmen had little time to give to such matters as weights and
measures. Mr. Chase, however, had (in 1863) procured the appointment, by
the N'atioual Academy of Sciences, of a Committee on Weights, Measures,
and Coinage. This ISTational Academy of Sciences had been incorporated in
1863 by the Senate and House of Eeprcsentatives of the United States, and
consists of a body of not more than fifty scientific men, whose chief duty it
is, whenever called upon by any department of the Government, to " investi-
gate, examine, experiment, and report upon any siibject of science or art."
This Committee included all the most notable men of science in America who

--had given special attention to weights and measures. The members were as

follows : Joseph Henry, Chairman ; J. H. Alexander, Pairman Eogers,
Wolcott Gibbs, Arnold Guyot, Benjamin SUliman, Jun., William Chauvenet,
John Torrey, A. D. Bache, John Eodgers, L. M. Eutherfurd, Professor iJiew-
ton, Samuel B. Euggles, J. E. Hilgard.

    After a thorough investigation of the subject in January 1866, these
gentlemen reported shortly in favour of the authorization and encouragement
by Congress of the introduction and use of the metric system ; and with a
view to this it made three practical suggestions :

    1. The immediate manufacture and distribution to the Custom-houses and

States of metric standards of weights and measures.
           ----

358  >  .  --REPORT 1866.

   2. The introduction of the system into the Post-offices, by making a
single letter weigh 15 grammes, instead of 14-17 grammes or half an ounce.

   3. To cause the new cent and two-cent pieces to be so coined that they shall
weigh respectively 5 and 10 grammes, and that their diameter shall be made to

bear a determinate and simple ratio to the metric unit of length.

   Such were the recommendations which the National Academy of Sciences
forwarded to Congress in January last. The Report was at once referred to
a Standing Committee of the House of Eepresentatives on Weights, Measures,
and Coins, which had been wisely constituted at the beginning of the present
Congress to take cognizance of this important subject. This Committee was
constituted chiefly through the exertions of the Hon. J. A. Kasson, who

became its Chairman, and to his energy its prompt action is greatly due.

He obtained the assistance of Professor Newton, of Yale College, a well-
known man of science, as Clerk to the Committee ; and with his aid a Eeport
was prepared and printed in May last, which is well worthy of the attention

of all friends of the metric system.

    After examining at some length the whole subject of weights and measures
in the United States, Mr. Kasson's Eeport proceeds to demonstrate the
progress which is being made by the meti'ic system throughout the world.
With regard to the action of England, it declares that the course taken by

the House of Commons " must be regarded as evincing a deliberate intention
to introduce the meti'ic system into England, and as giving up any purpose
of creating a separate system founded upon the yard, the foot, or the inch,
and as paving the way for the ultimate exclusive adoption of the metric

system."

    The Report next points out and illustrates by Tables the inconveniences

and want of system of the weights and measvu'es now in use in America,
with all which we are sufficiently acquainted, and contrasts therewith the

order, simphcity, and perfect harmony of the metric plan.
    The Report pronounces strongly on several grounds against a change of

nomenclature, and after illustrating by a Table the somewhat astonishing
fact that of the total value of the imports and exports of the United States for
1860, which amounted in all to 762,000,000 dollars, the amount of nearly
700,000,000 doUars was with nations and their dependencies that have
now authorized or taken the preliminary steps to authorize the metric system,

 concludes as follows :

    Your Committee imanimousl}^ recommend the passage of the Bills and joint
Resolutions appended to this Report. They were not prepared to go, at this time,
beyond this stage of progress in the proposed reform. The metric system
 is already used in some arts and trades in this country, and is especially adapted to
the wants of others. Some of its measures are ah-eady manufactured at Bangor,
in Maine, to meet an existuig demand at home and abroad. The manufacturers of
the well-known Fairbanks scales state, "For many years we have had a large
 export demand for om* scales with French weights, and the demand and sale is
 constantly increasing." Its minute and exact divisions specially adapt it to the
 use of chemists, apothecaries, the finer operations of the artisan, and to aU scientilic
 objects. It has always been and is now used in the United States' coast survey*.
 Yet in some of the States, owing to the phraseology of their laws, it would be
 a direct violation of them to use it in the business transactions of the com-
 munitv. It is therefore very important to legalize its use, and give to the people,
 or that portion of them desiring it, the opportimity for its legal employment,
 while the knowledge of its characteristics will be thus diiiused among men.

     * I ascertained that the metric weights are in use in the Assaying Department of the

 U.S. Treasury at New York, and by analytical chemists generally throughout America.

Chambers of commerce, boards of trade, mauufactiiring associations, and other

vohmtary societies and individuals will be induced to consider and in their dis-

cretion to adopt its use. Tlie interests of trade among a people so quick as ours

to receive and adopt a useful novelty will soon acquaint practical men witii its

Whenconvenience.  this is attained (a period, it is hoped, not distant), a further

Act of Congress can fix the date for its exclusive adoption as a legal system. At

an earlier period it may be safely introduced into all public offices and for Govern-

ment service.

   In the schedule of equivalents provided in the Bill, extreme scientific accuracy
is not expressed. The reasons follow. The exact length of the meter in inches

and the weight of the kilogram in grains can of necessity be determined only

approximately. The most careful determinations of these quantities now possible

are liable to minute corrections hereafter as more numerous observations are made

and better instruments are used. Instead, therefore, of aiming at an accuracy

greater, perhaps, than is attainable, it is more expedient to consult the convenience

of the people by using the simplest numbers possible in the schedule, and yet such

as shall be in fact more nearly exact tlian can ever be demanded in the ordinary

business of life. These nmnbers are to be used in schools and in practical life

millions of times as umltipliers and divisors, and every unnecessary additional

figure is justly objectionable.

   In a popidar sense of the word, however, the numbers in the schedule may be
said to be exact. The length of the meter, for example, is given as 39-37 inches.
The mean of the best English and the best American detei-minatious dirters from

this only by about the amoimt by which the standard bar changes its length by a
change of one degree of temperature. Such accuracy is certainly suflicieut for

legal purposes and for popular use.
   The second measure recommended is a joint resolution, necessarily following the

adoption of the leading Bill, and provides for furnishing the standards, which will

thereby be required, to the several States.

   The third proposition is a Bill to authorize and provide for the use of the weight

of 15 grams in the Post-office, in conformity with the system adopted by that

department for foreign correspondence.

   The fourth is a Resolution looking to effective negotiation for a uniform coinage
among nations.

court, shall be deemed invalid, or liable to objection, because the weights or

measm-es expressed or referred to therein are weights or measm-es of the metric

system.

Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That the tables in the schedule hereto annexed

shall be recognized, in the construction of contracts, and in all legal proceedings,

as establishing in the terms of the weights and measures now in use in the LTnited

States, the equivalents of weights and measures expressed therein in tenns of

the metric system ; and said tables may be lawfully used for computing, deter-

mining, and expressing in customary weights and measures the weights and mea-

sm-es of the metric system.

The above Bills and Resolutions passed the House of Representatives with

little or no opposition. They are now before the Senate, which has referred

them to a Committee, of which the                                                                                                                            Hon.

his well-known and enlightened views on the subject encourage the hope

that, either in this session or next, the Senate will confirm the action of the

House of Representatives*.

   Such is the present position of the metric movement in the United States.
   I may add that the general piiblic in America seems inclined to receive the
new system favourably. Several of the leading ncwspai^ers have noticed it
in terms of welcome and commendation ; and it is notorious that the know-
ledge which all Americans possess of the great advantages of a decimal

system of coinage, render them hkely to appreciate all the more fully the

merits of the metric system of weights and measures.

   Nor are its promoters careless of advantages likely to result from the

spread of instruction on the details of the system in schools. I have already
mentioned its adoption as a part of education in the schools of Connecticut.

I was assured th.-^t it only needs that the permissive Bill be passed, for many

other States to follow the example of Connecticut.

In February last a large number of Professors, Presidents of Colleges, and

* Since this Report was put in type, news ha.s arrived that Mr. Sumner's Committee, on

the 16th of July, reported favourably the above Bills and Eesolutions, all without amend-
ment

others connected with education in the United States, issued an address to
editors and publishers of Arithmetics, urging

    1. That to the Arithmetics now pubhshed an appendix be at once added,

that shall contain a full explanation of the metric system of iveights aitd

measures, and of their relation to the weights and measures now in common

use, and that the whole be illustrated by suitable and numerous examples.

   2. That in every revised edition of Arithmetics now used, and in every

new Arithmetic, a projjer development of this system have a place in the
body of the work ; and that in examples for practice occurring thereafter,
there be frequent reference to these weights and measures.

    I learned that Messrs. Stoddard and Co., of jSTew York, were in June last
already engaged in introducing an explanation of the metric system into

--revised editions of Stoddard's Arithmetics an important series ; and I

further ascertained that the authors and publishers of at least three other
series of Arithmetics have promised similar introduction.

    I left Avith Professor Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution at
Washington, a copy of Bowling's Synoptic Table, which will be exhibited in

the Museum of the Institution ; and I doubt not thnt we shall soon hear of
similar Tables or charts of the metric system being made in America for the
use of schools. I have much pleasure in acknowledging Professor Henry's
courtesy in suggesting that any parcels which we wish to send to our friends
in America, may be sent free of expense through the Smithsonian Institution.

We shall certainly do well to supply them with copies of any miu-al standards,

school metres, or other appliances which may be devised for extending the

knowledge of the metric system. In the Report of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution for this year, which will shortly appear, and whicli is very widely
circulated, will be found Tables of equivalents of the metric and English
systems of weights and measures, compiled by Professor Newton.

   The first two pages of Mr. Kasson's Report are devoted to the question of
Coinage. Upon this subject the Committee makes no recommendation of a
specific nature beyond the joint resolution quoted above. It is therefore

singular that the first actual step in advance towards a practical adoption of

the metric system in the United States has been made through the Mint in

the following manner.

   In May last an Act was passed through the House of Representatives, on

the motion of the Hon. J. A. Kasson, and through the Senate, on the motion
of the Hon. John Sherman, which subsequently was signed by the President
and became law, authorizing the coinage of five-cent pieces of copper and
nickel in place of the paper five-cent currency then in circulation, and fixing
their weight at 77" 16 grains, equiponderant to .5 grams of the metric system.
The diameter of this coin was fixed at 20 millimetres, and they have already
been issued from the Mint in large qtiantities, so that every citizen of the

United States now carries in his pocket a weight and measure of the metric

system. AVhen the Bill authorizing the issue of this coin passed through

Congress, the Chamber of Commerce of New York at once held a meeting to

express its satisfaction, and unanimously voted thanks to Messrs. Kasson and
Sherman for their exertions in thus teaching the people by actual experience
the uses and value of the metric system.

   No better instance could be given than the above of the practical and
energetic manner in which the friends of the metric system in America are

taking up the subject. It is greatly to be hoped that our present Parliament
will not slacken its efforts in the dii'ection in which the last Parliament made

so good a beginning. I may mention, however, that oui- friends in America

find it difficult to understand how it has happened that, after the unanimous
Eeport of the Committee of the House of Commons in 1862, in favour of the

ultimate adoption of the Metric System of Weights and Measures, notliiug
has yet been done by our Government to make our people acquainted with
the details of that system by the distribution of Standards, and its introduc-
tion as a branch of education into schools aided by public money.

Report on the Exhihitlon of Weights, Measures, and Coins at the Universal
     Exhibition in Paris, 1867. Bi/ Professor Leone Levi, F.S.A., F.S.S.

--Gentxemen, In compliance with the desire of the Metric Committee of the

British Association and the Council of the International Decimal Associa-
tion, I proceeded to Paris to confer with M. Le Play, the Commi.ssaire-
General of the Universal Exhibition for 1867, with regard to the proposed
special exhibition of the Measures, Weights, and Coins of aU countries ; and
I have the pleasure to report that the utmost desire was shown to forward
the object in view, the same being quite in consonance with the design of
that Great Exhibition.

    Already had the Imperial Commission anticipated to some extent our
suggestions, since by decree of the 20th September I860, an International
Scientific Commission was constituted for the purpose of assisting in propa-
gating useful discoveries and promoting reforms of an international interest,
such as the adoption of the same weights and measures, of common scientific
units, &c., Mr. James Yates, F.E.S., Vice-President of the International
Association, having been nominated one of its members.

    In order to elicit an expression of opinion on the subject, and at the same time
to secure the concurrence of the Commissioners of different countries at the
time in Paris, M. Le Play summoned a preparatorj- Conference on the sub-

ject, which was held at the Palais de I'lndustrie on the 2nd of May, when the
proposal of holding such au Exhibition was fully considered and approved.

On my arrival in Paris, another meeting was held of the same Conference,

and both were attended by persons of great distinction belonging to France
and other countries. In the observations which I had the honour of making,
I showed the progress already made towards the uniformity of weights,
measures, and coins in diiferent countries, as well as what remains yet to be
done, and I concluded by suggesting

    First, a special Exhibition of Weights, Measures, and Coins of all

countries

    Secondly, the collection of all official documents and rejjorts bearing on
the qiiestion of uniformity

                                                                                                                     ;

    And, thirdly, the holding an Inteinational Conference at the time of such
an Exhibition to consider the weights, measures, and coins exhibited by all
countries, and the documents referring to the same, and to prepare a report
on the best means of attaining the desired uniformity as speedily as possible.

    M. Le Play, representing the Imperial Commissioners, gave his complete
sanction to the proposal ; and he suggested that a smaU Committee from the
Scientific Commission should be appointed by the President of the Imperial
Commission to promote the object, the same to be afterwards enlarged by
364' REPORT-- 1866.

the addition of foreign members to be nominated by the Exhibition Commis-

sioners in different countries, each nation contributing to bear a proportional

share of any expense, which, ho-\vever, coukl not be great.

In accordance, therefore, with the suggestion jn'omulgated by the Metric

Committee and the International Association, and with the resolutions

adopted by the Conferences held at the Palais de I'Industrie, an ordinance on

the subject was issued by the President of the Imperial Commission on the

2nd of June last, which appropriated a space in the Palace for tke exhi-

bition of measures, weights, and coins of all countries, and appointed a

Special Committee from the Scientific Commission to preside over this par-

ticular Exhibition.

The Committee thus formed, of which I have the honour of being a mem-

myber, held its first meeting during  stay in Paris, when, after organizinag

oiirselves by nominating our senior member, M. Mathieu, of the Bureau

des Longitudes, President, and Messrs. Baudrillart and Becquerel, Secretaries,

we prepared a circular to be sent to the Commissioners appointed in all

countries for the Universal Exhibition, communicating to them a copy of

the ordinance of the Minister of State and the minutes of the Conferences

held in the Palais de I'Industrie, and inviting their cooi)eration on the

subject. An important step has thus been taken which will, I trust, greatly

stimulate the object we have at heart, viz. the adoption of the same system

of measures, weights, and coins in all countries.

   Permit me now to add that, having regard to the part taken by the

Metric Committee of the British Association and the International Decimal

Association in suggesting such an Exhibition, it is much to be desired that

we should do our utmost in assisting the International Committee in the

attainment of the object. The Poyal Commissioners for the Exhibition of

1867, of which His Eoyal Highness the Prince of Wales is Chairman, T\dU

be invited to send to that Exhibition a copy of all the weights and measures

legal in this country, and two collections of the current coins of the realm.

I trust the Metric Committee of the British Association and the Council of the

International Association wiU commend the subject to the attention of the

British Commission, and so secure their compliance with the request.

In the name of the International Decimal Association, I have promised

that the collection of weights and measures made for the International Ex-

hibition of 1862, and deposited in the Kensington Museum, shall be placed

at the disposal of the International Committee for the purpose, and upon

this also it will be necessary to communicate with the authorities of the

Kensington Museum.

Still more important, however, is the nomination of delegates to take part

in the great Conference ^^'hich will be held at the time of the Exhibition.

This Conference should consist of men able to study the objects and docu-

ments there exhibited from a scientific and practical point of view ; and it

is most important that the two scientific Associations, to whom I have the

honour to address myself, should communicate with Her Majesty's Govern-

ment, soliciting them to appoint official representatives to the same Confer-

ence from the Mint and the Board of Trade, and that you should also write

to the Chambers of Commerce in the United Kingdom, showing the prac-

tical advantage of their responding in due time to the invitation of the

International Committee by appointing delegates to the same Conference.

The Council of the International Decimal Association may also appeal to its

Y ice-Presidents in all countries, soliciting their good offices with their

respective Governments, with a view to secure their cooperation in pro-
                --

moting the proposed Exhibition, and appointing official delegates to the

Conference.

  My best thanks are due to M. Le Play for his kindness towards me during
my visit to Paris, and I should fail in my duty were I not to acknowledge

with gratitude the care and interest shown by M. De Chancourtois in the

promotion of the object of my mission to that great metropolis.

                               I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,

                                                              Your obedient Servant,

Report on the Mural Standard. By James Yates, FM.S.

I TAKE up the account of the Mural Standard, exhibiting in immediate
apposition the Yard and the Metre with their divisions, where I laid it down
last year at Birmingham*.

The want of Mural Standards of the linear measures has been shown qn

the authority,

   1st, of the Commissioners for the restoration of the Standards, whose
Eeport, with the evidence, was published by order of Parhament in 1841

(see pp. 16, 17)

2ndly, of G. B. Airy, Astronomer-Eoyal, in his letter to Lord Monteagle,

Comptroller of the Exchequer, dated Eeb. 1st, 1859
                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

    Srdly, of Lord Monteagle himself, in his letter transmitting that of Pro-

fessor Airy to the Secretary of State for the Home Department (see Appendix

to the Eeport quoted below)
                                                                                                                             ;

   4thly, of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Weights and
Measures, a.d. 1862 (see their Eeport, p. ix).

These Commissioners and public officers all conciu- in advising that Mural

Standards of length should be exhibited in public places, where they may be

accessible to the people generally. But, although this subject has been
earnestly and repeatedly recommended to the attention of the Government,
and although the advice so given is agreeable to the general practice of
civilized nations both in Europe and America, yet nothing has been done by
our Government to give effect to these recommendations.

   Parliament has, however, passed a law, which received the Eoyal Assent

on the 6th instant, and which may be regarded as a first step. The Select
Committee of the House of Commons, to which I have alluded, adopted
(a.d. 1862) a series of Eecommendations, one of which was, " that a De-

partment of Weights and Measures be established in connexion with the

Board of Trade." This has been done by the Standards of Weights, Mea-

sures, and Coinage Act, 1866, Sections 1, 10, 11, 12. But much remains

to be done, and Mr. Ewart, the Chairman of the before-mentioned Select

Committee, has accordingly given notice of a motion next Session to re-
appoint the Committee with a view to facilitate the introduction into this

country of the Metric System of Weights and Measures. The task imposed

on the Comnrittee will be no less arduous than that Avhich they executed

with such distinguished success in the spring of 1862. It will be the duty

of those who are friendly to this great improvement to avail themselves of

the interval by collecting all kinds of evidence, which may guide the Com-

mittee in their determinations                                                                                                        and we trust that they will continue to act in
                                                                                                                                   ;

the same liberal and enlightened spirit, and in conjunction with the many

able and excellent men, in both Houses of ParUamout, whether in or out of

office, who now combine their eflbrts in the same direction. The extensive
exhibition and use of our Mural Standard will, as we may confidently anti-

cinate, be among the principal means of accomplishing the object.
  "The Committee of the British Association, soon after its appointment,

thought it desirable to appply for advice and assistance to the Chemical

Society, which includes many of the most eminent chemists and metallur-
gists in the kingdom. Their application was granted in the kindest manner

by the President of the Society, Dr. William Allen Miller, the Secretary,
Dr. Odling, and the other members of the Council. The subject was brought
before the Society at two of its meetings, and the result was a very important

change in the course of proceeding. Professor Frankland advised that,

instead of Baily's metal, or any other metallic substance, either simple or
compound, the Mural Standard should be made of white glazed porcelain.

The question was carefully considered, more especially in regard to the

durability of porcelain, and its susceptibility of changes by expansion and

contraction. With regard to durability, we know from innumerable exam-

})lcs that porcelain Avill last for hundreds of years without any perceptible

Wedecay.  also know that it is very little subject to expansion and con-

traction from the changes of atmospheric temperature. But it is also well

known that all objects made of clay contract by exposure to great heat.

How could we pass our porcelain Standard through the ordeal of a fur-

nace without destroying the dimensions marked upon it? In this diffi-

culty we were fortunate in obtaining the assistance of Mr. Casella, Philoso-
phical Instrument Maker to the Board of Ordnance. This gentleman, whose

business makes him familiar with works of this particular description, instituted

a series of experiments, which proved that a slab of porcelain after completion
contracts visibly on its reexposure to a great heat, but that, if the heat be

sufficiently intense and sufficiently long continued, an adequate security will

be obtained against future change. Consequently a slab may be prepared by

firing at fii'st, and then have the lines etched in with hydrofluoric acid, the
figures and letters painted with enamel, the lines rubbed in with the same,
and then the lines, figures, and letters all burnt in, after which treatment it

will not shrink at all. Having obtained so satisfactory a result, the Com-

mittee desired Mr. Casella to proceed with his work.

   The Committee have seen no reason to make any important change in the
form and dimensions of the instrument. These remain nearly as they were
sho^vn to the Statistical Section of the British Association at Birmingham. But,

as the Yard was then placed in close contact with the Metro, a question arose
whether the two measures might not be more clearly distinguished from
each other ; and to effect this it was proposed that the Yard should be marked
in red lines and the Metre in blue. This suggestion was adopted, and the
instrument, thus completed, is thought to be elegant and attractive as well
as clear and distinct. If, however, any ]x>rsons prefer having it marked

with black lines this may be done.

    It was requisite that the divisions should be so exact that no inaccuracy
could be perceived either by the sight or the touch. This has been accom-
j)hshed by our artist, who obtained from M. Perreaux, of Paris, one of his

beautiful dividing instruments, which is so constructed as to divide, if le-
quired, to the 500th part of a millimetre, a length far more diminutive than
can ever be found necessary. About the tenth of a miUimetrc is sufficient

to answer every useful purpose.

                                                                                   I

   Besides showing the name of the maker on each instrument as a voucher
for its accuracy, the Committee hope to obtain the stamp of the Government
as directed by Act of Parliament. But as the stamp could not be impressed
on the porcelain, a number will be marked and burnt on every instnunent,
and the same number with the Government stamp will be impressed on the

frame.

   The price cannot be at present determined. "We can only say that it

will not exceed £5 5s. ^iVhen the demand is sufficient the price may be

lowered.

   Whilst Mr. Casella has been employed upon our Mural Standard, a Bir-
mingham artist, Mr. Gargory, who piu'sues the same line of business, has

produced an instrument which may be called a School Metre, being espe-
cially adapted for school use. It is made of wood and ivory. It shows the

Metre together with the Yard, both Long and Cloth Measure, the principles
of its construction being generall}' the same with those of the Mural Stan-

dard. Its price will be about 7*'.

   The sum of £50 voted by the British Association at Birmingham having

been expended, it will be necessary to ask for a further grant. If the
General Committee of the Association should think it proper to send copies
of the Mural Standard to aU the places where the Association has met, or
even to a considerable number of them, a grant of =£100 -n-ill not be too

much ; and it may be deserving of consideration, that if philosophers, who
are proverbially poor, can afford such a sum as .£100, the Lords of Her
Majesty's Treasury, who have hitherto expended nothing on this great and
indispensable public provision, need not grudge any amount which may be

found requisite.

An Account of Meteorological and Physical Observations in Three

   Balloon Ascents made in the years 1865 and 1866 {in continuation
   of twenty -five made in the years 1862, 1863, and 1864), under the
    auspices of the Committee of the British Association for the Advance-
   ment of Science, by James Glaisher, F.R.S., at the request of the
   Committee, consisting of Colonel Sykes, The Astronomer Eoyal,
   Lord Wrottesley, Sir D. Brewster, Sir J. Herschel, Bart., Dr.
   Lloy'd, Dr. Robinson, Mr. Glaisher, Mr. Gassiot, Prof. Ty^ndall,

   Dr. Fairbairn, and Dr. W. A. Miller.

At the first appointment of the Balloon Committee it was charged with the

determination of the law of the decrease of temperature with increase of ele-
vation, as the primary object of research ; and some two years since this law
seemed to have been pretty well determined, but up to that time the experi-

ments had been, for the most part, made in the months of summer and du-
ring the hours of afternoon. The principal duty of the Committee was
the verification of the results then found, by including experiments at other
times of the day, and at other seasons of the year. It was expected that
this part of the work to be done by the balloon would have been completed.
In carrying out these experiments, it was found that those taken in the morn-

ing hours did not accord with those taken in the afternoon hours, nor did
those taken at one time of the year agree with those taken at other times of
the year. Tn the course of these experiments an accidental descent just at

the time of sunset showed very little or no difference of temperature for a
height of nearly half a mile. The question then arose as to whether it was
possible that at night the temperature might increase with elevation, and
not decrease as always heretofore had been considered, and acted upon when-
ever such entered into physical investigation.

   The Committee last year therefore was reappointed with special reference
to night observations at any time of the year made within a moderate distance
of the earth. To make day observations, in winter and the adjacent
months at any hour in the day; in summer to be made in the morning,

only the subject of temperature to be considered as of the first importance,

with any other of the usual experiments which might be possible. Up to

the Meeting at Birmingham twenty-five ascents had been made, of which
seventeen had been made iu the months of June, July, August, and September,
but not one in May, and mostly during the hours of afternoon.

                                  § 1. Insteuments and Apparatus.

   The instruments were of the same construction as those iised in the previ-
ous experiments ; in addition well-made miners' lamps were used to illumi-

nate the instruments at night.

                                    § 2. Observing Areangesients.

   The instruments were in all cases placed on suitable framework, attached
to the outside of the car, and sufficiently protected from all effects of radiation.

                Circumstances of the Ascents, and General Observations.

  --Ascent from Woohvkh Arsenal, October 2, 1SG5. The first ascent after the

Meeting at Birmingham was made on October 2nd. The balloon used was

that of Mr. Orton, of BlackwaU.

   When the sun had set for nearly three-quarters of an hour and night had

fairly set in, the moon shining brightly, and the sky free from cloud, the

balloon left Woolwich Arsenal at 6'' 20"', the temperature at the time being
56°. Within three or four minutes a height of 900 feet was reached, and till

this time I failed in directing the light of the Davy lamp properly. When I

succeeded the temperature was 57° and increasing; on reaching 1200 feet
high it had increased to 58°-9 ; we then descended to 900 feet, and the tem-
perature decreased to 57°*8 ; on turning to ascend again the temperature in-
creased to 59°- G at 1900 feet high, being 3|° warmer than when the earth

was left. On descending again the temperature decreased to 57^° at the

height of 600 feet, and in the several subsequent ascensions and descensions
the temperature increased with elevation, and decreased on approaching the

earth. On every occasion the highest temperature was met with at the

hio-hest point. This result was remarkable indeed. The difterent degrees of
the humidity of the air met with in this ascent are no less remarkable.
Considering saturated air as represented by 100, at the commencement of
the ascent in the balloon it was 95 ; at Greenwich Observatory it was 84
towards the end of the ascent in the balloon it was 85, and at Greenwich was
97. The state of things was reversed, and would indicate that the water in
the air had fallen. Its amount at the beginning of the ascent was 5| grains
in a cubic foot of air, and at the same elevation was 4| grains in the same

mass of air at the end of the ascent.
    The readings of the instruments were taken very slowly, owing to the dif-

ficulty experienced in directing the light properly. I failed in all magnetic
experiments, and indeed in nearly all but those relating to temperature and

                                                                                      i
                                                                                  ;

humidity. Two self-registering minimum thermometers were tied down, one

with its bulb resting on cotton-wool, fully exposed to the sky, and the other

with its bulb projecting beyond the supporting frame ; their indexes were at
the end of theii- columns of spirit on starting, or at 56°. At every examination

of each of these instruments a space was found between its index (which re-
mained unmoved) and the end of the column of spirit, indicating a temperature

higher than before leaving, and it was closely approximate at all times to the

temperature of the air. Consequently, notwithstanding the clearness of the

sky, the loss of heat by radiation must have been small. No ozone was shown

at the Eoyal Observatory, but in the balloon paper tests were coloured to 4,
on a scale of greatest intensity being considered 10.

   At the early part of this ascent I was wholly occupied with the instruments,
and when at the height of about 1000 feet, the view which suddenly opened

far exceeds description. Almost immediately under, but a little to the south-

east, was Woolwich ; north was Blackwall ; south, Greenwich and Deptford

--and west, as far as the eye could reach, was London the whole forming a

starry spectacle of such brilliancy as far to exceed anything I ever saw.

When I have been at this elevation in the evening, at a distance from Lon-

don, it has had the appearance of a vast conflagration, but on this night the

au- was so clear and free from haze that each and every light was distinct,
and apparently all but touching each other.

The whole of Woolwich, Blackwall, Deptford, and Greenwich could be

traced as a perfect model by the line of lights of their streets and squares.

In nine minutes we were opposite Brunswick Pier, Blackwall, crossing the

Thames, then passed across the Isle of Dogs, Greenwich Keach, and so up

the Eiver Thames. As we advanced towards London, the mass of illumina-

tion increased in intensity. At 6'' 42TM the South-Eastern Eailway Terminus

at London Bridge was directly under us ; looking southward at this time we
saw the Borough stretching far away, and the many streets shooting from it,

particularly Southwark Street, with its graceful curve of lamps. In one

minute more we were over Southwark Bridge, 1300 feet high, passed Black-

friars Bridge at 6^ 45TM, and Charing Cross at 6^ 47TM.

 --On leaving Charing Cross I looked back over London, the model of which

could be seen and traced its squares by their lights, the river, which looked

dark and dull, by the double row of curved lights on every bridge spanning it.

Looking round, two of the illuminated dials of Westminster clock were like

two dull moons. Again, looking eastward, the whole Hues of Commercial and

Whitechapel Roads, with their continuations through Holborn to Oxford Street,

Wewere visible, and most brilliant and remarkable.  were at such a distance

from Commercial Road that it appeared like a line of brilliant fire, assuming a
more imposing appearance when the line separated into two, and most impo-

sing just under in Oxford Street. Here the two thiclcly studded rows of bril-

liant lights were seen on either side of the street, with a narrow dark space

between, but which dark space was bounded, as it were, on both sides by a

bright fringe like frosted silver. At first I could not account for this appear-

ance ; but presently, at one point more brilliant than the rest, persons were

seen passing, their shadows being thrown on the pavement, and at once it was

evident this rich effect was caused by the bright illumination of the shop

lights on the pavements.

I feel it impossible to convey any adequate idea of the brilUant effect of

London, viewed at an elevation of 1300 feet, on a clear night, when the air is

free from mist.

   It seemed to me to realize a wish 1 have felt when looking through a tele-
scope at portions of the MUky Way, when the field of view appeared covered

with gold-dust, to be possessed of the power to see those minute spots of light
as brilliant stars, for certaioly the intense brilliancy of London this night must

have rivalled such a view.

  We were over the Marble Arch at 6^ 51"*, about eleven miles in a straight line
Wefrom Woolwich, which distance had been passed in about half an hour.

therefore were travelling at more than twenty miles per hour. On passing

onwards we left the Edgeware Eoad on our right, and the Great Western

Railway on our left, and passed nearly down the HaiTOw Road. In six or

seven minutes we left the suburbs of London, passing over Middlesex in the

direction of Uxbridge ; there the contrast was great indeed ; not a single ob-
ject could anywhere be seen, not a sound reached the ear; the roar of Lon-

don was entirely lost. The moon was shining, but seemed to give no light
and the earth could not be seen. After a time the moon seemed to shine with

increased brightness ; the fields gradually came into view, then the shadow of
the balloon on the earth was seen distinctly pointing out our path, v/hich, by

reference to the pole-star and the moon, became well known. After this oc-

casional masses of lights appeared as we passed over towns and villages. Thus

we passed out of Middlesex, over parts of Buckinghamshire and Berkshire, to

Higlimoor, in Oxfordshire, where we descended on the farm of Mr. Reeves at

S'' 20'", distant about 45 mUes from Woolwich. The horizontal movement of

the air at Greenwich in the same time was registered as 3 6 miles.

   Unfortunately, Mr. Orton believed we were near the sea, and, notwithstand-

ing my assertions and assurances to the contrary, he suddenly brought the

lialloon to the groimd, and broke nearly all the instruments ; the lamp was

lost, but an offered reward brought it to me a fortnight afterwards in a very

battered condition.

   The results of this first night experiment are very valuable ; and, so far as
one experiment can give, indicate that, on a clear night, the temperature, up

to a certain elevation, increases with increase of elevation.

 --Ascent from Woolwich Arsenal, December 2, 1865. The weather during

the month of November was too boisterous to attempt an ascent at night, and

no opportunity presented itself till December 2; This day was cloudless, and

held out the prospect of a clear sky at night.

The balloon was filled, and it was ready before siinset ; for some time after

this it continued clear, but suddenly became overcast, obscuring the moon.

When the sun had set nearly 2| hoiu's, we left Woolmch, Mr. Orton taking

charge of the balloon. The temperature of the air just before leaving was

38i°,  at  1400 feet  high  it  decreased  2°                                                                      unlike  the  previous  ascent,  the lowest
                                                          :

temperature was always at the highest point, and the highest was at the

lowest point of every ascent and descent, of which there were several instances

at the highest point reached ; when nearly one mile high the temperature
was 27°, being 11° colder than when we left the earth, one hour and a half

before ; we then descended with the view of ascending again still higher,
when unfortunately, at tlie height of 2400 feet, the lamp was thrown down

by a jerk of the balloon,       and went out                                                                       just before this  the  temperature was
                                                                                                                ;

32|°. On losing the light we continued the descent to the earth.

    Pilot balloons started shortly before leaving, having inchoated the lower

current of air as S.E., and the upper nearly W. On leaving Woolwich we
passed over Stratford, Tottenham, St. Albans, towards Triug ; when here wo

considered ourselves high enough to venture out of the lower current, and on.

doing so, at the height of 3000 feet, we changed our direction, and moved

with some W. in the wind ; on descending again to the same level we fell in

with the S.E. current.

   During the whole ascent the sky was covered with cloud, and we neither

saw the moon, nor could distinguish her place in the heavens, and we had to

depend on the compass entirely for a knowledge of the course we were taking.

This we could readily do ; for although the sky was uniformly covered with
cloud, with very many detached clouds helow us, some of which were very

near the earth, yet when no cloud was directly under us, the boundary of

every field was clearly visible, even at the height of one mile. By carefully

noting the angle and direction our course made with edges of the field, we

determined the direction we were moving. Thus guided we kept in the

lower current till we passed so far inland as to be safe from the sea, towards

which the upper current would have taken us. The results of this night'S'

experiments difi'er frota those taken on October 2, liy showing a small de-

crease of temperature with increasing elevation. They were made, however,

entirely under the cloud ; for at our highest point the cloud was uniformly

dense, and situated far above us.

In our course we passed a little north of London, but, owing to a cloitd of

less elevation than 1000 feet between us and London, we did not see a single'

light, or anything of London, forming a great contrast to the experience of

the previous ascent.

Arrangements were made for ascents at night in January and February,

and for several months the balloon was kindly stored at night at "Woolwich

for the use of the Committee ; but my health failed, and for many months I

--was too unwell to attempt an ascent at night, and thus passed tiU April.
   Ascent from Windsor, May 29, 1866. I have abeady said that no ascents

had been made in May; Mr. Westcar, of the Royal Horse Guards, then

stationed at Windsor, kindly offered the use of his balloon, and arrange-

ments were made at different times in May, but, as is usual, some fruitless

attempts were made.

On the 29th of May the balloon was filled early in the afternoon and left

at 6'' 14"", about an hour and three-quarters before sunset, in the hope of being

able to remain in the air for as long after sunset as possible.

The temperature of the air at this time was 58°, and was 58|° at Green-

wich Observatory. It at once declined to 55° at 1200 feet, and to 43° be-

tween the height of 3600 to 4600 feet, then further declining to 29|° at the

height of 6200 feet, at 7"^ 17". On turning to descend, the temperature

increased, but not uniformly, to 54° at S*" 9"", at 380 feet above the sea,

but very nearly touching the tops of the trees, being about 3° of less tem-

perature when at the same height above the sea on rising. Our object was to

be as near the earth as possible at the time of sunset, and having seen him set

Weto discharge sand so quickly as to make him to rise in the west.  did not

succeed. At the time of sunset we were about 600 feet high, but directly

passed over a hill, and on passing the ridge, the balloon was sucked down and,

it was only by a very free discharge of sand that Mr. Westcar prevented the

Weballoon coming to the ground.    then again started upon a second ascent,

to be as like the one we had just completed as we could make it. At S** 9'"

the temperature was 54°. Again the temperature declined, but somewhat

less rapidly than before. On again reaching one mile the temperature had

declined to 39°, and on reaching the height of 6200 feet (the same elevation

as we were three-quarters of an hour before simset), the sun having set

                                                                2b2
                                                                           ;;

--372 REPORT 1866.

nearly twenty minutes, the temperature was 35°, or about 6° warmer than
when at the same elevation something more than one hour before. On turn-
ing to descend, the temperature changed very little, it being 35° to 36° for a
thousand feet downwards. It increased to 37° at 4500, to 47° at 1500, and

to 54° at 900 feet ; but here the increase was checked, and at 600 feet the

temperature was 52|° ; on ascending a little again the temperatiu'e increased,
and decreased on descending, and was 50^° on the ground at a spot 300 feet
above the sea, at half-past eight o'clock. At Greenwich at this time the

temperature of the air was 52°.
   At the time of leaving the earth at 6'' 14TM the air at Greenwich had but three

grains of moisture in a cubic foot. At AVindsor, near the Thames, there were

4| grains ; the air was damp : on ascending the air at first became drier
but at the height of one mile was saturated, and was very nearly saturated at

the same height after sunset.
   Thus this double ascent enables us to compare the temperatures of the same

elevations, just before and just after sunset on the same daj", and to estimate

the amount of heat radiated from the earth at about the time of sunset.
   At heights exceechng 2000 feet the direction of the wind was N. by "W.

at the height of one mile the au- was nearly calm ; and at heights less than
2000 feet it was N. by E., and these cm-rents were met with always at those

elevations.

   At all times during the ascent, whenever the sun shone upon a transparent
bulb, or a dull blackened bulb thermometer, the reading was a very little
in excess of the reading of a shaded bulb, and was frequently the same even

when the sun's heat felt sensibly warm to ourselves.

   The path of the balloon from Windsor was over Windsor Great Park
nearly over AVoking at 7'' 43TM ; a little west of Guildford, approaching the
coast, at half-past nine, we calculated that the sea must be near, and we

descended at a place five mUes south of Pulborough.

  My attention was almost wholly occupied with the observations, Mr. "West-

car's was chiefly with the management of the balloon, frequently, however,
reading the several instruments, particularly those whose bulbs were exposed

to the sun's rays.

The safety lamp was burning all the time, thus enabling the instruments to

be read after dark.

I till recently believed that this was the first ascent for scientific purposes

since that of Biot and Gay-Lussac in 1804, in which the management of the

balloon was undertaken by the experimentalists themselves. But I find I am

Myin error in this respect.   friend L'Abbe iloigno tells me jthat Messrs. Bixio

and Barrel, in the year 1850, took the entire management of the balloon in

their own hands.
   On descending one hour and a half nearly after sunset, there was no one

near to assist us to empty the balloon and to pack it. This we had to do

ourselves, and were preparing to pass the night in the car of the baUoon,

when towards midnight a shepherd came to attend sheep, and we passed the

night in his cottage at the distance of half a mile, leaving the balloon, &c. in

the fields till the morning.

    This is the last ascent of which I have to speak. I regret that I have not

been able to report upon others, but it is all I have possibly been able to make

in the year.

   From aU the experiments made it would seem that the decrease of tempe-

rature with increase of elevation is variable throughout the day, and variable
--

in the different seasons of the year ; that at about snnset the temperature
varies but very little for a height of 2000 feet ; that at night with a clear sky,
from the only experiment made, the temperature increases with increase of

elevation ; that at night with a cloudy sky there was a small increase of tem-

peratm-e as the height increased ; that in the double ascent on May 29, the

one just before sunset and the other after, it would seem that after radiation
is set in the heat passes upwards till arrested, where the air is saturated with

vapour, when a heat greater by 5° was experienced after sunset than at the
same elevation before sunset.

   Two years ago, when I exhibited the mean results of the experiments then
discussed, I did so with much confidence, and thought all that then was needed

·was to verify the results exhibited. jS'ow, with increased knowledge, I speak

very differently, believing that many more experiments are necessary, and

that they should not be confined to this countiy.

    Certain it is, from the very remarkable results obtained from the night
ascents, which might, with sufficient number of observations, have important
bearing both on the theory of astronomic refraction and on the theory of heat,
that nocturnal observations deserve repetition and extension,

                      § 3. Desceiption op the Table of Observations.

    All the meteorological observations taken during the ascents are contained
in Table I.

   Column 1 contains the times at which the observations were made. Column
2 contains observations of the barometer corrected for temperature and index
error. Column 3 contains the height above the level of the sea, as deduced
from the barometric readings in column 2, by the formula of Bailey, checked
at intervals by that of Laplace, which is as follows :

Z=log(|)x60159(l+^i^)(l + 0-002837cos2L)(l+yg|§^^

where Z is the height required, and h, h', t and t' the height of the barometer,
corrected for temperature, and the temperature of the air at the lower and

upper stations respectively, L the latitude. The temperature of the air for the

position of the balloon has been derived from the readings in column 4.
Columns 5 to 7 contain the observations with wet-bulb thermometer, its
depression beiow the readings of the dry-bulb, and the deduced dew-point.

   The Astronomer Royal had observations made every ten minutes at the
Eoyal Observatory, Green-ndch, on the days of ascent, by Mr. Nash of the
Magnctical and Meteorological Department.

   The height of Greenwich barometer cistern above the mean sea-level is 159

feet.

These mean values at the mean height were laid down on a diagram ; all these
points were joined, and a curved line was drawn through, or near them, so

that the areas of the space between the original and the adopted lines on one
side were equal to those of the spaces on the other side. The curve thus
formed was assumed to he the curve of temperature freed from local
disturbance, and that it was assumed that the deviations of the original cui've
indicated the places and the amount of disturbance.

   The next step was reading from these curves the temperature at every
100 feet, and in this way the next Tables were formed.

   The niunbers in the first column show the height in feet, beginning from
the ground and increasing upwards ; the numbers in the second column show

the interval of time in ascending to the highest point ; the notes in the third

column show the circumstances of the observations ; the numbers in the fourth
and fifth columns, the observations and the approximate true temperatures of
the air, and those in the next column the difference between the two
preceding columns, or the most probable effect of local disturbing causes.

   The next group of columns are arranged similarly for the descent, and the

other groups, on May 29, for the second ascent and second descent.

       drawn through the observed temperatures, and as read off the curve of

        temperature.

1800 feet, the sky heing cloudy as seen from here, and the air was misty. In

the next 100 feet the temperature decUned 0°-2, and as much as l^-i in the
succeeding 100 feet ; the temperature then dechned slowly to 34° at 2600 feet,

the clouds being at a lower elevation : the decline of temperature continued

to the height of 4000 feet, where it was 271°, and there was very little change

in the next 600 feet. On descending, the temperature slowly and steadily
increased to 32°-4 at the height of 2500 feet, when the light was accidentally

extinguished, and no more observations could be made.

   The temperature of thu air declined from 5S°'0 on the ground to 52° at
2000 feet, and somewhat more rapidly to 4(P~ at ."5000 feet ; it increased to
4S^-7, or by 2° in the next 40(1 feet, and then gradnnlly declined to 2U°-8 at
the height of 620l» feet. On descending:, the temperature increased £i:radually
to -iS°-3 at 1000 feet, and then much more rapidly to 5n°-() at the height of
500 feet : this rapid increase was remarkable. On turning to ascend the sun
having set, the temperature declined pretty e(iually to the height of 4000
feet, and at greater heights, with somewhat less regularity, to 34° at GOOO
feet, when the temperature increased to ;55°-3 at the height of G400 f( et
this increase was very remarkable. On descending again, the temperature
increased with moderate regiilarity to 48°- 7 at the height of 1300 feet, and
then ^^'ith much greater rapidity to 53°-8 at the height of GOO feet, A\hen
the increase was arrested, and the temperature at lower elevations rajiidly

doclined, on approaching the earth, to r>u°-\. 'Jliis decli)ic uf temperature

from Gi»0 feet is remarkable. Ey conqjaring the readings at tlie same heights

before and after sunset, it will be seen tliat at the height of GiXM) loet, the
temperature was from .3° to 0° warmer after sunset than it A^as before sunset,
and that tlu' (emperatures on the ground, and at liHiO feet high, were nearh'

the same, whilst at intermediate heiglits llicy were much higher.

^UjrcsT immediately after the appointment of the Committee, intelligence was

received in England of the very important discovery by Mr. George Clark, of

Mahebourg, in Mauritius, of a large deposit of bones of the true Dodo {Dklus

hieptus), in a marsh known as the « Mare aux Songcs,' an accoimt of which

that gentleman has published in 'The Ibis' Magazine for April 1866.

Several fine series of these bones having been sent to England, some were

purchased by the Trustees of the British Museum, and formed the subject

of a memoir " On the Osteology of the Dodo," read by Professor Owen at a

meeting oi the Zoological Society of London, 9th January, 1866. This
memoir is understood to be nearly ready for publication, and will appear,

copiously illustrated, in the ' Transactions ' of that Society. Some other tine

series of these bones have, by the liberality of Mr. Clark, passed into the

possession of one of the members of your Committee ; and a portion of them
is now exhibited. Several smaller series of bones have likewise been vari-

ously distributed by sale or gift both in England and on the Continent, so that

numerous Museums (one of these smaller series forms the subject of some

" Remarques " communicated to the Academv of Sciences of Paris, 23rd April,

402 REPORT--1866.

1866, by M. Ali^honse Milne-Edwards) and collections have reaped the benefit

of Mr. Clark's valuable discovery, the importance of which may be better

appreciated when it is remembered that previously the only remains of the
Dodo known to naturalists were the head and foot at Oxford, the skull at

Copenhagen, the portion of an upper mandible at Prague, and the foot in the

British Museum. Now it is believed that every bone of the bird's skeleton

has been recovered, with the exception (though that is an important excep-

tion) of the extremity of the wing.

The attention of Mr. Edward Ifewton has been especially called to this

deficiency, which seems likely to be supplied by a thorough and systematic

exajuination of the Mare aux Songes, or at least the part of it which has been

most prolific in Dodos' bones. That gentleman has accordingly determined

to carry out this undertaking as far as may be expedient ; but according to

the latest accounts received from him, he had been obliged to defer com-

mencing operations in this quarter till the expiration of the rainy season, as

the marsh stUl continued to hold much water, and he expected to be able to

do no real good there until next month, when the Committee hope that com-                                I

plete success may attend his excavations.

The collection of bones formed in Rodriguez last year by Mr. George Jen-

ner, and sent home by Mr, Edward Newton (as stated in the communication

made by that gentleman to this Section at Birmingham) arrived safely in

England in the course of the autumn ; and the majority of them proved to

belong to the Solitaire or Dodo, peculiar to that island {Pezophaps solitaria).

They were exhibited at a meeting of the Zoological Society, 23rd November,

1866 ; and a select series of specimens from them is now produced, among

--which are several that were previously unknown such as the proximal end

of the tibia, portions of the pelvis and coracoid, the ulna, radius, and phalanx.

Mr. Edward Newton has been very desii-ous of completing the exploration

of the caves in Bodriguez, in the hope of finding the remaining portions of

the Solitaire's skeleton ; but communications between that island and Mauri-

tius being suspended for a large portion of the year, and when existing, being

uncertain, the difficulties in the way of carrying out his design were much

increased. At last, after long delay, he was informed that labourers were

so scarce in Bodriguez that the necessary assistance was not to be obtained

for making excavations there. To meet this new and imexpected difficulty

he was compelled to hire men in Mauritius and send them to Bodriguez,

under engagement for the express purpose of digging in the caves. The

Committee trust that the best results may follow this mission.

Bourbon or Re'union, the third of the Mascarene Islands, which is known

to have formerly possessed a Didine bird, has not been neglected by the Com-

mittee                           but they regret to say that at jiresent they see no chance of success-
                              ;

fully carrying on researches there. Mr. Edward Newton, however, is

thoroughly alive to the importance of discovering the remains of this species

(of which, unhke its allies, not a single relic is on record as now existing);

and he has commissioned a gentleman, who has lately proceeded thither, to
make a preliminary survey in the hope of finding places likely to reward a

search for its remains.

PENETRATION OF IRON PLATES BY STEEL SHOT.                                                                                                         403

Report on various Experiments carried out by Captain W. H. Noble,

   R.A., under the direction of the Ordnance Select Committee, rela-

   tive to the Penetration of Iron Armour Plates by Steel shot, to
   which is added a Memorandum on the Penetration of Iron-Clad
   Ships by Steel and other Projectiles.

[A communication ordered to be printed among the Eeports.]

In 1862 the Special Committee on Iron proposed a series of experiments for
the purpose of ascertaining whether the penetration of projectiles into iron
was proportional to their vis viva.

   Tlie guns proposed for use were the 68-pounder smooth-bore, and 7-inch

B L ritied gun, and the necessary charges were determined by the Ordnance

Select Committee with the aid of Navez's Electroballistic Apparatus.
A few experiments
                             were  subsequently made                                                                       but the  results were  not to
                                                                                                                        ;

be relied on, as the projectiles used were cast iron and broke up on impact.

This subject was revived in 1864 by the Ordnance Select Committee, and a

--series of expeiiments were authorized for the purpose of determining the fol-

lowing points :

   First. To determine the relative penetrating effects of two shots on an

iron plate, provided they strike with the same "work"*, notwithstanding
that the one may be heavy with a low velocity, and the other light with a

high velocity.

    Secondly. To determine the relative resistances of a plate to penetration by
two shots of similar form of head, and striking with " work " proportional

to their respective diameters.

   An example of the first point may be stated as follows :--The 10"-5

wrought-iron gun of 12 tons is fired at an iron plate with a charge of 50 lbs.,
and spherical steel shot of 168| lbs., the velocity at 200 yards being 1570

feet, and consequent "work" 2898 foot-tonsf.

   The same gun is fired in its rifled state at a similar plate, with a charge of
40 lbs., and hemispherical-headed steel elongated shot of 300 lbs., the velo-

city at 200 yards being 1180 feet, and consequent "work" 2898 foot-tons.

    Will the penetration + be the same in both cases?
   The following case will serve to illustrate the second point :
   The 100-pounder smooth-bore gun of 6| tons is fired at an iron plate
with a charge of 15-4 lbs., and siAerical steel shot of 104-1 lbs. weight and
8-87 inches diameter, the velocity at 100 yards being 1254 feet, and con-
sequent '-work" 1135 foot-tons.

  MThe 7-inch L rifled gun of 130 cwt. is fired at a similar plate, with a

charge of 13-5 lbs., and elongated hemispherical-headed steel shot of 100-3 lbs,

weight and 6-92 inches diameter, the velocity at 100 yards being 1129 feet,

and consequent "work " 886 foot-tons. Will the penetrationj be the same iu

both cases, the vis viva beiag proportional to the respective diameters, or as
8-87 to 6-92 ?

used.

404 REPORT-- 18G6.

   The experiments which the Ordnance Select Committee instituted for the
piirpose of obtaining a sohition to the foregoing questions must be regarded

as preUminary to any inquirj- into the larger question of the penetration of

iron defences by steel projectiles. No attempt has been made to found any

(tbsohife law of resistance upon the following results ; for these results are
not sufficiently extensive to warrant any such proceeding. They were car-

ried out for the purpose of affording a practical solution to the questions at

issue, and were limited in extent by considerations of expense. To found
any general law of penetration into iron defences would require a much more

extensive and costly trial; and although the results of such an investigation

might be highly interesting as a philosophical question, it is doubtful whether

they would prove of sufficient practical utility to warrant the unavoidable

expense*.

   AVhen it is considered that this question is surrounded by difficulties and

causes of error over which we have no control, it will appear that it is at

present hopeless to look for anything but an approximate result. The very
quahty of the materials we are obliged to make \ise of, the rougli and prac-
tical nature of the trials, and the necessity of carrj-ing them out on a
moderate scale, aU tend to make the cxj "riments, philosophically considered,

imperfect and insufficient as a basis for mathematical analysis.

The following programme of experiments was determined on for the first

-- Mpoint :                   L i-ifled gun (Shimtf).
    Chm. 6-3-inch
--Frojectiles. Four descriptions of steel sliot, of the following weights, as
--nearly as manufacturing limits will allow: spherical 3o-o lbs., elongated
--71 lbs., elongated 106-5 lbs., elongated 64 lbs. J, all to be hemispherical-

headed, and of 6-22 inches diameter.

   Charges.--To be so arranged that each projectile may strike -with the

--same " work "' stored up in it.
    Iron Plates. Best roUed iron, 5^ inches thick, placed vertically at a dis-

tance of 100 yards, and unbacked.

The programme for the second point was as follows :                                   L rifled gun of

-- M MGuns. 6-3-inch L rifled gun of 140 cwt. ; 7-inch

--134 cwt. ; 100-poundcr smooth-bore gun of 61 tons (9-ineh).
   Projectiles^. For 6-3-inch gun, same as detailed in the first programme
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

 --Charges. To be so arranged that each projectile may strike with a "work"

--proportional to its diameter, taking the 6-3-inch as the standard.
   Iron jilates. Best rolled iron 5h inches thick, placed at a distance of 100

yards, and unbacked.

   * The experiments liitlierto carried out have given us a fair practical knowledge of tlie
conditions to be fulfilled in order that complete penetration tlirough iron defences may

be effected.

  Wo can predict, with a very close a]iproximation to the trutli, whether a given projec-

tile sti-iking with a given velocity, will or will not pei-forate a given ii-ou structure; but

supposing it not to be able to perforate it, we cannot say how far it wUl indent it, and it is

submitted that this is of little consequence.

   t The gun used in the first series of experiments against .'j-.^-incli plates was the experi-
mental G-3-inch gun of 140 cwt., lengtli of boro 126 inches. This enabled the necessary
high velocity to be obtained.

If we examine Table III., it appears that penetration* varies nearly in the

inverse ratio of the diameter. The only round which does not bear this out

is No. 1009 ; and in this ease the fault may have been in the steel of which

the projectile was composed. Thus Nos. 1008 and 765 agree exactly ; 1011
and 1026 are practically equal in effect, and IS'os. 1027, 1012, and 1013 are
all very similar in their efi'ccts. As before mentioned, in an experiment of
such a practical description we must not look for too much theoretical harmony

in the results ; and when wc remember that steel and iron vary so much in

quality, exact results cannot be expected.
   The Committee, however, determined to repeat tlie experiments against

4-5-inch plates, and to fire with such charges that the projectiles should strike
with a force which would be merely suiRcient to Just penetrate throiigh tlie

plate t.

   It appears from Table II., round 1008, that a G-22 inch projectile is Jast

able to penetrate a 5-5-inch plate, Avith a "work" on impact of about 825

foot-tons ; and if we assume that the resistance of the plate varies as the
square of its thickness, we shall have the following proportion to determine
the " work " necessary to penetrate a 4-5-inch plate with the same projec-

tile, viz. :

                       x5-5= : 825 : : 4-5^ : ;

and .r=552 foot-tons.

In order therefore to Just penetrate a 4-5-inch wrought iron unbacked

plate, a 6-22-inch solid steel hemispherical-headed shot ought to strike with

a " work " represented by about 552 foot-tons ; and if wc take the weights

of the projectiles to be approximately

                       35-56

                       03-87
                       71-00 lbs.

                       106-62

the following Table gives the velocities which each of these projectiles must be

moving at, in order that the " work " on impact may equal 552 foot-tons.

PENETRATION OF IRON I'LATES BV STEEL SlIoT,  400

with a 6-22-ineh shot. This was determined in the following manner by a

preliminary experiment.

   The weight of the steel shot was 63-87 lbs., its diameter 6'22 inches, and
the required velocity 1116-6 feet. It was found by experiment that a shot
of this description would be moving with a velocity of nearly lllG-6 feet at
100 yards distance, if it were fired with a charge of G lbs. 11 ozs. of powder.
This charge was therefore employed in round 1047 with the following results.

    Shot struck 4-5-inch imbacked plate about the centre and just penetrated

the plate, the .shot rebounding (i j-ards. From this result it appeared that a
" work" of about 552 foot-tons was just capable of piercing a 4-5-inch un-

backed plate, and that, practically speaking, the assumption that the resist-
ance varies as the scjuare of the thickness was correct.

   The experiments might therefore proceed.
   It appears from the above Table that when the weight of the projectile
varies from 35 to 106 lbs. the velocity wUl vary from 1496 to 864 feet, if the
" Avork " is required to be constant.
   In order therefore to strike the 4-5-inch plates with a constant '' work"
of 552 foot-tons, we must so proportion the charges of powder that the seve-

ral projectiles on impact may be moving with tbeir corresponding velocities

as shown by Table IV. This has been done by observing the velocity at
100 yards of a series of cast-iron projectiles of as nearly as j^ossible the same
weight as the steel shot, the cast-iron projectiles corresponding to the
spheriml steel shot being a shell brought to the proper weight by being filled

\vith lead.

   The following Table shows these charges determined by experiment :

  Mspherical-headed shot should be fired from the 64-pounder L gun, in

   If we examine this Table, it appears
   1. That all the projectiles biit one struck with "work" sHghtly under

that which was required, viz. 552 foot-tons ; and that 542 tons is only just

capable of piercing a 4-5-inch plate.
    Thus, in most instances, the shot, after penetration, rebounded and fell in

front of the plate, sho-sving that they had expended almost their entire

force in the penetration.

    As 552 tons was calculated on data supplied by a shot (round 1008)

                                                   * Preliminary roimd.
             PENETRATION OF IRON PLATES BY STEEL SHOT.                                                              411

which penetrated and liad some little force left in it, it is to be expected that
a force of 542 toiis should act as it did. It appears that a reduction of
2 0Z3. in the charge, and consequent diminution of " work" to 525 foot-tons
was sufficient to prevent complete penetration (round 1161), although it ap-
parently required but a small blow with a hammer to separate the piece of
plate at the back of the point struck : as this effect was produced by the shot
moving with the highest velocity, it is a convincing proof that with steel shot
the penetration is not proportional to a higher power than the square of the

velocity.

   2. Round 1164 is the only anomalous round in the present series : it was
supposed to be fired with exactly the same charge as round 1158 yet the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

penetration was inferior, and the observed velocity less. It is difficult to

account for this except on the supposition that, throiigh some oversight, a

smaller charge was employed, or that the projectile was not quite rammed

home.

3. It is clearly proved that plate 2 was of somewhat better quality

than plates 1 and 3.    The      fracture      showed    a better  weld                              and  this  is  evi-
                                                                                                  ;
--dent by the increased resistance it offered to the projectiles round 11G5

especially.

   It is difficult to guard against this cause of error, which is one of the

many that beset this question.

   From these experiments, the following practical conclusions may be drawn
when the 2yrojectiles arc fired direct.

   1. An unbacked wrought-iron plate will be perforated with equal facility

by solid steel shot of a similar form of head, and having the same diameter,

provided they have the same vis viva on impact ; and it is immaterial whether

this vis viva be the result of a heavy shot and low velocity, or a light shot
and a high velocity.

   2. An unbacked iron plate wiU be penetrated by solid steel shot of the

--same form of head but different diameters, provided their striking vis viva

varies as the diameter nearly that is as the circumference of the shot.
   3. That the resistance of unbacked wrought-iron plates, to absolute pene-

tration by solid steel shot of similar form and equal diameter, varies as the
square of their thickness nearly *, up to 5g inches.

    4. These experiments have proved that although, in the case of cmt iron,
a light projectile moving with a high velocity will indent iron plates to a
greater depth than a heavier projectile with a low velocity but equal " work,"

it is not as necessary that there should be a high velocity when the projectiles
are of a hard material, such as steel and chilled iron ; and this result wUl be
much in favour of rifled guns, by enabling them to prove effective with com-

paratively moderate charges.

   If wo -wish to put these results in an algebraic form, wc shall have, taking

the units as the pound and the foot,

                        ^=2*Rt6^t,                                                                                  (1)

* Tliis is only true wlien the plates arc of the best quality. It is well known that it is

easier to make a thin than a thick plate, and that the latter is liable to imperfect welding

in the process of rolling. The manufacture of armour-plates has, however, been so much

iniproved of late, that it is practically allowable to assume that theii- resistance varies as

the square of their thickness, witliin ordinary limits.

   In order to determine /.;, we can form a series of ecjuations of the follow-

ing conditions :

                                                        &c. &c. &c.

    Substituting the experimental values of the different quantities, and eli-

minating /.-, we find that for hemispherical-headed shot

                   7.-= 53.57200.

Having thus determined the value of 1-, we can calcidate the " work

necessary to penetrate any unbacked plate of given thickness.
   Thus, let US determine the " work " required to just penetrate a 5-5-inch

plate M'ith a hemispherical-headed steel shot of (r22 inches cUameter.

Here we have   =E=3-ll inches 0-2591 7 feet,

               7; =5-5 inches =0-45833 feet,

               A~5357200
                                                                        ;

and substituting these values in equation (1), we find that

               ^'=1832522 lbs.

                            = 818 foot-tons.

  We see that round 1008, consisting of a spherical shot of 35-56 lbs. and

6-22 inches diameter, moving with a velocity of 1829 feet, and consequent
" work " of 825 foot-tons, just penetrated a 5-5-inch plate. This " work " is
practically the same as that given in the above example, as a difference of 5 ozs.
in the weight of the shot would have reduced its work to 818 foot-tons.

   By means of the foregoing eqiiations, wc can determine most of the effects

--against unbacked plates ; and the following examples are given in proof.
   Example I. What thickness of unbacked wrought-iron plate will with-

stand the impact of a soUd hemispherical-headed steel shot of 115 lbs. weight,
and 0-92 inclies dinmctor, fired with a charge of 22 lbs. from the 7-inch

ijeing 1260 feet ?

Here we have from equation (2),
                                                           413

and substituting the values above, we find

                                 =5 6-486 inches.

   The thickness of plate to resist this shot ought therefore to be more than

6'5 inches.

 --E.vample II. The 68-pounder smooth-bore gun is fii-ed with a spherical

steel shot of 72-0 lbs. weight and 7-91 inches diameter, the striking-velocity
at 200 yards being 1365 feet; what thickness of unbacked plate will it

penetrate ?

   Here we have, as before,

           Vo = v\ /                        ;

                                    47r%^-

and substituting the above values,

           h=5-2 inches.

Round 906, fired with the above charge, failed to perforate a 5'5-inch plate,

although it indented it to a depth of 2-8 inches, and cracked off the plate

Webehind.  find, however, that the 68-poimder penetrated a 4-75-inch plate

--on the " Small-plate" target (roiuid 842), and a 5-inch plate (round 960).
   Example III. The 13-3-inch gun of 22 tons was fired at an 11-iuch plate

with a spherical steel shot of 344-4 lbs. weight and 13-24 inches diameter

charge 90 lbs., the striking-velocity being 1574 feet at 200 yards : ought it

to have penetrated the plate ? Now the thickness of unbacked plate which

this shot wUl penetrate can be found from equation (2),

and substituting the above values, we find

                             =6 10-14 inches.

   Round 704, minute 11,287 shows that a shot of the above nature indented

--an 11-inch unbacked plate to a depth of 4-9 inches and broke the plate in two.
   Example IV, The embrasures of a fort are protected with unbacked wrought
iron plates of 8 inches thickness, with what velocity should a 250-lb. hemi-
spherical-headed rifie shot of 8-92 inches diameter strike so as to ensure pene-

tion ? Here we have, from equation (1),

                                                                                              rRf/Z;

and substituting the above values, we find

                                  v= 1197 feet.

   From this it follows that if the 9 -inch rifled Woolwich gim was fired with
its service-charge of 43 lbs, and a 250-lb. steel sliot it would penetrate an
unbacked 8-inch plate at about 1200 yards.

  --Example V. The 12-poimder B L Armstrong gun is fired with an elongated

at that range ? Here we have, from equation (1),

                                  -g-- =102 foot-tons,

or 11-2 foot-tons per inch of the shot's circumference; and we also find

from the same equation that it requires 12-46 foot-tons per inch of the shot's

circumference to penetrate a 3-inch plate.

The above shot therefore would not penetrate, although it would be very

near it. This result is borne out by roimds 986 and 993.
--WoExample VI.
                    wish to test some steel shells of 115 lbs. weight and 6"92

Minches diameter, fired from the 7-inch L Woolwich gun, with 22 lbs. charge,

Weand a striking-velocitj'- at 200 yards of about 13S0 feet.  have a target,

cxjiressly constnicted for the trial of steel projectiles fired from heavy guns,

which consists of S-inch plates backed by about 20 inches of wood. Will

this suit oiu" purpose in the present instance ?

ISTow, in order efi'ectuaUy to test a steel shell, the following conditions ought

to be fulfilled, viz. the iron plate which protects the target should not be of

greater thickness tlian that which the shell would be capable of penetrating

unbacked. Or, assuming that the shell, if fired blind would have as great a

penetration as a sliot of the same form and weight, the thickness of the plate

should be such as will admit of the shot getting its nose into the backing.

This condition is self-evident : for if we increase the thickness of the pro-

tecting plate beyond the power of the shot, it is manifest that the only result

of firing a shell at it woidd be an indent, and that it woidd not signify whether

there was powder in the shell or not.

From equation (2),

we can find the maximum thickness of plate which a shot of the same form
as the above sheR wUl penetrate. Substituting the values, we find

                              =6 7'09 inches.

   From this we see that a target faced with 8-inch plates is unsuitable for

testing shells from the 7-inch Woohvicli gun with the above charge, and,

moreover, that something less than 7 inches should be the maximum tliickness

of plate of a target placed for such a purpose at 200 yards.

  We could further demonstrate that the 8-inch target would do veiy well

for larger projectiles, such, for instance, as those fired from the 9-inch Wool-
wich gun of 12 tons.

 --Example YII. The wall piece is fired with a cylindrical steel shot of

0-34:4 lb. weight and 0-S7 inch diameter at a ^-inch plate, velocity on im-
pact being 1141 feet; ought it to penetrate it? and will it also penetrate a

1-inch plate ?

   Here we have

and substituting the above values, we find

                    6=0-906 inch.

The shot woiild therefore penetrate a |-inch plate, but not one of 1 inch.

   It is unnecessary to give further examples of penetration through unbacked

plates : the subject of backed plates will bo further considered when the

results of experiments against various targets representing existing iron-clad

slips have been reviewed.
--WeOn Oblique Fire.-
                              have hitherto considered the fire as being direct

that is to say, the plate has been supposed to have been placed perpendicular

to the ground and the gun to have been so directed that the plane in which

the shot * moved was perpendicular to the face of the plate, or nearly so.

Let lis suppose, however, that the plate has been set at an angle, or that the

gun fires obhquely at an upright plate. The shot has then a tendency to
glance oif and continue its motion in a new direction, and we shall have the

following proportion, viz. :

The force with which the shot, acting obhquely, will strike is to that with

which it would strike if acting directly as the sine of the angle of incidence is

to unity f.
   Equation (1) will therefore become

and (2),                   J = .sin0^/^^W^^

                                                                            (5)

It appears from this that the resistance of the plate increases as the value

of d diminishes.

  We have already shown that a 4-5-ineh unbacked plate, when fired at

direct, requires a force represented by 28 foot-tons per inch of shot's circum-

ference to ensure penetration.

Let us siippose, however, that we place the plate in such a position that it

makes an angle of 38° with the ground. From equation (4) we find that the
force required to penetrate it in this position amounts to 1445 foot-tons for a

shot of 6-22 inches diameter, or 73-9 foot-tons per inch of the shot's circum-

Weference.  may expect, therefore, that a less force wiU not penetrate a

4-5-inch unbacked plate placed at an angle of 38°.

   An experiment of this nature was actually tried by the Armstrong and

"^Tiitworth Committee ; they caused 4'5-inch plates to be set up at an angle
of 52° Avith the vertical, and fired at them from 200 yards distance with the

competitive Armstrong and Whitworth guns.

   It appears that the projectiles were solid steel shot of 70 lbs. weight and

6-34 inches diameter, that they struck with a "work" of 1049 foot-tons or

52-7 tons per inch of shot's cii-cumference, and that thej failed to pass tlirough,
although the plate was cracked and opened at tlie back.

    The Special Committee on Ii-on carried out some experiments with a wall-
piece, filing steel flat-headed shot at |-inch unbacked plates placed at various

 angles.

    The waU-picce is able to pierce this plate in an upright position, but it
failed to do so in any case when the plate was at an angle. It is a pity this
experiment was not continued with diiferent thicknesses of plates, as the

present results do not afford sufficient data.

    The results of experiments with this waU-piece have proved that much
valuable information may be obtained at a comparatively trifling expense.

    Although it would be of advantage to carry out further experiments on

the eifect of fire directed obliquely against iron defences, still we have suffi-
cient evidence to prove that the power of resistance is much increased by

placing the target at an angle. This result is in favour of turrets or cupolas
for sea and land defences, as there is a great probability that such structures

wiU be struck obliquelj-.

    It is also in favour of protecting guns by ii'on shields placed at a slope,
and not upright.

                                                 and form.

   The difference between the effects of cast iron and steel shot is most
marked. The latter material is the nearest approach to perfect hardness
and cohesion which we have been able to procure, and the amou7it of work
expended on the shot is less with steel than any other known material.

With ordinary cast iron a very large amount of "work" is expended in
breaking up the projectile, and hurling the fragments in all directions. When

steel shot are manufactured in the best possible manner, very little " work''
is expended on the projectile; and in one instance a 12- pounder Whitworth
steel shot was of such perfect material that, after passing through 2| inches
of solid iron, its temperature was apparently imaltered, and its form so slightly
changed that it might have been fired from the gun a second time. Several
experiments have been instituted with a view of ascertaining the amount of
work lost by the breaking up of cast iron, alteratiou of form of steel shot, etc.

    Su- William Armstrong endeavoured to treat the question by an applica-
tion of the dynamic theory of heat. Having fired jn-ojectiles of various
materials against iron plates, he attempted to measure the quantity of heat
generated by the concussion.

    This method was verj- ingenious, but most difficult to carry out ; and the
results of such trials can only be looked upon as approximate.

   The conclusions drawn by Sir William Armstrong from his experiments
were as follows :

    1st. With hard and well-tempered steel shot the " work " expended on
the projectile was about one-tenth of the total work in the shot on impact.

   2nd. With soft steel the "work" expended on the projectile was about

two-tenths of the whole " work."'
   3rd. With soft wrought iron it amounted to nearly one-half.

   These experiments are alluded to in the memorandum on this subject by

Professor Pole, F.R.S., published in the Report of the Special Committee
on Iron, 1862, p. 30.

   If we examine the results of the various experiments in which cast-iron pro-
jectiles were used in comparison with, or under the same circumstances as, steel

shot, -we shall find that in almost every instance where the projectiles were

monng at a velocity not exccediug 1200 feet, the cast-iron shot may be

said to require about 2| times the " work " necessary to effect the same
amount of perforation with steel shot. When, however, the velocity of the

cast-iron shot is very high, this proportion is reduced to about 1-7. This
latter result is due to the influence which the element velocity has in the

penetration of cast-iron shot. If we suppose two cast-iron projectiles to be

of the same form of head and diameter, and to be animated with the same
amount of energy or "work," consisting in one case of a heavy shot and
low velocity, and in the other of a hght shot and high velocity, the oifect
of these projectiles wiU be very different.

    The damage in the case of the low velocity will be spread over a larger
siirface, and the absolute indent will be small ; while in the case of the high

velocity the effect will be confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the
point of impact, and the result will be a deep indent. This result with cast-

iron shot is so well known that it seems almost needless to allude to it ; we

may, however, select one or two examples for record.

   Thus the 'BeUerophon' target was struck by two projectiles fired from
the 10-5-inch gun (rounds 717-719). The first consisted of a spherical
shot of 150 lbs., moving with a velocity of 15-47 feet, and a consequent
" work " of 76 foot-tons per inch of shot's circumference ; the second, of an
elongated shot of 308 lbs., moving with a velocity of 1090 feet, and consequent
" work " of 77 foot-tons per inch of shot's circumference.

   In the first instance the indent was 5 inches, and the damage was con-
fined to the point struck. In the second instance the indent was 1-G inch,
but the plate was cracked and bulged over a large area.

   The foUo-wing Table shows the absolute thickness of plate which can be
penetrated by cast-iron shot fired from various guns with service-charges

the guns were at a distance of 100 yards from the plates, with the excep-
tion of the 68-pounder, which was at 200 yards (see Appendix, Table X.) :

                                                             Defences.

"We have abeady seen that it is almost useless to fire cast-iron projec-

tiles against iron defences if penetration is required ; it will therefore be

neccssaiy to use a material which will effect our purjjose at a moderate cost.

Steel is a most expensive material for shot ; and as we have proved that

Palliser's chilled iron is almost, if not entirely, as good as steel, all our

projectiles for battering-purposes wUl most probably be made of this material.

The proper form of front or head to be given to hardened projectiles for use

against iron plates is a subject of much importance. Various forms have

been proposed for this purpose.

Mr. Whitworth relies on the flat-headed form, while most of Sir "Wm.

Armstrong's projectiles have been round-headed or hemispherical; Major

Palliser has used elliptical heads, and lately, in the projectiles for the 13-

inch gun, a sharp-pointed form. The flat-headed form is supposed to be

right, because it is generally used as the form of a punch. But although

a flat-headed punch, when used with a die, will make a nice dean hole in a
plate of iron, it by no means foUows that a sharp-pointed or " centre " punch

will not make a rugged hole of equal size, with the same, if not greater ease.
   The manufacturer uses the flat-headed punch in order that he may be

enabled to cut out a dean hole ; but the artilleryman docs not care what

shaped hole he makes so as it is made ; and if he has a preference at all,

it is for a ragged hole which it is difficult to mend or plug iip.

  We find in practice that the pointed form is the best for the artillery-

man, particularly when the iron plates are backed by wood.

  A consideration of the result of firing at a backed target will make this

evident.

The flat-headed or round-headed shot punches out a jnece of the armour

plate, and diivcs it into the backing ; the shot, ho-\^^ever, has no means of

ridding itself of this piece of armour plate, and consequently it has to push

it in front of it through the hacTcing. Thus in targets penetrated by flat-

 headed or round-headed shot, we invariably find that the piece of annour

plate has passed through the target along with the shot. It is needless to

remark that this piece of jagged armour plate must greatly increase the

resistance which the shot meets in passing through the backing.

When, however, the shot is of the form of a pointed ogival, the results

of its action are far diff'erent : this projectile cuts through the armour

plate, or rather tears it through, and the plate is bent back and forced into

the backing round the edge of the hole. The shot thus passes through the

backing -without carrj-ing any jagged armour in front of it*.

A very good illustration of this was obtained in the practice with the
ML13-inch
           gun at the 'Hercules' target; and the photographs of the

target taken when the plates were removed show the effect in the most marked

manner.

Round 1141 : a steel round-headed shot penetrated the lower or 8-inch

plate of the ' Hercules,' forcing the piece of plate against the backing. On

the plate being removed, this piece of iron was foimd exactly as the shot

had punched it out, and endeavoured to force it forward. The total pene-

tration or indent was about 13 inches.

Round 1145 : a chQled iron pointed-headed shot also struck the 8-inch

   * In practice with ogival-headed shot we seldom, if ever, find that any part of the
armour plate has passed through the target witli the i^rojoctile.

                                                                                        I

plate and tore thi-ough it, bending the edges of the plate back, and forcing

them laterally into the backing.  The penetration in this case was 22 inches
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and if the shot had been a perfect casting it would probably have had a

greater effect.

  We see also from Table XII., in the Appendix, how much greater penetration

was obtained by a steel sheU wnth a soUd head in the form of a pointed

ogival, than where this form was not used.

There is another disadvantage which the blunt-headed form labours under,

viz. the tendency to " set up " or bulge at the head ; and this result is

Aoften ver}^ marked.   pointed head, on the contrary, does not " set up "

to anything like the same extent, and almost all those which have been

fired have preserved their points intact after passing through the plates.

   On the whole, it may be said that in the case where the projectile ought

to be capable of piercing the plate or target there is little difference between

the effects of a flat head and a hemispherical head ; but when the target is
beyond the power of the shot the hemispherical head makes the deepest indent.

This is clearly shown in the case of the experiments with a waU-piece at a

4-5-inch unbacked plate, and 12-pouuder Armstrong and Whitworth gims, at

the Scott- Russell target. In every case where the target could not be pene-

trated, the round gave a deeper indent than the flat head.

The Tables in the Appendix give the results of some late experiments,

which clearly show the great superiority of the pointed head.

In these experiments, both steel and Palliser's chilled shot were used.

All the projectiles were fired from the same gun, under the same circum-

stances, the velocity of each rovind being observed. The targets consisted

of a strong structure, representing the side of an iron-clad vessel protected

by solid plates of 6 inches thickness, backed by 18 inches of compact teak,

Aan iron skin of two half-inch plates, the usual iron ribs, tfcc.  second

target of unbacked 4-5 -inch plates, inclined at an angle of 38° with the

ground, was erected at the same distance.

The projectiles were of a mean weight of 115 lbs., and of the following

forms of head, viz. :

                       For Palliser's Chilled Shot.

   1. Ogival, head struck with a radius of 1 diameter, and broiight to a point.
   2. Belgian form, head struck with a radius of 1-47 diameter, and pointed
in the shape of a cone.
    3. EUiptical, the height of the eUipse being equal to the diameter of the

projectile.

                                                For Steel Shot.

    1. Hemispherical.

   2. Ogival, head struck with a radius of 1 diameter, and brought to a

point. See Table XI., in the Appendix, round 1186 to 1201.

   From this it appears

   1st. That hemispherical-headed steel shot, strildng the box target with
a " work " of 6S tons per inch of shot's circumference faUed to penetrate
completely: this result might be expected, as from calculation it would
require about 82 tons per inch of circumference to send a hemispherical-
headed shot completely thi-ough such a structure.

    2nd. That ogival-headed steel shot, the head being brought to a point,
striking the above target with a " work " of 68 tons per inch of shot's
circumference, penetrated completely, with some remaining force left.

   3rd. That pointed chilled shot, striking the above target with a "work " of

                                                               2e2

OG tons per inch of shot's circumference, penetrated completely, and were fully
equal to the steel.

    4tli. That elHptical or blunt-headed chilled shot, striking the above target
·with a " work " of 06 tons per inch of shot's circumference, failed to pene-
trate completely, the indent being about equal to that made by the hemi-
spherical-headed steel shot.

    5th. That ogival -pointed chilled shot striking the 4-5-inch unbacked
plates, inclined at angle of 38° with the ground, with a " work " of GO
tons per inch of shot's circumference, penetrated completely.

    Gth. That the same shot with the Belgian coned head failed to jieuetrato.
    7th. That it would reqiiire a " work " of above 70 tons per inch of shot's
circiimference to send a hemispherical-headed steel shot completely through
4-5-inch unbacked wrought-iron plates, inclined at an angle of 38° with
the ground. Such a structure therefore presents a greater obstacle to com-
plete perforation than the ' Warrior ' target if fired at chrect.
   Sufficient experiments have not yet been made with pointed shot to
enable us to determine the value of Ic for this form of projectile with any

great exactness.
    It is probable, however, that Ic for pointed shot will be found to be about

four-fifths of that for hemispherical-headed projectiles, when the target is

backed, or

                                 Spherical versus Elongated Projectiles,

   The experiments against iron-plated targets have clearly demonstrated
the immense sui^eriority of elongated over spherical projectiles, when the
shot or shell are made of a hardened material. Elongated projectiles have
been found to be less liable to alter their shape on impact ; and the c^din-
drical form is much better adapted for steel shells, which as spherical woidd
be almost worthless. The best form of steel shell known at present is the steel
solid-headed shell, the head being ogival and moveable, so as to offer the

least resistance to the action of the bursting charge in the forward direction.

 --The chief characteristics of this projectile are : its solid pointed head,

which penetrates or punches a hole in the armour, and so permits the
powder to explode in the backing*; and the construction of the head
which renders it very strong when acted on by a force from the outside,
but weak when subject to pressure from within ; it is thus easy for the
bursting charge to blow the head forward through the backing and inner skin.

   The form of this projectile is also well adapted for the use of gun-cotton
as a bursting charge, the cotton being made up in the improved manner,
viz. disks of pulp. These shells having been first proposed by Cajitain H.
J. Anderson, ll.A., are known as the " Alderson shell; " and Table XIII. (in
the Appendix) shows what success attended their use (rounds 1048-1050).

    It is believed that Sir William Armstrong was the first to point out the
advantage to be gained by causing the powder to act in a forward direction

and the steel shells known as the " Armstrong pattern " are thus made.

All these shells, however, are furnished with hollow east-iron heads or caps,
and their penetration is inferior to the shells with solid steel heads.

PENETRATION OF IRON PLATES BY STEEL SHOT.  421

                          On tlie Penetration into UnbacJced Plates.

    "We have hitherto considered the effects due to absohite penetration or

j)erforation, that is, when a clean hole is made through the iron plate. Let
us now examine the results of various experiments where the effect was to

bend and indent the plate in consequence of the force not being sufBcient to

perforate it.

    The Tables in the Appendix give the results of various experiments at un-

backed plates.

   From these Tables it appears that, when the shot is unable to perforate, the

effects are very variable and difficult to compute.
    Thus the total effect or " work done " by round 986 was made up of the

following items :
    1st. Indent 2-3 inches.
    2nd. " "Work " expended in cracking indent.

    3rd. " "Work " in cracking and bulging rear of jilatc.
    4th. " "Work " in cracking the head of, and " setting up " the shot from 7*4

inches to 6-74 inches.

   Again, we have, round 993, fired under the same circumstances :

    1st. Indent 2-2 inches.
    2nd. " "Work " expended in twisting the shot, cracking its head, and
reducing its length from 7'4 to 6-.5 inches.

    Here no " work " was expended in cracking the indent or the back of the
plate, but, on the other hand, the shot was more distorted in form, and more

reduced in length.

   It would be difficult to reduce such results to any law, unless we were pos-
sessed of data furnished by a number of carefully conducted experiments
made with shot of the same form and quality, and plates of equal strength.

   It is submitted, however, that the knowledge of how far a shot will penetrate

into an iron plate is of little practical value. '^Ve can determine with a close
degree of ajiproximation whether it will penetrate throu[/Ji the plate or not
and that is the chief point. It is, however, interesting to observe the differ-

ence between the way in which the work is done in the two cases, viz. when
the plate can be perforated, and when it cannot.

    Thus round 986, with a luorl- of about 102 foot-tons, only penetrated to a
depth of 2-3 inches in a 3-inch plate, whereas it would have perforated the
plate if the ivorJc had been ] 14 foot-tons.

    The 68-pounder smooth-bore, firing solid steel si^herical shot with 16-lb.
 charges, could perforate a 5-inch plate, but would only penetrate to a depth of
about 3 inches in a 5^ -inch plate.

    The effects of the wall-piece, firing steel flat-headed shot, are very strange.
 Thus this projectile can penetrate, at 25 yards, all plates up to and including
 |-inch; it fails to penetrate an inch plate, and indents it 0-28 inch, but it
indents a 5-inch plate almost as much ; and there is no difference whatever
between the indent in a 5- and a 4-inch plate. This seems to prove that
anything above a 4-inch plate may be regarded as being of infinite thickness,

relatively, to a wall-piece projectile.

   Examination of tlie Pesults of various Experiments aijainst Tanjets rejpre-
                                            seniinf) Iron-clad Vessels.

   The experiments before detailed have indicated that the comparative effect
produced on iron defences by steel shot can be very closely represented by

--the vis viva of the projectUe on impact and that it is of little importance
                                              -- f;

422 REPORT--1866.

whether this vis viva be the result of a heavy shot and a low velocity, or a light
shot and a high velocity. Thus the 10'5-ineh gun with a spherical steel shot
of 165 lbs., and a charge of 35 lbs., gives a striking-velocity at 200 yards of
1470 feet, and a " work " on impact at 200 yards of 2472 foot-tons *.

   If the same gun be fired with an elongated steel shot of 300 lbs. and charge
of 35 lbs., the " work " will be practically the same at 200 yards, viz. 2472

foot-tons.

   The effect of these two projectiles may therefore be assumed to be equal

that is, either of them would punch the same hole.
    This, however, is only true in the case of projectiles of the same diameter ; it

would not hold good if the comparison had been made between a shot of 10-5
inches diameter, and a shot of 9-22 inches diameter. It is also necessary that the
shape of the head, or front part of the shot, should be the same in both cases.
Thus, when a comparison is made between a spherical and a cylindrical shot,
the head of the latter should be hemispherical. If the cylindrical head be
pointed or elliptical, it will have a certain advantage over the spherical form.
In the experiments with steel projectiles which have taken place in this
country up to the present time, the form of the head has been, generally

speaking, hemispherical ; the effects there are fairly comparable.
    It has been said that the diameters of the shot should be the same, in order

to ensure a dii'ect comparison. Recent experiments, however, have shown
that with projectiles of different diameters the vis viva, should vary as the
diameter nearhj. That is to say, the force required to punch a 10-5-inch hole
is to the force requii-ed to punch a 9'22-inch hole as 10-5 is to 9*22 nearhj

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

so that, if it be found that 2472 foot-tons are required to send a 10-5-inch
projectile through the side of an iron-clad, the same effect, as regards pene-
tration, wlU be produced by 2171 foot-tons in the case of a 9-22-inch pro-

jectile.

   Let us now examine some of the principal experiments which have taken

place in this country in relation to iron-clad sea defences J.
    In the remarks on these striictures and the effects observed, the following

points will be chiefly attended to, viz. :
    1st. Experiments against targets which represent actual sea-going vessels.

   2nd. The effects produced by guns of those calibres only which are likely
to be carried on board ship.

    3rd. In most cases, solid steel shot.
   The accompanying brief description of the several targets alluded to in tlie

Tables is inserted here for reference.

  --Warrior.- This target represented a portion amidships of the frigate of that

name. It is a specimen of an iron armour-plated ship.

* The vis viva of a body in motion is the whole mechanical cfTcet which it will prodnco

in being brought to a state of rest, without  regard to the                                                                               time  occupied                                                 and it varies as
                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the weight of the body multiplied by the square of its velocity.

Tills mechanical effect, or " work " accumulated in the moving body, is represented by

the weight which it is capable of raising 1 foot high, and is equal to the weight of thf

moving body multiplied by the square of its velocity, and divided by twice the force of

gravity, or ,  .

               -9
Thus, if a shot of 165 lbs. weight be moving with a velocity of 1470 feet per second, the

" work " accumulated in it will be represented by

                  1 65 X 1470 X 1470
                                                                                                                                       ,

                  2 X 32 1908

which is equal to 5538048 lbs., or 2472 tons. That is to say, the force stored up in this

shot is capable of lifting a weight of 2472 tons 1 foot high.

   Minotaur. This target consisted of 3 plates, 5-5 inches in thickness.

The backing consisted of 9 inches of teak, and the inner skin similar to

' Warrior.'

   Each plate was fastened by three rows of bolts, the upper and lower rows
being 1-75 inch diameter, and the centre row 1'5 inch. The majoritj' of
the bolts went completely through, having double nuts on the inside ; but
some of them were screwed into the teak backing, being in fact only large
wood screws. Strips of iron, 1-25 inch thick, were placed in rear, at the

junction of the plates, the upper strip being 16 inches wide, the lower strip

10 inches wide.
   The supports in rear were similar to that of the ' Warrior ' target. It

appears, therefore, that this target differs from the ' Warrior ' by the sub-

--stitution of 1 inch of armour plate for 9 inches of teak backing.
   BelleropJion. Each frame of the target was made of an angle-ii-on lU"

X 3|" X I", and two angle-irons 3i" X 3|" X f", rivetted together. To the

double angle-irons of this frame, the skin, which was composed of two thick-

nesses of I" plating, making together Ig", with a layer of painted canvas
between, was rivetted.

   On the outside of the skin plating four horizontal angle-iron stringers were
attached, two under the upper armour plate, 9i" X 3|" x |", the broad
flange being square to the skin, and not reaching out to the armour by half
an inch ; the other two were j)laccd behind the lower plate, 10" x 3|" x i".

The breadth of the broader flange being thus equal to the backing, it rests
against the armour. The wood backing, 10" thick, was worked longitudinally

on the skin plating, and between the angle-iron stringers, and bolted with
nut-and-screw bolts through the skin plating. The armour consisted of
two rolled plates, 6" thick, weighing upwards of 9 tons each. The upper
armour plate was bolted with 2|-iiich bolts, the lower plate with 2|" bolts.
The bolts ran through, and were secured by nuts and washers. In erecting
the target, care was taken to support it behind with beam ends, &g. ; so that
the actual condition of the proposed slap's side was approximated to as closely

Appendix Tables*.

  --The Lord Warden. It appears from round 813, that this vessel could be

completely penetrated by a steel shot of 0-14 inches diameter, striking with a
storcd-up work of 2G42 tons.

   The gun in this cr.sc used a reduced charge of 30 lbs. "We learn from this
that, had the full charge, viz. 44 lbs., been used, it vrould have been equivalent
to a removal of the gun to something over 1000 yards from the target.

   The 9-22-inch gun of 12 tons, with an elongated steel shot of 221 lbs. and
charge of 44 lbs., is therefore capable of completely piercing an iron-clad
vessel of the * Lord Warden ' class at 1000 yards.

  We have before mentioned that recent experiments have indicated that for

complete penetration through iron, the " work '' must vary as the diameter

of the shot nearly.

   If, therefore, we were to use a 10-5-inch gun against the ' Lord Warden,'
the force required to obtain the same effect as that accomplished by the 9-22-

--inch with a striking- "work" of 2G42 tons, would be expressed by the following

proportions :

                      9-14: 2642:: 10-43 :.r;

=and we find x 3015.

   The 10-5-inch gun would therefore require a force of 3015 tons to com-
pletely penetrate the ' Lord Warden.' That this reasoning is nearly correct,

we find by observing the eflects of round bOG, where a steel shot of 10-43
inches diameter, struck with a "work" of 2S98 tons, and failed to get com-

pJetdii throu(/h.

   In the same manner wc can approximately determine the effect which would

be produced by any other steel shot of given diameter and 's^'eight.

Let us take, for example, the 15-iuch and 11-inch cast-iron smooth-bore

guns used in the United States.

   The first of these guns would tlu-ow, p^o^ddcd they had such projectiles, a

spherical steel solid shot of 484 lbs. weight, and 14-85 inches diameter, with a

maximum battering charge of, say, 50 lbs.

   The second gmi would fire a steel sohd shot of 189 lbs. -svilh a charge of
20 lbs.

   The following Table shows the remaining velocities of these projectiles at
various distances, with their corresponding stored up " work :"

versely as the diameter, and that it requires 2642 tons of '' work " on impact to
send a steel shot of 9"-14 through the side of the ' Lord Warden ;' the penetra-
tion of a steel shot from the 15-inch gun will require a force represented by

the following proportion :

                                     9-14 : 2642 : : 14-85 : x ;

=and .V 4292 tons. It would therefore require a force of 4292 tons to send

a steel shot of 14-85 inches diameter through the ' Lord Warden.'

  A glance at the last Table shows that the 15-inch gun, if fired with a 50-lb.

charge, is unable to accompKsh this even at a range of 200 yards ; and it is
further very doubtful whether this gun, fired with 50 lbs. of powder, and a solid
steel shot of 484 lbs., would penetrate the side of the u'on-clad ship ' Lord
Warden,' even ivere the muzzle of the yim touching the armour plates of the

vessel.

' It is needless to remark that the 11-inch gun would be much less

effective.

    These conclusions go to prove

  M1st. That the 7-inch L gun of 134 cwt. rifled, fired with a solid elon-

gated steel shot of 100 lbs. and charge of 25 lbs., is not capable of piercing the
' Lord Warden ' at any range.

   2nd. The same remark applies to the 100-pounder smooth-bore gun with a
spherical steel shot of 104 lbs. and 25 lbs. charge.

   3rd. The 9-22-uich rifled gun of 12 tons, fired with an elongated steel shot
of 221 lbs. and 44 lbs. charge, is capable of piercing the ' Lord Warden ' up to

a range of about 1000 yards.
   4th. That the same remark applies to the 10-5-inch gun of 12 tons, fired

with a solid elongated shot of 301 lbs. and charge of 45 lbs.
   5th. That the American smooth-bore guns of 15, 13, 11, and 9-inch calibre,

fired with solid spherical steel shot and their service charges, arc not capable
of piercing the ' Lord Warden' at any range whatever.

   6th. This vessel could steam 2)ast batteries armed with the above smooth-

--bore guns without suffering except from " racking " efl'ect.
   The Bellerophon.- ^Thc trial of this target was of such an undecided cha-

racter, and of such a comparatively mild form, that it is difficult to obtain
sufficient data upon which to base any comparison between this vessel and
other iron-clads. The most severe blow it encountered was from the 10-5-inc.h
rifled gun, with a spherical steel shot of 165 lbs. and charge of 35 lbs., the

strildug "work " being 2472 tons. This shot failed to penetrate the target;
but we have no evidence to prove that the 10-5-inch gun would not have
penetrated with a charge of 50 lbs., and striking "work" of 2898 tons.
The ' Bellerophon ' is undoubtedly of a stronger construction than the

' Warrior ' or ' Minotaur ' class ; but there is no direct evidence to prove that
it is as strong or stronger than the ' Lord Warden.'

  We have seen that 75-4 foot-tons per inch of shot's circumference has

failed to penetrate the ' Bellerophon ;' but it appears that this force is quite

sufficient to penetrate this target when the plates are 5-5 inches thick instead

Weof 6 inches (rounds 949 to 952).  have no evidence, however, whether

75 foot-tons per inch may not be too much for a ' Bellerophon ' with 5-5-

inch plates. If we assume that this force is only sufficient for the pene-

tration of 5-5-inch plates on a backing and skin similar to the ' Bellerophon,'

the latter with 6-inch plates would require a force of 89-6 foot-tons per

inch, which is about what is required by the ' Lord Warden.'

    The fact^ however, of the 10'5 inch gun having failed to pierce this target,

indicates that the American smooth-bore 15-inch gun fired with solid steel

sliot and 50 lbs. charge, would not penetrate it at any distance over 100

yards. This vessel, therefore, could pass batteries so armed without suffering,

except by "racking."

 --The Warrior. The only steel shot which have been fired at the ' Warrior '

target have been from 100-pouuder and 68-pounder smooth-bore guns, and

Wethe 7-inch rifled gun, and 6-3 and 5-inch rifled guns.                                                                       sec from the

Table that the 7-inch rifled gun is capable of piercing the side of this vessel

vnth a 100-lb. shot and 20-lb. charge, the striking "work" being 1374

tons (round 1018). The effect of the 100-pounder gun would, therefore, be

represented by the proportion

                                          6-91: 1374:: 8-87: a-;

and a.'=1764.

   The force, therefore, required to send a steel shot from the 100-pounder
gun through the ' Warrior ' would be about 1764 tons ; and we may assume
that any force under this would not produce the required effect.

   Thus we find (round 972) that a shot from the lUO-pounder struck the
' Warrior ' with a force of 1573 tons, but failed to penetrate. In the same
manner we can approximate to the force required to send a shot from the
9-22-inch gun through the ' Warrior,'

                                                         6-91  :  1374  :  :  9-14                           x  ;
                                                                                                          :

and .r=1813 tons.

    The 9-22-inch gun could therefore send a steel shot through the ' War-

rior,' provided the striking force were 1813 tons.

    If the shot, therefore, was 221 lbs. weight, the necessai-y velocity would

be  1087 feet                                            and if the gun were fired -with                     its full  charge  of 44 lbs., it
                                                      ;

woiild send an elongated steel shot of 221 lbs. through the ' Warrior ' at
2500 yards range.

   In the same manner, in the case of the 10-5-inch gun, we have the pro-

portion

                                                         6-91: 1374:: 10-43: A-;

and .v=:2074.

   The 10-5-inch gun would therefore send its shot through the ' Warrior,'
provided the striking-force were 2074 tons.

   From this it appears that the ' Warrior ' is of weaker construction than
the ' Lord Warden,' as the 10-5-inch gun failed to penetrate the latter with
a striking-force of 2898 tons.

In the case of the 15-inch American gun, we have the proportion

                                        6-91: 1374:: 14-85 :.^;
and .r=2953 tons.

   From Table VIII. it appears that the 15-inch gun, fired with a spherical
steel shot of 484 lbs. and a charge of 50 lbs., would penetrate the ' Warrior
at any distance up to 500 yards, but would not do so at 1000 yards.

   In the case of the 11-inch gun, we have

                                                         6-91 : 1374:: 10-85 :.r;

and .r=21o7.

And from Table VIII. we find that the 11 -inch gun, fired with a solid steel

shot of 189 lbs. and charge of 20 lbs., would not penetrate the ' Warrior ' at
any range, not even if the muzzle of the gun were touching the armour plates.

438 REPORT--1866.

    From these considerations the following effects arc probable :
    1st. The 7-inch muzzle -loading rifle-gun of 130 cwt., with a solid steel

shot of 100 lbs. and charge of 25 lbs., is capable of piercing the side of the
' Warrior ' up to a range of 600 yai'ds *.

    2nd. The 100-pounder smooth-bore gun (9-inch) of 125 cwt. with a solid
spherical steel shot of 10-1 lbs. weight and 25 lbs. charge, is not capable of
piercing the 'Warrior' at any distance over 100 yards.

    3rd. The 9-22-inch rifled gun of 12 tons, with a solid elongated steel shot
of 221 lbs. and charge of 44 lbs., is capable of piercing the ' Warrior ' up to
a range of 2500 yards f.

   4th. The 10-5-inch rifled gun of 12 tons, with a solid elongated steel shot
of 301 lbs. and charge of 45 lbs., is capable of piercing the ' Warrior ' up to
a range of 2500 yards.

    5th. The American 15-inch giui of 22 tons, with a spherical steel shot of
484 lbs. and charge of 50 lbs., is capable of piercing the ' Warrior ' up to a
range of 500 yards.

    6th. The American smooth-bore 11-ineh and 9-inch guns, fired with solid

spherical steel shot and their maximum charges, are not capable of piercing

the ' Warrior ' at any range.
   7th. This vessel could pass batteries armed with 15-inch guns, as above,

--at a distance of 800 yards without suffering, except by " racldng."
   The Minotaur. This class differs from the ' Warrior' in having 1 inch of
iron armom- jilating substituted for 9 inches of wood backing.

   In the trial of this target, an experimental powder named 2Aj was
made use of; and this accounts for the effects obser^^ed with the 10-5-ineh

gun.

   It appears that, when the ordinary service, powder was used, the result was

something the same as in the case of the ' Warrior.'

   The actual strength of these ships may therefore, in absence of direct
evidence to the contrary, be assumed to be equal; but whether the wood

and iron, whicli combined form the mass of resistance, have been more ad-
vantageously distributed in the construction of the < Warrior ' than in that of

the ' Minotaur,' is a separate question.

   On the whole, it may be assumed that the remarks which apply to

the ' Warrior ' are equally applicable to the ' Minotaur ' and sliips of
her class.

  --The Hercules. This target was by far the strongest ever tried at Shoe-

buryness, and accordingly it received the most severe treatment. The pre-
liminary experiments were made with the 9"-22, 10"-5, and 10" rifled guns
of 12 tons, firing solid steel shot with very high charges.

   It appears that rounds 1041, 1045 broke the 8-inch plate and forced
the pieces into the 12-inch wood backing. Both these rounds struck between
two ribs ; 1045, however, met with more resistance than 1041, as it struck just
over one of tlio liorizontal plates ; the armour plate was thus supported in
rear of the point struck by a rigid backing.

   An 8-inch plate unbacked requires 88-6 foot-tons per inch of shot's circum-

ference to just penetrate it ; it was to be expected, therefore, that the above
rounds should do so.

   * The same result -n-ould probably occur with the present serTico charge for this gun,
viz. 22 lbs. and shot of 115 lbs.

   t The same result would occur with the service 0-inch gun of 12 tons.
--

PENETRATION OF IRON PLATES BY STEEL SHOT.  429

   Rounds 1043, 1044, 1040, 1042 struck the O-incli plate, wliich, if un-
backed, would require a force of 112-1 foot-tons per inch of shot's circum-
ference to penetrate it. Round 1044 was thei'efore the only shot which had
sufficient force to penetrate the plate ; and this round struck both on a rib
and full on one of the rigid backings ; 1040 almost penetrated the plate, as,
although the absolute indent was only 4-5 inches, the piece of plate struck
was almost dislodged ; 1042 ought to have done more damage than it did ;
probably the steel was not of the best quality.

   The target was subsequently tested by firing at it with the 13-inch
wrought-u'on gun of 22 tons, using solid steel and chilled iron shot of 570
lbs., with 100 lbs. of powder.

   The gun was at 700 yards from the target.
   The results proved that the target was impenetrable when struck fair,
although it was penetrated by a chilled shot which struck just above a pre-

vious round.

   When it is considered that this target was only 18-2 feet x S feet x 4 feet,

and that it received blows amounting in all to over seventy thousand foot-
tons, it must be confessed it did its dutj'.

  --The Small Plate. This target represented a wooden ship armour-plated,

such as the French ' Flandre ' &c.

    It appears that this class of iron-clad is not quite as strong as that repre-

sented by the 'Warrior ' or 'Minotaur' (which are iron vessels armour-plated),
and of course not nearly so strong as the ' Lord Warden ' or ' Bellerophon,'

    Thus the 10-5-inch gun with a striking-" work *' of 1657 tons penetrated
the " small plate" target ; and we have seen that this gun would require a
striking-force of 2047 tons to send the same shot through the ' M^arrior.'

    It is hardly fair, however, to take this round (850) for the basis of a com-
parison with other guns, as it appears that the target had been previously

considerabl}^ shaken.

   On the whole, it may be assumed tliat vessels of the class represented by

the " small plate " target are something weaker than those represented l)y
the ' Warrior,' and that the remarks which apply to the latter are applicable
to the former in a greater degree*.

    The following Table shows the probable distance at which various guns,
firing solid steel shot, with full service charges, would penetrate iron-clad

ships at present (1866) in the service :

    * This target is of equal, if not superior strength to the ' Warrior,' if struck on the

feet ; we can therefore find what thickness of unbacked plate it would liave

penetrated.

   From equation (2),

                       '=V^

                                                ?>=6-76 inches.

And as the armour plating of the target was 4-5 inches, the backing, inclu-

Weding the inner skin, was equivalent to an extra 2-20 inches of platiug.

can also determine the "work" necessary to penetrate the -i-S-inch plate
(unbacked) by the above shot. From equation (1),

                    =5^'=27rIUi- 608-4 foot-tons,

or 28 foot-tons per inch of shot's cii'cumference.

   As the total force required to penetrate the target would be 01 foot-tons

per inch, we see that this may be divided into twenty-eight for the armour

plate, and thirtj--three for the backing.

   It is, however, possible that this backing might be penetrated with greater

ease if it depended on itself alone ; and possibly it is only when combined

with the armour plate that its resistance is so great*.

That this reasoning is approximately correct, we find by examining the

results of round 979.
   Here the striking-" work " was 22 foot-tons per inch, and, as might be

expected,  the  plate was  not  penetrated                                                 again,  round  736  struck with  39
                                                                                        ;

tons per inch, and penetrated the plate, driving the pieces into the backing.

We learn from the foregoing results that any good hemispherical-headed

steel shot will penetrate a structure like the ' Warrior,' provided the strildng-

" work " bo not less than about 61 foot-tons per inch of shot's circumference,

and that the shot hits direct t.

   In the absence of direct proof to tlie contrary, we may assume that the

same results would take place in the case of the ' Minotaur ' and ships of her

class.

   If we examine the results of round 1 in the Portsmouth experiments, it

appears that a spherical steel shot of 113-81 lbs. weight and 9-15 inches dia-

meter, monng with a velocity of 1450 feet, and consequent " work " of 57'7

foot-tons per inch, penetrated a o-o-inch plate and the side of a wooden fri-
gate, viz. 25 inches of wood.

   The amoimt of " work " due to the plate was here 41'4 foot-tons per inch,
which leaves 16-3 tons for the backing.

   It will be seen from this that the backing and inner skin of an iron-built

ship like the ' Warrior ' is capable of much greater resistance than the side of

an ordinary frigate.

   If we suppose the ship to have been protected with the 4-5-inch armour
plates, as in the case of " Portsmouth C " target, the resistance wiU be ap-

proximately proportioned to the squares of the thicknesses of the plates, the
backing being the same in both cases.

  We might therefore expect that a " work " of about 44 tons per inch

would penetrate " Portsmouth C." It appears from round 4 that 38-7 foot-

tons per inch failed to penetrate this target.

  We* have no experimental data to determine this point.

   t The above only ajjplies to hemispherical-headed shot ; if the projectile be cival-
hcadetl the " work" required will be less.
                          -- ''

--432 REPORT 1806.

As before stated, it is proved that a " work " of about 58 foot-tons per inch,

of shot's circumference will just penetrate a 5-5-inc]i plate and 25 inches of

wood ; and we may assume that it will require a force of 4-i foot- tons per inch

to penetrate the same ship if the plates be 4'5 inches.

   In order to demonstrate how this knowledge may prove of advantage, let

us suppose the following case.

   H.M.S. ' Favourite ' is a wooden ship of about 22 inches thickness, pro-

Mtected by 4-5-inch plates, and armed with 7-inch L rifled guns throwing

solid elongated steel shot of 115 lbs. weight and 6-D2 inches diameter, with

a charge of 22 lbs.

Suppose this ship meets an enemy's vessel of the same thickness, but pro-

tected by 5-5-inch plates, and armed with 11-inch smooth-bore guns throw-

ing solid spherical steel shot of 189 lbs. weight and 10-85 inches diameter,

with a charge of 20 lbs.

   To all appearance the enemy's vessel is much the stronger of the two.

We find, however, that at 500 yards the'll-inch projectiles would strike with

a " work " of only 31 foot-tons per inch of shot's circumference, and conse-

quently would fail to penetrate the ' Favourite,' wliich requires a force of

about 41 foot-tons ; while, on the other hand, the projectiles from the rifled
guns of the latter ship would at 500 yards strike with a " work " of about

65 foot-tons per inch of sliot's circumference, which would be amply suflicient

to penetrate, even with steel or chilled shells, the side of a ship of 22 inches

thickness, protected by 5-5-tiich plates.

It may, however, be urged that, although the 11-inch shot could not pene-

trate, they would have great battering effect. But it is submitted that the

projectile which can perforate the side of an enemy's ship and disable her

crew, machinery, or magazine, is decidedly to be preferred. Battering is all

very well ia theory, but we know nliat a battering the ' Tennessee ' stood
without being much injured ; and if the ' Favourite ' should ever liappen to
fall in with an enemy's wooden frigate protected by S-S-inch plates and

armed with big smooth-bore guns, she will most likely be able to dispose of

lier in a satisfactory maimer.

If we examine the experiments carried out against the ' Lord Warden

target, it appears that the target was completely penetrated by a force repre-

sented by 92 foot-tons per inch of shot's circumference, while 88 tons per

Weinch failed to penetrate, although it evidently very nearly did so.  may

assume from this that a force of about 90 tons per inch is just capable of

piercing the ' Lord Warden.'

Now this ship consists of

A1st. 4*5-inch armour plate.

2nd. 8| inches of wood backing.

A3rd. 1-5-inch iron plate.

4th. 20| inches of wood.

And if we assume the force required to i)enetrate the iron part of it to vaiy

as the squares of the thicknesses of the plates, we shall have 28 tons for the

4-5-inch plate, and 3-1 to2is per inch for the 1-5-incli plate, thus lea^^ng 58

tons^for the backing and wood. This seems a large amount, but we must re-

Wemember that the target is very thick.    have, unfortunately, no data upon

which we can depend relative to the penetration of backing and the eft'ect of

dividing it by vertical iron plates of less thickness than the principal armour

plate. It is probable, however, that the strength of the ' Loi-d Warden

would have been increased had the Ig-inch inner plate been differently dis-
                                                  ;'

posed. It would have been interesting to find the effect of adding one inch
to the armour plate and supplj-ing a |-inch iron skin.

                          On the effect of Baching to Iron Plates.

   It might appear at first sight that wood backing would have the effect of

--strengthening an iron plate ; the results, however, of a very large number of

cases go to prove the opposite namely, that the backing aftbrds little, if any,

support to the plate, unless it be of the rigid form, such as the ' Hercules
and ' Bellerophon.' In other words, if a shot is capable of perforating an

unbacked 4|-inch plate, it will perforate it or break it away equally if it be
backed by wood alone.

  We have many instances of this. Thus we find that a steel shot fired

from the 68-pounder perforated 4g-inch plates on the ' Warrior,' 4|-inch

plates on the Small Plate, a 5-inch plate (round 960), and penetrated to the
same depth in 5^-inch unbacked and backed plates.

  We have evidence, however, that a rigid backing is a great advantage

this was particularly appai-ent in the case of the ' Hercules,' where the plates
were not perforated by some shot which struck with sufficient " work " to
penetrate them completely if unbacked.

  We have also evidence of the great superiority of packed backing of teak,

such as in the ' Warrior,' ' Minotaiu:,' &c., over the ordinary side of a line-
of-battle ship, and of the great support which an inner skin affords.

   Thus it required 33 foot-tons per inch of shot's circumference to penetrate
the backing and skin of the ' Warrior,' viz. 18 inches of compact teak and
a |-inch iron plate, strengthened and supported by iron ribs ; and we see
that 16 foot-tons per inch were sufiicient to penetrate the side of an ordinary
line-of-battle ship, viz. 25 inches of oak.

  We also find that the backing of the ' Lord Warden ' required 58 tons per

inch, and of the Small Plate target about 16 tons per inch. This shows the

vast superiority of compact backing supported by internal iron plates.

                                                                       iron,

    1. "\i\Tien it is required to perforate the plate, the projectile should be of

a hard material, such as steel or chiUed iron.
   2. The form of head best suited for the perforation of iron plates, whether

direct or oblique, is the pointed ogival.

   3. The best form of steel shell is that in which the powder can act in a
forward direction, and which is furnished with a solid steel head in the form

of a pointed ogival.

   4. When chilled iron can be made of the best quality, it is almost, if not
quite, as effective as steel for solid shot. And where the projectile can per-

forate with ease, the chilled shot is more formidable than steel, as it enters the
ship broken up, and would act as grape *.

   5. To attack well-built iron-clads effectively, the guns should be, if pos-
sible, not under 12 tons weight and 9 inches calibre, firing an elongated
projectile of 250 lbs. with about 40 lbs. of powder.

   6. When the projectiles are of a hard material, such as steel, the perfora-

tion f is directly proportional to the " work" in the shot, and inversely pro-

portional to the diameter of the projectile ; and it is immaterial whether this

"work" be made up of velocity or weight, within the usual limits which

occur in practice.

    7. The resistance of wrought-iron plates to perforation by hemispherical-
headed steel projectiles varies as the square of their thickness.

    8. Hitting a plate at an angle diminishes the eifect as regards power of

perforation in the proportion of the sine of the angle of incidence to unity.

    9. The resistance of wrought-iron plates to perforation by steel shot is not
much (if at all) increased by backing simply of wood ; it is, however, much
increased by a rigid backing, either of iron combined with wood, or of granite,

iron, brick, &c.*
    10. Iron-built ships, in which the backing is composed of compact oak or

teak, offer much more resistance than similarly clad wooden ships.
    11. The best form of backing seems to be that in which wood is combined

with horizontal plates of iron, as in the Chalmers, ' BeUerophon,' and

' Hercules' targets.

   12. An inner iron skin is of the greatest possible advantage; it not only

has the effect of rendering the backing more compact, but it prevents the

passage of many splinters which would otherwise find their way into the ship.
   No ii'on-clad, whether iron-built or wooden converted, should be without

an inner iron skin.

   1 3. The bolts known as " Palliser's bolts," are the best for securing ar-
mour plates.

    In these bolts the diameter of the shank is reduced, so that it is less than
the diameter at the screwed end.

    In the foregoing pages great stress has been laid on penetration.
    There are two methods by which an iron-clad vessel can be destroyed by

the fire of artillery.

    1. Rachiny t, or the impact of heavy shot of large size moving at low
velocities, and intended to shatter the vessel's armour, and by repeated
shakes ultimately to knock the whole structure to pieces.

    2. Punchiny J, or the penetration of the vessel's side either by elongated
shot or shell, intended to kill the crew, damage the machinery, and sink the
vessel by holes made through her, at or near the water-line.

    Both these systems have their advocates, and there is undoubtedly a great
deal to be said on both sides.

    All warlike operations tend to the crippling of your enemy ; and that
system is evidently the best which will cripple him in the shortest time,
in the easiest manner, and at the least possible expense.

   Now time is an element which will largely enter into consideration in

future actions with iron- clad vessels.
    Suppose two opposing iron-clads to meet, one armed with guns on the

"racking" system, the other with guns on the "punching system;" it is
probable that the vessel which could send her shot clean through the sides of
her adversary would have the greatest chance of reaching a vital part in a
given time. Besides which, a " punching " shot is usually an elongated rifle
projectile, animated by a moderately high velocity, and has consequently a
flatter trajectory than the "racking" shot, which travels at a low velocity;
and as accuracy and a flat trajectory are closely allied, the " punching

. * That is to say, a shot which is capable of breaking a hole through a 4-5-inch plate

unbacked, will be also capable of doing so if the plate be only backed by wood, to the

extent that, were the plate taken off the backing, the piece of iron where the shot had

struck would fall out.

system would gain another chance, viz. that of making the greatest number
of hits for a given number of shots.

   Suppose an iron-clad is desirous of running past a fort which defends an
important harbour or roadstead, she would, if possible, ijrobably pass at a
rate of over 10 miles an hour. The fort in this case would only have time
to fire a few rounds at her ; and if the effect of those rounds was merely an

--external racking, the vessel might receive no real injury at all nothing, at

least, which would in all likelihood stop her. On the contrary, a happily

directed punching shot would have the chance of destroying the machinery,
blowing up the magazine, or establishing a leak at the water-line.

    In attacking an iron-clad by the racking system, the whole effect is directed
against the casing or armour plating of the vessel, which, for all offensive

purposes, is harmless ; the enemy which we want to cripple are the men and

guns behind the armour.

   It appears from these considerations that an attack on the "punching"

system will probably be attended with gain in time, as the vital parts of the
vessel cannot be reached so quickly by an attack on the " racking" system

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and even were an enemy's ship ultimately shattered, and her offensive power
destroyed by the effect of heavy blows, this result might not be effected before

she accomplished her object, partly, if not altogether.

    The attack on the " punching " system is carried on in an easier manner
than that on the " racking " system. The former employs light rifle guns,
from 6 to 12 tons, the latter unwieldy heavy ordnance of from 12 to 50 tons.
The " racking" projectiles are heavy cast-iron shot fired with relatively small
charges ; and the loading and working of such projectiles and guns cannot be
carried out as easily or expeditiously as in the case of a system which uses a
lighter shot and relatively larger charge.

    The question of expense is one which, although it should come last in an
inquiry of this nature, is too often made the most important consideration.
If, however, we compare the cost of the 9-inch 12-ton gun, as fairly repre-
senting the " punching " system, and the American 15-inch smooth-bore gun
as representing the " racking " system, we shall find that the total cost of
gun, carriage, and 100 rounds of ammunition is very much the same for

each gun.

    On the one hand, the money will have procured a gun which can send a
shot, and possibly may send a shell, through the strongest iron-clad yet afloat
at 1000 yards range. On the other hand, a gun will be obtained which, if

--fired with service charges, cannot pierce the above ship at any distance

whatever whose shot at 1000 yards would, if cast iron, merely indent the
armour and fall back broke into the water, and if steel, would merely lodge
in the ship's side, and whose shell would be absolutely worthless against
an iron-clad, and even against wooden ships or earthworks, inferior to the

 9-inch rifle shell both in accuracy and bursting-power.

REPORT 1866.

JReport of the Committee on Scientific Evidence in Courts of Laiv, con-

   sisting of the Rev. W. Y, Harcourt, Professor Williamson, the
   Eiglit Hon. J. Napier, Mr. W. Tite, Professor Christison, Mr.

    Carpjiael, Dr. Tyxdall, Mr. James Heywood, Mr. J. F. Bate-
    man, Mr. Thomas Webster, Sir Benjamin Brodie, Bart., and

   Profcs.sor W. A. ]Miller : Professor Williamson, Secretary.

Tx the year 1S62 a Committee of this Association recommended that " By a

Legislative Act judges sliould be empo^rcred, on application from a suitor,' in
causes of a technical character, to convene skilled assessors, the number of

whom should not exceed three, and -who should give their opinions truly

on the statements of the witnesses in such manner as they shall be required

by the judge previous to his adjudication of the cause." No legislative action

has, however, as yet been taken upon this recommendation.

    It is admitted that the character and functions of one class of witnesses have
of late years undergone an important development, which has removed them
from the position of ordinary witnesses. Yet no provision has as yet been made

for this alteration, and the new witnesses are in the eyes of the law stUl like
other witnesses. These new witnesses may be described as active witnesses

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

for the novelty in their functions consists in the practice of collecting by
active exertions facts which are favourable to one conclusion upon the question
at issue, and even making experimental researches for the discovery of new

facts which may be favourable to that side. An impartial witness goes into
court to depose to such facts as he may know pertaining to the question under

investigation, and he is bound to state tliose facts in ;is accurate and straightfor-
ward a manner as possible, and to avoid shaping his statements with a view of
promoting one conclusion or verdict more than another. But an active wit-
ness, wiieii he undertakes to give e\-idence iipon any question, need not be

possessed of any specific information bearing upon the question at issue. He

receives statements and information from persons who are interested in one par-

ticular conclusion, and he receives no information from the opposite party.
But with his mind thus prepared with facts on one side of the question, he

frequently sets to work to verify these facts experimentally, or to find new

facts bearing upon the question at issue. His opportunities of collecting facts

for the trial are one-sided, and his facts arc mainly in favour of one particular

--view of the case the view which he has been employed to sujiport. So

well is this partiality of the evidence of scientific witnesses felt and acknow-
ledged, that the more conscientious witnesses, and probably most scientific wit-
nesses, would decline to give evidence at the request of a party whose case they
considered unjust. They know that their efforts would tend to increase his
chances of success, and they decline to promote a cause which they consider
unjust. By thus acting, these conscientious witnesses usurp the functions of
judge : for they decide the case in their own minds, and either strive to carry
out what they consider a just conclusion, or refuse to aid what they consider an

imjust one. If his position in a trial were not of necessity one-sided, and if
he did not consider himself bound to support the side \ipon which he is

employed, a scientific or active v^itncss would have no motive for forming an
opinion upon the subject at issue before consenting to give evidence. His verj-
selection of what seems the time side is a proof that he is aware of being

necessarily partial. AVith our present procechn-*, every scientific witness must

cither allow clianccto decide Avhich side he will aid by his exertions, or else he

must prejudge in his own mind the (lucstion at issue, and then strive to carry
                                   SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN COURTS OF LAW.            457

out this verdict by exerting his energies on behalf of the conclusion which he

considers true. He is compelled to be a partisan, and tries to avoid being the

partisan of falsehood. It is asserted that for the ends of justice such conilicts

of evidence as are thus obtained between witnesses engaged by the opposite

parties ought to take              place                         but no  reason has been shown why such partial
                                                              ;

witnesses should be placed in the position of impartial witnesses, or why there

should not be scientific witnesses so placed as to have as little bias as possible,

and able to depose to facts which they know to be true, leaving to others

to weigh these against the opposite facts, and to decide the question at issue

upon the result of such comparison.

    The present system oscillates between two evils, according as the depositions
of scientific witnesses are received by the court. If received as impartial depo-

sitions, they endanger the cause of truth ; and if considered partial, they are

liable to bring censure upon the so-called witnesses who make the depositions.
   Among the various remedies for these evils which have been suggested, the

two following appear to your Committee most promising :
    One remedy would consist in the appointment by the judge of some scientific

witnesses in addition to the witnesses engaged by each party respectively in
the suit. These judicial witnesses would hear the evidence adduced on each
side, and would be empowered to request the witnesses on each side to show
them the experimental or other proofs of their statements, and they would re-
port to the Court all important corrections of statements made by the partial
witnesses which they might be able to make, as well as all other facts of
which they might be cognizant, bearing upon the question at issue.

   The functions of these judicial witnesses would, however, be confined to

statements of particulars of evidence. They would have no concern with

questions of law, and would accordingly be precluded from summing up the

particulars of evidence in favour of any conclusion, unless called upon bv the
judge to sum up any part of the evidence. The presence of these judicial

witnesses could not fail to act as a check upon the statements of partial

witnesses.

   The other form of remedy would consist in the appointment by the judge of
assessors competent to advise him respecting the evidence adduced by the

ordinarj- -witnesses.

The Committee is of opinion that the vast extension of natural knowledge

which has taken place of late years, and the corresponding development of

manufacturing processes, have necessitated the consultation in courts of law

of men cognizant of the principles involved in any processes under considera-

tion, and skilled in the art of eliciting information upon them by experi-

ments                              but they are of opinion that the action of such  persons requires some
                                ;

check of the kind above described.

   They trust that the Legislature may soon give to the subject that attention

which it so urgently demands.

- REPORT 1866.

                 Second Report on Maltese Fossiliferous Caves i^c.

                  By A. Leith Adams, M.A., M.B., F.G.S.

The Report I had the honour to lay before the Members of this Section at

the last Meeting of the Association contained a summary of my researches

and discoveries in connexion with the fossiUferous caves, fissures, and allu-
vial deposits of the Maltese Islands, but had more especially reference to
the contents of the Mnaidra Cave, which was then only partially exjilored.
Since that period I have been enabled to clear out the above remarkably pro-
ductive locality, and continue previous researches in other situations, and
bring together a large assemblage of fossil remains, which have been duly
forwarded to the Committee appointed to report on the excavations, together
with a detailed account of them, as far as I have been able to determine.

   Early in December 1865 the explorations in Mnaidi-a Cave were recom-

menced, at the point where they terminated (as stated in my last Report) ; and

they were continued with unabated vigour until the entire debris and fossili-
ferous remains were removed and attentively examined. Then the exact nature

--of the opening and mode of deposition of its contents became apparent.
   (1) Mnaidra Gap. Mnaidi'a, like similar gaps and fissures throughout the
islands, had at first sight the appearance of a cave ; but when attentively
examined afterwards, was found to present several roof-openings by which
its contents had been conveyed into the interior. It was therefore a simple
gap or hollow depression, covered in here and there by fragments of the
parent rock and stalactite. Its greatest length was 100 feet, the breadth
vaiying from 15 to 40 feet ; its eastern side and rounded extremity were
smooth and upright, inclining slightly inwards, whilst the western or oppo-
site side sloped at an angle of about 50°, thus contracting the breadth of the
canity to about 15 feet at the lower limits of the fossiliferous deposits, which
lay for the most part along the eastern wall. The lowennost deposits de-

scribed in my last Report continued much the same to the limits of the gap,

and showed no traces of organic remains. The brick-red clay on which the
fossiliferous deposit rested, was found to thin out towards the extremity, and
slope gradually downwards at a low angle to about the middle of the gap,
where it deepened and spread out towards the entrance on the edge of the
cliff. Precisely the same colour pervaded the overlying debris in which the
animal remains were distribiited, the largest accumulation of bones being

--found at the bottom of the incline that is, about the middle of the gap, where

the second series of explorations were begun in December 1865. Nor was
there any material change in the nature of the fossiliferous deposits : the
same thin stratum of sandstone pebbles, with teeth and fragments of bones
of the quadrupeds and birds, continued on to the fiu'thest extremity of the

--gap, and overlay the brick-red clay, succeeded by the red and blue clay,

intermixed with large blocks of sandstone the fossil remains being found in
the greatest abundance, and in the best state of preservation, wherever the

stones and clay predominated. The greatest thickness of the two latter
equalled 10 feet, but the average was not above 6 feet. The superficial white

calcareous di'ift on the top attained a depth of 9 feet in certain situations,

with angular fragments of sandstone and the parent rock intermixed. This
deposit showed aU the appearances of its having been derived from the de-
gradation of the two last-named formations, and was probably conveyed into
the gap by the same agency that brought the stones and clay, as teeth, tusks,
and bones of elephant, and remains of the lai'ge dormouse, also land shells,
were found here and there throughout, even to within a foot of the surface.

Thus the maximum thickness of the fossiliferous deposit equalled 18 feet. It

filled the cavity in the shape of a talus, narrowing at the upper and inner

extremity, and spreading outwards towards the entrance. There were, there-

--fore, three distinct kinds of arrangement of the fossiliferous deposits : Ist.

When water passed down its floor, bearing along with it small pebbles and

fragments and bones of teeth of the proboscidian, rodent, birds, and shells.

A2nd. sudden rush of water containing blocks of sandstone from the slope

above, soU, and portions or whole carcasses of the animals just mentioned, and,

finally, the scourings of the rock-surfaces and whatever organic remains and

debris were lying thereon. The mode of arrangement of the deposits indi-

cated that they had been borne down the west and north sides, from the cir-

cumstance that the debris and remains were piled wp pell-mell along the con-

cave eastern wall, the most perfect remains being found near the inner

extremity of the gap, whilst fragments of bones increased towards the entrance.

On the slope above, in the direction just indicated, were discovered several

sandstone blocks Ijdng in the pot-holes and waterworn crevices of the lower

limestone, as if they had been deposited there at the same time that the masses

were carried into the gap. Although many bones, especially those of the

feet, showed every appearance of having being introduced in the flesh, there

were not a few that testified by their cracked exterior and surface-decay, that

they had been bleaching in the open air before they were conveyed into the

gap. At all events the organic remains could not have been brought from

any great distance, as is exemplified by the perfect state of preservation of

the majority of the teeth and bones of the proboscidian. In my last Iteport I

estimated that remains of upwards of fiJfty individual elephants had been

identified up to the termination of the fii'st series of explorations                                                                                                                                                                                                                          since then
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

more than 100 elephants' teeth alone have been added to the above, besides

many important bones of the skeleton. The remains of the gigantic dormouse,

more especially at the upper extremity of the gap, were so numerous that

there was scarcely a square inch of the lower stratum that did not contain

--abundant relics of this rodent.
   (2) Gandia Fissure. The jihenomena represented by the Mnaidra gap were

again repeated inland in an ossiferous fissure in the calcareous sandstone in

the district of Gandia, three miles to the east. Here during the summer of

1865 I cleared out a gaping rent, communicating with the surface, and filled

to the depth of 8 feet with red earth and masses of the parent rock, among

which were discovered teeth of upwards of sixteen individual elephants, of
nearly aU ages, together with bones of the rodent, and those of water-birds,

including species of very large proportions, as evinced by the length and

--dimensions of the articulating surfaces of the bones the breadth across the

condyles of one femur being 2 inches. It is worthy of note that aU the ossi-

ferous cavities and deposits hitherto discovered in the Maltese Islands have

been either in the doAvncast or denuded districts. The latter embrace nearly

two-thirds of the island of Malta, viz. the whole of that portion eastward of
a line passing about N. and S. through Civita Vecchia. It is computed that
a thickness of from 400 to 500 feet of limestone, sand, marl, and sandstone

has entirely disappeared from the above locality. In some places the sand-
stone has been entirely denuded, bringing into view the lower limestone, which,

--from its hardness, has retained the traces of sea-action on its surface.
    (3) St. Leonardo Fissure. Another example of a similar description to the
two last described was afforded by the contents of St. Leonardo Fissure, situated

in the calcareous sandstone on the N.E. coast of Malta, and close to the sea,

which, however, had washed away the greater portion of the contents before

my attention was directed to the locality. Here, under precisely the same

conditions us just mentioned, I discovered teeth and fragments of a skeleton
of a young elephant. Such accumulations, either with or without organic
460 REPORT -]8G6.

remains, are common throughout the denuded district, displaying in every

--instance the same jjell-mell aiTangoment of their contents.
   (4) Benghira Gap. At the S.E. extremity of Malta, and five mQcs from
Mnaidra Gap, in the calcareous sandstone, is situated a little gorge, forming

an inlet up which the sea penetrates for 700 feet to the hase of an accumula-

tion of stratified blocks of sandstone and red soil, which fill the further end of

Mythe gap, and extend inwards for several hundred feet.  attention was

directed to this spot during the winter months of 1864, in consequence of

observing several elephants' teeth and bones lying among the debris. The

sides of this hollow incline at angles of 45°, embracing between them a

surface breadth of 110 feet of alluvial deposit, the maximum height being
32 feet. An entire section of this gap displays the following appearances :^

A layer of large partially waterworn blocks of sandstone, deiived from

the pale variety in which the gap is formed, occupies several feet of the

bottom, mixed up peU-mell with red soU and silt, derived from disintegrated

fragments of the same sandstone. Supeiimposed on the mass is a layer of

gravel and much waterworn pebbles of the parent rock, presenting the

hardening process by which the percolation of water highly charged with

carbonate of lime had for the most part converted them into a compact

limestone. The above passed into a stratum, 3 ft. in thickness, of red

loam highly impregnated with iron, and containing pebbles with a few

larger sandstone blocks ; the latter form another layer several feet in thick-

ness, on the top of the last. These blocks are far more roimded and water-

worn than the lowermost, with deep grooves and hollows scooped out on their

--surfaces, the largest attaining a girth of from ten to fifteen feet, and showing,

as in the case of all the stones in the gap, the metamorphic process referred

to, which proceeds from without inward, so that many present an outer ring of

a pale green limestone, whilst the inner part retains the original soft porous

texture of the rock. It was in this layer, situated from 22 to 25 feet from

the surface, that the greatest amount of organic remains was discovered, more

especially on the eastern side, where the blocks are not so numerous and the

soil is more closely packed between them than on the Avest side, where the

stones were more crowded, with little soil between them, and that of a finer

consistence, as if it had been ground by attrition between the blocks. As

before, another layer of pebbles and soil lay on the top of the last-mentioned

stratum and to within about 4 feet of the surface, where the deep-red

loam changed to a white calcareous drift, containing scattered fragments of

sandstone, which showed some appearances of stratification. Thus the sec-

tion displayed several distinct alternations of large blocks and layers of loam

and pebbles, representing peiiods of violence and comparative quiescence such

as might be expected from occasional violent floods and freshets succeeded by

less powerful currents which only bore down the lighter detritus. This is

well seen in the layers of red loam with waterworn pebbles interspersed

throughout at various levels, as if they had slowly sunk in the soft mud at

the bottom of a stream. The organic remains were discovered at all levels,

excepting in the white upper drift, and showed undeniable traces of the forces

which had acted so powerfully on the other contents. Among the large blocks

of sandstone were found portions, and, in one or two instances, seemingly

entire skeletons of elephants, together with numbers of the great dormouse,
between the masses of rock, as if the Rodent had been di-owned and had sunk

into the hollows between the stones. Fragments of birds' bones of large di-

mensions, together with those of the great river-tortoise, a small lizard aboiit

the dimensions of the common chameleon, and i'rogs, were met with chiefly in

the red loam and pebbly strata. Land shells in large numbers, principally

belonging to HcJix and ClaasUia, were frequently found under the largest

blocks, or strewn along with the other animal remains. Several skulls of

melephants with the toeth situ were found impacted between blocks as if

they had been retained by means of rock which had fallen on them with
considerable force, as was further testified by the underljing mass having been

cracked by the violent impact of the one above it. In one situation the right

lower ramus of an elephant, almost entire, with the loss only of its condyle,
was found jammed between two large blocks, one of which had struck the
jaw at the commencement of the diasteme on the inner side, and bent the

anterior portion nearly at right angles. Nevertheless tusks, almost entire,

were often met with even among the smaller stones. The bones and the
teeth were for the most part covered by calcareous incrustation, taking the
shapes of dendiites ; and frequently the larger bones, skulls, &c. were encased

in layers of stalagmitic red soil, as if the hardening of the matrix had been the

result of decomposition of the soft parts after deposition in the gap. The

extent of my explorations in Eeughira gap chd not exceed a section of about

8 feet in thickness ; nevertheless there turned up, more especially among the
large blocks, teeth of upwards of twenty-four individual elephants, of all
ages, from the unworn crown of the calf to the last true molar of the aged.

Several detached bones displayed traces of former exposure to the atmosphere,

by the presence of cracks and honeycombed perforations. The appearance

presented by this remarkable collection of organic remains seems to me to indi-

cate clearly that the gap had at one time formed the bed of a stream subject
to occasional violent Hoods, which bore down whatever animal remains came

within its reach. The direction of this ancient torrent-bed is not now trace-

able beyond a few hundred feet south-westward, owing to the changes of level
and the advancement of the sea on the coast-line. At all events the evidence
is strong that the aqueous agencies which conveyed the contents of Benghira gap

into theii- present situation must have been of no common order or intensity,

whilst the blocks were not conveyed from any great distance, at a peiiod, too,

when the denudation of the district was about the same as at i^resent.

   My recent explorations in the Maltese post-tertiary deposits clearly de-

monstrate that, besides the pigmy fossil elephant, so named by the late Dr.
Falconer from remains collected by Captain Spratt in the cave of Zebbug, I
have also found undoubted remains of an elephant which attained the di-
mensions of a small- sized Asiatic or African species. The data from which I

have deduced this statement have been fully recorded in papers sent to Pro-
fessor Busk, where the dental characters of upwards of 120 individual ele-

phants, besides the bones of the trunk and extremities, are set down with
studied care and accuracy. I have therefore been brought to the conclusion
that all the elephantine remains found by me in the Maltese alluvial deposits
belong to one species. For example, the largest last true molar found by me
gave a maximum length of 8-4 inches, and breadth of 2-3 inches, which is
about equal to the dimensions of intermediate size between the first and

 second true molars of the Asiatic elephant. Again, of four first milk-teeth,

only one of which showed well-marked signs of wear, the maximum length

 did not exceed -55 inch, whilst that of the Asiatic is usually between -6 and
 ·7 inch. All the tusks of the Maltese elephant had perfectly straight tips,
and curved gently, as in the recent species. The largest yet discovered was
found in Mnaidra Gap. It embraced a portion of the pulp-cavity, and 4 feet

2 inches of the body, and had a maximum girth of 15 inches, whilst at the

 distal fractured extremity it measured 13 inches, indicating that the species

could not originally have been under 5 feet in length. On comparing certain

vertebrae with those of the Indian elephant dissected by Blair, which was sur-
 mised to have been 26 to 28 years of age, and of middle stature, its height
 at the fore leg being at 8| feet, I find that the diameters of the bodies of two
462 REPORT--1866.

vertebrae from Mnaidra Gap slightly exceed those of the above. Allo'wing,

therefore, for discrepancies as to size of the tusks, it is apparent that the
owners of the above teeth and bones were not markedly diminntive species

compared with any living or fossil elephant. The question, however, whether
more than one species is represented by the remains in the Maltese
deposits deserves the fullest attention, from the able remarks read by Pro-
fessor Busk in a paper read before the Zoological Society of London with re-
ference to the Zebbug cave-deposits, none of which I have had an oppor-
tunity of examining, vsdth the exception of one molar ; and that I have found

equal to one of the intermediate teeth of the species here referred to.

   The dentition of the Maltese fossil elephant as observed by me furnishes

characters similar to the Loxodon group, whilst the crown-pattern resembles

closely that of Ehphas antiquus. The teeth, however, are relatively much

smaller, and present a different ridge-formula, which, from the extensive and
varied materials I have examined, appears to me, exclusive of talons, to stand

Milk-Molars.    True Molars.

   Remains of birds were very common in nearly all the localities, and em-

braced various species. Baptores of large dimensions were represented by
foot- and wing-bones from Mnaidra Gaj), Avhere likewise, as before stated,
water-birds, including gigantic Graihe and Anseres, were plentiful. The
presence of a very large river-tortoise was repeatedly confu-med by the dis-
covery of heads of femurs and other portions of the skeleton ; and besides the

testacea enumerated in my last Report, I have found associated with the ele-

phants' teeth and bones several specimens of a recent shell (HcUm sj3mtii)
hitherto only met with in the Maltese Islands, From a digest of aU the

evidences deducible from the geological stnicture and fossil fauna enumerated

in this and the previous Report, it may be inferred that the old Miocene for-

mation, of which the Maltese group are composed, underwent subsequently
extensive upheavals, and formed a considerable tract of land, tenanted by
vast herds of Hippopotami, elephants, and other quadrupeds, together with
birds and reptiles, almost specifically distinct from any species yet found else-

--wliere, and at a time when the land testacea were identical with those now

inhabiting the islands, that at a subsequent period the whole, or at least by
far the greater portion of this area, was again submerged under the sea, and
reelevated at a still later period, when, after various oscillations of level,
the subterranean movements ceased, leaving the present insular fragments.
The extent or direction of the ancient post-miocene land is at present a
matter of mere speculation ; but no doubt the obscurity hanging over the
subject will in time be dissipated, when the shores and other islands of the
great inland sea come to be carefully explored, especially Sicily, Candia, and

the Eastern Archipelago, also the western portions of the Mediterranean,
which promise rich stores, as has already been demonstrated by the wonderful

discoveries made by Captain Brome in the caverns and fissures of Gibraltar.
   I have in this and the previous Report attempted to lay before the Members

of the Geological Section a cursory account of my researches in the caves,

fissures, and alluvial deposits of the Maltese Islands and now that I have
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

finished my task, and been compelled by unavoidable circumstances to relin-
quish my labours, I cannot but here humbly express my high admiration of

the encouragement I have received from the Members of the British Associa-

MoN CHEK Ami, Je n'ai pas besoin de vous dire combien je regrette de ne

pouvoir pas accepter votre cordiale invitation povir assister a la British Asso-

ciation  de  cette  annee                             j'ai  ete  deux fois  a  cette                                                                                                                          reunion,  a York  et  a  South-

ampton, et j 'en ai rapporte les impressions les plus douces et les plus cheres

de ma vie. L' Association Britannique est une des Institutions que je desire

le plus de voir penetrer et s'enraciner en Italie.

Je regrette d'autant plus de ne pouvoir assister a la reunion qui aura lieu

en quelques jours a Nottingham, car j'aiu'ais voulu attirer I'atteution du Comite

siu- un sujet de recherche qui merite toute I'attention et I'encouragement de

r Association. Je veux dire, I'etude des courants electriques de la terre.

Dcpuis trois ans je m'occupe de ce sujet qui a interesse vivement en Angle-

terre beaucoup de savants et entre autres le celcbre Astronome de Greenwich.

L'obscurite et I'incertitude qui regnent encore raalgre ses travaux sur ce sujet

dependent principalement de deux causes ; c'est a dire, 1° de la maniere im-

parfaite d'operer qui introduisait des causes d'errcur dans les experiences : 2°

de rimpossibilite ou ont ete jusqu'ici tons les Physiciens qui s'en sont occupes

de varier convenablement les experiences. J'ai la certitude d'avoir absolument

ecarte la premiere difficulte et je crois de I'avoir prouve assez dans deux com-

munications que j'aifaites a 1' Academic des Sciences de Paris en 1864 sur les

courants electriques de la terre. Je vais bientot communiquer a la meme

Academic des resultats nouveaux et encore plus concluants. Je defie les

Physiciens qui se sont occupes jusqu'ici de ce sujet sans employer les elec-

trodes de zinc amalgame plonges dans la solution de sulfate de zinc neutre

et saturee, je les defie d'affirmer que les deviations qu'ils observent sont dues

a des coiu'ants electriques qui n'ont pas leur origine ou dans les electrodes,

ou dans les couches terrestres immediatement en contact de ces electrodes.

lis ont pu decrire de grandes variations des courants electriques dans leurs

circuits et rattacher ces variations aux aurores boreales ou a des tempetes

magnotiques, mais ils n'ont pu rien assurer sur la direction et sur la force des

courants terrestres. Ces defauts n'existent pas dans ma methode d'operer et,

soit qu'on opere avec les lames de zinc preparees comme je I'ai dit et plongees

dans les cylindres d'argile cuite qui plongent dans Feau de deux puits places

a I'extremite du circuit, soit qu'on tienne ces cylindres plonges dans une

couche de gravier de la meme qualite aux deux extremites et qui forment une

couche de a pen pres 1 metre cube, on est certain des deux manieres, que les

courants qu'on obtiendra dans ces circuits sont independants des causes d'erreur

et qu'on peut les appeler courants naturels de la terre. C'est ainsi que jo

regarde comme parfaitement e'tabli, qu'on a de ces courants toutes les fois que

les extremites du circuit plongent a des hauteurs differeutes dans le sol et que

ce courant est ascendant dans le fil metallique                                                                                                                                                               que la direction et I'intensite

de ces courants sont independantes de la position, de la hauteur, et de la con-

figuration de la partie metallique du circuit que lorsque les extremite's de
                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

cette ligne sont placees le long du meridien et plongent a une certaiue distance

entre elles, on a dans cette ligne une circulation d'electricite dont la direction

est constante et qui est sujette a des variations regulieres pendant le jour,

tandis que cette regularite et cette Constance cessent dans une ligne semblable

equatoriale.

Mais cette partie de ma methode ne suffit pas pour completer ces recherches.

II faut absolunient abandonner les ligiies telegraphiques et avoir des lignes

expresses pour cos experiences comme celles sur lesqneUes j'ai pu operer an
camp de St. Maurice, et avoir en nieme temps uu certain nombre d'aides pour

pouvoir executer une serio d' experiences dans lui temps qui ne doit jamais
etre trop long. II f'audrait done pouvoir se procurer du fil de ciuvre convert

de gutta-percha pour une longueur de 20 miles, qui au prix de £14 pour 1 mile
anglais, couterait £280. Evidemment, apres un temps d'a pen pres six mois

d'experiences on pent calculer que ce prix ne serait jias diminue de plus d'un

tiers. Ajant un terrain uniformc, horizontal, une plaine, il faudrait y con-
struire deux lignes a angles droits de 10 miles I'une, c'est a dire, dans le me-

ridien et dans I'equateur magnetique. Avant tout il faudrait s'assurer qu'il

n'y a pas de difference dans les resultats en operant sur une ligne suspcndue

sur des poteaux et sur une ligne parallele et souterraine. L'observateur

charge de ces experiences devrait etre place au point ou les deiix lignes so

croisent afin de pouvoir observer en meme temps les deux galvanometres ou

boussoles-taugcntes introduits dans les deux circuits. II faudrait au moins

deux observateurs pom- continuer les observations pendant toutes les 24 hemes.

Aux quatre extremites des deux lignes on devait avoir une garde chargee de

maintenir les extremites et les communications avec le sol en bon etat, et ces

gardes pourrait executer les modifications qui leur seraient iudiquecs d'avance.
il ne serait pas difficile d'obtenir avec une faible depense ces gardes d'une

administration telegraphique. En reussissant a s'assurer (comme j'ai raison
de croire qu'il en est aiusi) que les effets sent les memes dans une ligne sus-

pendue et dans une hgne souterraine, il y aurait de grands avautages a con-
struire souterraines les deux lignes que nous avons dites.

Les recherches principales devraient etre executees dans le but de connaitre :

1° I'influence de la longueur des lignes ou couches terrestiTS sur les com-ants

de la terre et cela en operant en meme temps sur trois lignes paralleles de 1

6 et 10 viiles : on pourrait apres operer sur ces trois lignes egalement i^aral-
leles mais placees normalement a la premiere position ; 2° Comparaison des
effets des lignes suspendues et des lignes souterraines ; 3° Influence de la
profondeur de la couohe ou plongent les extremites. Pour cela on devrait

avoir des lignes paralleles de la meme longueui', dont les exti'emites seraient

placees a la surface, a 1 metre a 2 metres de profondeur, se mettant a I'abri

de I'influence de I'humidite de la couche immid'uttement en contact des elec-

trodes. 4° Etude dans des conditions tres-variees de I'influence sur les cou-
rants de la terre de la difference de niveau ou plongent les deux extre-

mites. 5° Une assez longue serie d'experiences pour pouvoir comparer les

intensites et la direction de ces courants dans les deux lignes a angles droits

et de longueur variable dans les differentes heures de la journee. 6° Etude

comparative de ces phenomenes avec I'etat electrique de I'atmosphere et le

magnetisme terrestre. Apres m'etre occupe pendant si longtemps de ce sujet

je n'ai aiicune difficulte a afl&rmer qu'il y a la presque certitude de reussir a
resoudre ces questions avec clartc. Je n'ai pas besoin de dire que les rela-

tions entre ces courants electriques de la terre et le magnetisme terrestre et
I'electricite atmospherique sont certainement un des problemes les plus inte-

ressants de la physique terrestre ! on doit ajouter que tons ces phenomenes
sont intimement lies avec la nature et les lois de I'electricite, du magnetisme,

de I'attraction universelle.

   Je suis done fonde a recommander 1' etude de ce sujet aux encouragements

de I'Association Britannique pour les Sciences, et par consequent a son illus-

                Oil Plane Stigmaiics. Bij Alexan;)ee J. Ellis, F.E.S.

This paper is a continuation of that read at the Bath Meeting- (Report of tlie Brit.

Assoc. 1864, Trans, of Sections, p. 2). By means of diagrams the meaning of the

stigmatic line, stigmatic involution, stigniatic homography, and the stigmatic circle
was illustrated, and these were sho-wni to include the straight line and circle of
Descartes, and the involution and homography of C'hasles, as particular cases. The
imaginary points of intersection of a stright line and circle, the imaginary double
points, and imaginary double raj's of an involution and homography, &c. were, for

the first time, publicly exhibited on paper. And an attempt was thus made to show

that the principle of stigniatics, as explained in the papers cited, affords a complete
solution of the problem of the geometrical signification of iniaginaries in the
geometries of Descartes and Chasles, and establishes an imbroken agreement be-
tween ordinary algebra and plane geometrj'.

            On Practical Hyjisometr}/. Bif Alexander J. Ellis, F.P.S.

    If the heights of the barometer be B, b inches, the temperatures of the air A, a

degrees Fahr., and the temperatures of the mercury M, in degrees Fahr. at the
lower and upper stations respectively, then, for all British heights, the ditference of
the level of the two stations is

                    rB-&)x52400 _g, .,. .-i^ A + «+830

English feet to the nearest unit, with the same accuracy as by Laplace's complete
formula. Beyond the British isles, small corrections for the alteration of gravity
in latitude and on the vertical, have to be made, but when aneroid barometers

are used, these corrections may be neglected, as being- much inferior to the pro-
bable instrumental error. The heights must be taken in sections not exceeding

4000 feet eacli, both on account of the construction of the formula, and of tlie un-

known law of variation of temperature. When the decrease of the temperature of

the air does not vary nearly as the decrease of the height of the barometer, or
the observations at both stations, Avhen distant, are not simultaneous, or the two
stations are not nearly north-east and south-west of each other, the results of

barometric hypsometry must be received with great caution.

Description of a New Proportion-Table, equivalent to a Slidiwj-rule 13 feet
   4 inches lon<j. By J. D. Eteeett, D.C.L., Assistant Professor of Mathe-

    matics in Glasgow University.

   The distinctive feature of the new arrangement consists in breaking np each of
the two pieces which compose a sliding-rule into a number of equal parts, and ar-
ranoing these consecutiveh' in parallel colmnns, the columns in one of the two pieces
beino- visible through openings cut between the columns of the other. The large-

ness of the scale is such that the space from 1 to 1-1 is divided into a hundred parts,
the smallest of these being ^-V of an inch long. The material employed is Bristol
board, printed from copper plates, the dimensions of each board, exclusive of mar-

gin, being 16 by 8 inches.
   Multiplication and division can be performed by this Table with the same ac-

curacy as by fom'-figau-e logarithms, and with greater ease and expedition, Formulie
not aiiapted to logarithmic computation are thus rendered available, and with the

aid of a small table of natural sines and tangents the calculations of nautical astro-

nomy can be performed with great facility and with all needful accm-acy.

On certain Errors in the received Equivalent of the Metre, Sfc. By F. P. Fellows.

  On Tschirnhausen's Method of Transformation of Algehraic Equations, and

    some of its Modern Extensions. By the Rev. Prof. E. Haelet, F.E.S.

   It has long been known that any algebraic equation may be deprived of its second

term by a linear transformation. Tschirnhauseu introduced quadratic, and suggested

higher'transfomiations, and thus opened the way to great progi-ess in the theory.

He showed that by the solution of a linear equation and of a quadi-atic, any alge-
braic equation may be deprived of its second and third terms siuudtaneously. The
complete quintic 'may in this way be reduced to a quadrinomial form. Erland

Bring, Professor of History in the University of Lund, in a paper bearing date 14th
December 178G, seems to have been the first to extend Tscliirnhausen's method so
as to reduce the quintic to a trinomial form by depriving it of its second, third, and

Afourth terms simultaneously. (See a paper by Prof Harlev, entitled " Contri-

bution to the History of the Problem of the Reduction of the General Equation of

the Fifth Degree to a Trinomial Form," Quarterly Jom'nal of Mathematics, vol. vi.
pp. 38-47.) Bring's process has lately been simplified by ^Mr. Samuel Bills of

Hawton, near Newark ; and Prof Ilarley explained to the Section how Mr. Bills's

method might be extended so as to deprive the general equation of the «th degTee
of its second, third, and fourth terms by the solution of equations none of which

rise higher than the third degree ; and of its second, third, and fifth terms by the

solution of equations none of which rise higher than the fourth degi-ee. (See
" Mathematics fi-om the Educational Times," vol. i. pp. 8, 38-40, 57, 58.) Notice

was taken of the labours of other in^'estigators in the same field, particularly

Mr. Jerrard, Sir W. R. Hamilton, Chief Justice Coclde (Queensland), Prof Cayley,
and Prof Sylvester. The author concluded with some observations on the alleged

solutions ofthe general quintic by the late ]SL\ Jerrard and Judge Hargreave.

On Differential Resolvents. By the Rev. Professor R. Haeley, F.R.S.

The author gave a short accoimt of his researches on difierential resolvents,

particularly those connected with certain trinomial forms of algebraic equations,

.(in abstract of these researclies has recently been published by the Loudon Mathe-

matical Society. He also pointed out the coincidence of some of his own results

with those obtained about the same time, quite independently, by Chief Justice

Cockle, F.R.S., of Queensland.

   The author's remarks were arranged under three heads. First, he gave some
accoimt of Boole's system as developed in his ' Mathematical Analysis of Logic,'
and more elaborately in his great work on 'The Laws of Thought.' Next, he
noticed some remarkable anticipations of Boole's views. iVnd in the concluding
portion of his paper he pointed out the direction in which he believed Boole's

method might be usefuly extended.

   1. He contended that in Boole's system the fundamental laws of thought are

deduced, not, as has sometimes been represented, from the science of number, but
from the nature of the subject itself. Those laws are indeed expressed by the aid
of algebraical symbols, but the several forms of expression are detemiined on other
grounds than those which fix the iiiles of arithmetic, or more generally of algebra
they are determined in fact by a consideration of those intellectual operations
which are implied in the strict use of language as an instrument of reasoning. In
algebra letters of the alphabet are used to represent numbers, and signs connecting

those letters represent either the fundamental operations of addition, subti'action,

&c., or, as in the case of the sign of equality, a relation among the numbers them-

selves. In Boole's calculus of logic literal symbols (.?·, ?/, &:c.) represent things as

Subjects of the                                                  faculty of conception, and other  symbols (+,                                                                                                              --            &c.) are used to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,

represent the operations of that faculty, the laws of the latter being the expressed

'laws of the operations signified. For instance, x-\-i/ stands in this system for the

--aggregation of the classes or collections of things represented by .r and y, and x y

for what remains when from the class or collection .r the class or collection y is

Aristotelian syllogism are really symbolical ; but the symbols are less perfect of

their kind than those which are employed in this .system. By adopting algebraical

signs of operation, as well as literal symbols and the mathematical sig-u of equality,

Boole was enabled to give a complete expression to the fundamental laws of rea-

soning, and to construct a logical method more self-consistent and comprohonsi\e

than any hitherto proposed. His calculus does not involve a reduction of the ideas

of logic under the dominion of number ; but it rests on a fact which its inventor

--has rigorously established, viz., " that the ultimate laws of logic those alone upon
--which it is possible to construct a science of logic are mathematical in their form

and expression, although not belonging to the mathematics of quautit}'." The
term mathematics is here used in au enlarged sense, as denoting the science of the
laws and combinations of symbols, and in this view there is nothing imphiloso-
phical in regai-ding logic as a branch of mathematics, instead of regarding mathe-
matics as a branch of logic. The sjTnbols of common algebra are subject to three

laws, viz.

The law of commutation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ccy=yx,  (1)

The law of convertibility of terms                , x+i/= +y+.r,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      (2)
The law of distribution                          x (y+~) =xi/+xz                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      (3)

These laws are fundamental ; the science of algebra is built upon them. And they

are axiomatic ; each of them becomes evident in all its generality the moment we

clearly apprehend a single instance. Now Boole has shown that the same laws

govern the symbols of logic, and that therefore in the logical system the processes of

algebra are all Aalid. But at the root of this system there is found to exist a law,

derived from the nature of the conception of class, to which the symbols of com-

mon algebra are not in general subject. This law is named by Boole " the law of

duality,'' and is expressed by the equations

                               .r2=.r, y-=y, &c                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       (4)

Now Aiewing the equation x-=x as algebraic, the only values which will satisfy

it are and 1. If therefore an algebra be constructed in which the symbols

X, y, z, &c. admit iuditi'erently of the values and 1, and of these alone, it "follows
that " the laws, the axioms, and the processes of such an algebra are identical in

their whole extent with the laws, the axioms, and the processes of an algebra of

logic." Difference of interpretation alone divides them. Upon this principle

Boole's logical method is founded. Propositions are represented as equations

these are dealt with as algebraic, the literal symbols involved being supposed

susceptible only of the values and 1 ; all the reqinsite processes of solution are

performed; and linally the logical interpretation of the symbols is restored to

them. Some illustrations were given of the application of the method. That

mg^jtiOd, to use the originator's o^m words, " has for its object the determination

of any element in any proposition, however complex, as a logical function of the

remaining elements. Instead of confining oiu: attention to the ' subject' and the

' predicate,' regarded as simple terms, we can take any element or any combination

of elements entering into either of them, make that element or that combination

the ' subject ' of a new proposition, and determine what its ' predicate ' shall be,

in accordance with the data afforded to us." In the same way any system of

equations whatever, by which propositions or combinations of propositions can be

represented, may be analyzed, and all the "conclusion" which those propositions

involve be deduced from them.

2. Bacon, in his 'Novum Organum,' Liber Seeuudus Aphorismorum, A. XXWL,

notices incidentally an analogy that exists between a well-known axiom in ma-

thematics, and the fundamental canon of syllogism : he says, " Postulatum ma-

thematicum, ut qua eidem tertio aqualia sunt etimn inter se sint cequalia, conforme est
cum fabrica syllogismi in logica, qui imit ea qua? conveniunt in medio." On this-

passage E. Leslie Ellis remarks, " The importance of the parallel here suggested

was never imderstood until the present time, because the language of mathematics

and of logic has hitherto not been such as to permit the relation between them to be

recognized. I\Ir. Boole's ' Laws of Thought' contain the first development of ideas

of which the germ is to be found in Bacon and Leibnitz                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       to the' latter of whom the

=fundamental principle, that in logic a- a, was known (vide Leibnitz, Philos. Works,

by Erdmann, p. l-SO). It is not too much to say that Mr. Boole's treatment of the

subject is worthy of these great names. Other calculuses of inference (using the

word in its ·widest sense), besides the mathematical and the logical, yet perhaps

remain to be developed." (Bacon's Collected Works, vol. i. footnote on p. 281.)
The reference to Leionitz requires some correction, for on p. 130 of the edition

cited, there is nothing whatever relating to the logical question. Probably the

passage intended is that whicli occurs on p. 103, wliere Leibnitz, in a paper entitled
"])ifficiiltates quredam logic*, " makes a near approacli to the enunciation of the

fundamental law of logic, although he does not, either in that paper or elsewhere,

so far as is known, state the law explicitly. He does, however, observe that

AB=BA, which is Boole's law of  commutation                                                      and  fiu-ther, that  from  the  pro-

A AB= --position, all is B, we may infer that
                                A,^ an inference which, applied to the

A A A =identical proposition is A, gives us Boole's law of duality,                                   A. One of Leib-

nitz's illustrations of this inference is very curious. " Quidam se appellabat Grtjn-

BERG, viridis mons. Sodalis ei dicit, sufficeret ut Te appellares Berg, mons. Quid

ita ? respondet prior, putasne omnes montes esse virides ? Cui sodalis, ita, inquit,

nunc certe, nam testas erat. Ita illi naturalis sensus dictabat luec duo coincidere,

omnis mons est viridis et asqiiivalent viridis mons et mons." Boole did not become

aware of these anticipations by Leibnitz imtil more than twelve months after the
publication of his 'Laws of Thought,' when they were pointed out to him by E.

Leslie Ellis. Ellis subsequently addressed to Boole some " Observations,'' which

yet remain impublished, on some of the elementary parts of his system. These

" Observations," which are chiefly critical, throw much light on the -wi-iter's views

respecting the possibility of developing other calculuses of inference besides the

mathematical and the logical.

3. The space at our disposal for this absti-act will not permit us to print Ellis's

paper here in e.rtenso, but the following brief extract will give a tolerably clear

idea of its general character.

   " It appears to be assumed in Chap. III. Section 8 [' Laws of Thought '], that
in deriving one conception from another the mind always moves, so to speak, along

the line of predicamentation, always passes from the genus to the species. No

doubt everything stands in relation to something else, as the species to the genus,

and consequently the symbolical language proposed is in extent perfectly general,

that is, it may be applied to all the objects in the universe. But I veutiu-e to

doubt whether it can express explicitly all the relations between ideas which really

exist, all the threads of connexion which lead the mind from one to the other. It

seems to me that the mind passes from idea to idea in accordance with various

principles of suggestion, and that in correspondence with the diflerent classes of

such principles of suggestion, we ought to recognize ditterent branches of the general
theory of inference. This leads me to a further doubt whether logic and the science

of quantity can in any way be put in antithesis to one another. From the notion

of tan apple we may proceed to that of two apples, and so on in a process of aggi'e-

gation, which is the foundation of the science of discrete quantity. Or again,

from the notion of an apple we may proceed to that of a red apple, and this move-

ment of the mind in lined predicatnentali is the foundation of ordinary logic. But

it is plain it priori that there are other principles of suggestion besides these two,

and the following considerations lead me to think that there are other exercises of

the reasoning faculty than those included in the two sciences here refeiTcd to. In

the first place, certain inferences not included in the ordinary processes of conver-

sion and syllogism were recognized as exceptional cases by the old logicians. Leib-

nitz has mentioned some with the remark that they do not depend on the dictum

(le omni et mdio, but on something of equivalent evidence. The only question is

whether we should be right in considering these cases as exceptions, and if they are

so, to what they owe their existence. One instance is the ini-ersio relationis, e. g.
Noah is Shem's father, therefore Shem is Noah's son. Here we pass from the idea

of Shem to that of his father, and vice rers(i. The movement of the mind is along

a track distinct from that which we follow, either in algebra or what we commonly
call logic. The perception of the truth of the inference depends on a recognition

of the correlation of the two ideas, father and son."

The author gave his reasons for believing that, when the " exceptional cases " re-

ferred to in the above passage are fully investigated, and a calculus is devised for their

symbolical solution, it will be found that the processes involved in such a calculus

formally coincide with the processes commonly employed in the solution of func-

tional equations. He also pointed out that it was in this direction probably that

--Boole's method would be found to admit of extension an extension analogous

to that which Boole himself effected for the theory of the solution of differential

   The process is formally identical with the following :

   Examples of inference lying beyond the domain of the old logic are deserving

of much greater attention than they have hitherto received. Professor De Morgan
seems to be the only writer who has treated of such examples with any degree of

fulness and ability. ' (See papers on the Syllogism, and on the Logic of Relations,

    On Com2)lexes of the Second Order By Dr. Pluckee, F.R.S., of Bonn.

   Dr. Pliicker showed a series of models executed with great accuracy by ]\Ir. Ep-
kens of Bonn, calculated to illustrate his theory ot complexes of the second degree.
Such complexes are determined aualj-tically by equations of the second degree
between the coordinates of right lines'in space. In any plane whatever the lines
of such a complex envelope a curve of the second class, and every point in space is
the centre of a cone of the second order generated by lines of the complex. If _a
plane revolves round any line within it regarded as an axis, the variable conic
therein generates a surface. The same surface is enveloped by a variable cone of
the second order, the centre of which moves along the same axis. Surfaces of this
description are of the fom'th order and the fourth class. The axis is a double line
of the surface. The four circumscribed cones whose centres are the four intersec-
tions of the double line with the surface, degenerate into systems of two planes, each
of which touches the surface along a curve of the second order. In each of four
planes passing through the double line, the conic degenerates into two points ; these
points (singidar points of the surface) are the centres of cones formed by tangents
to the surface. The poles of the double line, with regard to all conies in planes
passing through it, are situated on a right line, through which pass the polar planes

of the^'doubleline Avith regard to all circumscribed cones.

   The surfaces even of the more general description are easily constinicted ; the
models exhibited belong to the special case where the double line is at an infinite
distance. In this case the surfaces are formed by curves of the second class in
parallel planes, having their centres on a light "line. The circumscribed cones

become circumscribed cylinders.

On the Partition of the Cube, and some of the Combinations of its parts. By

   Charles M. Willich, late Actmrij and Secretanj to the University Life

Assui'ance Society.

A cube maj^ be divided iuto equal aud uuiforin bodies in various ways.

1st, B}' lines from the centre to the eight angles of the cube, which will give six

four-sided pyramids (B).

2nd. By lines from one of the upper angles of the cube drawn diagonally to the
opposite angles, dividing the cube into three equal and uniform solids. Each of these

solids being^halved, forms a left- and right-handed solid. These six bodies pro-

duced though equal in mass, differ so far in shape, as three may be termed left-
handed and three right-handed, in the same way as the hands of the human body.

.3rd. By lines drawn from the centre to four angles of the cube, and continued on

each facej will produce four equal and similar bodies(G), each composed of two three-

sided pyramids united at their base--the one having the same angle as the trihedi-al

roof of 'the Bee's cell, viz. 109° 28' 16", the other 9(P. These bodies rearranged

produce the half of a dodecahedron with rhomboidal faces.

4th. Another division of the cube may be made producing the tetrahedron and

octahedron, viz., by diagonal lines from two of the upper angles of the cube, con-
mtinued on the other faces, will cut off' four three-sided pyi-amids, leaving
                                                                                                   the

centre a tetrahedron. The four three-sided pyramids cut off" may be so aiTanged as

to produce the half of the true octahedron.

   The four-sided p;sTamid obtained by the first mode of division being cut into
two portions by a diagonal line will produce a body which I have assumed as a
unit (A) for the construction of many geometrical and ciystalline bodies. The
models laid before the Association show some of the forms produced. The rhom-

boidal cube (J), and the rhomboidal dodecahedi'on (I.) with pyramidal faces (con-

tainino- in mass one-half of the cube from which it is derived), may be considered
interesting ; but the various ciystalline figures which may be formed by a combi-

nation of my unit (A) I cannot even estimate--though probably all geometrical
solids and even many, if not all, crystalline bodies may be included, if we use sec-

tions of bodies produced by a partition of the cube.

   It may be observed that the pyramid (B), or one-sixth of the cube, which con-
tains two units, may itself be divided juto four bodies by sections parallel to the sides,

each of which is one-third of a cube containing one-eighth of the mass of the cube

from which it was derived ; so that, in fact, we may go on dividing and reproducing

bodies of a similar shape, and still retaining the same angles as in the portion from

the original cube, flow far this subdivision may be earned in nature, or how

niuch fiirther than our powers of vision will reach, I will not venture an opinion.

We can imagine that the commencing atoms may be infinitely small when we

remember the wonders revealed by the microscope.
    I entertain a sanguine hope that, should the attention of philosophers be drawn

to this subject, the further development may perhaps be the means of throwing

 some unexpected light as to the shape of an atom. I incline, however, to think

 that atoms may differ in shape in the three kingdoms of nature--mineral, vegetable,

and animal.   practical  use  in  education,  I  am of opinion     ,  tihe  s^tujdy      j.  geometj.iy

HemarJcs on the Variable Star lately discovered in Corona Borealis.

                          By J. R. Hind, F.R.S.

Early in June last the author received a letter from Mr. W. Barker, of the Customs

Department, London, Canada West, stating that the remarkable variable star in

Corona Borealis, which was seen in Europe on May 13, had been discovered by him

--on the 4th of that month. He thus descriljes its variations : " I first observed it

on the 4tli of May at 9 p.m., when it was somewhat brigliter than Epsilon Coronaj

it rapidly increased until the lOtli, whenit was fullj- as bright as Alphacca (Alpha

Coronte) ; it was at its maximum. On the 14th it had decreased to the third

magnitude, on the 18th to the fifth. On the 19th I could just discern it, and on

the 20th 1 could see it no longer with unaided vision. On the 20th I observed it

mythrough  telescope (one of Cooke's 5 feet 4 inch object-glasses).  With a power

of 133, it showed a beautiful clear disk, and was exceedingly brilliant, and had a

ruddy tinge. I still see it as a telescopic star ; its light about equal to the com-

panion of Polaris." As far as the author was at present informed, Mr. Barker did

not make a public announcement of his discovery until the 16th of May, when he

communicated a paragraph to the ' London Free Press,' and forwarded copies of

--the paper to various astronomers in this country. It rims thus : " Asti'onomers will

be interested to learn that a new .star has made its appearance in the constellation

of Corona Borealis. It is of the third magnitude, and is situated about one degree

S.E. by E. of Epsilon Corona", and three degrees from Pi Ophiuclii, in a direct line

between the two. It also forms the apex of an equilateral triangle with Beta and

Zeta Ilerculis. Hour of observation, 9 p.m., 14th May, at London, C.W." It will

be remarked that in this communication no reference is made to any observation of

the star previous to the 14th of May,-probably because Mr. Barker merely intended

his notice to refer to its appearance .at the date of his letter. But these observa-

tions are of historical and scientific value ; and the author has not failed to press

for any further particulars or corroborative facts which it may be in Mr. Barker's

power to furnish. Several European astronomers, ignorant of Mr. Barker's observa-

tions, have conjectured that the star must have burst forth with astonishing sud-

denness. Mr. Schnadt, of Athens, a practised observer, thought it could not have

been so bright as a star of the fifth magnitude on the 12th of May, early in the

evening, or he must have perceived it ; and M. Courbisse, at La Eochelle, was

convinced it was invisible to the naked ej^e on the 11th; yet at this date it must

have shown, according to Mr. Barker's observations, as a star of the second mag-

nitude. This is by no means a solitary instance in proof of the little value which

attaches in many cases of a similar kind to merely negative evidence. In his own

astronomical practice the author had met with startling instances, and striking ones

may be found in the history of tliese phenomena of variable stars. Tyclio Bralie
thought the celebrated new star of 1572, which he detected on returning home
from his laboratory, and which was then shining as a star of the first magnitude, could

not have been visible an hour or so previouslj', and yet, keen observer as he was,

he is well known to have been preceded by several clays in the discovery of that
wonderful object. Astronomers generally, however, may not be disposed to attach
so little weight to negative evidence in a case of this kind, as from his own expe-
rience Mr. Hind was inclined to do, and it will be most desirable to possess every
particular relating to Mr. Barker's observations between the 4th and 14th of May,
which it may be in his power to furnish. ]Mr. Barker thinks he saw this star one
or two years earlier, when the constellation was in the S.E., about 9 p.m., and Sir
John Herschel announces his having recorded a star in this very position in one of
his revisions of the heavens. The apparition of this star will be memorable as

having afforded an opportunity of applying the spectrum-analysis to one of this

class of objects. The valuable and highly interesting observations by Mr. W. Hug-

gins and others are the results.

On a New Geometrical TJieorem relative to the Theory of Reflexion and Re-
      fraction of Polarized Light {hotropic Media). By M. A. Coentt.

   The direction of the luminous vibration relatively to the plane of polarizatiou
of a ray has not been yet stated in a way which is quite incontestable. Fresnel, in
his admirable memoir ' On the Mechanical Theorv of the Reflexion and Befraction

of Bolarized Light,' concludes that the vibration is perpendicular to the plane of

polarization. JPCullagh and Neumann have arrived at the same formula}, but

by supposing, on the contrary, that the vibration is within the plane of polariza-
tion. It seems that no middle temi can exist between these two theories, and

that the three rays have necessarily their vibration in the identical position com-

pared Avith their respective plane of polarization. However, there is a third me-

--thod, or, in other words, a third theory, extremely simple, the author would not

--say extremely plausible,^ which will lead us to the opinion of Fresnel respecting

the refracted ray, and to the opinion of M'^Cullagh respecting both the others.

The onlj' principle to be admitted, besides the exact transversality of the vibrations,
--is the following the refracted vibration is perpendicular to the incident and re-
Weflected vibrations.
                       have, indeed, no theoretical gi-ound for admitting, a priori,

this principle ; but if the consequence of it agree with the results of the other

theories, it deserves to attract the attention of theorists in optics, and, in fact,

it -will constitute a new theorem. With the help of this principle, it is easy to

detei-mine the position of the reflected and refracted vibrations, if the position of
the incident vibration is given. The resulting formula is

                       _ -- =tan X
                                             ;
                       tan /13                                      ,

                       cos (^-- ?·) cos {i-\-r)  cot y,

in which os, ^, y are the angles of the incident, reflected, and refi-acted vibrations

Avith the plane of incidence, i and r the angles of incidence and refraction. Seeing

that the vibrations are besides transversal, the above formula determines them

completely. But if this theoiy is exact, that formida is nothing else than the ana-

--lytical translation of the law of the rotation of tlie planes of polarization of the

three rays a law first stated by Fresnel, and which, according to the same rota-

tions, may be written

                        = -- =--cot ct

                       cos (* -- r)
                          cot~H                                    .
                       cos (1+ /)

arrives, on the contrary, at the expression

                 tan a        tan /3

                 cos (i->r) - cos (i+,^-^°^ y-

    It is obvious that oiu' formula agrees with tlie formula of Fresnel for the refracted
ray, and with the formula of M'^CuUagh according to the incident and reflected
rays. It is easy to conclude, from this theory, that imder the normal incidence

the luminous vibration rotates a right angle when the ray penetrates into the second
medium. It would be interesting to look for a direct veritication of that conclu-
sion l)ut it seems difficult to realize an experiment in which the surfaces limiting

                          ;

the medium do not produce an even number of those rotations, so that the vibra-
tion does not come again to its first direction. The author could have stated

this property of polarized light under a more modest form, that is to say, as a

simple corollary of known theorems ; but he fancied that it was more useful, in the
actual state of optics, to state it as a new theory, in order to show, first, that the

geometrical simplicity of the principles does not constitute the most plausible

theories : thus it is prudent to conclude that the greater geometrical simplicit)' of the
M'^Cullagh tlieory is no sufficient ground for rejecting the theory of Fresnel, though

more complicated. Besides, the proposal of a new principle, very little obvious, u
priori, is a good occasion to remember the feeble degree of evidence for the prin-

ciples used in the other theoiies. After a further examination, it will appear that
it is neither more nor less difficult to admit that the refracted vibration is perpen-
dicular to both the others, than to admit, for the density of the luminous ether,

the theories of Fresnel or j\PCullagh.

On Dispersion-equivalents. By Dr. J. H. Gladstone and Rev. T. P. Dale.

   The refractive index of a substance minus unity, divided by its density, is termed
its " specific refractive energj'," and the product of this and its atomic weight, or

P . , 18 termed its " refraction-equivalent." But the refractive index fi differs

the extremes in the two directions which can be measured under ordinary circum-
stances, jx\i--y.\ has been taken as the measure of dispersion; and in a previous

paper the authors had called  --= the " specific dispersion." Hence the dif-

                                                                    ,

-^the " Dispersion-equivalent ; " and as P   is little affected by the manner in

which the substance is combined with other bodies, it becomes a matter of interest

to inquire whether the same holds true with respect to P ^h            ^a
                                                                                   .

It has been abundantly shown that the refraction-equivalent of the combination

Clio is 7-0 : its dispersion-equivalent, as determined from eight different substances

or series belonging to the great vinic group of organic compounds, varies only

within the limits of 0-32 and 0-38, the mean being 0-35. But when we turn to the

benzole group its dispersion-equivalent is found to be 0-62, and in the pyridine

group 0'58.

The determinations of the dispersion-equivalents of chlorine, bromine^ and iodine

also differ, when they are made from different groups.

  --Spectre de la vapeur d'eau. L^ne experience directe qui demontre definitivement

Uncette propriete vieut d't5tre faite a Paris dans I'usiue de la Compagnie du Gaz.

tube de fer de 37 metres, ferme aux extremites par deux glaces, a ete rempli de
vapeur a diverses pvessions. Le tube de fer etait place dans une enveloppe de hois
rempli de sciure de bois pour empecher les deperditiou de la chaleur. La lumiere

etait domiee par une rampe de 16 bees de gaz. On salt que cette lumiere donne un

spectre continu et sans raies ; or, quand la lumiere eut traverse le tube plein de
vapeur a 7 atmospheres, elle donna uu spectre sillonne de raies et bandes obscures
correspondant aux raies et bandes atmospheriques terrestres ou telluriques du spectre
solaire. (Ce sont les bandes decouvertes par I'iUustre Sir Da^id Brewster quand
le soleil est a I'horizon.) L'experience a ete repetee dans des circonstances diverses.

On a examine les eftets de la longueur du tube et ceux de la pression. Les raies

se developpent a mesure que la longueur augniente ou que la pression s'dleve ; elles

s'aflfaiblissent dans les circonstances opposees. Quand le tube est vide de vapem- ou
qu'il en contient fort peu, on ne voit aucune raie. Le resultat est done parfaitement
constate. J'ai interrompu les experiences pour venir en faire part au Congres, mais je

compte en poursuivre les consequences.

   En attendant je puis deja conclure :
   1. Que les raies du spectre solaire dans les regions rouge, orangee, jaune, sont

presqiie toutes dues a la vapeur d'eau de uotre atmosphere.

   2. Qu'il n'y a pas de vapem- d'eau autour de la photosphere solaire..

   3. Que la decouverte du spectre de la vapeur d'eau vient confirmer les resultats
obtenus par M. Tyndall, touchant Taction absorbante de cette vapeur sur la chaleur

rayonnante.

On a Fhiid 2yossessinr/ Opposite Eofatory Poivers for Rays at opposite ends of

                  the Spectrum. By Professor John H. Jellett.

The existence of this fluid was discovered in conducting a series of experiments

with a new saccharometer which the author had formerly described to the Eoyal

Irish Academy *, and which he now exhibited to the Section. In making use

of this instrument, it became necessary to compare the rotatory powers of tlie two

--well-lcnown species of oil of turpentine, namely : 1. The American oil of turpen-

tine, which  is  obtained  from   the Pimis  australis  of North  Carolina                                             and  2.  the
                                                                                                                    ;

French oil of turpentine obtained from the Phuis maritima of Bordeaux. As

these fluids, which are opposite in their rotatoiy powers, are chemically identical,

and verj' slightly different in their refractive and dispersive powers, it was natural

to expect that no difficulty would be found in determining the relative lengths of

two columns of these fluids respectively, which should perfectly compensate each

other. Two columns of fluid are said to compensate each other when a ray of

polarized light, transmitted successively through these columns, emerges from the

second column in the same state in which it entered the first. The actual result,

however, was wholly different from this anticipation. When the relative lengths

were so determined that the intensity of the light transmitted respectively by the

two parts of the analyzer f was the same, the colours of these two spectra were
wholly different. In reasoning on the difference of colour, the author was enabled

to perceive that the American oil of turpentine was much more highly dispersive

of the planes of polarization of the elementary rays than the French oil. It is

plain, therefore, that if the lengths of the columns be so proportioned that the

rotation maybe the same for tlie mean ray, the more dispersive (in the sense just

defined) fluid will turn the plane of polarization of the red ray through a less

angle, and that of the violet ray through a greater angle than the less dispersive

fluid. Hence, remembering that French oil of tui-pentine is left-handed, and

American oil of tui-pentine right-handed, it is plain that if a red ray be trans-

mitted through two columns, whose lengths are so proportioned, the total effect

will be left-handed rotation ; whereas, if a violet or a blue ray be so transmitted,

the effect will be right-handed rotation. As these fluids, being identical in com-

position, could scarcely act chemically on each other, the same effects might be

expected from a single fluid produced by mixing these two columns.

This the author found to be, in fact, the case. The rotating fluid was fomied

by mixing the two oils in the following proportion J :

             American oil of turpentine                           G7

             French oil of tui-pentine                            3.3

   "When a column of this fluid, whose length was 4 inches, was traversed by a
solar ray which had been previously transmitted through plates of red and blue
glass, the rotation produced in the plane of polarization of this, which is the ex-

--treme red ray, was found to be 1° 35'.

   Again, when the same column was traversed by a ray which had been pre-

viously transmitted through a solution of animoniacal sulphate of copper, the
rotation was found to be +2°.

   This phenomenon is best shown with solar light, but it may be shown, though

·with less distinctness, with the electric or oxy-calcium lights.

   The autlior at a previous Meeting described the method by which he secures the
durability of iadia-rubber. Diagrams representing the effects of pressure and im-
mersion were shown, from which it was seen that pressure improves the insulation
of his wire in tlie same way as is observed with gutta percha. The result of care-

fully-conducted experiments, extending over three years, proves that the absorption
of water is so small that the most refined electrical tests failed to discover it.

   Extract of a Letter from Senhor Capexlo, of the Observatory, Lisbon, on

      Maynetie Disturbance, to Balfouk Stewart, of the Kew Observatory.

   The author sent three Tables representing graphically tlie most important
residts deduced from the curves of our magnetographs for the year 1864. lie had

followed the plan of General Sabine in separating the greatest disturbances of the
three elements. Thus he had considered as a disturbance of the declination every

ordinate which diflered from the monthly mean by 2' -3 or upwards; while the
separating value for the horizontal force was -0011 of the whole horizontal force,
and that for the vertical force '00032 of the whole vertical force. The instruments
were at work during the whole of the year 1864 ; and of the 8760 hourly observa-

tions of each instrument, the observers only failed in measuring 97 for the declina-
tion, 139 for the horizontal force, and 159 for the vertical-force instrument. The
number of disturbances have been

For the declination       1043
For the horizontal force   810
For the vertical force     982

  From a diagram exhibited, giving the hourly variations yearly and half-yearly of

the three elements, it was seen that the progress of the declination for each period
is very regidar. The mean daily range of declination during the six months from
April to September, while the sun is north of the equator, is 9'-20; while during
the six months from October to March, when the sun is south of the equator, this
range is less, being barely 6'. For the dip, the corresponding curves are much
disturbed from 6 p.m. to midnight, especially for the six months when the sun is
north of the equator. The total force gives a well-pronounced minimum at 11 a.m.
during the six summer months, and ll'' 30"" a.m. during the six winter months.
The daily range is gTcatest for the six summer mouths, and least for the six winter

months.

   The diagi'am of disturbances gives for the declination a maximum of the westerly
distm-bances at about 8 a.m., and a minimum about 10 in the evening. On the
other hand, the maximum of easterly distiu'bances is about 10 in the evening, and
the minimum about 6 in the morning.

   The curves for the horizontal-force disturbances are irregidar. The maximum

of disturbances tending to increase the horizontal force takes place about noon,

while the minimmn is about 1 a.m. But here one is much struck with the great

disproportion between the distm-bances tending to increase and those tending to

diminish the horizontal force, the latter being both the most numerous and the

gi'eatest in amount. The maximum and minimum of these latter disturbances take
place a little later than the maximum and minimimi of the disturbances tending to

increase the force.

   With respect to the vertical force, the curve of disturbances tending to increase

this element resembles to some extent the curve of easterly disturbances, or disturb-

ances tending to diminish the westerly declination. In this same diagram blue and
--14 REPORT 1866.

red curves were made to represent the whole effects of the perturbations, or the
quantities which it is necessary to apply to the line of no distiu-bance, reckoned a
straight line, in order to reconstruct the ciirves with the perturbations.

   Thus the effect of disturbances upon the declination is to cause the needle to
deviate towards the west diu-ing- the hours of the day, but towards the east during

the hours of the night.

   The effect of disturbances upon the vertical force is of a reverse kind, tending to

diminish this element during the hours of the day, but to increase it duiing those
of the night.

   With regard to the horizontal force, it appears that the distm-bances tend to

diminish this element almost diu-ing the whole of the twenty-four hom-s.

  A third diagram represented the mean hom-ly movements of the north pole of

the freely suspended needle in a plane perpendicular to the direction of such a
needle, both for the whole year, and also for the winter and simmier seasons.

On a Neiu Method of Testing Electric liesistance. Bi/ C. F. Taeley.

In 1860, Prof. Thomson and Fleemiug Jenlrin, F.R.S., invented a method of ob-

taining exact subdivisions of the potential of a voltaic battery. The apparatus con-
sisted of a number of equal resistance-coils, sa}' 100. These were connected one

witli one pole of the battery, and the other with the other pole. To the function

of each coil a piece of metal is attached, and a spring attached to a brass slide tra-

velling along a square rod of the same metal traverses these different pieces, and so
makes contact with whichever is desired. If the two poles of an electrometer be

attached, the one to one pole of the battery, and the other to the brass bar on which

the slide travels, it will be found that at the one end we have the full potential

power, and at the other end nothing at all, and halfway half the potential; this is

too self-e\-ident to require furflier explanation, and is explained in Thomson and
Jeukin's patent, 1860. Prof. Thomson has recently succeeded in making reflecting

electrometers of such sensiWlity that they will give 200 scale-divisions for a varia-

tion of potential equal to one cell of Danieirs battery. In testing the Atlantic

Cable this electrometer was used in the following way at Yalentia, to get the po-
tential of the ship's magnetism. The one pole of the electrometer was connected

with the cable, and the other one with the slide, and by running it up and down
the exact potential of the cable was measured. There were in the jnaia slide ICO

coils of 1000 units each, and it became necessary to subdivide these again 100
times to get sufficient accuracy. Some difficulty presented itself in getting a
method for subdividing these coils, and the author v^as fortunate enough to hit
upon the following verj' simple method of effecting this pm-pose. The slide con-
sists of two square brass bars, over each of which travels a piece of brass, to the
bottom of which is attached a spring, pressing upon the studs connected «'ith

the resistance-coils. Instead of using 100 coils in the main slide, the author

uses 101, and makes the two springs to embrace two coils. Thus, then, the
two bars of the slide have invariabh' a resistance between them of 2000 ohmads.
The two bars are connected with a second set of 100 coils, each coil hav-
ing 20 units resistance, and the 100 coils making up precisely the same resistance

as that of two of the coils in the main slide. These two circuits of 2000 units each

reduce ihe resistance to one-half, or to 1000 units, so that the resistance of the 101

coils of 1000 each is reduced to that of 100 coils. By passing the traveller along

the 20 unit coils in the second slide an exact subdivision of the potential between

these points is  obtained                                     and  in this way the potential  of the  battery is  accurately
                                                           ;

and quickly subdivided to 10,000 parts. By these means Prof. Thomson has beeii

able to introduce a method of testing, on the Wheatstoue balance system, so ex-

tremely simple that it should be made known as soon as possible. 'The battery is

connected permanently to the main slide, so that a current is always passing through

it. Its resistance, 100,000 ohmads, is such that no sensible elevation of tempera-

ture is produced. The cm-rent is also passed into the cable through a definite re-

sistance, E. At the junction between the end of the cable and the resistance II a

key is attached, whicli is connected by either the reflecting electrometer or a re-
flecting galvanometer with the slides". That position is sought upon the slide
which has precisely the same potential as that of the cable at the point where it

joins the resistance E. If now the potential of the battery be represented by j), and

Ethe resistance of the junction of the cable with be represented hj p^, and if the

two portions of the coil necessary to balance this potential be n and m, it will be

evident, on the principle of the "NMieatstoue Balance, that n:m::Ii: cable .r (the

On the Climate of Aldershot Camp. By Sergeant Aenold, F.M.S.

The military station of Aldershot is in the countj' of Hampshire, bordering on

Surrey, and is" situated on an elevated site, about 320 feet above the level of the
sea. It is distant about 40 miles from London, and about 50 fi-oni Portsmouth and

Southampton, being in lat. 51° 15' 25" N., long. 45° 36' W. The extensive area

of ground occupied by the North and South Camps was formerly a barren heath,

the soil consisting mostly of sand and gravel, covered by about seven inches of peat.

On the north and south the Camp is much exposed : on the east it is slightly

sheltered by hills that rmi from the eastern boundary of the North Camp to the

Soiith.  On the south-east is  a  range        of hill, called' the  " Hogsback "                                                        these  are

the highest in the neighbourhood, attbrding great protection to the cultivation of

hops, which is carried on so successfully that their growth is rapidly extending.

The north-west and west are bounded by land under cultivation. Small woods or

copses are numerous in the locality, consisting principally of stimted fir-trees and

Abrushwood.  small river named Blaclcwater is the only one in the vicinity.

   Meteorological observations during tlie past eight years yield the following

--results : The mean height of the barometer at 325 feet above the mean sea-level

is 29-610 inches ; this, however, is only an average of seven years, a standard in-

strument not having been used for the whole of 1858. The highest observed

reading of the barometer was 30-452 inches on Januai-y 9th, 1859 ; the lowest,

28-269^ inches on January 14, 1865 (these observations being reduced to 32°

--Fahrenheit). The adopted mean temperature of the air is as follows : January,

88°-4; February, 39°;  March, 42°-l ;          April, 48° -4 ;       May, 5.3° -2 ; June,                                                58°-8

range of temperature being 15°-8. The highest temperature was 93° on July 12,

1859, and the lowest 8° on December 29, 18G0, so that the extreme range of

temperature is 85°. The mean degi-ee of humidity (saturation= 100) is as
follows :--January, 89°; February, 82°; March, 84°; April, 76°; May, 78°;

June, 78°; July, 78°; August, 78°*; September, 85°; October, 86°; November, 90°;

December, 89°. The yearly mean is 83°. The amount of cloud is estimated on
the usual scale, being a clear sky, and 10 an overcast sky. The mean amount is
O-l. The month in which the largest amount of cloud occurred was December (7-2),
and the least (5-1) in September. The indi-^-idual monthly averages show that the

most cloud state (8-5) occurred in December 1805, and the least (3-2) in Jime 1859.
Eain falls on an averase of 143 days of the year. The greatest number of days
was 183 in 1860, and ithe least 11-3 in 1864. The average yeariy rainfall is 25-24
inches. This is less than at any other station in Hampshire. The greatest yearly
total was 33-89 inches in 1860, the least 17-13 inches in 1858. The greatest

monthly fall was (5-80) in October 1865, and the least (0-16 inch) in February

1858. Taking the average of eight years, the wettest month is October, the mean

amoimt being 2-96 inches, and the driest February, being 1-23 inch. The mean

 tioiis of winds are from the N. on 80-1 days, from the E. on 72-3 days, from the S.

 on 887 days, and from the W. on 123-7 days. The force of wind was estimated

 from to (3; being a cahn and 6 a hmiicane, the mean force heing 0-Q; but
 Robinson's anemometer is not stationary more than twice a year.

    During a residence of nearly ten years in the camp the author has had the good
 fortune to observe that, in comparison with any other station, civil or military, its

      On an Error in the usual method of ohtaimng Meteorological Statistics.

                          By Peancis Galton, F.B.S., F.O.S.

    The meteorological statistics of the ocean have been hitherto obtained by ex-
 tracting observations from the logs of different ships, and by sorting those that
were made in ditferent geographical divisions of the ocean into corresponding
 groups. The usual geographical divisions are bounded by each 5th degree of
 latitude and longitude, and they therefore are 300 miles in length, and have an
 average breadth of loO miles. Each of the "roups is treated as if it were composed
 of observations taken at irregular periods, by a single person stationed at a hxed

 observatory in the centre of the group, that is to say, the barometer, thermometer,

and other elements are determined by computing the simple mean of all the re-
corded observations. The propoi-tion of winds that IjIow from the diflerent points
 of the compass is computed in a similar manner. Only one limitation is exacted in

 respect to the admission of an observation into a group. It is that it should not

have been made at an interval of less than eight hours from any other observation
by the same ship, already included in the same group. Were it not for this limi-
tation, a zealous observer might contribute hourly, or j'et more frequent observa-
tions, which, by their multitude, would prevent the scantier observations of other
ships from exercising a just influence on the a\'erage. In an extreme case of this
description, the weather met with by a single ship on one particular voyage might
mainly govern the computed results.

    In a recent report on the condition of the Meteorological Department of the

Board of Trade by ^Ir. Farrer, Captain Evans, and himself, were pointed out many
objections to the existing methods of computing ocean statistics. The object of
the present paper is to draw attention to yet another objection, and to show that

an additional limitation is required before an observation ought to be admitted
into a group. The objection was, that the observations made by a sailing ship are
more numerous in respect to antagonistic winds or calms than in respect to
favourable weather. Therefore, as some parts of the ocean are mainly frequented
by outward-bound and others by homeward-bound ships, the means of the re-
corded observations in those parts must differ materially from the true average

weather. When favourable "u-inds are blowing, a ship is rapidly wafted across the

area of observation, and comparatively few observations are made within it. The
wind may continue blowing, but the ship is unable to record its continuance after
it has left the area in question. On the other hand, if an antagonistic wind blows,
or if calms or light breezes prevail, then the ship is delayed within the area, and
continues making observations during the whole, or nearly the whole period
of their continuance. Taking one course with another, a ship sailing -with a
favourable wind crosses one of the usual five-degree divisions of the ocean in twenty-

four hours, or, in other words, in three eight-hourly periods of observation. There-

fore the observations made by a ship resemble observations made at a fixed obser-

vatory under the instructions that only three eight-hourly observations were to
be taken din-ing the continuance of winds, say, from the northerly quadrant, but

that when the wind was in the southerly quadrant the observations were to be
continued dming the whole of its duration. No one would be inclined to accept

gical Department. The weather under which a ship enters a division may be of

any description whatever, except that of an absolute cahn in a sea without a cur-
rent, and therefore has no bearing- on the present question. It must furtlier be
observed that the error he had pointed out not only alfects the winds, but all the
meteorological elements so far as they are correlated with the winds ; the tempe-
ratm'e and dampness are especially aft'ected by it. The method he proposed by
which this error might be obviated, was to impose a limitation to the observations

in respect to interval in distance, in addition to the existing- eight-hourly interval in

respect to time. He proposed that observations slioidd not be included in the groups,

unless the places where they were made were at least as far asunder, measuring

in the direction of the ship's general course (and not along- her tacks) as she could

traverse with a favom-able -wdnd in eight hours. Then on an average not more
than three observations would be accepted from a single log-book in any 5-degree

ocean square. He did not possess data to show how far the accm'acy of the exist-
ing wind charts is impaired by the neglect of this cause of error. He presumed

that it would only be in certain parts of the ocean that it would exercise consider-
able influence on the computed proportions of the winds, but that the ratio of the
calms would be everywhere exaggerated. It was sufficient that he should point out
the error as one to be guarded against for the futm-e, for he trusted that the whole
of the work in the Meteorological Office would be submitted to recomputation,
and that an improved method of handling and grouping the observations would be
adopted, in accordance with the recommendation of that Report to which he had

already alluded.

                                      On the Conversion of Wind-charts into Passage-charts.

                                                      By Francis Galton, F.E.S.

   The most direct line between two points of the ocean is seldom the quickest

route for sailing-vessels. A compromise has always to be made between directness

of route on the one hand, and the best chance of propitious "winds and cm-reuts on
the other. Hence it is justly argued that an inquiry into the distribution of the

winds over all parts of the ocean is of high national importance to a seafaring

Apeople like ourselves.                                                                                                 knowledge of the distribution of the winds would clearly

enat)le a calculation to be made which would show the most suitable passage in any

given case.

    But as a matter of fact, no calculations have yet been made upon this basis ; much

less have charts been contrived to enable a navigator to estimate by simple mea-

surements the probable duration of a proposed passage. The wind-charts compiled

by the Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade are seldom used by navi-

gators                                for tliej do not afford the results that seamen principally require ; they only

give data fi'om v.-hich those results might be calculated by some hitherto unex-

plained process, which, we can easily foresee, must be an exceedingly tedious one.

    To convert wind-charts, or the tables of wind-direction from which the wind-

charts have been compiled, into passage-charts, we must ascertain the distances

that ships of different classes would attain in an hour, if they made the best of

their way under the same wind towards different points of the compass. With a

moderate -wind, a merchantman of the class that usually navigates the Atlantic will,

by beating to windward, make 2g miles an hour, right in the wind's eye. At two

points off the wind it will make 3 miles ; at four, 4 miles ; at six, 7 miles ; at eio-ht,

85 miles :                            at ten, 9 miles                                                                   at twelve,  9^ miles ;  at fourteen, 8f miles ;  and  at six-

as the centre portion of the moon's crust at the last quarter has been exposed to

some 180 additional hours of uninterrupted solar radiation, it is probable that the

total heat attained must be very gi-eat indeed. Whatever temperature is acquired,

the maximum -will, it is believed, occur as stated, at or near last quarter.

As regards the date of the gTeatest cold in the moon, the German physicist already

cited arrives at the conclusion that it occm's about half a day after first quarter

at the period, in fact, when, as was said before, the region of the moon opposite to

us has been the longest time unexposed to the sun's rays. If a temperature of

-- 92° Fahr. occurs at the time fixed by Althaus, it would suppose a tail of 940^

Fahr. (522° Cent.) in about fifteen days. The author believes this interval would

be required ; for the conduction of heat through the moon's strata would be very

gradual : and though it is true that bodies at veiy high temperatm'es cool, both in

air and in vacuo, with great rapidity, yet it has been proved that the rate of

cooling is greatest in air, by reason of its convection of heat. This is one of the

laws laid down by Dulong and Petit, and admitted by those whose judgment in the

matter is most to be relied on. The author has submitted the point to direct ex-

periment in the receiver of the large air-pump at Kew, when the velocity of cooling,

shown by a thermometer with a half-inch bulb coated with lampblack, for tempe-

ratm-es a little above the boiling-point, was found, for the first 100°, to be 25 per cent,

greater in the glass filled with air, than in the exhausted receiver. Thus it would

seem that the absence of an atmosphere would, in the case of the moon, favour an

aecumidation of heat, though in a difterent manner from that in which the presence

of air and vapour aifects the earth, where the slight heat stored up in its crust would

be speedily lost if it were not for the counter-radiation from cloud and vapom*.

As regards the theory that the solar rays would have no power to heat matter if

surroimded by aether, there would seem no reason to believe that this is the case.

It would be necessary that the observations which are supposed to point to that

conclusion should be verified before the possibility of a result so unlooked for is

admitted. Sir H. Davy foimd by experiment that absorption of heat fi-om the coal-

points of the electric light  took  place  in  vacuo                        and the  author's own experiment
                                                                         ;

with the solar rays upon the blackened bulb of a mercmial thermometer, heated by

means of a lens, in the l{3-incli receiver already referred to, though undecisive as

I'egards the relative speed of heating in air and vanio 'with the sun as the source of

heat, showed a gain of 160° Fahr. in two minutes (71° 11' Cent.) in a vacuum of

about one-eighth of an inch. Also in several experiments with thermometers with

black and blackened glass bulbs enclosed in exhausted 2-inch globes, by Mr. Casella,

and one with a lamp-blackened bidb in a globe tilled with air made for the pm-pose,

the thermometers in the exhausted globes (and more especially the one with the

blackened bulb) were found to rise quicker and reach a higher maximum, in equal
intervals of time, than the one in the globe filled with air. On a view of the whole

case at the present time, there would seem to be reason to believe that the sun's

rays must penetrate the moon's crust to a depth that would present the possibility

of her acquired heat being easily or speedily dissipated, and consequently that the

accumulation of heat rmder her vertical sun would reach a higher point than is

generally- supposed.

The Table contains a list of such pairs of stars, drawn up by Professor Grant of

Glasgow Observatory ; and with each pair there is given a correction-factor, which,

being multiplied by the secaut of the latitude of the place of observation, gives the

correction of the approximate meridian found by the process ; that is to say, the

true azimuth of a plane passing thi-ough the observer and the two stars at the

instant when that plane is vertical. The following are the formidse for the correc-

On some Recent Improvemenis in Astronomical Telescopes with Silvered Glass
                     Specula. By John Bro"\vning, F.R.A.S.

During the last year I have devoted a large portion of time to an attempt to

improve the construction of telescopes moimted with silvered glass specula. The

methods usually adopted for mounting the speculum are, 1st, suspending it

2ndly, supporting it upon an air-cushion, or a bed of felt ; 3rdly, allowing it to rest

on a number of balanced triangles.

All of these plans are open to the objection that the specula, when thus moimted,

are very liable to get out of adjustment. The plan I have adopted consists in

bringing the bottom of the speculum to a veiy accurate plane surface, and then

Elacing it   in an iron cell, the  inner   surface of the cell on which  the speculum rests
                                   plane.     Moimted in this manner,    the speculum can
  eing also  made an accurate

be removed fi'om and replaced in the telescope without fear of deranging its

adjustment.

   The adjusting screws must be an-anged so that they do not throw any strain on
the iron cell, which would be liable to produce flexure in the speculum. Many

specula have been mounted by this method, up to 10 inches diameter, with success.
   It is known that the arm which carries the diagonal mirror in reflecting tele-

scopes produces coarse rays on bright stars. Instead of the usual arm, I mount

the diagonal mirror by means of three strips of chronometer spring strained tightly

edgewise towards the speculum.

  When observing stars with reflectors, the diffraction-rings sm-rounding them are

greatly reduced by employing with all Huyghenian eyepieces a good Barlow lens.

Achromatic eyepieces (not the Kellner construction) give superior results to

Huyghenian.

lube-currents can be almost entirely avoided by making the body or tube of

iron, which quickly equalizes the temperature of the air inside and outside

the tube.

   Should an observatory be built for a reflector, it should be made of sheet-iron,
as when constructed of this material the temperature inside and outside the
building wiU be always nearly alike, and annoying air-cuiTents, which would be

generated in a building constructed of a non-conducting material, will not occur.

Peflecting telescopes require steadier stands than refractors, and the importance

of seciu'ing this steadiness can scarcely be overrated.

   With reflectors mounted as described, if the precautions which have been enu-
merated are adopted, the performance wiU almost rival that of good refractors,

and in di\'iding power excel them.

   The Moon Committee of the British Association has recommended that ob-
servations upon the moon should be made with a power of 1000 diameters.

Such a power can only be applied in telescopes of large aperture, which are very

costly.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  23

   As the reflectors are onlj' half the length of achromatic refractors of equal
aperture, aud their price is scarcelj^ a quarter that of refractors of the same power,
I believe, wheu their qualities are more generally known, they will he very ex-

tensively employed.

                      On a Neiu Anemometer. By L. Casella.

        On a Variable Diaphragm for Telescopes and Pliotographic Lenses.

                                By A. Clatoet, F.B.S.

   This diaphragm is fonned by a number of narrow strips of india-rubber, the two
ends of which are respectively attached to two short tubes placed near the object-
glass in the telescope, or in the middle of the photographic optical combination.
One of the tubes can, to the extent of ISO^, be made to revolve by the handle of an
endless screw placed outside, aud acting cui a half-toothed cii'cle fixed on the
moveable tube, so that one end of each strip being attached to the immoveable
tube, and the other end being carried round as much as half its circumference by
the circle to which it is fixed ; each strip, extending sufiiciently by its elasticity
during that motion, hides more and more the aperture of the tube, until it coin-
cides entirely with its diameter. All the strips, acting simultaneously in the same
manner, cross each other, aud iu doing so gradually reduce the aperture of the
tube imtil it is shut entirely, wheu the strips overlapping one another form two
cones with their apices turned towards each other.

   The action of this diaphragm, being as rapid as may be needed, is very effective.
It may be usefully employed in astronomical investigations, allowing the observer

to alter gi'adually, or at once, the apertm-e of the lens, according to circumstances

and different kinds of experiments.
    This diaphragm is also very convenient in photogi-aphic operations, as it enables

the artist, dming the sitting, to increase or reduce rapidly the aperture of the lens
according to sudden changes in the intensity of light. But it has another most
important advantage in taking portraits, which consists in affording the means,
first, to impart to the portrait a certain degree of softness resulting from the
spherical aberration produced by the whole aperture, and immediately after, by
gradually reducing the apertm-e until it is shut entirely, to communicate to the
picture upon the slightly confused image another one sharply defined ; the blend-
ing of the two effects producing an harmonious and artistic poi-trait, which could
not be obtained separately, either by the whole aperture, or by the centre of the

lens only.

  Omi Magnifying Stereoscope with a Single Lens. By A. Ceattbet, F.E.S.

   In the ordinary stereoscope each eye has its lens, but if a single lens be placed

on any point where the optic axes may be directed and cross each other, such a lens

is sufhcient to enable both eyes at once, and each separately, to see through it, the
slide placed behind containing the two pictures ; each eye perceiving only the
one, the perspective of which belongs to it. In looking with the two eyes the
combined image appears in relief, and just as if it were situate on the lens itself,
where, by the requked convergence of the two optic axes, the two pictures seem

really to coincide.

   The pictm-es are mounted as usual on a slide, one near the other, but with the
right perspective on the left, fmd the left perspective on the right, from whence
through the single lens they can only, of course, reach their respective eyes. The
slide must be placed at the distance behind the lens, which, corresponding with
its focus, gives a distinct vision of the picture. The observer must place himself
exactlj- before the lens, which is to be precisely in the middle of the space between
the ej-cs and the pictures. Placing against the lens and in front of it a black
card with a square opening, the picture appears on the plane of that opening, and
as if it were seen on its usual square mounting.

   For persons who (converging the optic eyes upon the lens) can keep them in

that position while they look thi'ough it at the pictures behind (which, by a little
practice, is easily acquired), the stereoscopic illusion is very complete, and the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              :

      Experiments off Ventnor luith Mr. Johnson's Deep-sea Pressure-gauge.

                              By J. Glaishek, F.R.S., ^r.

   AIn the year 1861 1 brought under the notice of Section a deep-sea thermometer

 and a deep-sea pressure-gauge, both instruments invented by Henry Johnson, Esq.
    Experimental trials were made with these instruments by Sir F. Leopold McClin-

tock during his sounding voyage in H.M.S. ' Bull-dog,' on the proposed route of the
 North Atlantic Telegraph in the year 1860.

    In the experiments made with the deep-sea thermometer, the indications in

 various deep soundings, to the depth of 1400 fathoms, approximated to those of the
best merciu'ial thermometers specially an-anged for temperatures at great depths

my own observations upon one of these instruments daily recorded for six mouths,

during which time it was suspended on a stand with other thermometer.^, at the
Hoyal Obsei-vatory, Greenwich, also were in agreement. I have taken great interest
in this thermometer, which is not liable to be affected by pressiu-e of water ; and

which was contrived in consequence of some experiments made by me upon the
temperature of the Thames water at Greenwich being frustrated by the pressure

of water on the bulbs of the thermometers then used, at the depth of only 24 feet,

when the pressure of water would be rather more than two-thirds of the weight

of the atmosphere, as represented by the column of water of 32 to 34 feet in the
water-barometer.

   The deep-sea thermometer is composed of brass and steel, and the specific
gravity of these metals being 8-39 and 7-81 respectively, they are not liable to
compression by water, which acquires a specific gravity or density of 1'06 only,

under a pressure of 1120 atmospheres, as de-
termined by Mr. Perkins. This pressure is
equal to a depth in roimd numbers of 6000
fathoms.

    In the construction of the instrument ad-
vantage has been taken of the well-known
difference in the ratios of expansion and con-

traction of tlie two metals by variation of
heat to form compound bars consisting of a

thin plate of each metal rivetted together.
These bars assume a slight curve in one direc-

tion when heat has expanded the brass more

than the steel, and a slight curve in the con-

trary direction when cold has contracted the
brass more than the steel.

   The indications of the instrimient record

the motions under changes of temperature of
such compound bars, in which the proportion
of brass, the more expansible metal, is about
two thirds, and of steel one third.

   To the lower end of a narrow plate of

metal, about a foot long, are firmly fixed the
ends of two such compound bars, the other

ends being free to move to one side or the

otlier, according to the action of temperature
upon the more dilatable metal.

   The free ends of these bars are connected
by lateral arms to a needle moving on a pivot
in its centre, at points equally distant from the centre, and the motion of the needle
on its axis is regulated by the motion of the bars under the action of the temperatm-e.
                                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                     25

Thve^iKales of temperature, ranging from 25° to 100°, and tlius exceeding the

range oithe temperature of sea-water, are fixed upon the upper end of the plate, to

the lower part of which the bars are attached.

Upon one of these scales the present temperature is shown by the needle or

pointer (E), regulated by the motion of the bars. Two other needles moving upon

the same pivot are useful as indexes, the needle (c/) being pushed by a pin on the

pointer (E) to the highest temperature attained, and the needle (F) to the lowest,

where they are retained in position by still' friction on their axis.

It wiU be observed that lateral concussion is avoided by the employment of two

bars attached to the needle at points equally distant from its centre.

The experiments made by Sir F. Leopold M'^Clintock with the deep-sea pressure-

gauge showed that further improvements in the instrument were essential.

The pressm-e-gauge used by him in 1860 consisted of a brass cylinder, with a

solid piston rod, in which the water was compressed in descending by the piston

rod, forced inwards by the pressure of the denser external water imtil it became

equally dense.

In filling this metallic cylinder, .it was found that so many air- bubbles adhered to

its internal surface as to interfere very materially with the results of experiment.

To obviate this difficulty, a cylindrical vessel of glass was adopted, with a gra-

duated scale upon a long neck or stem, and closed -with an elastic plug of caout-

chouc, which when descending was forced inwards by external pressure, compressing

the water in the pressure-gauge, and pushing along the gi-aduated scale a spring

index, which remamed and marlied the degree of compression, when the elastic

plug was forced back again to the top of the scale by the expansion of the com-

pressed water, as the pressm-e-gauge was raised again to the siuface.

In this instrument the absence of air-bubbles was easily secured, but the difficulty

of regulating with exactness the lubrication of this plug, and thus regulating the

friction against the inner surface of the stem, rendered the results of experiments

still somewhat uncertain.

The form of instrument now used combines the advantages of a transparent glass

vessel with the absence of friction. It consists of a cylindrical glass vessel (A),

having at one end a sphere (B) perforated with one or more small apertures, and

covered with a close-fitting elastic diaphragm, and at the other end an oiled silk

valve (D), resembling the valve of an air-pump, and admitting water into the

cylinder under external pressure when descending, until the water in the pressure-

gauge is of equal density with the external water. Upon a shoulder projecting

near to the upper end of the cylinder a small glass vessel (H) is fixed, covering the

sphere  (B)                      and from it rises a small tube (I), graduated on such a scale that each
                              ;

part or degree is eqiial to , ,,',, ,, part of the volume of the water contained in the

cylinder, and consequently one-tenth of a degree is equal to jt.Vto part.
   To protect the valve from gi-it, and also to prevent the admission ot air into the

cylinder, an elastic waterproof bag (E), with a perforated metal cover, is filled

with water, and screwed on to the valve under vxiter to exclude air ; and the valve

is then screwed into the end of the cylinder, which should be quite full of water,

the superfluous water escaping through a slot in the valve-screw, so that air is ex-

cluded from the cylinder.

  When the pressure-gauge is thus filled, and the case fastened, it is ready for

sinking valve downwards, on a sounding line, into water of gi-eat depth.

AVhen the pressm-e-gauge sent down is again raised into water of less density,

the increased quantity of water forced into it by external pressure is retained ty

the valve in consequence of the elastic diaphragm covering the sphere yielding

readily to its expansion, and being distended in proportion to the quantity of water

forced in ; and an equal quantity of water is expelled, through the open tube, from

the small glass vessel (II ) covering the sphere.

   This displacement of water from the vessel (H) is the measure of the depth to
which the pressure-gauge has been lowered, and the amount of it is ascertained

readily by adjusting the water in the tube (I) to the degree 2000, and then turning

the valve-screw (D) very slightly, to allow the excess of water to escape through the

slot in the valve-screw, and the elastic diaphragm to sink again closely on the sphere,

and then reading off on the scale-t,ube the lieight of the water remaining in it.
--26 REPORT 1866.

   The moderate depths of water that can be attained on the coast of this country
do not admit of any trial of the instrument as an-anged for deep soundings.

   However, some larger instruments were made, in order to test practically the
principle on which the pressure-gauge has been constructed, at moderate depths

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and the proportions of the cylinder and of the tube (I) were so arranged that one
degree on the scale of the tube should be equal to j;;^ part of the volume of
the cylinder, and also should be one-eighth of an inch in length, so that variations
were read without difficulty,

   In July last Thomas Sopwith, Esq., F.E.S., Captain J. E. Davis, of the Hydro-

graphic Department at the Admiralty, Mr. Johnson, my son and I, went to Ventnor

in the Isle of Wight, oiF which place is a depth of water of 40 fathoms, which is a

greater depth than can be conveniently obtained at any other place near the coast,

and we succeeded in obtaining the following series of experiments on Julv the 23rd,
24th, 25th, 26th, and 31st :--

 8 were made at the depth of 10 fathoms.

The results of experiments are shown in the annexed diagram. On every occasion

the compression at the greatest depth was recorded, and appeared to be nearly in
proportion to the depth. The ratio of compression for sea-water, which has a den-

sity of 1.027'equal to the density acquired by fresh water, according to INIr. Perkins's

^^experiments, under a pressure of about 600 atmospheres, appears to be  part

for a depth of 10 fathoms--in the moderate available depth for experiments.
   These experiments are considered to have established the principle of the instru-

ment as sound. Still, a series of experiments at gi-eater depth appears necessary to
test the instruments under various conditions of depth, temperature, &c., and also
to construct a table of depths to be used in deep-sea soundings, and which can be

arranged in fathoms.

The deep-sea thermometer is intended to be used at the same time with the deep-

volume of water in it through change of temperature.

   However, it has been suggested by Captain Davis that, to render this instrument
independent of this calculation, it should be placed previous to use in water of
about the temperature of the air, so as to acquire this temperatiu-e, aud the same

Address by H. Bence Jones, A.M., M.D., F.R.S., President of the Section.

From the foundation of the British Association in 1831, I believe no practising

physician has been President of the Chemical Section ; and I cannot take this

chair, when I know there are so many around me much better qualified than I am

to lead and to direct the discussions that will take place on various papers that will

be read, without asking your extreme indulgence for my shortcomings when sub-
myjects are before you which will be far above the direction of
                                                                                         inquiries.

When, however, I consider that my presence here may be regarded as a slight

evidence of the relationship that exists between chemistrj^ and medicine, I am

encourao'ed in my undertaking by the thought, that whatever sets forth the union

of chemistry and medicine tends to promote not only the good of science but also

the welfare of mankind.

For centuries this nnion has been at one time admitted and at another disal-

lowed but in the last half-century the discovery of Dr. Bright has proved that
                                   ;

chemistry is absolutely requisite for the detection of a large class of diseases, and

that without chemistry the nature of these diseases cannot be imderstood.

Moreover, since this gi-eat discovery the action of different chemical substances

on the different forces in the ditierent living textures, as, for example, in the
muscles and nerves, has been so far investigated by chemists, that it is daily

becoming more and more certain that not only must every medical man become a

chemist if he wishes to have any clear idea of the action of air, food, and medicine,

but that the chemist who has most knowledge of the different forces that act in

the body will require to learn the forms of matter in which those forces reside, and

then -vsath tentative skill he will quickly be able to regulate the qualitative and

quantitative errors which constitute disease. In other words, when the union of
chemistrv and medicine is perfect, then science will show us how to keep or to

regain the greatest of blessings, health.

The past year has not for chemistry been a year of great progress, though the

harvest of new truths has been quite equal to the average.

   That o-rand field for discovery, the synthesis of organic substances, furnishes as

usual the most important fruit ; and, as in duty bound, let me first mention the

results that have been obtained by Professor Frankland at the Royal Institution.

   His svnthetical researches on ethers have partly been published in the Philo-

sophical Transactions. He has succeeded in replacing all three atoms of hydrogen

in the methyl of  acetic acid by  alcohol  radicals                                 and  thus he has obtained a third

hence these results are still unpublished.
   Taken together, the data furnished by this investigation establish beyond doubt

the internal architectm-e of the fatty acids, placing the constitution of these bodies

on as certain a basis as that of the compoimd ammonias synthetically investigated
by Hofmann.

 " Professor Fraukland has also continued his researches with Mr. Duppa on the

sjTithesis of acids of the lactic series.

   M. Persoz and Professor Maxwell Simpson have added still further to our know-

ledge on the sj-nthesis of organic acids ; and Professor Hofmann, notwithstanding
his engagements in superintending the building of two grand laboratories for the

promotion of chemical research, has found time to send us the synthesis of guanidine.

   Before leaving this subject of synthetical chemistry, I must mention Professor
Roscoe's paper on the " Chemical Intensities of Simlight," for this is the direction

--in which the chemist looks for the glorious climax of all his synthetical investiga-

tions the discovery of the chemical architecture of substances in the vegetable

world.

finds that mixed gases pass through india-rubber at different rates proportioned to
their power of liquefaction. The ox3'gen of atmospheric air passes through rapidly,
whilst the nitrogen is comparatively stopped. The importance of this discovery in

metallurgy, and its application to the physiology of respiration and of the passage

of oxygen from the blood into the textures, must be apparent to all. Mr. Vernon

Ilarcourt has begun to estimate quantitatively the effect of time in influencing the

amount of chemical change ; or more generally, the laws of connexion between
the conditions of a chemical change audits amount. Theu we have new researches
on gun-cotton, and a new series of hydrocarbons has been extracted from coal-tar.
Some further spectrum analyses have been made by Mr. Iluggius : anaong these
are the analyses of comets and of the new star in Coronn Borealis, of which the
author will give you his own account ; and lastly, in physiological chemistry we
have an important paper on animal heat, by M. Berthelot, being the third memoir

of his researches on thermo-chemistry ; and a most valuable work on colouring-

matters and  extractive  matters of the urine, by  Dr.  Schunck                                            and a paper on the
                                                                                                        ;

detection of nn alkaloid fluorescent substance like quinine in the different structures

of the body, by Dr. Dupre and me.

Pardon my egotism if for a moment I dwell on my own subject, when you may

consider other subjects are far more deser\-ing of further remarks.

It seems but a few years ago when we were taught that the animal and vegetable

kingdoms were composed of entirely different kinds of substances. Nitrogenous

compounds were said to belong to the animal Idngdomj and the vegetable kingdom

was said to be formed of carbonaceous matters only. The annnoniacal products

of the gas-works were cousidered curious ; and only from the time of Professor

Liebig's investigations do we date our knowledge of the all-pervading presence of
Wealbuminous substances in ^-egetables.
                                             can now see plainlj^ that this was the

death-blow to aU chemical distinction in the composition of vegetables and animals.
   But no wrong knowledge is easily set right. lirst starch, then woody Jibre, then

colom-ing-matters like indigo, then alkaloids lilfe quinine were one after the other

thought to distinguish tlie vegetable from the animal creation, and eacli of these

substances or their representatives have at last been found in animals. Even pro-
tagon, which was thought to belong only to the nerves of animals, has been found
by Hoppe in maize and other cereals to the amount of 0-149 per cent. So that

really at the present time no chemical distinction whatever between veo-etables

and animals can be made. And except in the mode in which these different sub-

stances are produced in the two kingdoms of nature, no chemical difference exists.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  31

   I allude to the present state of education in natural knowledge of that portion of

the community who may at any moment be asked to tell any of us here present,

what mechanical means should be used to lessen or increase the mechanical actions
of the body, and what chemical substances should be taken to lessen or increase the
diflerent chemical actions within us, .when they rise or fall to such a degree as to

constitute disease.

   I know well that no expression of opinion can be given collectively by this
Chemical Section on the necessity for a preliminary education in chemistry and
physics of those who imdertake, first to imderstand, and then to give advice on the

errors of oxidation, digestion, secretion, and nutrition of our bodies; but I may,
perhaps, lead you individually to consider this subject, and to bring your influence

to bear upon this question as being at the root of a gi-eat change, which may bring

a direct benefit to us and to oiu" children in helping us to procure and to preserve

our health ; whilst it will lead to an increase in the number of those who are
looked on with great favour by the British Association : 1 mean the individual

cultivators of natural knowledge.

   In order that you may see clearly what is wanted, I will contrast the present
state of medical education with that reasonable knowledge, which I am quite sure
every one in this Chemical Section will say ought to be possessed by those who

attempt to understand and to regulate an apparatus that works only whilst oxygen
is going into it and carbonic acid is coming out of it.

   I will, as shortly as possible, put before you the present education of those who

practise medicine.

   The present higher education for the medical profession consists, shortly, in
learning reading, writing, and arithmetic in the first ten years of life. In the
second ten years, Latin, Greek, some mathematics or divinity, and perhaps some
modern language. In the third ten years, physics, chemistiy, botany, anatomy,

physiology, and medicine, and perhaps surgery.
   Looking at the final result that is wanted, namely, the attainment of the power

of employing the mechanical, chemical, electrical, and other forces in all things
around us for increasing or diminishing the mechanical, chemical, and other actions
taking place in the difi'ereut textures of which our bodies are composed, it is
quite clear that the second decennial period is passed without our advancing

one step towards the object required ; and that in the third decennial period the
amount to be learned is very far beyond what is possible to be attained in the time

allowed.

   In the first eighteen years of life, reading, writing, and arithmetic, and enough

Latin to read and write a prescription constitute the minimum to be acquired.

During the next three years, physics, chemistry, botany, anatomy, physiology, and
the practice of medicine, sm'gery, and midwifery have all to be learned, and from
this crowding it follows that the study of physiology is begun at the same time
as the study of physics and chemistry. In other words, the structure and the

foundations are commenced at the same time. The top of the house may be almost
finished when part of the foundations has not been begun.

   What chance is there of any one imderstandiug the actions of the chemical,

mechanical, and electrical and other forces in the body, until a fundamental know-

ledge of chemistry, mechanics, and electricity has been fii'st obtained ? What
chance has a medical man of regulating the forces in the body by giving or with-
holding motion, food, or medicine with any reasonable prospect of success, when a

preliminary education in these sciences is thought to be of no importance ?

   It seems to me that the only possible way to make the present preliminary
education for medical men less suited to the present state of our knowledge, would
be to require them to know Hebrew or Aralaic instead of Latin, in order that the

origin of some of our words might be better understood, or that prescriptions

might be vsnitten in one or other of these languages.

   Let me now, for contrast sake, draw j'ou a picture of a medical education, based

upon the smallest amormt of classical Imowledge, and the greatest amoimt of

natural knowledge which can be obtained.

   In the first ten or twelve years of life, a first-rate education in the most widely

iised modern language in the world, English, with writing and arithmetic, might
--32 REPORT 1866.

be acquired, and in the next five or ten years a sound basis of knowledge of pli.v-
sics, chemistrj', and botany, with German or French, might be obtained ; and in

the following live years anatomy, physiology and medicine, surgery, and mid-

wifeiy.

   If every medical man were thoroughly well educated in the English language,

and could explain the nature of the disease and the course to be followed in the

most idiomatic and immistakeable English, and if he could iise all the forces in

nature for the cm-e or relief of his patient, and if he could, from his knowledge of
chemistry and physics, and their application to disease and medicine, become the

best authority within reach on every question connected with the health and wel-

fare of his                               neighbours                                                      and if  he possessed the power of supervising and directmg
                                                                                                       ;

the di'uggist in all the analyses and investigations which could be required as to

the nature and actions of food, drink, and medicines, and as to the products of

disease, surely the position and power and agreement of medical men would be
very different fi-om that which they now obtain by learning some Latin and less

Greek.

At present, so far from physicians possessing more knowledge of food and of

medicine than any other class of persons in the community, the analytical and

pharmaceutical chemists are rapidly increasing in knowledge, which ^·ill enable

theiu not only to understand fully the nature and uses of food and medicines, but

even to detect the first appearances of a multitude of chemical diseases. Their

habits of investigation and their knowledge of the nature of the forces acting in

the body will gradually lead them to become advisers in all questions regarding

the health of the commimity, and from this they will, like M. Bouchardat, in

Paris, become almost, if not altogether, practitioners of medicine.

  No doubt chemists are very far from being medical practitioners at present, but
remember that there is no limit to natural knowledge, and that each moment

the chemical knowledge of things around us is progressing, and that chemists are

becoming able better to answer every question that can arise regarding the air,

water, food, drink, and medicine which, by means of the forces that exist in them,

act upon the forces within us, and give rise to the phenomena of health and of

disease                                   whilst, as if to lessen the time that might be devoted to acquiring natural
                                       ;

knowledge, the authorities who regulate medical education only this last spring

have determined that, in addition to Latin, every medical man shall possess a com-

petent knowledge of Greek, in order that the derivation of hard words may be

obtained from the brain instead of a dictionary.

   In contirmation of mj' opinion of the direction in which the treatment of disease

is progTessing, I may just refer to tlie cattle-plague, which in 1745 was treated by

Dr. Mortimer, at that time Secretary of the Eoyal Society, and therefore one of the

most scientific physicians in the country, \\'ith antimony and bleeding. In 186G,
two chemists, l)r. Angus Smith, Ph.D., F.R.S., and Mr. Crookes, F.R.S., gave the

only usefid suggestion for combating the disease, namely, by the aiTest or the
destruction of tlie poison by chemical agenls.

   There is yet another point of view in which chemisls wiU see the harm that

results from our present medical education.

   The use of Latin in our prescriptions requires that the pharmaceutists should
learn at least suihcient Latm to read what we have written. Many errors have
arisen, and will arise from the dispenser being imable to give the directions rightly.
To avoid such mistakes, a portion of the time that ought to be giAen to the attain-
ment of the highest possible amount of chemical acquirement, and a perfect know-
ledge of the English language, or some foreign language, wherein he might learn
the discoveries in chemistry, and the improvements in pharmacy of other countries,
must be devoted to the learning of Latin in which the physician writes his

direcrions.

   All our druggists in England ought to be what they are in Germany and in

France, chemists capable of any analysis that miglit be required of them, and able

to satisfy themselves and the medical men that the substances they sell are what

they profess to he, pure, unadulterated chemical compounds.

acc[uirement of such knowledge, and until the pharmaceutists all obtain this educa-

tion, medicine will be subject to a great cause of uncertaintj' in the variations in

the quality and quantity of the different substances which, under the same name,

are obtained from different druggists.

Before I conclude I must apologize to some in this Section who may think that

this subject is of no interest to them, by reminding them that none but chemists

can judge what the worth of chemical education really is ; and I am sure that no
body of scientific men exists who are so fitted to judge of the necessity of an edu-
cation in natural knowledge for those who employ the forces around us to regulate

the forces within us as the Chemical Section of the British Association.

   Last year Professor Miller said, " It behoves all who are themselves engaged iji
the piu'suit of science to consider in what way they can themselves aid in forward-

ing the cultivation of natural knowledge."

I ask you, for the good of science and for your own good, to exert your influence

in the first place, and more especially to effect a change in the preliminary educa-

tion of all those who intend to  practise medicine                                                                     so that leaving Greek and Latin

to be the ornaments and exceptions in their education, they may have time to

obtain the best possible knowledge of the chemical and physical forces with which

they have to deal. I urge this because of my conviction that whenever the most

perfect knowledge of cheniistiy and physics becomes the basis of rational medi-

cine, then, and not till then, medicine will obtain the highest place among all the

arts that minister to the welfare and happiness of man.

On the Assay of Coa'l,.Sfc., for Crude Paraffin Oil, and of Crude Oil and
    Petroleum for Spirit, Photogen, Lubricating Oil, and Paraffin. Bij Dr. J.

    Attfield, F.G.S., Director of the Laboratory of the Pharmaceutical Society.

   The paper included descriptive details of the methods of examining small speci-
mens of coal, shale, lignite, &c., with the view of determining their value as
sources of crude parafiin oil. It also contained instructions whereby to obtain the

valiie of a specimen of crude oil or of petroleum as sources of spirit, photogen, lubri-

cating oil, and paraffin. The author placed no dependence on the process of igniting
thecoal, &c. in a crucible and taking the amount of volatile matter yielded as an

indication of the value of the specimen. He preferred to submit the coal at once

to distillation, with certain precautions, in a small iron retort arranged in a pecu-

liar manner. After showing how to best separate and weigh the oil and other

products of the distillation so as to avoid loss, the author proceeded to suggest the
adoption of uniform operations to ascertain the value of the oil or petroleum.
These were mainly operations of fractionation with or without previous distillation,

with or without pre\ious purification. The separation of paraffin on the analytical
scale of the laboratory was then described, the paper closing with suggestive remarks

concerning the nomenclature of the various products.

On the Purification of Terrestrial Drinhing Waters witli Neutral Sulphate of
                              Alumina. By Alfred Bird.

   The principle upon which this process is founded is based upon the known affinity
which hvdrated alumina has for organic matters, in combining with them and ren-
dering them insoluble.

  --The action is as follows :

   One part of neutral sidphate of alumina in solution is added to seven thousand
parts of tlie water to be pm-Ified. As soon as the mixture is made, a cloudy haze
is seen In thewater, which haze rapidly condenses into flocculi, with little lanes of
clear water of the greatest brilliancy and beauty between them. As the flocculi
become more dense they rapidly descend to the bottom of the water, leaving it
absolutely free from all organic colouring-matter, as clear as crystal, and free from

taint.

The time required for complete precipitation is from six to eight hours ; If, there-

fore, the precipitant be put in over-night, the water will be ready for use in the
morning', and as time for the action to take place, and not quantity/ of icater is the con-
sideration, ten thousand gallons can as quickly be purified bj' this process as a

gallon.

  --The chemical action is thus : The lime which is in solution in the water as a

carbonate combines with the snlphm-ic acid of the sulphate, and forms sulphate of
lime. The liberated hydrate of alumina instantly attacks the organic matter, which
it renders insohible, and both rapidly descend to the bottom of the water, while the
carbonic acid gas which remains in the water imparts to it a sparkling freshness and

beauty.

   As the liberation of the hydrated alumina depends on the presence of carbonate

of lime in the water, and as its absence in terrestrial wiiters is a most rare occur-
rence, the applicabilitj^ of this precipitant for the purification of tei-restrial waters

may be said to be imiversal.

   In order to test the effect of the precipitant upon very dirty water, a gallon was
taken out of the Thames at half-tide, in the centre arch of London Bridge. Into
this water was put twenty di'ops of a standard solution of the precipitant. The
water was then allowed to stand eight hoiu's, when it was found that all the filth
had settled to the bottom, and the supernatant water was clear, sparkling, and

pleasant to drink.

   The author has therefore the greatest confidence in recommending the precipi-
tant for purifying the water contained in ships' tanks, and the waters taken from
tropical rivers and ponds, which in their natural state it is impossible to drink, in

consequence of the decaying organic matter contained therein, being a direct incen-
tive to cholera. If to such waters the precipitant be applied, they can be rendered

as perfectly salubrious as water taken from the deepest wells. The same effect can
be produced by the precipitant on tainted well-water, and the waters of stagnant
ponds which are left for the use of cattle in the comers of fields.

   For testing the superior salubrity of water which had been purified with the pre-
cipitant over the same nriter which had not been so purified, various experiments
were detailed.

     On the Oxidhhwi Action of Carbon. By Dr. Ceace- Calvert, F.R.S.

                  On Disinfection. By "William Ceookes, F.B.S.

   As an illustration of the want of general knowledge of the laws of disinfection,

and the evils resulting from the absence of combined action between the local self-

governing authorities, I may refer to what is being done in London in reference to

the present outbreak of cholera. The drainage of one thousand acres, saturated with
a powerfully cridizing disinfectant, mingles in the sewers with the'drainage from an-
other thousand acres, to which a powerfully deoxididmi agent has been liberally ap-
plied, the result being that an enormous amount of money is expended on various dis-
infectants and deodorizers, with veiy inadequate results ; and many valuable agents

may iiltimately fall into discredit from the want of a few simple discriminating rules

for their proper application. Disinfecting agents of great value are being used for
pui-poses for which they are totally imfit ; usefid but incompatible disinfectants
are recommended in the same paper of instructions and chemicals of the most

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

potent description ai'e given to ignorant persons without a word of warning as to

how they are to be applied.

   Disinfection is by no means so simple a process as is generally supposed. Che-
mists are aware that we cannot iise one substance with equal efficacy in all imagi-
nable cases. The process is one depending upon complicated chemical and physiolo-
gical actions ; and chemistry has placed at our disposal several substances which are
applicable to various requirements of the case ; but to pin one's faith to one agent
only, be it carbolic acid, chloride of lime, Condy's fluid, or McDougall's powder, is
to limit one's powers of disinfection in a very unwise degree ; whilst to recommend
all these things without discriniinatiug in Avhat cases they are severally to be used,

is like sending a sick man to a druggist's shop, telling him neither what special
drug to take, nor how much for a dose.

   It is higUy impoi-tant that the best plan of disinfection adapted to tlie present,
or like emergencies, should be definitely settled by some competent authority, and

its adoption then made uniform throughout the country. The various disinfectants

ouglit always to supplement each other, so that when the contents of the adjacent

sewers blen^ together, the purifying action of the disinfectants used should pervade

the mass.

   The word '^ disinfectant," in its ordinary sense, implies a body which wiU destroy
an animal poison or virus, in -whatever way it is accomplished ; in a more restricted

sense, the term  is  used  to indicate an  agent which  destroys  organic or                                  ofl:ensive
                                                                                                           _

matter by oxidation or analogous action; whilst under the tenn "antiseptics '' ai'e

classed those agents which arrest poisonous action by destroying the tendency to

putrefy, and stopping chemical change.

  --Oxich'zittf/ disinfectants those which actually burn up organic matter by means
--of combined or atmospheric oxygen are by far the best known and most used

inasmuch as they appeal directly to popiilar prejudice, by destroying the foul
odours which are the usual accompaniments of infection, whilst ^'antiseptics^' have

little or no action on these gases. This fallacious mode of estimating their relative

value is one which does great injustice to antiseptics.

   In the search for disinfectants suitable to arrest the progi-ess of a zymotic disease,
it is necessary to strike otfat once a whole class of valuable agents which will not

meet the requrements of the case. It is more than probable that the infectious
matter partakes of the physical properties of a vapour or of fine dust ; and it is

consequently hopeless to attempt to combat the virus by non-volatile disinfectants.

For this reason, charcoal, chloride of zinc, the permanganates, solutions of metallic

salts, and other similar substances are of limited use : what is wanted for general

purposes, is a liquid and a volatile disinfectant, which, after first acting on infected
surfaces, M'ill, by gaseous diflnision, pervade the infected atmosphere, and destroy

the floating virus.

At first sight the action of a powerful oxidizing-disiufectant, like chloride of

liine, or Condy's fluid, upon noxious vapours or even septic germs, appears perfect.

In presence of an excess of either of these agents, all organic impurity is at once

bm-nt up, and reduced to its simplest combinations; and coidd we always rely

upon the presence of a suflicient amount of either of these bodies, no other purifiers
would be needed. But in practical work, these disinfectants are always very

inadequate, except for a short time after their application; at other times, the
oxidizing agent has presented to it far more noxious material than it can by any

possibilitr^ conquer ; and being governed in its combinations by definite laws of
chemical aflinity, the sulphuretted and carburetted hydrogen, the nitrogen- and
phosphorus-bases, and other vapours of puti-efaction, will all have to be burnt up

before the oxidizing agent can touch the germs of infection ; whilst the continued

renewal of the gases of putrefaction will constantly shield the infectious matter

from destruction.

   This is the chief objection to disinfectants which act by oxidation. If we ar-
range in a series the possible substances which may be present in an infected
neighbourhood, and gradually mix with them chlorine or a permanganate, we find
that these vapours, which have strong and foetid odom-s, and which we will place

at the commencement of the list, are the first to go ; whilst the actual virus of the

-- --disease the organized particles which have little or no odour are the last to be

attacked. It so happens that the stinking gases of decomposition are of compara-

tively little danger, whilst the deadly virus-cells of infectious diseases are inap-

preciable to the sense of smell. Again, oxidizing disinfectants possess little or no

permanent action. What they attack is destroyed perfectly, but what they leave

has no special resistance to decomposition conferred upon it. They remove the

products of decomposition, but they do not take away the power of subsequent

decomposition. Mere deodorization therefore is no protection whatever.

Oxidizing disinfectants produce their effect by the actual destruction of the in-

fecting substance. Antiseptics act by destroying its activity. The former act more

energetically upon dead than upon li'^ing organic matter. Antiseptics attack first

the opposite end of the list, and commence by destroying -vitality. They exert

little or no action on the foul-smelling but comparatively hanuless gases of decom-
                                                                                                 3*
--36 REPORT 186G.

position, -whilst they act with intense energy on the inodorous germs of infection

which these gases may cany into the atmosphere along \\-ith them.

   If, therefore, the matter which conveys infection from one person to another be
of the nature of an organized germ, if its tremendous powers of destruction are
due to its vitality, then antiseptics are the only agents fitted to deal with these

special cases ; for whilst they leave almost untouched the majority of simply odorous

o-ases, they seek out and destroy the one thing to be feared.

   Now, of all antiseptics, those known as the tar acids, are the most powerful
and of these, commercial carbolic acid maybe regarded as the representative. The
powerful action which carbolic acid exerts on the phenomena of life, is the most

remarkable property \\-hich it possesses. It may be looked upon as the test proper

for distinguishing vital from purely physical phenomena ; and in most cases its

action is diaracterized by the certainty and dofiniteness of a chemical reagent.

In the presence of carbolic acid the development of embryonic life is wellnigh im-

possible ; and before its powerful influence all minute forms of animal existence
inevitably perish. The vapour of carbolic acid in the atmosphere exerts a specially

selective power on all minute organisms possessing life. If the iufectious matter

of cholera is possessed of organic vitality, as is now almost universally admitted,
it will be destroyed beyond the possibility of revival, when brought in contact

with this vapoiu'.

Although the properties of carbolic acid are so valuable, the en-or I have already

alluded to must be avoided, of considering it applicable to every case where disin-

fection is reqm-ed. Whilst its peculiar properties render it of wide applicability, it

may on many occasions advantageoush' be replaced by other disinfectants. Thus,

for pmifying water for drinking or culinary purposes, it is far inferior to ebullition

in the presence of Condy's fluid, which acts in this respect perfectly. Again, the

liquid nature of carbolic acid renders it not so appropriate as McDougall's or Cal-

vert's powder for many purposes, an excess of liquid being frequently a disadvantage
where large quantities of solid offensive matter have to be dealt with, in which case

either of the powders above mentioned is more suitable than carbolic acid.

Although much more expensive than carl)olic acid for equal amounts of puii-

fjang work, chloride of lime also is a more appropriate agent where mere deodori-

zation is the chief desideratum.

It has been assumed, I think on insuflicient groimds, that the mere addition of

permanganate of potash to drinking-water -nail certainly destroy the cholera virus.

The oxidizing powers of this agent, although very energetic on dead organic matter,

are successfully resisted by living organisms. Animalcules will live without appa-

rent inconvenience for some time in water tinted with permanganate ; and, assuming

that the cholera poison possesses organic vitality, we liave no guarantee that_ the

ao-ent in question will eftect its destruction. For this reason, I should be inclined

to prefer boiling tlie water after adding permanganate.

   Let me here' state a fact which ought to be generally known in respect to car-

bolic acid. For disinfecting purposes, as ordinarily applied, it is very extravagant

to use it in the undiluted form. Except in special cases, the aqueous solution of
the acid should invariably be used. Water will dissolve about 4 per cent., and for

Amost purposes this solution is a better disinfectant than the undiluted acid.

small insect which is killed in a few seconds by immersion in the 4 per cent,

aqueous) solution, will live for a minute or more when covered with the undiluted

Whenacid.  the aqueous solution is added to sewage, the latter is at once disin-

fected ; but on adding to a similar quantity of liquid far more than the corre-
sponding amount of undiluted acid, this sinks, as a heavy oil, to the bottom, where

it remains ; and unless the mixture be well shaken, so as to bring the oil in con-

tact ^^·ith every portion, complete disinfection will not be efl'ected for some time.

To throw undiluted carbolic acid down the drains, as is done in many places at the
present time, is simply to throw money away.

AUow me, in conclusion, to draw attention to the gTeat importance of the scientific

prosecution, by qualified persons, of accurate experiments and observations in

reference to the cholera, similar to those undertaken in respect to the Cattle Plague.

Tlie third report of the Cattle-Plague Commission has given us more insight into

that pestilence than we possess of any human zymotic disease ; and there is no

reason why a similar plan should not be earned out in this instance. The subject

is so serious, that its treatment ^^'ith reg-ard to disinfection ought not to be decided
by analogies between cattle plague and cholera, wliich are yet unproved. In a

visitation of this character it is possible to try experiments of a nature wholly out
of our power under ordinary' circumstances ; and thus it is feasible to suppose

that, from the lessons derived from this pestilence, we might obtain insight into the

laws governing zymotic diseases.

   Although foul sewage and putrefying animal matter are probably insufficient to

generate the first septic germ of a pestilence, there can be no question that when
such a plague does come amongst us, it spreads with the greatest virulence
wherever such putrescent materials abound. It may therefore be expected, not

imreasonably, that by extending the sphere of an operation of appropriate disin-

fectants, we may diminish the death-rate, and materially augment the well-being

of the community.

                             On Ozone. Bij Dr. DAUBENy, F.R.S.

   Dr. Daubeny communicated a summary of the observations and experiments he
had been making with respect to the presence of ozone in the atmosphere, the
sources from which it was derived, and its uses in the economy of nature. Judging
from the depth of coloration produced upon Schonbeiu's papers by exposure to
the open air, as observed dming a .period extending on the whole to eight months,
he inferred that the quantity of ozone at Torquay was much greater, on the average,
during the prevalence of winds proceeding fi-om the sea, than at times when they had

blown over land. By the same test he had endeavoured to ascertain wliethei- this

ozone was generated by vegetation ; and although he found that light alone exerted
some influence in colouring the paper, in proportion to its intensity, was led to infer
that, after deducting this, a certain residual effect was due to the action of the gi-een
parts of plants in generating ozone during the day ; and as ozone exercises an un-
doubted power in removing putrid matter by oxidation, it seemed probable that the

vegetable world may be thus the appointed means of destroying animal effluvia,
and of thus restoring to the atmosphere its original purity w hen vitiated by the

emanations of living beings.

On the Refraction- and Dispersion-equivalents of Cldorine, Bromine, and

                        Iodine. By J. H. Gladstone, F.E.S.

The refraction-equivalent of a substance is the product of its atomic weight into

its specific refractive energy, that is, its refractive index minus one divided by its

density. From data previously published by the author and the Eev. T. P. Dale,

together with Dulong s observations on gases, the following determinations of the

refraction-equivalents of the halogens had been made.

Chlorine, as a gas, or in gaseous combination, gives the number 8'7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        in the chlo-

ride of phosphorus it seems to be 9'4 ; while in several cases of its liquid com-

pounds of carbon and hydrogen it ranged from 9-6 to 10.

Bromine, as the elementary liquid, gives the number 16-6; its liquid compound

with phosphorus indicates only 14'5, and its compounds with carbon and hydrogen

about 15 '5.

Iodine, as determined fe'oni four liquid compounds of the iodide-of-methyl series,

averages 242.

The numbers determined for bromine are nearly intermediate between those for

chlorine and iodine.

   The dispersion-equivalent of a substance is the difference between its refraction-

Aequivalents as calculated for the two extreme lines of the spectrum and H. De-

terminations fi-om some of the same compounds of the halogens with methyl, ethyl,

&c., gave numbers, of which that for bromine lies also between those of the other

two, but considerably nearer to chlorine than to iodine. The following detennina-

On the Chemical Action of Medicines. By Dr. H. Bence Jones, F.R.S.

   The law of the conservation of energy entirely does away with every supposition
that medicine can create or annihilate any force. Medicines may carry latent
energy into each part of the body, and they may become active within by increasing

oxidation, nutrition, secretion, motion, and sensation ; or by their properties they

may put a check upon these functions by increasing the resistance or by altering

the conditions necessary for the conversion of latent energy into active force.

The great fimctions of medicine are chemically to assist qualitatively or quanti-

tatively, first the working, and secondly, the repair of the organs and structures of

the body.

For clearness, only two of the chemical actions of medicines are dwelt on in this

paper, namely, their influence on the two processes of oxidation and of nutrition

that continually take place in each of the textures of the body. These processes are

aflected by medicines in at least two ways. First, directly, by the passage of the

medicines into the different textures, where oxidation is promoted or retarded, and

where nutrition is assisted or muscles prevented and secondly, indirectly, by the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

action of the medicines on the nerves that regulate the circulation, whereby the

flow of blood through the vessels is increased or diminished.                                                              The motion equals

   On this view, the first great division of medicines consists of those which (A)

directly or (B) indirectly promote oxidation, or (C) directly or (D) indirectly

retard it.

--A. Medicines that directly promote oxidation, Iron; oxygen and ozone; alkalies;

chlorine, iodine, bromine permanganates ?,                                                                            iodates, chlorates ?, nitrates ?, strong
                                                                                                                   ;

mineral, vegetable and animal irritants, as large doses of salts of antimony, cop-

per, zinc, mercury ; croton oil ; cantharides; all forms of motion, including heat,

light, and electricity.

B. Medicines that indirectly promote oxidation by increasing the circulation.

  Among the causes that determine the force and the frequency of the heart's con-

   traction are, (1) the action of the nerves, (2) of the muscle, and (3) the chemical
   and mechanical quality and quantity of the blood, and its relative proportion to
   the system of vessels in which it is contained.

   For stimulating or checking the centre of the circulation a most highly complex
system of nerves exists, and a similar controlling power over the arterial capillaries
exists throughout the periphery.

   There are at least four different centres of nervous action for the regulation of                                                                                                                                                                                         1

Athe heart. 1. stimulating or musculomotory centre in the heart itself; 2. an

inhibitory centre there also ; 3. a centre which acts through the ninth pair of nerves
and 4. another with opposite action, which acts on the heart through the sympa-

thetic nerve. Medicines may act chemically on any or all of these centres, and

thereby stimulate or check the heart's action. Thus, for example, digitaline acts on

the centre which aflects the heart through the ninth pair, for when these nerves are

di^dded digitaline has no action on the heart.

   The experiments of Claude Bernard on the sublingual salivary gland show the
antagonistic action of the sympathetic and the chorda tj-mpani. Stimulation of

the sympathetic checks circidation through the gland ; whilst stimulation of the
chorda tympani increases the flow of blood, by which secretion and oxidation are

increased also.

C. Medicines that directly retard oxidation. To this class belong all the remedies

which were included in the antiphlogistic regimen. Vegetable salines ; vege-

table acids ; mineral acids ; substances which become organic acids in the system,

as sugar; preparations of lead ; oxide of carbon ; sulphuretted, arseniated, anti-

moniated hydrogen                                                                             oxide of nitrogen ;  rest from all kinds and forms of motion,
                                                                                           ;

mechanical, thermal, electrical, photaL
                                                                                             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                   39

D. Medicines that iudirectl}' retard oxidation. These may be divided into (1) those
   that act upon the nerves, as prussic acid, morphia, and many other alkaloids

(2) those_ that act on the muscles, as rest, cold, salts of potass, lead salts, vera-

trine,                      digitaline,                                                      nicotine                                 (3)                   those  that alter the qualitative and  quantitative
                                                                                                                                   ;

relationship of the blood to the vessels, as local and general bleediags^ starva-

tion, dilution, evacuation.

   The second great division of medicines consists of those vi^hich (E) directly or

(F) indirectly promote nutrition, or (G) directly and (II) indirectly retard it.
   The chemical actions which are concerned in the formation of the multitude of

organic substances of which the body is composed are far more complicated than
those comparatively simpler chemical actions on which oxidation depends. If

even now the different steps and processes, the helps and hindrances which affect
the formation of cai-bonic acid and water in the body are not yet determined, how
much less able must we be at present to comprehend the chemical actions which

take place in the formation of blood-globules, bones, muscles, nerves, &c.

   Many of those medicines that promote or retard oxidation at the same time

promote or retard nutrition. "^Tien they are present in excess, they render the

formation of different substances more rapid ; and when absent, the chemical actions

necessary for the formation of these substances are retarded or altogether stopped.

E. Medicines that directly promote nutrition. Iron helps to form blood-globules
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;
   phosphate and carbonate of lime help to form bone ; cod-liver oil and other fatty

matters help to form adipose tissue. Gelatine perhaps helps to form cellular

tissue                      and phosphorus,                                                  still more doubtfully^ promotes the formation of nervous

F. Medicines that indirectly promote nutrition (1) by increasing the action of the
   heart, (2) by lessening the resistance in the capillaries.--Alcohol, ether, chloro-

   form, nitrous oxide, chloride of methyl, oleliant gas increase the action of the

  heart by acting on the nerves. Ammonia almost immediately deprives motor

   nei-ves of their power of exciting motion, while it intensely irritates the mus-
   cidar structm-es. Of medicines that cause the capillaries to dilate curare is the
   most remarkable.

G. Medicines that directly retard nutrition, either (1) by themselves entering into

   conibination with the organic substances of which the textures are composed, by
   which combination the chemical changes that would othei-wise occur are stoppedf,

   or (2) by the accumulation in the textures of any of the substances resulting
   from the chemical changes in the textures.

   Lead, zinc, silver, copper, arsenic, antimony, and in some rare cases mercury, act

in small doses in the first way. Among the substances which act in the second
way must be included all the different products from each texture in their down-
ward com-se to carbonate of ammonia, water, and salts. Among these substances

carbonic acid and carbonic oxide                                                                                                                            organic acids from oxalic  acid upwards;   sugar;
                                                                                                                                                         ;

fat              nitrogenous  substances                                                     from                                                           CiU'bouate  of  ammonia, urea,  kreatine,  indigo
              ;

animal qumoidine, to the first products formed from the albuminous substances!

H. Medicines that indirectly retard nutrition by lessening the action of the heart
   and increasing the resistance in the capillaries, by which actions the flow of

    blood through the textures is lessened.

   Four different actions may be distinguished, by any of which nuti-ition may be
lessened :-- 1. By an action on the nerves of the heart, as by strychnia, nicotine,

conicme, digitahne                                                                           2. by an action on                                                    the  muscular structure of the heart, as  by
                                                                                          ;

veratrme, colchicine, salts of potass; 3. by contraction of the capillaries in conse-

quence of an action upon the sympathetic''nene, as by morphine ; 4. by the reduc-
%tion, quantitatively or qualitatively, of the state of the blood, as
                                                                                                                                                                                                   bleeding-

starvation, excessive dilution, lead salts, mineral and organic acids.

   The actions of oxidation and nutrition are mutually dependent everywhere, and
no separation of these two actions in any part of the body actually talces place,

although, for clearness, I have considered them separately. The progress of all
accurate knowledge of the actions of medicines depends on exact chemical and

physical experiments ; and by the perfection of these alone vnll the practice of

become esteemed by all as the art that can confer the highest benefit upon man-

   The distinguishing peculiaiitj of this lamp is that it burus magnesium in the
form of powder, instead of riband or wire, and does not depend on clockwork or any
similar extraneous motive power for its action. The stream of the metal powder is
mixed with a small portion of gas and tine sand in its progress through the tube
they escape together at its mouth, where they are ignited and continue bui'uing

\vitla a brilliant flame.

             On the Accumulation of (he Nitroqen of Manure in tlie Soil.

 By J. B. Laaves, F.B.S., F.C.S., cmdJ. H. Gilbeet, Ph.D., F.E.S.,F.C.S.

   The authors had been engaged for many years in an investigation in the course
of which they liad gTown wheat year after year on the same land for more than
twenty years ; on some portions -n-ithout any manure, and on others with farm-
yard manure, or witli various descriptions of manure. They had published the

results obtained in tlie field during the first twenty years of the experiments *, and
thej^ had been for some time, and were still engaged in investigating the composi-
tion of the produce gi'O-mi under the difterent conditions, and also the compara-
tive composition of the soils of the different plots as affected by the various treat-
ment.

    The point to which they chiefly confined attention on the present occasion was
the accumulation, and the loss, of the nitrogen which had been supplied in the
manure and not recovered in the increase of crop. After discussing the difficul-
ties of sampling, preparing for analysis, and analyzing soils in such manner as to
yield results applicalile to the pui-poses of their inquiiy, and describing the
methods they had adopted, they called attention to some of the results obtained,
 summaries of which were brought to view in Tables hung up in the room. Tne
percentage, and calculated acreage, amounts of nitrogen existing in such condi-
 tion as to be determinable by burning with soda-lime were given for the soil of
 the first, of the second, and of the third nine inches, of eleven diftereutly -manured

 plots, shov^-ing the amounts, therefore, to the depth of 27 inches in all.

    The accumulation of nitrogen from the residue of manuring was found to be,
 in some cases, very considerable ; but even with equal amounts supplied, it
 varied, both in total amount and in distribution, according to circumstances ; the
 depth to which the umised supply had penetrated being apparently influenced by
 the character and amount of the associated manurial constituents. The general
 result was, that, although a considerable amount of the nitrogen supplied in
 manure which had not been recovered as increase of crop was shown to remain
 in the soil, still a larger anioimt was as yet unaccoimted for. Initiative results
 indicated that some existed as nitric acid in the soil, but it was believed that the
 amount so existiui^- would prove to be but small. In fact, it was concluded that a
 considerably larger propoition would remain entirely unaccounted for within the
 soil to the depth under examination than was there traceable, and the probability
 was, that at any rate some of this had passed oft' into the drains, and some into
 the lower strata of the soil. Finally, it was shown, by reference to field results,
 that there was not more than one or two bushels of increase in the wheat crop per
  acre per annum, due to the large accumidated residue of nitroo:en in the soil, not-
 withstanding its amount was man}- times in'eater than that which would yield an
 increase of twenty bushels or more, if applied afresh to soil othei-wise in the same
 condition. On the other hand, it was sho-wu that the ettect of an accumulated
  residue of certain mineral constituents was not only very considerable in degree,
 but veiy lasting,

On the Sources of tlie Fat of the Animal Body. Bi/ J. B. Laaves, F.B.S.,

   In 1842, Baron Liebig liad concluded that the fat of Herbivora must be derived
in great part from the carbo-hydrates of their food, but that it might also be pro-

duced from nitrogenous compounds. MM. Dumas and Boussiugault at first called
in question this view; but subsequentl}' the experiments of Dumas and Milne-

Edwards with bees, of Persoz with geese, of Boussingault with pigs and ducks, and
of the authors with pigs, had been held to be quite coniirmatory of Liebig's view
at any rate so far as the formation of fat from the carbo-hydrates was concerned.
In 1864, however, at the Bath Meeting of the British Association, Dr. Ilayden, of

Dublin, read a paper before the Physiological Section, in which, basing his conclu-

sions upon certain physiological considerations .of a purely qualitative kind, he ex-
pressed doubt on the point. In August 1865, again, at a meeting of the Congress of
Aoricultural Chemists, held at Mimich, Professor Voit, from the results of experi-
ments with dogs fed on llesh, maintained that fat must have been produced from
the nitrogenous constituents of the food, and that these were probably the chief, if
not the onlv source, of the fat even of Herbivora. In the course of the discussion
which followed. Baron Liebig disputed this conclusion ; and his son, Hermann von
Liebig, has since written a paper on the subject, in which, illustrating his views by

reference to experiments with cows, he admits the probability that fat may be

formed from nitrogenous substance, but nevertheless concludes that this is neither

the onlv nor even the chief source of fat, in the ordinary feeding of Herbivora.

   The authors agi-eed with the conclusions of these latter authorities. The data
cited by Hermann von Liebig did not, however, afford conclusive evidence on the
point ; and they considered that the results of experiments with cows were, in
several respects, less appropriate for the purposes of tho inquiry than those with some
other animals. They showed, illustrating the various points by reference to expe-
riments of their own, that, compared with either cows, oxen, or sheep, the pig had
a much less proportion of alimentary organs and contents, consumed food of a much
hio'her character, produced a much larger amount of fat both in relation to a given
weight of animal within a given time and to the amount of food consumed, voided
a much less proportion of tlae solid matter of its food in its solid and liquid excre-
tions, and, finally, its increase contained a larger proportion of fat. For these rea-
sons results obtained with pigs must be much more conclusive as to the sources in
the food of the fat which they yield than those with either cows, oxen, or sheep.

   Tables were exhibited shomng the results which had been obtained by the authors

in numerous experiments with pigs ; and from these the following main conclusions

were drawn :
   1. That certainly a large proportion of the fat of the Herbivora fattened for human

 food must be derived from other substances than fatty matter in the food.

    2. That when fattening animals are fed upon their most appropriate food, much

 of their stored-up fat must be produced from the carbo-hydrates it supplies.

   3. That nitrogenous substance may also serve as a source of fat, more especially

when it is in excess, and the supply of available non-nitrogenous constituents is

 relatively defective.

On the Poisonous Nature of Crude Paraffin OU, and the Products of its Becti-

  fication itj)on Fish. By Steat;nsox Macadam, Ph.D., F.B.S.K, F.C.S.,

    Lecturer on Chemistry, Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh.

   The gi'eat extension of paraifin oil-works, both crude and refined, during the last
few years, has led to attention being directed to the nature of the discharges which
emanate from such, more especially to those matters which find their way into
rivers which form the natm-al drainage of the district. The deleterious nature of

these dischai'ges has manifested itself already in the total destruction of all fish in
more than one of oiu' Scottish streams, and to the impregnation of the water with
paraffin oil, and the products of its rectification, to such an extent as to impart the
characteristic taste and odour of paraffin to the water, and render it unsuitable for
domestic purposes.

              * For fi.dler report, see the Philosophical Magazine for December 1866.
40 REPORT-- 1866.

   I have had occasiou to make a large number of experiments on such discharges
taken alone and diluted with much water, with the view of testing the desti-uctive
nature of these liquids and mixtures upon the life of hsh, and the general results of

the inquiry I purpose to lay before the Section.

The discharges from the paraffin oil-works are of the following nature :

   1. Crude petroleum and shale-oil escaping from the crude oil-casks, either when
fuU or when empty, when the drainings leak awaj' into the surrounding soil and

thence to the drains.

   2. The condensing water from the worms of the crude and refining stills, which
often passes away impregnated with paraffin oil.

   3. The spent acid liquor which has been used in acting upon the crude petroleum

or shale-oil.

   4. The spent alkaline liquid or soda which has been employed in acting upon
the oil which has been previously treated with acid.

   Besides these there is the accidental overllow of the retorts, both during the fiirst
redistillation of the crude oil, and subsequently in the distillation of the relined oil,
and which can hardly be altogether provided against.

   The drainings from the oil-casks, when the latter have been emptied and are ex-
posed to the sun, are considerable when a number of casks are stored together, and

the oil which percolates through the soil is liable not only to ooze through the

ground, but when rain falls, the oil floats thereupon, and is thus carried into the
ordinary drains. Any material damage to rivers, however, from this cause may be

lessened by providing proper surface drains, which carry all the oily water to traps

where it settles, and the oil may be removed from the surface whilst the water is

run off underneath. The condensing water from the stills is liable to be impregnated
with paraffin oil from the leakage of the pipes, which is greater when the pipes are
of cast iron than when they are constructed of malleable iron. Of course any ex-

cessive leakage is quickly arrested, but there is generally that taint communicated

to the water which, independent of the lesser proportion of oxygen dissolved in the

water as compared mth ordinary river- water, renders the water more or less dele-

terious to the health offish.

The spent acid liquor and the spent soda-liquor, however, are the most serious

discharges which, eitlier regidarly or occasionally, escape from paraffin oil-works, and

their influence upon the health and life of fish are much more decided than the

paraffin oil itself.

   The spent acid liquor consists of the sulphm'ic acid which has been added to the
crude oil, accompanied by tar products, including picoline and other L .t -i- oils, and to
which the acid liquor no doubt owes part of its poisonous properties. Whilst now
the material in question is to some extent utilized by separating the tar, and either
mixing it with spent oak bark, or sawdust, and using it as a fuel, or by distilling it

into pitch, yet occasionally the acid liquor is discharged into a neighboiu-ing stream.

It is a black tarry liquid of the consistence of molasses, with a somewhat sulphureous

odour, and a very small quantity added to water confers poisonous properties upon

the latter.

   In one example I found the spent acid liquor, which was collected somewhat

diluted with water, to possess the following powerful efl'ects iipon fish :

  1. When the liquor was taken by itself and fish immersed therein, they were dead

in five minutes.                                                          '

2. When the liquor was diluted with three times its volume of good stream water

and fish introduced into the mixture, they were killed in ten minutes.

3. With one of the liquor and twenty of water, the fish died in fifteen minutes.

4. One of the liquor and 100 of water, killed the fish in fifteen to twenty

minutes.

   5. One of the liquor and 1000 of water was poisonous to the fish in two hours,

whilst

   6. In one of the liquor to 10,000 of water, the fish were not killed by their
immersion in the mixed liquor for twenty-four hours, but were apparently sick

and prostrate.

   The spent soda-liquor which has been employed in treating the oil which had

its nature. It has exti-acted from the oil and retains in solution more or less car-

bolic acid and its honiologues, and the poisonous nature of the spent soda-liquor is

doubtless materially augmented by the presence of these acids.

One sample of this soda-liquor which was flowing from a paraffin oil-work, and

which contained extra water, proved destructive to fish in ten minutes diluted
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

the fish were dead in twenty-five minutes                                                                                                                                                              with  100  of water, the fish were killed
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

in thirty minutes ; diluted with 1000 of water, the soda-water was destructive to fish

in twenty hours ; whilst in 10,000 of water the fish were not killed but were appa-

rently slightly sick. Experiments were made with crude shale-oil and the refined

oils obtained therefrom, and with crude Pennsylvanian petroleum, and the refined

oils extracted from it. The crude shale-oil was destructive to fish when taken in

--the proportion of 1 of the oil to 1000 of water the crude oil being more ener-

getic in its action than any of the others, then in succession the lubricating oil,

the bm-ning oil, and the lighter spirit.

The Pennsylvanian petroleum was not so powerfid in its poisonous properties as

the shale-oil employed in the experiments. The crude shale-oil, in the proportion

of 1 to 1000 of water, was poisonoiLS to fish in twelve hours ; whilst the crude

Pennsylvanian oil in the same proportion did not kill the fish for twenty-four hours.

The refined oils acted in a corresponding manner on fish. Thus the refined shale-

oil, in the proportion of 1 to 1000 of water, killed the fish in twenty-fom- hours

whilst the refined Pennsylvanian oil did not prove destructive for two days.

The importance of this subject will probably soon be greater than what it is at

present, as the manufacture of crude paraffin oil in conjunction with gas has

abeady been introduced into one of om- gas-works in Scotland.

The coal used is the Newbattle gas or Cannel coal, which j'ields when distilled

in ordinary gas-retorts, at a bright cherry-red heat, about 11,000 cubic feet of gas,

with an illuminating or photogenic power of thirty-four standard sperm candles for

every five cubic feet of the gas bm-ned dm-ing every hour. When distilled, how-

ever, at a low or black-red heat in larger retorts, as carried on in ordinary paraffin

oil-works, the coal yields only .3000 to 3500 cubic feet of illuminating gas, with the

photogenic power of thirty candles for every five cubic feet bm-ned dm-ing the horn-,

so that two-thirds of the total quantity of gas capable of being yielded by the coal

is sacrificed ; but in place thereof there are obtained about 60 gallons of crude

paraffin oil with a specific gravity of 900 to 905. The g.io-works in question are

vii-tuaUy crude parafiin oil -works in which the gas is utilized ; and as the change in
the mode of working the coal appears to be profitable, there is every reason to

consider it likely that other gas-works will follow the example, and become

virtually crude paraffin oil-works with refineries attached thereto.

    On an Exti-aorcUnary Iron Stone. By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F.C'.S. Sfc.

   The author alludes in this paper to a journey which he made dming the year
1805 in the principality of Waldeck (Germany), and gives an account of the
mining district which he visited there. About twelve English miles from the
mineral springs of Wildimgen, in the region where the schists are upheaved by
greenstone, containing lodes of coijper ore, lead ore, and barytine, with some zinc
blende, he met with a very remarkable ironstone which is distinct from the fine
red hematite that_ abounds in these districts, by the presence of a considerable
amount of magnetic oxide of iron, some specimens yielding as much as 28 per cent.,
and when smelted give about 59 per cent, of iron of exceedingly fine quality. This
mineral occurs in a quartz lode, is crystallized in the rhombic system, and as'brilliant
as steel. It gives a dark purple powder. The red hematites of the same district all
contain a little magnetic oxide, vai-ying from 2 to 4 per cent, and even more.

                      On the Origin of Muscular Force in Animals.
               By Dr. Ltoi^^ Platpaie, C.B., LL.D., F.R.S.L. 6f E.

   The author reviewed the recent experiments of Fick and Wislicenus on this
subject. These physiologists ascended the Faulhorn, after having subsisted for
thirty-one hours on cake made of starch fried in fat, and they found that they
--44 REPORT 1866.

ascended the lieiglit of 2000 metres, witli au evacuation of uvea which, converted
into muscular substance, did not represent more than half the actual energy ex-
pended in the ascent. The author pointed out as the main objections to this
experiment (1) that the period of production of urea is not necessarily the period

of its elimination ; (2) that when starch and fat are used as food alone, the nitro-

gen of the alvine dejections, usually only one-twelfth that in the urinary secre-

tions augments so much as sometimes to be equal in amount to the latter. With
respect to the first objection, E. Smith has shown that lowering of the barometer

and thermometer retards the evacuation of urea, and these conditions were obvi-
ously present at the top of a high mountain. The amount of urea passed for
twelve hours before the ascent was 46 grammes ; but it was only 38 grammes in
the six hours of the ascent and six hours after it ; while it fell to 32 grammes in
the subsequent twelve hom'S, although a hearty meal had been taken. The result
was not easily explicahle on Liebig's views, that muscular force is produced by
muscidar waste ; but it was equally difficidt to explain on the view that the urea
is the mere representation of the waste of muscle due to the friction of the
machine, whose natural fuel is non-nitrogenous [food ; for the experiments show

that when the friction of the machine was largely increased by the work per-
formed, the amount of urea actually diminished, instead of increasing proportion-

allj' to the work.

   The author then entered largely into the proofs ofl"ered by experience in feeding
man and animals, that albuminous diet must be olfered in proportion to the work
demanded. lie showed that there was sufficient potential energy present in the
ordinary supply of albumen to men to account for the work performed. But he
did not deny that non-nitrogenous diet might, in the absence of such albuminous
supply, be temporarily used for the production of muscular force. Such vicarious
action is common in the body. But this admission did not interfere with the view
that the normal food and fuel of muscles consists of albuminous bodies, which
must constantly be supplied to produce sustained effort, and to prevent corporeal

deterioration.

On some Phenomena connected ivith the Meltinq and Solidifying of Wax.

                            By C. ToMLiNsoN, F.G.S.

When melted bees-wax containing a small portion of a very fine powder, such

as that of plumbago, is poured into a shallow tinned-iron tray and allowed to cool,

the wax breaks up into a luxmber of hexagonal figures more or less regular, the

boundaries being marked by the plumbago. The fines of the hexagons are formed

by the mutual pressure of rings of plumbago powder thrown off" fi'om cylindrical or

polygonal centres of the wax in cooling. Even in deep vessels of melted stearine

or grease, containing particles capable of floating about in it, and of being carried to

and fro by currents, an in-egular network is formed by the particles arranging

themselves on the surface in lines. There appears to be on the sm-face a movement

of the gi-ease from the centre to the sides of each of these polygonal figures. The
figure varies with the material, and may be shown during the cooling. It may be

seen on castor-oil and other fatty bodies ; but not on spermaceti or crystalfine fatty

bodies. The figures are produced by a Idnd of local convection ; that is, convec-
tive currents rise and sink in various parts of the mass, so that from many points

at the bottom of the vessel rising currents are set up, and as the surface of the oil

cools bv exposiire to the air, these cooler portions snik from ^arioua points of the

surface", so that, instead of one central rising current, and one circumferential

sinking current as in ordinary cooling, many small rising and sinking currents are

established. Hence the surface becomes divided into many spaces, in the centre of

each of which a current of warm oil is rising and around the circumference of

which the cooler oil is sinking. Each of these S3'stems tends to fonn a cylinder,

with a rising central and a sinking circumferential current, and the contact of the

boundaries of such cylinders produces a series of polygon-shaped  systems.                                  If the
                                                                                                         _

surface be veiy stiU, and there be no tendency in the oil to crystallize as it cools,
                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                   45

nearly perfect hexagons are formed, and as the ch-cumference of each hexagonal
system is cooler than its centre, the floating particles are first arrested at the
circumferences, and gi-adiially accumulate there, giving an hexagonal appearance to
the sui-faee as the mass cools. In a crystalline material the tendency to assume its
peculiar crystal would prohably overcome these currents before the mass became

cool.

   The second part of the paper referred to the passage of an electric spark through
melted wax, &c. The early electricians remarked that a non-conductor, when melted,
became a conductor. Faraday foimd that when such substances were fused and
tested by their power to transmit a voltaic cun-eut, in no case did the cmTent pass,
unless accompanied by polarization of particles and decomposition. The same seems
to be true for fiictioual electricity. The substance to be tried was contained in a
glass bulb about 2 inches across in the widest part, and about 3^ inches hio-h,
fitted with corks through which pointed brass wires were passed, or one pointed
and one knobbed. On hanging such a bulb by its vnre to the prime conductor of
an electrical machine, connecting the lower wii-e with the earth, and setting the
machine in action, a most vivid spark plays between the -^-ires, strikino- out,°as it
were, from an anvil a midtitude of smaller sparks, and lighting up the whole of
the bulb and liquid in a remarkable manner. The smaller sparks, which apparently

fill the bulb, are globules of gas, ai-ising from the decomposition of a portion of the
liquid, and illuminated by the principal discharge. "When the point and bulb are

far apart, the dischai-ge is in the form of a brilliant rippled line of lioht, also accom-
panied by decomposirion"of the dielectric. The effects varv with diflerent sub-
stances, and also cliange with the cooling of each substance. Spermaceti, cocoa-nut
oil, lard, and solid paraffin are well adapted to these experiments, and also such
fluids as castor-oil, balsam of copaibs, paraffin oil, tui-pentine, and benzole. It was

not found possible to pass a spark through melted camphor. By holdiuo- a bulb
containing the solid over a spirit-lamp, the solid may be melted 'in a few minutes.
The phenomena form good class experiments.

On a Projaoml Use of Fluorine in the Ilanufacture of Soda.

men sulphate of sodium is treated with hydrofluoric acid, one half of the
.sulphate IS converted
                        into bisulphate and the other half is transformed into fluoride.
 Upon this fact of the  reaction between sulphate of sodium and hydrofluoric acid

yielding without any destruction of sulphuric acid, a compound almost as readily
caustifaable as carbonate of sodium itself, the author believed that it would prove
practicable to base a manufacturing process by means of which soda shoidd be pro-
duced, not only, if not exactly without the use, at any rate without any consump-
tion of sulphui-ic acid, but actually without the consumption of any materials
whatever excepting salt and coal, all the reagents employed beino- recovered for
use over and over agam continually. One method by which this obiect could be
accomplished was descnbed as foUows. It comprises four operation! the first of
which consists in the production of sulphate of socUum by double decomposition
between chloiide of sodium and sulphate of magnesium, havino- associated with it
at least one atom of water, the products of this reaction being, besides sulphate of
sodium, hych'ochloric acid and magnesia. The second operation consists in treating
two equivalents of sulphate of sodium
whereby one equivalent of fluoride of  with one equivalent of hydi-ofluoric acid"
                                       sodium, which for the mhsi part precipi-
tates, and one equivalent of bisulphate of sodium, which remains in solution, are
tormed. Ihe thu-d operation consists in the decomposition of the fluoride of sodium
obtained in the second operation by means of the magnesia obtained as one of the
results of the first operation, the products being caustic soda and fluoride of mao--
nesium; and the fourth operation consists in the decomposition of this
magnesium by means either of the bisidphate of sodium obtained in       fluoride of
                                                                        the second

 nient way, with production of sulpliate of magnesium, with which to repeat the
 first operation, and hydrofluoric acid, with whicli to repeat tlie second operation.
 All the reag'ents emploj^ed for the transformation of salt into soda by this method
 are thus continually reproduced, the only materials consumed being the salt and a
 small quantity of fuel. The author also described some briefer methods than the
 above of transforming salt into soda by way of the intermediate production of

 fluoride of sodium.

    Address by Professor A. C. Eamsat, LL.D., F.B.S., ^c. President of the

                                                             Section*.

 Since I last had the honour of acting as President of the Geological Section a
custom has crept in of opening the meetings of tlie various Sections with presiden-
tial addresses. I have, however, been called upon unexpectedly, and rather late in
the day, to occupy this chair, while I was busy -with a multitude of other avoca-
tions, and I have not had the time to pr.-iiare an address ; nevertheless I shall

endeavour to the best of my ability to say a few words upon the state of opinion

upon various subjects connected with physical geology, so as, possibly, to prepare

in some degree tlie minds of persons, who are not thoroughly conversant with all

branches of the science, for topics that may, perhaps, be touched upon in some of

the papers to be brought before us. The great question which underlies much
that concerns geologists is whether the economy of the world as we now see it
represents in kind, and partially or altogether in degree, the average economy of

the world as it has existed in time past, as far as it can be traced by reference to
rocks and their contents as they appear at the surface, or as deep beneath the sur-

face as we may dare to reason upon within the limits of presumed legitimate

inference.

   After people had thoroughly made up their minds that the world consisted, as

--far as the outside of it is concerned, of two classes of rocks igneous and aqueous

it was for a long time the fashion to attribute most of the chief distm-bauces which
the crust of the earth has undergone to the intrusion of igneous masses. The

inclined positions of strata, the contortions of the formations in mountain-chains,

--and the existence even of many important faults in fact, disturbance of strata

generally, were apt to be referred to direct igneous action operating from below.
But a closer analysis of the rocks founded on careful surveys, not of a little area
here, and a little area there, but on surveys of kingdoms and contuients, has tended

to disprove these old-fashioned ideas, although you may constantly see them

brought up again and again in a certain class of popular works, and sometimes

even in memoirs by authors who ought to be better iuformed than merely to
repeat the notions that we find in common-place popular works on geology.

   Now, if we loolv at those British formations in which igneous rocks are most
generally developed, what do we find ? Go first to North Wales, to the Lower

Silurian strata, which are to a great extent intennixed -Rath igneous rocks. There,
instead of finding great masses that broke through the stratified crust of the earth
and tumbled the strata into confusiou, the igneous rocks consist chiefly of beds of
felspathic lava and ashes of great thickness interstratified among the Lower Silu-

rian strata, with here and there bosses of porphyry, which may sometimes repre-
sent, as I think, the underground nuclei of old volcinoes of Lower Silurian age ; but

the mountainous character of the country is due, not to the direct igneous action

of that period heaving up the rocks. On tlie contrary, all the rocky masses of

which the region consists, both igneous and aqueous, have been disturbed and
thrown into great sweeping imdulations formed of curved strata, thousands of feet

thick, by those agencies, whatever they may have been, that at a later date pro-

duced disturbance. The igneous rocks were not that cause ; for they have them-

selves been disturbed, together witli the fossiliferous Lower Silurian rocks amid

which  they lie                                 and the mountainous character of the country, as  it now  presents
                                             ;

itself, is due, not to direct volcanic action, but to the unequal hardness of igneous

and aqueous masses, acted on by many denudations both ancient and modern, both

marine and subaerial. These causes, aided by faults wliich often brought hard and

soft rocks into immediate juxtaposition, have given rise to all the rugged outlines

on the surface of Wales, the hard rocks more strongly resisting decay and waste,

the soft ones yielding to time, the sea, and the weather, with gi-eater ease ; and

thus it happens that the hai-der masses generally form headlands, and the summits

of the moimtains, though often found elsewhere ; while the softer strata, wasted
away by the sea and by rain and rivers, are apt to lie in the recesses of bays and

in valleys and plains. This kind of argument I could equally well apply"^to the

Carboniferous formations of Scotland, where igneous rocks are rife, and, indeed, to

all those areas where igneous masses of ancient date are found intermixed with

sedimentary strata*.

Again, if we go to the Alps, and look at the strata there, which are distiu-bed on

the greatest scale ; in all that part of the range that I best know, from east to

west for more than 100 miles in length, I have never seen a fragment of what I can

-- --call a true igneous rock. Gneiss there is, and granite there is, which, according to

old ideas a great advance in their day some have been apt to classify either as

common igneous productions or as closely allied to them ; but no basalts or green-

stones, or rocks allied to these, play any important part in the structure of the

country, although the strata have been d'istm'bed in a manner of which no concep-

tion can be formed by those who have only studied such minor mountains as those

of the British Isles. There, in the Alps, we find areas as large as half an English

county, in which a whole series of formations has been turned upside down. But

by what means were masses of strata many thousands of feet thick bent and con-

torted and raised into the air so as to produce existing results by aiibrdiug matter

for the elements to work upon ? . Not by igneous or other pressure and upheaval

from below, for that would stretch instead of cnimpling the strata in the manner we

find them in great mountain-chains like the Alps, or "in less disturbed gi-oups like

those of the Highlands, Wales, and Cumberland, which are only fragments of

older mountain-ranges ; but, perhaps, as some have supposed, because of the radia-

tion from the earth of heat into space, producing gi-adually a marked shrinkage of

the earth's hardened crust, which, giving way, became crumpled along lines more

or less irregular, thus producing jjartial upheavals, though the bulk of the whole
Aglobe was diminishing.
                                                modihcation of this hypothesis does not attempt to

explain the positive cause of the shrinkage, but simply states, that from some un-
known cause, irrespective of radiation, great areas of the earth's crust having been

depressed, broad lines that lie between them have been contorted and heaved into

the ail- in the manner already indicated. Such shrinkage and crumpling, however
it was produced, when most intense and on the greatest scale, is always (where I
know it) accompanied by the appearance of gneissic or other metamoi-phic rocks,

and of granite or its allies ; and it has often been the custom to attribute the dis-

turbance of the strata in such mountain-ranges and their nietamorphism into

mygneiss, crystalline marble, and the like, to the intrusion of granite. But

opinion has long been that, -ft-ith regard to gneiss and granite, the first has been

produced by processes of nietamorphism which had no necessary connexion with

tlie intrusion of granite, while granite itself is often simply the result of extreme

nietamorphism, having passed through and beyond the stage of imperfect crystal-

lization, characteristic of gneiss, into that state of more perfect crystallization which

marks well-developed granite. If this be so, then, so far from the intrusion of

granite having produced such mountains as those I speak of, both gneiss and

granite woidd rather seem to be results of the forces that formed the mountain-

chains, I cannot tell how, but possibly connected with the heat produced by the

intense contortion of such vast masses of strata, the parts of which now exposed

by denudation were then deep undergroimd. There is, however, a difficulty here

   * This argument has of course no immediate application to existing or late Tertiary
volcanic areas, such as those of Auvergne, where entire and ruined craters still exist.
--48 REPORT 1866.

perhaps insuperaWe, and wliicli my knowledge does not enable me to gi-apple

with ; viz., that if the shrinkage that contorted the strata were slow, the heat

resultino- from it might never have attained sufficient intensity to have produced,

with the aid of alkaline waters, those common metamorphic masses, known as

gneiss, granite, syenite, &c., and others less commonly recognized as metamorphic,

such as some of the quartz porphyries, for the heat thus generated may have

escaped as fast as it was formed. But I cannot now enter on these details.

It has often been customary to speak of the Cumbrian moimtains as a great

dome, forces from below having heaved up the strata towards a central point,

fi'om whence the main valleys radiate as great rents produced by that upheaval.

But the strata of Cumberland are not dome-shaped in the true geological sense.

If it were so, the strata ought to dip from the centre. But instead of that we find

Lower and Upper Silurian strata from the equivalents of the Llandeilo flags to

the Ludlow beds, which though contorted, yet form an ascending series aU across

Cumberland from Cockermouth to Ambleside, A\ith an average south-easterly dip.

There is, indeed, nothing cone-Hke in the manner of their arrangement, and the

io-neous rocks associated with the Cumbrian strata have partaken of disturbances

oi the same ages as those that heaved up the Silmian rocks of Wales. Afterwards

the wholej series was planed across by marine denudation before the deposition

of the Old Red Sandstone of the area ; and then, but chiefly at later periods, the

valleys were scooped out from a great tableland, an old plain of marine denudation,

especially after the removal by denudation of the Carboniferous rocks which at

one time probably cased and concealed the whole of the Silurian sti-ata. In this

manner the character of the mountains of the country was produced, the harder

masses being apt to form the heights, craggy, yet often rounded by glacial action.

  mNow in disturbed districts, and many not much disturbed, faults are more or

less numerous, and they are of all ages and of varying amounts. On the Continent

of Europe and in Britain, for example, from the Middle Tertiary strata downwards,

somewhere or other, all the formations have been dislocated, some of the faults

beino- of the amount of only a few inches or yards, and others of many fjhousands

of feet. Several I know in \\'ales of liOOO, 5000, or even 12,000 feet in amount ; and

as a rule it is found that the greatest faults intersect strata that have been most

disturbed, while also it often happens (Ijut not always) that the oldest strata have

undergone most disturbance, because they have been more frequently aftected by

disturbino- agents. On the north side of the Alps the Miocene rocks of the Rhigi

are inverted and faulted agamst the older formations, and the amoimt of the throw

must be very large, and as many jMioceue species of moUusks are still li-\-ing, far as

it is removed from our epoch, this fault, by comparison with older ones, may almost

be said to approach our own day.

Now the question arises whether the agencies that produced contortion of strata

and faults, which in certain cases have resulted in the formation of gTeat mountain-

chains, have been sudden in their operation, or if the changes have been as pro-

--gressive and gradual as the operation of those agents of denudation the sea in the

formation of plains of marine denudation, old and new, and the outlines of coasts ;

together with the work of au', rain, risers, frost, snow, and ice, that, long continued,

have produced the famihar sculptm-ing of hill and valley. This is a very puzzling

question to geologists, and various opinions have been stated. One of these is that

we now live in a world, as it were, nearly in a finished state, antl which will sufter

no more catastrophes ; another that the world now remains in a temporary state

of repose after a succession of spasmodic throws which broke up suddenly gi-eat

portions of the earth's crust, and repeatedly revolutionized the world, and that such

efforts may recur at later periods a long way beyond our time ; or again, that the

state of tranquillity we now enjoy, in which change is constant, more or less slow,

and very sure, has been the order for all time, as far as geologists' can trace back

the history of the world in the rocks that form its crust. These are the leading

myopinions on the subject, and  own inchues to the last.

But in the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to reduce to a demon-

stration the truth of this opinion. Those who fancy the world to be in a finished

state are seemingly forgetfid of the fact that the old rocks were made by the same

operations as those that are now forming ; and those who advocate sudden violence

and wide-spread revolution have, it seems to me, nothing beyond assertion to help

them, foimded on that kind of wonder and awe that arises from the contemplation

of crags, peaks, and the inversions of the strata of great mountain-chains, or of other

and kindred phenomena ; while the advocates of peaceful change have little to say-

beyond an appeal to observed facts, gathered from a study of rocky masses and

their contents, which to them seem to point througliout to gradual and continuous

changes ; and these imperfectly understood phenomena have induced a half intuitive
and growing belief that the laws, both physical and biological, that govern the

world are quiet, progressive, and imviolent.

Proceeding now a point fui-ther, the connexion of life with the modifications

which have taken place in the crust of the earth somewhat helps us in our endea-

vours to understand the question. As every one knows, there have been great

numbers of different genera and species inhabiting the world at different geological

epochs, the remains of which lie Duried in the various formations ; and looked at

on a large scale, and over broad areas, it is evident that there has been a succession

of life, each of the greater series of formations being more or less marked by its own

particular fauna. This fact led to the old geological doctrine that there had been

many sudden creations, by which the world was at various times peopled ; that

these inhabitants, after long intervals, were as suddenly destroyed ; that new crea-
tions came in, and that each formation was in this way marked by its peculiar forms

of life. When, however, it was found that in some formations a few, or sometimes

many, of the same species were common to two or more formations, this theory of

complete and sudden extinction and creation was seen to be untenable. By and

by, when the geological structure of Britain began to be minutely analyzed, it was

found in cases of unconformable stratification, even when the upper formation was

ill time the next hnomi member of the series to tliat which lay below, that breaks

in the succession of marine life, partial or total, always accompanied such uncon-

formities in stratification. It has, indeed, been a question with some geologists

whether two marine faunas, commonly recognized as belonging to two distinct and

far apart geological epochs, such as the Silurian and Carboniferous, could not have

been contemporaneous in past eras, or indeed even now. It is very possible that

something of this kind may have been the case ; but in my opinion only in a mixed

and minor way between periods or formations that in a geological sense were not

far apart in time. When we consider the greater formations, such as Silmian and

Carboniferous, Oolitic and Cretaceous, the probabilities, as I have elsewhere argued,

are almost infinitely against this assumption ; for if so, an Oolitic fauna, for example,

in whole or in part might both underlie and overlie Cretaceous formations. But,

however we may look upon this question, it is certain that the great principle of a

succession of life, showing a method of change and progress, the old disappearing,

and the new coming in, and breaks in succession of life, as I have shown in detail

elsewhere, have a close connexion with uuconformability of strata and ffajis in

geological time unrepresented by stratijied formations over areas of varying size, such

areas being determined by those agents that produced upheaval and denudation of

continents and islands.

   I could follow out this view with particidars, but without now doing so, this

reasoning seems to assure us that there never has been universally over the world

any complete destruction of life, but that the succession of being has gone on in

regidar order and sequence, though for a time, or for ever, we have lost many of the

--records whole chapters, whole books, in consequence of the disturbances and slow

denudations which the earth's crust has undergone. This must show, therefore,

that there never has been any universal cjitastrophe which destroyed the life of the

world ; especially because many of the forms are stiU alive that belong to compara-

tively old epochs ; and to my mind the continuity of genera and even of broader

distinctions leads to a like result. But great changes in physical geography have

often taken place in times too limited to have involved total changes of life ; for

life, I believe, dies out or changes not by violence or sudden edict, but by the slow

effects of time. The north of Europe and America has been more than half sub-

merged during the last glacial epoch, and re-arisen without the disappearance of

an)' one marine niollusk. Of the fossils of the Crag, part of an old German ocean,

 large percentages still remain ; and tlie Miocene formation of the Alps, wliicli con-

tain many laud plants barely distinguishable (if distinguishable) from li^dng species,

 have been formed, upheaved, inverted, and faulted without a total destruction
 either of terrestrial or of aqueous life. Putting all these things together, I feel
 myself almost driven to the conclusion that aU these changes have been so slow

and gradual, that to occupants of old time, had there been human intelligence to

 obsei-ve, everything would have seemed to go on in the same slow, steady, and

apparently imdisturbed manner in which they appear to us to go on now ; and if

this be true, then, instead of having recourse to unusual catastrophic action to ex-

--plain what is seen to have resulted, it all resolves itself into time to effects in fact

produced b}^ small cumulative causes, which were more than equal to all the de-

structive forces attributed to eruptions of igneous rocks, the production of faults,

and immense contortions of strata ; and the effect of all, but not the final effect, h.os
brought about the astonishing changes which the world has so -v-isibly undergone,
resulting in the present physical geology, physical geography, and life of the surface

of the earth.

On the occurrence of Flint Implements in the Gravel of the Little Ouse Vcdley at

                 Thetford and elsewhere. By Hexey Brigg, Jun.

   The author in this paper described some discoveries of flint implements at five
points in the valley of the Little Ouse, a river having a common origin with the
Waverney at Lopham Ford, and which, after receiving the waters of the Thet and
another small river, takes a north-west course, and joins the Great Ouse.

   The country drained by the Little Ouse and its tributaries, is of the Upper Challc,
largely overlaid with glacial drift ; and the ri^-er- valleys exhibit extensive deposits
of the debris of these formations arranged terrace-like upon their sides.

   From Thetford to Brandon the valley-gravels attain their gTeatest development,

and are extensively quarried during the winter months for road-making material.
   It was at Sauton, in the spring of 18(32, that the first flint implement was dis-

covered, and Mr. Brigg has since recorded further discoveries at the Red Hill and

Yv^hite Ilill, Thetford (slight eminences upon the Abbey-heath, thus called by the

pitmen from the colour of the gi'avels), Santon Downham, and further down the
rivei', and without the valley, at Shrub Ilill, in Feltwell fen.

   The discoveries at the Red and White Hill are important ; the first from the
large number of implements that have been fomid, the latter from the occurrence
in the same deposit of remains of the Elephas primiycnius, Eqtnis, Si(s,&c. The im-

plements of the Little-Ouse gravels are mostly of tlie spearhead form, with the

usual variety of finish and staining. Many of them show traces of wear from use,
while others have suffered much attrition and water-wear.

   Occurrences of the Bemains of Insects at Barroiv. By the Eev. P. B.

   Bkodie, M.A., F.G.S.

The author fii-st described two sections of the '^ Insect and Saui'ian " beds at

Bairow-on-Soar, not previously noticed. These were compared with other ad-

jacent sections, and the variations in the strata duly noted. The Insect beds

were shown to occupy their normal position ; but the thickness of the latter

was not so gi-eat in Leicestershire as in Warwickshire. Hence a considerable

thinning out of the Lower Lias in this direction was inferred. The Insect-bed

were believed to extend into Nottinghamshire, and thej' have been also observed

near Cave in Yorkshire.  It remains  to  be  proved  whether the  " Rhfetic             "
                                                                             series

is present beneath in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire as in Warwickshire. It

Ahas been lately detected near Gainsborough, in Lincolnshire.     general compa-

rison was then given of the lower Lias in the county of Leicester with the same

series in Warwick, Worcester and Gloster. The insect limestones were shown to

be of much economical value in making hydraulic lime and for other pui-^Doses.

Several faults on a small scale were noticed both at Barrow and at Wilmcote, in

WarAA-icksbire, in this zone. The characteristic fossils were pointed out ; and it

appeared that sauriaus and fish were abimdant, more so at Barrow than Wilmcote;

and the remains of insects were now for the first time indicated there, though they

had been long since discovered in the same division in Yorkshii-e. It was argued

in conclusion, that these lower Liassic limestones have a very extensive horizontal

range, and are characterized by the remains of insects throughout, which really

distinguish them far better than the Sam-ians, which have a much wider vertical

    Gainsborough is situate at the foot of a moderately steep escarpment of the
Keuper or uppermost division of the Triassic system.

   This escarpment consists of the usual beds of the series, yellow and blue marls
alternating with brown and gi'ey sandstones and beds of gypsum ; the latter pre-
senting both the granidar and fibrous ^-arieties. Owing to the operations of the

Great Northern Railway Company, who are lowering the gradients of their line to

Lincoln, a fine section of Rhaetic "beds has been exposed at Lea, about two miles
from Gainsborough, where the lowest bed of the series, containing Avicida contorta,
bones, and coprolites, is seen resting unconformably, thougli with parallel stratifi-
cation, on the blue marls of the Keuper. This is followed by a band of black shale
nearly unfossiliferous, above which comes the bone-bed, a narrow band full of
worn bones, teeth, scales, and coprolites, imbedded in a cement of pyrites. This
is followed again by a number of other beds of shale, sand, and limestone, of vari-
able thickness and degi'ees of hardness, the highest at present exposed, a band of
black shale about two feet thick, containing large Septarian nodules.

   The whole series is highly pyritous, and contains Avicida contorta, Pidlastra
arenicola, with teeth of Hyhodits, Acrodus, Sargodon, Tennatosaiints, and other

Rhretic fossils in abundance.
   Tlie lihcetic beds are capped by a stratum of drift which covers the surrounding

country, and through whicb the cutting passes to Marton Station, about three miles
from Lea, where a fine and very fossiliferous section of lower lias is laid bare.

   Amongst the specimens found there are Scjitasfriva Fromciitcli, Montlivaltia Hameii,

Am-Pleurotonua-ia Anylica, Turbo eleyans, Lima Ilettangiensis, several species of

On a Curious Lode or Mineral Vein at New Boseiuarne Mine, Givinear, Corn-
                        u'aU. Bij Dr. C. Le J^eve Fostek, F.Q.S.

   The author observed that it was chietiy remarkable as being a brecciated lode,
containing- rounded pebbles. Tlie lode or vein ran east and west, and dipped south,
the average dip being about 85 degreej=. The surrounding rock was the ordinary
" killas," or a hard shale, for which the name of clay-slate was not appropriate.
The lode, which had an average width of aljout 8 feet, contained on the north side
mainl)' tin, and on the south copper ore. The "tinnj-," or stanniferous part, some

--6 feet wide, consisted of fragments of killas, elvan, and killas breccia, cemented

mainly by quartz, tin-stone, niispickel, and chlorite. The fragments were mostly

--angular, but some of the pieces of killas and elvan were rounded in many cases

sufficiently so to be called true pebbles. The whole history of the formation of the
lode described by the author implied an enormous lapse of time.

On the Biscovery of Ancient Trees helow the surface of the Land at the Western
   Bock now under construction at Hull. By Dr. F. M. Foster, Hull. Head

    by James Oldham, C.E.

    The space intended for the west dock, in Hull, has been inclosed from the
Hmuber on three sides by a coft'er-dam. In the cuttings at the east end, the
 upper stratum is noticed to be silt deposited from the turbid waters of the Humber,
 locally knoNTii as " mud," and immediately under the silt, the trunks, roots, and
 branches of oak-trees, together with a peat soil of 2 feet in thiclmess, beneath
 that a strong clay soil, and under this (so far as is uncovered) an extensive bed

 of blue sand, containing the freshwater shells Lymncca, Phmorhis, &c.

    At a depth of 40 feet below the level of the adjoining land, trees (chiefly oak)
 are found in all positions; those which are upidght and still in situ having been
 broken off within 3 feet of the roots. One oak-tree, of noble dimensions, is per-
 fectly straight, its trunk being 45 feet long, and in the thickest part measuring

 125 feet in circumference ; it is tolerably sound, but blackened in colour. This
 tree lies nearly north and south, but others, which have also fallen, are to be met
 with in everj^ direction.

     In a hole caused by the decay of a branch, was fomid a quantity of hazel-nuts,
 possably the winter store of some pro\ident squirrel ; the shells, though black,
 were quite perfect.

    The undulating state of the original surface may be seen by the silt abo-\e
 bemg of a lighter colour than the lower stratum. It is evident, from the position

  of the roots, that the ground on the north or land side, on which the trees gi-ew,
  has been higher than the south or river side, thiis indicating the side of a valley
  before the existence of the estuary of the Humber, and probably of the North Sea.

     The trees cannot be less than 3000 years old ; and would require at least 300
 years to attain the dimensions given. In a boring made the chalk has been foimd
  at the depth of 110 feet below the surface of the sea.

  On the Anylo-Beh/ian Basin of the Forest-bed of Norfolh and Suffolh, and

    the Union of England with the Continent duriny the Glacicd Period. By

      the Rev. J. Gunn.

   A question of the greatest importance had been raised by Mr. Godwin-Austen

  with reference to the extension of the Belgian coal-measures to this cormtry. It
  was evident that in the mesozoic period, the continuous ranges of chalk in Bel-
  gium, France, and England, formed a basin, in which tertiaries were deposited.
  The author, after researches carried on for upwards of thirty years, had come to the
  conclusion that the forest-bed was the estuarine deposit of some great river or
  rivers flowing westward, closed on the south by a ridge of chalk-hills, and open to

  the sea on the nortli ; and that such ancient ri^er or rivers were now represented

by the several rivers flowing into the German Ocean between the mouths of the
Scheldt and the Ehine. Thus there might he said to be on the English coast the
remains of an estuary without a river, and on the Belgian side of a river or rivers
without an estuary. The author followed up a description of the deposits by a
remark that he strongly suspected the disruption of this country fi-om the Continent
took place at a more recent period than was assigned to it by geologists generally.
His impression was that the forest-bed aud the crag-series which preceded it could
only be studied to advantage in connexion with and as part of the corresponding

beds of the Continent.

On the Miocene Flora of North Greenland By Professor Osavald Heek.

                              Translated by Egbert H. Scott.

   The Royal Dublin Society is in possession of a ricli collection of fossil plants,

which have been brought from the Arctic Regions by Capt. Sir F. Leopold

M'Clintock and Capt. Philip H. Colomb, at various times, and have been pre-

sented by these gentlemen to the museum of the Society. I am indebted to the

kindness of I\Iij Robert H. Scott, Plonorary Secretaiy of the Royal Geological
Society of Ireland, for a sight of these specimens, as the Royal Dublin Society has

been induced to entrust the whole collection to me for examination. Before I
received these, Dr. J. D. Hooker had entrusted to me specimens which had been pre-
sented to the Museum at Kew by Dr. Lyall and Dr. "\Valker. In this latter collec-
tion I discovered seven determinable species, Avhich are also to be found among the

specimens of the Dublin collection. In this I find sixtv-three recognizable species.

If we add to this the additional species mentioned by Brongniart and Vaupel, we

obtain a total of sixty-six species.

  All the specimens of the Dublin and Kew collections come from Atanekerdluk,

as do also the specimens which Capt. E. A. Ingletield brought home, of which he

deposited a portion in the Museum of the Geological Survey, aud retained a portion

in his own hands. The former have been kindly sent to me by Sir Roderick Mur-

chison, while I have obtained the latter through the goodness of their owner.

AAtanekerdluk lies on the "Waigat, opposite Disco, in lat. 70°.  steep hill rises

on the coast to a height of 1080 feet, and at this level the fossil plants are found.

Large quantities of wood in a fossilized or carbonized condition lie about. Capt.

Ingletield observed one trunk thicker than a man's body standing upright. The

leaves, however, are the most important portion of the deposit. The rock in which

they are found is a sparry iron ore, which turns reddish brown on exposure to the

weather. In this rock the leaves are found, in places packed closely together, and

many of them are in a A^ery perfect condition. They give us a most valuable

insight into the nature of the vegetation which formed this primseval forest.

The catalogue which I append to this paper will give a general idea of the flora

of this forest of Atanekerdluli ; but before we proceed to discuss it, I must make a

few remarks.

(1) I7ie fossilized plants of Atanekerdluk cannot have been drifted from any great

distance. They must have grown up on the spot where they are fotmd. This is

proved--

(rt) By the fact that Capt. Inglefield and Dr. Rink observed trunks of trees

standing upright.

   (b) By the great abimdance of the leaves, and the perfect state of preservation
in which they are found. Timber, hard fruits, and seeds, may often be carried to

a great distance by ocean currents, 1)ut leaves always fall to pieces on such a long
journey, and they are the more liable to suft'er from wear and tear the larger they

Weare. find in Greenland \cry large leaves, many of which are perfect up to the

very edge. It is, however, difficult to work them out from a stone which splits

very irregularly and consequently we can hardly exhibit tlie entire lea-\-es in a
                                                                                         ;

perfect condition.

   (c) By the fact that we find in the stone both fruits and seeds of the trees whose
--54 REPORT 1866.

leaves are also found there. Thus, of Sequoia Langsdorffii we see not only the twigs

--covered with leaTes, but also cones and seeds, and even a male blossom catkin

(katzcheu) of Populug, Corijhis, Ostrija, Palivrus, and Prunus, there are leaves and
some remains of fruit, which could not be the case if the specimens had drifted

from a great distance.

   (f/) By our finding remains of insects with the leaves. There is the elytron of a

small beetle, and the ^ving of a good-sized wood-bug (probably belonging to the

fauiilj^ of the Pentatomidce).

   (2) The Flora of Atanckcnllulcis Miocene. Of the sixty-.six species of North Green-
land, eighteen occur in the Miocene deposits of Central Europe. Nine of these are very
MTidely distributed both as to time and space, viz., Sequoia Lanf/sdorffii, Taxodimn
duhiion, Phraf/mites Oenim/ensis, Quercus Dnjmeia, Planera Unfferi, Diospi/ros hrachij-
aepala, Andromeda jtrotof/a-a, Phammis Eridani, and JugJatis acuminata. These are
found both in the upper and lower Molasse, while some species, viz., Sequoia
Coidtsice, Osmunda Heerii, Corylus 3Iacquarrii, and Pojndus Zaddaclii, have not as
yet been noticed in the upper Molasse. From these facts it seems probable that

the fossil forest of Atanekerdlulc flom-ished in that high northern latitude <at

the lower Miocene epoch.

    (3) The Flora of North Greenland is very ricli in species. This is evident from
the gi'eat variety of plants which the specimens exhibit. Although the amount of
material obtained from Atanelverdluk is of small extent compared with that which

has come fi-om the Swiss localities, yet many of the slabs contain fom- or five species,

and in one instance even eleven. Atanekerdluk has been only twice visited, so that

we can only consider that we have got a glimpse of the treasures buried there, and
wliich await a more carefril search. At Disco and Hare Island there are extensive
beds of brown coal, in whose neighbourhood we may fairly expect to find fossil

plants. In fact, Professor Goppert mentions three species from Kooli (?) in lat. 70°
N., Pecopteris borealis, Sequoia Lanf/sdorffii, and Zamitcs j{rcticus, whicli, strange to
say, he has described (in liis Jalu'buch fiii- Mineralogie, 1866, p. 1-j4).

    (4) The Flora of Atenehcrdluk proves, wilhout a doubt, that North Greenland, in
the Miocene E2ioch, had a climate much xcarmer than its present one. The diflerence
must be at least 30° F.

   Professor Heer discusses at considerable length this proposition. He sa5''S that
the evidence from Greenland gives a final answer to those who objected to tlie con-
clusions as to the Miocene climate of Europe drawn by him on a former occasion.

It is quite impossible that the trees found at Atanekerdluk could ever have flourished
there if the temperature were not far higher than it is at present. This is clear

first from many of tlie species, of which we find the nearest lining representatives
10° or even 20" of latitude to the soutli of the locality in question. Some of the species
are quite pecviliar, and their relationship to other forms is as yet in doubt. Of these
the most important are a Baphnoyene (D. Kanii), the genus 3P ClintocMa, and a
Zamites. The Daphnogene had large thick leathery leaves, and was prolmbly ever-

green.

   M^ Clintochia, a new genus, comprises certain specimens belonging, perhaps, to
the family of the Pi'oteaceos. The Zamites is also new. Inasmuch as we know no
existing analogues for these plants, we cannot draw accurate conclusions as to the

climatai conditions in which they flourished. It is, however, quite certain tliat they
never could have borne a low temperature.

   If, now, we look at those species whicli we may consider as possessing living
representatives, we shall find that, on an average, the highest limit attainable

by them, even under artificial culture, lies at least 12° to the southward.
This, however, does not give a fair view of the circumstances of the
case. The trees at Atanekerdluk were not all at the exti-enie northern

limit of their growth. This may have been the case with some of the
species; others, however, extended much further north; for in the Miocene
flora of Spitzl)orgen, lat. 78° N., we find the beech, plane, hazelnut, and some

other species identical with those from Greenland. For the opportunity of examin-

ing these specimens, I am indebted to Professor Nordenskiold. At the present time

the firs and poplars reach to a latitude 15° above the artificial limit of the plane,

and 10° above that of tlie beech. Accordingly we may conclude that the firs and
poplars which we meet at Atauelrerdhilv and at" Bell Sound, Spitzberg-en, must have

reached up to the north pole, in so far forth as there was land there in the tertiary
period. Tlie hills of fossilized wood found by M' CI are and his companions in Banks
Land (lat. 74° 27' N.), are therefore discoveries which shoidd not astonish us; they

only confirm the evidence as to the original vegetation of the polar regions which
we have derived from other sources. Ihe Professor then proceeds to say that the

whole course of reasoning which led him to the conclusion that the mioce'ne tenipe-

peraturo of Greenland was oO^ F. higher than its present one, was too long to bo

included in a paper lilie the present one ; it would bo fully developed in his work

' On the Fossil Flora of the Polar Regions,' which will contain descriptions and

plates of the plants discovered in North Greenland, Melville Island, Banks Land,

Mackenzie River, Iceland, and Spitzbergen, and which he hopes to publish at an

early date.

f He then selects Sequoia Langsdorffii, the most abundant ofthe trees at Atanekerdluk,

and proceeds to investigate the conclusions as to climate deducible from the fact of
its existence in Greenland. Sequoia scmpervirens Lamb. (Red-wood) is its present

representative, and resembles it so closely that we may consider S. sempervirens to

be the direct descendant of S. Langsdorffii. This ti-ee is cultivated in most of the

botanical gardens of Europe, and its exti-eme northern limit may be placed at lat.
53° N. For its existence it requires a summer temperature of 60° F. Its fruit re-
quires a temperature of 65° F. for ripening. The winter temperature must not fall
below 31° F., and that of the whole 3-ear must be at least 50 F. Accordingly we
may consider the isothermjrl of 50° as its northern limit. This we may then take

as the northern temperatm-e of the Sequoia Langsdorffii, and 50° F. as the absolute

minimum of temperatiue under which the vegetation of Atanekerdluk could have

existed there.

The present annual temperatm'e of the locality is about 20° F. Dove gives the

normal temperature of the latitude (70° N.) at 16° F. Thus Greenland has too high

a temperature ; but if we come fiu-ther to the eastward we meet with a temperature

of 33° F. at Altenfiord. Even this extreme variation from the normal conditions

of climate is 17° F. lower than that which we are obliged t^ assume as having pre-
vailed dming the JNliocene period.

   The author states that the results obtained confirm his conclusions as to the cli-
mate of Central Europe at the same epoch (couf. Hear, jRechsrches sur le Climat et la
Vegetation du patj& Tevtiaire,^. 193), and shows at some length how entirely insuffi-

cient the A-iews of Sartorius von Waltershausen are to explain the facts of the case.
   Herr Sartorius would account for the former high temperature of certain localities

by supposing the existence of an insular climate in each case. Such suppositions

would be quite inadequate to account for such extreme difterences of climate as the

evidence now under consideration proves to have existed.

Professor Pleer concludes his paper as follows :

   I think these facts are convincing, and the more so as they are not insulated, but
confirmed by the evidence derivable from the Miocene Flora of Iceland, Spitzbergen,

and Northern Canada. These conclusions, too, are only links in the grand chain of

evidence obtained from the examination of the Miocene Flora of the whole of

Europe. They prove to us that we could not by any re-arrangement of the relative

positions of land and water produce for the uorthem hemisphere a climate which
Wewould explain the phenomena in a satisfactory manner.
                                                         must only admit that

we are fiice to face with a problem, whose solution in all probability must be at-

tempted and, we doubt not, completed by the astronomer.

             The Geological Distribution of Petroleum in North America.

               B)j Prof. C. H. HiTcncocK, M.A., of New YorTc City.

   During the past five years the United States of America have produced more than
three hundred millions of gallons of petroleum. The average daily yield for the
present year (1866) has been at least 12,000 barrels. The business of collecting,

transporting, and refinipg it employs as many hands as either the coal- or iron-trade.
--56 REroRT 18G6.

On account of its economic importance, therefore, this commodity demands a

passing notice of its geological relations.

    1. Petroleum sometimes occurs in si/iich'/ial basins, like the subterranean streams
of water penetrated by Artesian bore-holes. This is the case in Western Pemisyl-
vania, the most prolific of all the " oil-regions." It is found beneath each of three

sandstones, or sets of impervious strata, designated by tlie workmen as the "first,''
" second," and " third." In the small-yield wells the oil may constitute the drain-
age of an inconsiderable thickness of saturated Layers. The aid of pumps is often

required to bring the fluid to the surface.

2. Petroleum may occm- in cuvities andjissnres in the strata, either upon synclinal

basins or anticlinal slopes. The existence of a cavity is inferred from the prodigious

amount of fluid spouting out of the ground, as of the Grant Well at Pitt Hole,

which at the time of my visit was producing 1800 barrels of petroleum every day.

Manj' of these wells discharge their products intemiittently. Besides petroleum,

brine and gas are commonly,  perhaps universally,  discharged from the                                                                                        orifice                               and
                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

we may suppose that, before the tapping of the cavity, they were an-anged according

to their respective gravities, the gas xippermost and the brine at the bottom. The

varying phenomena of discharge may be explained by supposing different parts of

the'cavity to have been reached by the boring-rod in the several instances. When

a cavity is large, two or more bore-holes may penetrate it, as was the case with

the celebrated Phillips and Woodford Wells. Generally the wells of one neigh-

bourhood seem to have  some connection       with one another                                                                                   for  if  old  and unpro-
                                                                                                                                             ;

ductive holes are not closed, the discharge from new and promising wells is im-

peded. Abandoned holes should always be plugged up, partly for the benefit of

new entei-prises, and partly because it has been discovered that by rest they will

again become productive. The oleiferoiis reser\oirs may be iiTegular cavities, ver-

tical, hoi-izontal, or inclined fissures, an enlargement of natural joints, &c. Ex-

plorers look for regions where the strata have been much folded and broken, pro-

mising that the di.slocatious may produce cavities in which fluids will accumulate.

.3. Petroleum may occur along lines of fniiUs. Examples of this nature are in

Western "S'irginia, Southern Kentucky, and elsewhere.

A4. Petroleum may exist in c/reat quantities beneath anticlinal arches.                                                                                                                             fault

may change into an anticlinal along the strike. Examples of this nature are in

Albert Co., N. B., Gaspe, C. E., and in Canada West. The roof acts as an impervi-

ous cover to confine the fluids until the drill of the workman appears for their

liberation.

   These facts show us where to expect petrolemn in considerable amount. If we

search in that tarea where the oil-layer comes to the surface, or its distribution is

represented by the colours of a geological map, we shall find only shallow and
small-produciiig wells. Nevertheless these may be more permanent than the
deeper ones, and may be worked profitably from generation to generation, where
labour is inexpensive. The great wells involve three essentials ; first, plenty of
bituminous matter in the petroleum formation, from which an abundant supply
may be drawn ; second, cavities and crevices in the strata ; third, an impenious

cover, like the roof of an anticlinal, to have prevented the escape of the fluid in
East ages. The best " surface-indications " generally guide to shallow wells. The

  est reservoirs have been found at considerable depths.
    5. There are no less than fourteen different fonnations in North America (not

including the A^'est Indies) from which petroleum has been obtained, generally in

productive amount.

    (a). Pliocene Tertiary of California. This has been known for a century.

    (6). In Colorado and Utah, near lignite beds of Cretaceous age. Not yet

explored.

    (c). In small amount in the Trias of Connecticut and North Carolina.

   ((?). Near the top of the Carboniferous rocks in W. Va., including many of the

best producing wells in the .state.

   (e). Shallow wells near Wheeling, W. Va., and Athens, O., not far from the

Pittsburg coal.

   (/). 475 feet lower, near the Pomevoy ccal-bed.

ducing wells upon Oil Creek has satisfied me that they are aranged in four groups,

with scarcely any intermediate stragglers. Tliese centres are at Titusville, Petro-

leum, Cherry Run and vicinity, and about Oil City. Those at Pit Hole constitute

another group. The quantity and quality of petroleum obtained is proportioned

(the latter inversely) to the depth attained by the bore-holes. In the Cherry Run

district the wells in the vallej' average 550 feet in depth ; those at Pit Hole average

620 feet. At both these localities attempts have been made successfully to obtain

petroleum by piercing the hill-sides, and that from levels abo^e the average depth

of the valleys.

formations from the Genessee to the Marcellus slates. This is about the middle of

   («). In the equivalents of the Lorraine and Utica slates and Trenton limestone

The immense territory in North America, several hundred square mUes in extent,

underlaid by the formations mentioned above, in an unaltered state, assures the

Newworld that the petroleum of the                                                                              World, like its coal, is probabl}- practically

inexhaustible.

6. Petroleum is unquestionably of organic origin. In my opinion the great mass

of it has been  derived from plants                                                                             but  some  think it comes from animals, being
                                                                                                             ;

either a fish-oil or a substance related to adipocere. It does not appear to be the

result of a natural distillation of coal, since its chemical composition is difi'erent

from the oil manufactured artificially from the cannels, containing neither aniline

nor nitrobenzole. Moreo\'er, petroleum occupied fissures in the Silurian and De-

vonian strata long before the trees of the coal-period were growing in their native

forests. The nearly universal association of brine with petroleum, and the fact of

the slight solubility of hj'drocarbon in fresh- but insolubility in salt-water, excite

the inquiry whether salt-water of prinueval lagoons may not have prevented the

escape of the vegetable gases beneath, and condensed them into liquid ! The hint
appears to us worthy of consideration.

On the parts of England and Wales in which Coal may and may not he loolrd
  for beyond the liwwn Coal-field?:. By Sir Eodeeick I. Muechison, Bart.,

    K.C.B., D.C.L., F.E.S., F.G.S., Director- General of the Geological Survey.

   The ingenious suggestion of IMr. Godwin-Austen, that coal-measures might pos-
sibly be found under London and the south-eastern part of England, was formed on
a general and comprehensive view, as well as upon observation. He argued that as
coal is worked under tlie chalk at Valenciennes, in France, and had been found to a
small extent in recent sinkings under the cretaceous deposits ranging westwards
towards Calais, it might further extend across the Channel, and occur under similar

cretaceous rocks in the south of England.

   This theory, which, from the reputation of its author, attracted considerable atten-
tion, has recently been largely and boldly applied by Mr. H. Ilussey "S'ivian, M.F.,

who, in a speech delivered in the House of Commons, when moving for the appoint-
ment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the quantity of Eritisli coal, expressed
the opinion that this mineral might be found in the southern counties of England,

and even beneath the Houses of Parliament.
--58 KEPOKT 1866.

Reflection vipon tlio order and nature of the rocks which surroimd the south-

eastern counties of England, whether on the coast of Franco, the Channel Islands,

or the western, midland, or northern counties of England, having- led me to adopt

an opposite conclusion, I beg to offer the following observations in explanation of

the view which I take, viz. that no ]3roductive coal-measures can reasonably be

looked for in Essex, Kent, Sussex, Middlesex, Herts, Hants, Bucks, Oxfordshire,

Suffolk, Norfolk, and the eastern counties, from Yorkshire southwards. In this

list Nottinghamshire is happily not included. To it must necessarily be added

all the numerous tracts wherein rocks older thaii the carboniferous rise to th"

surface, as in the greater part of Wales and Herefordshire, in all of which coal

cannot of necessity be found.

Let us first test the value of the data afforded by observations in France, which

have led to the application of the above theory to the south of England.

   But although I diiFer from Mr. Godwin-Austen, the difference between us is not

great, inasmuch that I do not believe that my distinguished friend maintains that

a really valuable coal-field is likely to be found in the south-eastern counties, but

simply, that some carboniferous and older rocks may there underlie the younger

deposits. His memoir is, indeed, full of originality in tracing out the gradual position

of an old terrestrial area over v.'hieh the vegetation that formed the coal-fields pro-

bably extended.

It is true that beds of coal of considerable dimensions are worked at Valen-

ciennes at once beneath the chalk, all the intervening formations which exist in

many other parts of the world being there omitted. This fact simply indicates

that at Valenciennes the coal-bearing deposits had formerly been elevated, so as to

constitute ancient lauds, and had not been afterwards depressed under the sea

during all the periods in which the Triassic, Liassic, and Jurassic formations were

accumulated in other tracts. These carboniferous strata of Valenciennes con-

stitute a portion of the southern edge or lip of the great coal-basin of Belgium, in

which country', together with the sulDJaceut Carboniferous and Devonian limestones,

they form those great undulations so admirably laid down in the geological map of

M. Dumont. The portion of these coal-strata which exists in France, and which at

Valenciennes dips at a high angle to the north to pass into Belgium, has been also

found to have a lateral extension on the strike for a certain distance to the west

beneath the Cretaceous rocks, i. e., towards the British Chaimel.

  By trials made through the Cretaceous rocks and other overlying deposits,

these same coal-strata have been proved to extend to the west of Bethune. But

they there gradually thin out to a narrow band, which diminishes to a wedge-lik(3

mass directed to W.N.W. The western limit of the better portion of the field has

been definitely proved by the fact that, in all the borings which have been made to

the east of a village called Flechenelle, Devonian limestones, schists, and grits filono

have been reached, the coal being thus completely omitted.

   For general purposes the geological map of France, by Messrs. Elie de Beaumont

and Dufrenoy, sufficiently explains this thinning out to the west of the Valenciennes

Mycoal-field.    conclusions, however, are more specially drawn from a good statis-

tical coal-mining survey map of France, recently prepared by able civil engineers,

as laid down on the maps of the Depot de la Guerre, as well as from my own ob-

servations in the Boulonnais. On this map, every concession or grant of a right

to sink for coal (in number exceeding 200) is marked ; the results of each sinking,
and the depths being regularh' given. The limits of the coal-bearing strata on the

north and on the south of the Carboniferous Zone have been thus ascertained by

trials, all of which show that the Devonian rocks fiank on each side this narrow

tongue of coal-measures, the extreme point of which is at Flechenelle. Between

that village and Boulogne, Devonian rocks only are found under the secondarj^

deposits in all the borings that have been made. It is only to the north of Bou-

logne, at Hardingen, that a detached mass of carboniferous limestone, with an

insignificant patch of worthless coal associated with it, is seen to be basined upon

those Devonian rocks which there rise to the surface. In short, all the practical

French geologists with whom I have conversed are of opinion that the coal-basin
                TRANSACTIONS OF TUB SECTIONS.                            59

of Valenciennes and Belgium terminates, as far as productive value goes, a few
miles west of Bethime.

   As the coal-measures thus thiu out towards the British Channel, though some
ti-aces of poor coal have been found near Calais, we have a clear demonstration

in the Boulonnais that no productive coal-measures are superposed to the carboni-

ferous or mountain-limestone. In other parts, indeed, of the same district, the

true Devonian limestone, with many fossils, as well as crystalline carboniferous

limestone are at once covered by oolitic and cretaceous rocks to the entire exclu-
sion of any workable coal. Judging, then, from the gradual deterioration and
extinction of the coal-beds as fhey approach the French side of the Channel,
I hold that there can be no reason to hope that better conditions can be looked
for throughout the southern counties of England.

Looking, however, to the well-ascertained data that the secondary rocks of the

western and central parts of England which lie beneath the chalk, viz. the

Trias, Lias, and Oolites, thin out in their extension to the south-east, as well

proved by a memoir of Mr. Hull, still it is by no means improbable that the part

of the oolitic series which appears in the clifts north of Boulogne may be persistent

under the cretaceous and wealden rocks of Sussex and Kent. But the question is

What will the fundamental rocli: prove to be in these districts if it should ever be

searched for? Reasoning from such data and the visible outcrops in the Boulon-
mynais,
         inference is that, if not in part Jm-assic, they will probably prove to be

a thin band of carboniferous limestone without any productive coal, or more pro-

bably Devonian rock only. So far, then, I agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen as to

paleozoic rocks (but unproductive of coal) being possibly found in the south-east

of England.

   Again, if we follow the course of tlie older rocks in France southwards from the

Boulonnais, everywhere Devonian rocks only have been found beneath the secondary

strata ; and, proceeding througli Normandy and Brittany, we find that the Jurassic

rocks repose at once on lower Silurian rocks to the total exclusion of everythino-

Carboniferous or even Devonian; whilst in the Channel Islands nothing but
crystalline rocks of granite, gneiss, and slate occur, with no signs of any Inter-
mediate strata between them and the Wealden and cretaceous rocks of the Isle of

Wight and Hampshire.

   Tracing the line of the older rocks which separate the south-eastern from the
south-western counties, we see the Devonian roclcs of the Qaantocli: Hills, in West
Somerset, at once overlaid by new red sandstone, oolitic, and cretaceous rocks,

without a sign of anything carljoniferous. When we advance northwards from the

Mendip Hills, the phenomena we there meet with are, it seems to nie, indicative

of the hopelessness of seeking for any productive coal-measures between these hills

and the Straits of Dover, i. e. in Wilts, Hants, Sussex, Kent, Surrey, J.Iiddlesex,

Essex, and Herts. For, on the west, the mountain-limestone forms" tlie outward

eastern girdle of the great Somerset and Bristol coal-basin from Wells and Elm,

near Fromc, on the south, to Chipping Sodlmry, Wickwar, and to near Tortworth

on the north.

   Throughout a distance of about 35 miles, the carboniferous limestone with traces
only_ of mill-stone grit, which is the unproductive bottom-rock of every coal-

bearing stratum in the south of England and Wales, is everywhere and at once

surmounted on the east by now red sandstone, or the lias and oolitic forma-

tions. It has been said that an exception to this ride occurs in the neighbour-

hood of Frome, where the unproductive limestone is said to exhibit an axial

foi-m with coal-measures on two sides. Not having been for many years in

that tract, I ask for information, and will only now say that, if the coal so

worked be not on the eastern flank of the limestone but on the southern side, and

myis not seen to dip to the east and so pass under the secondary rocks,  reasoning

is unaffected.

   However this may be, we know that all along the remainder of the outcrop of

mountain-limestone which forms the eastern boundary of the Bristol coal-basin

the strata of that limestone are highly inclined to the west, thus passing under the'

Bristol coal-basin proper. Now, it is on the highly inclined and upturned edo-es of

tliat mountain-limestone that the secondary rocks lying to the east at once repose,
60 REPORT-- 1866.

without any portion of those deposits of coal which are so thickly spread out to
the west of tliis band, whether in the Bristol basin, properly so defined, the Forest
of Dean, or the great South Welsh coal-tield.

   So much for nearly the whole of the country lying to the east of the outer-
most or underlying baud of all the carboniferous rocks of the south of England
and Wales, including the Forest of Dean, to the east of which the non-existence
of any coal-measures is rendered still more striking; because, in addition to a
rim of mountain-limestone, wholly unproductive of coal, the Old Red Sandstone

and Silurian rocks are interposed in the Tortworth country, and on the east are im-
mediately covered by the lias and oolites. Tlie same data and the same reasoning
must, indeed, be applied to the country extending from that tract northwards, and
to the valley of the Severn, and the Cotswold Hills, as well as to all the country

lying to the south-east of Cheltenham.

   Who, for example, would speculate on the chance of finding coal to the north
of the poor little outlying coal-tract of Xewent, in Gloucestershire, when it is

kno'wni that on the north the Silurian and older roclcs rise to the surface ; their

flanks being covered at once by Permian or New Eed Sandstone ? Equally absurd

would it be to look for coal in those parts of the Severn Valley of Worcester,

which lie to the east of the ]Malvern liills, where the New Eed Sandstone also

lies directly upon the crystalline and other rocks of that range.
   The Malvern Hills on the south-west, and Charuwood Forest on the north-east,

each composed of Cambrian rocks older than the Silurian, form salient promon-

tories which seem to me to be indicative of the former southern coast-line of those pro-

ductive coal-fields of the Central Coimlies, which have been raised up through the

Permian and Xew Eed Sandstone formations. I would not aflirm that the southern-

most of these fields, those of Leicestershire and Warwiclishire, have no southern
extension, though they give strong signs of deterioration in that direction. I know,
however, that to the south of the South Staftbrdshire coal-field, all the produc-
tive coal-measures huxe been found b}- actual trials to thin out, old rocks of

Silurian age being reached beneath. I presiune, therefore, that no further efiforts

will be made in the more southern counties in that meridian.
   On the other hand there can be little doubt that m^t supplies of coal will

eventually be worked to the north and west of those fields, far beneath the Pennian

and New Eed Sandstone formations of the Midland Comities, wherein the coal-

measures have beeu raised to tlie surface by upheaval through those younger

deposits. Thus, in the Eed Sandstone tracts between Wolverhampton and Coal

Brook Dale, in Cheshire, between tlie Flintshire and Lancashire Coal Fields, and
over other large areas similarly circumstanced, there can be little doubt that coal

--will ultimately be worked a view which I advocated thirty years ago, and pub-

lished in my work, the ' Silurian System.'

   To retm-n to the consideration of the wide southern area in which London lies,
let us proceed due north from Eeading. On this line the first ancient rocks we
meet with are the slates of Cliarnwood Forest, which are admitted to be of Cam-
brian or infra-Silurian age. To the west of these, indeed, lies the Leicester
coal-tract, as well as other coal-fields of the central counties to which I have

alluded ; but to the east, on the contrary, nothing is seen but secondary rocks,

--from the Xew Eed Sandstone and lias to the oolites and cretaceous rocks. Who,

then, with such an outcrop of Cambrian slates in the west, would sink for coal in
any of the counties lying to the east of Charuwood Forest and Hart Hill ? The
recent well-sinking at Harwich to procure water has, indeed, completely solved
this portion of the problem. Tliere, beneath 1025 feet of chalk, the trial ended in
the discovery of a hard slaty rock, with fossils of the lower carboniferous lime-
stone, evidently older than any coal-bearing stratum. Specimens of tliis rock are

preserved in the Museum of Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, as a warning to
those speculators who would search for coal in the eastern or .south-efistern

counties of England. This fact shows indeed conclusively, that the great Belgian
coal-field does not extend eastwards to England, thougli the older rocks on which

it rests are persistent into our countrv.

   To ^^·iden the application of the inferences respecting those tracts where coal
cannot reasonably be sought for, I may extend the reasoning to parts of Lincolnshire
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  61

aud the East Rding of Yorkshire, as well as to a large portion of the North Riding

of the latter county. On this head I will first allude to the south side of the valley

of the Tees, a tract which I have long known, extending from Croft, by Middleton-

one-Row, to the town of Middlesborough, where the New Red Sandstone, of enor-

mous thickness, is covered by detritus and northern drift. At Middlesborough tlie

spirited ironmaster, Mr. Yaughan, being desirous of obtaining subterranean water

for the working of his engines, sunk an Artesian well to the depth of 1800 feet,

--and at length reached a body of rock-salt, subordinate to the New Red Sandstone,
   in fact, without reaching even the surface of the magnesian limestone, through

which the deep coal-pits of the east coast of Durham are sunk to the extreme depth

at which coal has hitherto been worked in that county. If, then, the coal-measui-es

should be prolonged uudergi'omid to the south of the Tees (which, from my ob-

servation of the rocks between Seaton Carew and Hartlepool, I greatly doubt, as
there are symptoms of a basin-shaped arrangement of the strata), and should pass

imder the vale of Cleveland, and the hills of the eastern moorlands, what, I may

ask, would be the vast depth at which they could be won, by passing through the

oolites and lias, in addition to the New Red Sandstone and magnesian limestone ?

   In the excellent work on Yorkshire by Professor Phillips, and indeed on all
geological maps of England, it is shown that throughout a distance of many miles

the lower or improductive carboniferous rocks of limestone and millstone grit of
the Yorkshire Dales are at once surmounted by the magnesian limestone of the

Permian group.

   On the banks of the Tees, west of Darlington, wherever the magnesian limestone
forms the upper stratum, as at Conscliffe, it is at once underlaid by unproductive

millstone gTit, which on the west lies upon mountain-limestone ; the productive

coal-measure which ought to lie between the millstone grit and the Permian

rocks being entirely wanting owing, either to great denudation or to an ancient

elevation of the tract after the lower carboniferous period. This iiprise of the

older rocks seems also to form a southern border of the great Durham coal-basin.

In fact, no valuable coaly matter has ever had an existence in the tract extending
from Barnard Castle on the Tees, to the south of Harrogate. At the latter place

and its environs, we have, further, the clearest possible proof of the omission of all

the productive coal-strata ; for the Plumpton rocks aud conglomerates underlying

the magnesian limestone, and foi-ming, in my opinion, the base of the Permian

system, are seen to repose directly on improductive millstone giit, which, in its

turn, rests upon the mountain-limestone of the western dales of Yorkshire.

  But whilst I give this as not merely my opinion, and that also of Professors
Phillips and Sedgwick, who have surveyed the tract in question, and also that of
manjf sound geologists, I may state that Mr. Lonsdale Bradley, acting for my friend

Mr. "Webb, of Newstead Abbey, is conducting experimental borings through the

Red Sandstone aud magnesian limestone between Northallerton and the Tees, in

the persuasion that, as the mountain- or carboniferous limestone disappears rapidly

beneath the superjacent deposits to the east of Middleton Tyas, there may be found
a productive coal-field, like that of Durham or Leeds, between the strata which
they are now piercing and the subjacent carboniferous limestone.

   This view is well explained in the diagrams which Mr. Londsdale Bradley has

allowed me to exhibit on this occasion. I must, however, declare that I think the

probabilities are entirely against the success of this enterprise, though as geologists

we commend ^Mr. Webb for making this trial, by which he will have done good

service to our science.

   To the south of Harrogate the great coal-fields of Leeds and the West Riding
appear with a well-defined boundary of millstone grit on the north and west. To
the east, however, of the known boundary of these fields there is a fair probability

that some coal may be found to extend under the magnesian limestone aud New

Red Sandstone.
   As we proceed southwards along the escarpment of the magnesian limestone in

its range from Yorkshire into Nottinghamshire, and thu? tiank succe3sivel_y the

Sheffield aud Derbyshire coal-fields, we find a progressive thickening of the coal

which lies beneath the Permian rock. Whilst thin and poor beds only have as yet

been worked in the south of Y''orkshire beneath the magnesian limestone, we now
--62 REPORT 1866.

know, thanks to the spirit and energy of the late Duke of Newcastle, that at Shire
Oaks good seams of coal, the prolongation of the Sheffield field, are worked to
profit. But the most important phenomenon of all others to the inhabitants of
Nottingham is, that in the tract between Mansfield and tliat town, the coal -strata

of Derbyshire, rich as they are, become thicker and richer as they dip to the east

mider the maguesian limestone. When visiting Mr. William Webb, at Newstead

Abbey, in the year 1863, I had sincere pleasure in annomiciug this important fact

in a lecture which I gave in the Mechanics' Institution at Mansfield, inasmuch as

the realization of it rendered the properties of my friend and his neighbours much

more valuable. The coal-pits which have almost been sunk along their lands near
Hucknall and other places, are satisfactory proofs of the 'certainty of now finding

excellent coal, superior, indeed, in quality and in dimensions to most of the coal-

beds of Derbyshire, in position and in tracts where no one, even a few years ago,

except geologists, thought of their existence. Indeed it is possible that at some
distant day, and when the more easily attainable coals are exhausted under the
magnesian limestone, the mineral will be worked under the new red sandstone

to the north of Nottingham, though at depths which at present would render such

operations nnremunerative.

But whilst I thus advert to portions of Nottinghamshire as included in those

British areas in which future supplies of coal will in all probability be obtained by

sinking deep through overlying deposits, it forms no part of this communication to

--dwell upon this point, still less to treat of the known coal-fields, Avhether they be

basins subtended by old red and moimtain limestone, as in South Wales or the
Forest of Dean, or upcasts through the Permian and new red sandstones of the

central counties. These subjects, which have already been ably handled by Mr.

Hull, one of my associates in the Geological Survey, and whose work, as Avell as

that of Mr. Jevous, has excited great public interest in reference to tlie duration

of British coal, will, I know, be well inquired into by the Royal Coal Commis-

My.sion.  sole object is to exclude from the reasoning npon the English coal-fields,

whether near the sm-face, or attainable through overlying rocks, those hypotheses

which, however ingenious in theory, are, in my opinion negatived by fair reasoning

on the data we possess. Thus, when we exclude, as of necessity, 21,800 square

miles, or nearly one-half of England and Whales, as consisting of rocks older than
the coal-measures, and in which no coal can possibly be found ; and when I
have further shown strong a priori reasons for setting aside the hypothesis that

productive coal-fields ma}' exist under our southern and eastern counties, we have
fii'st to proceed to form the best approximate estimate we can of the amount of

coal left in those fields which have been long worked. Next to endeavom- to

ascertain what is the prospect of a profitable extraction of coal from deep-seated

beds, by reaching them at certain depths beneath the superjacent Permian, or other

overlviug deposits, through which they have been upheaved to constitute the coal-

fields' of the Midland Counties. Such will be the objects of the Royal Coal Com-
mission recently appointed ; and on which I am as yet imable to give any reliable

opinion.

   By excluding from the incpiry into the present or probable future coal supply of

England and Wales, all the tracts of crj'stalliue and palaeozoic rocks which rise out

from beneath the carboniferous strata, and in which no trace of coal can ever be

discovered, and also all those secondary and tertiary rocks beneath which, for the

reasons given, there can be scarcely anj^ hope of finding that mineral, it will be seen

that the existing and possibly future supplies have, for all practical purposes, an

approximately defined limit, and that they range over little more than one-eighth

of England and Wales, or an area of about GOOO square miles.

Declining to express any opinion as to tlie duration of the accessible coal-beds in

Britain mitil a closer survey shall have been completed, I fully appreciate the

anxious desire which is felt by all persons who are interested in the future welfare

of their country, to have the subject fully and fairly inquired into ; the more so as

I have now in conclusion to announce that, by the last inquiry made by Mr.

Robert Hunt, the indefatigable compiler of the Mining Records in the Govern-

ment establishment under my direction, the last year's consumption of coal reached

the portentous figiu'o of nearly one hundred millions of tons. Most judiciously,

             On some Fossils from the Graptolitic Shales of Dumfnesshire.
                         By Hekkt AiLEYUE Nicholson, B.Sc.

    The upper Llandeilo rocks of the south of Scotland have long been known to yield
 graptolites in great profusion, few other forms of animal life having been recognized
 as occurring in them. Having had this summer an opportunity of examining the
 graptolitic shales of Gai-ple Linn, near Mollat, I was struclc with the occurrence
 in them of munerous bodies, difl'ering from the graptolites in form, though resem-
 bling them in texture. These bodies present themselves as glistening pyritous
 stains, scattered in considerable numbers among the graptolites upon the surface of
 the shale. In their most perfect condition they appear to be bell-shaped bodies,
 which average three-tenths of an inch in length and two-tenths in breadth, and

 are provided at one extremity with a prominent spine or niucro, the other termi-

 nating in a nearly straight, or gently curved margin.

   When compressed from above downwards, a. condition in which they often

 occm-, they appear as oval or rounded patches, frequently very definite in their
 outhne, and presenting somewhere within their margin an elevated point, which
 is surrounded by several concentric ridges, disposed with more or less regularity.
 The elevated point marks the position of the mucro, and the concentric rings are

 merely due to vertical compression. When in this compressed condition, these

 bodies somewhat resemble orbicular Erachiopods in appearance.
    The textm-e of these bodies appears to have been corneous, like that of the

 graptolites ; but they show no traces of structure beyond the presence of the mucro,
 from which, in some well-preserved specimens, a filiform border is prolonged for

 a greater or less distance along the free margui. The mucro appears to have con-
 stituted their most solid portion, projecting as a marked elevation when obtained
 in relief, and leaving an evident hoUow in the cast.

    In most cases these bodies are free and independent, but they occasionally occur
 in such close juxtaposition with the stipe of a graptolite as to justify the belief that
 the connexion is organic, and not merely accidental. I have not observed this

 except in Graptolites Seclt/wickii, the form in which this might most reasonably be

 expected, as the cellules are separated from one another by a conspicuous interval
 till close to their bases. In this case the origin of the body appears to have been

from the common canal or cosnosarc. In one specimen the mucro has been pre-

 served, and seems to have been situated at the free extremity, and therefore to have
been a point of dehiscence ratlier than one of attachment.

    The occurrence of these bodies in shales, crowded with gi'aptolites and grapto-
litic germs, and their close connexion in some cases with the gi-aptolites them-
 selves, would seem to warrant the conclusion that they are " gonophores," or
 " ovarian vesicles," at first attached to the parent stem, but finally becoming free-
swimming zooids. Bodies somewhat similar to these have been described by Pro-
fessor James Hall as occurring in connexion with the stipe of Grtqitolites Whit-
fddi, a diprionidian form, and these are regarded by him as true reproductive

 cells.

    If this conjecture as to the natiu'e of these curious bodies (to which the term
" grapto-gonophores " might be applied) be correct, then the Graptolitida v.^ould
have to be finally referred to the Hydrozoa, and would find their nearest living
analogues in the Sertularid(e, from which, however, they would always be sepa-
rated by characters sufficiently distinctive.

    The facts that no traces have been preserved of any central axis within these
bodies, and that they are not as yet known to occur in other localities where
 gi-aptolites abound, would to a certa'in extent militate against this hvpothesis; but
the first may be due to the soft nature of such an axis, and the second is probably
referable to the attention of geologists not having been dii-ected to theii- existence.

On a Peculiar Denudation of a Coal-Seam in Coates's Park CoUiery,

                               By James Oakes.

   This denudation was discovered in working tlie " Lower Hard " seam of coal at

Coates's Park Colliery in 1859 ; and it appeared to be the eflect of a river which

once existed, but has now disappeared, about 500 yards in -^vidth, which has as yet
been traced only in a southwardly direction for nearly six miles. The whole seam

(about 4 ft. thick) was broken up and deposited in "disjointed masses throughout
the course of this supposed river, in one instance these thicknesses of the seam

being found  piled upon each                              other                             and  where  no coal existed, the underclay (or
                                                                                         ;

clunch), which ordinarily is about 2 feet thick, was heaped up, in one case, to a

Adepth of 26 feet.  great body of water must have effected this ; and the nodules

of ironstone found in the underclay, by their worn shape, show that they have been

subjected to the action of a strong current.

Further Observations on, and Additions to, the List of Fossils found in the

         Boulder-Clay of Caithness, N.B. By Chaeles W. Peach.

'' At the Meetings of the Society in 1862 and 1 864 1 laid before the Members lists

of the fossils then found in the Boulder-Clay of Caithness. In the first paper, I

suggested that " the mode of transport to the shores of Caithness was by water-

borne ice and not by local glaciers." That opinion I still retain. I have no objec-

tion to the deposit being called glacial, believing, that, in the first instance, the

materials were partly derived from glaciers formed at a distance from Caithness.

These glaciers descended to the sea, and were launched into it ; and from them ice-

bergs were broken oft'. These, when so launched, picked up some of the sea-bottom,

witli its organisms, &c., and when on their voyages, wherever they touched, whether

on the bottom of the sea, or the shores of the land, they added to their burdens, by

picking up more organisms, stones, &c. ; and, when finally stranded, mud, stones,

sand, and the shells of Caithness became intermingled with them. As the icebergs

slowly dissolved, the burden was dropped in a pell-mell manner. The ice pro-

tected the materials, and prevented the sea from levelling and arranging them, and

giving the deposit a stratified appearance. The gradual dissolving of the bergs

gave time to the clay to solidify, and thus it was preserved when its ciirrier and

protector was no more. Once "firm, especially in deepish water, little injury could

be done to it. It sufters most when exposed to frost and atmospheric iufiuences.

The story of the voyaging and gathering of the icebergs is well told by the contents

of their left burdens; for Crag, as seen by its shells, &c., Gault chalk and green-

sand, by the flints, corals, and Foraminifera, with portions of chalk, both hard

-- --and soft some so soft that it may be used for writing with Lias and Oolite,

by their Belemnites, Ammonites, fossil wood, Septaria, &c., Silurian, by its me-

tamorphic limestones, quartz, and other rocks, Cambrian, by its gneiss, &c., granite,

porphjTy, &c., are not wanting. Then we have the abundance of Old Eed Sand-

stone, turned up and mingled with all the above by the large bergs as they bumped

and grated before finally resting. These remains form an interesting and sug-

gestive collection. The organisms are entombed in a hard and stubborn matrix.

It has, however, been made to give up its ancient dead, and to show that, at the

time of its formation, life was as abimdant in the sea as it is now. AVith few excep-

tions, the same species are found in it as are now living around our own shores, some

few in the Arctic seas  only                              and probably one or two may be extinct.       I say may he,
                                                       ;

from having been taught great caution by so many of those said to he extinct having

been from time to time dragged from ocean-depths by our active dredgers.^

" The frao^mentary state of the organisms proves that they could not have lived and

died where now found ; for, with two exceptions (two small specimens of Anomia

squamula), I have not seen two valves united amongst the hundreds gathered by

myself and other fellow-workers. The only way of accounting for the escape of

these delicate shells from destruction is, that they, with many other perfect minute

univalves, had been sheltered in depressions in some of the ponderous masses they
were fellow-voyagers with." He mentioned that chalk-flints were not uncommon

in the boulder-clay and all over Caithness (even on the small island of Stroma)

wherever the peat had been removed. Several species of chalk Foraminifera and

          0)1 Raised Beaches. By W. Pengellt, F.R.S., F.G.S., 4-c.

   The author stated that, " instead of aiming at description, his object in this com-
munication was to call attention to certain facts which, perhaps, have scarcely
received all the attention to which they are entitled."

  The substance of the paper may be gathered from the following recapitulation,

with which it concluded :

   " 1st. That accumulations of blown sand occasionally assume the character of

raised beaches.

   " 2nd. That it is not safe to conclude, in the absence of other evidence, that
raised beaches, diflering in height by as much as even 30 feet, necessarily belong to

distinct periods.

   " 3rd. That it is possible that what, in a small vertical cliff section having the

direction of the coast line, appears to be one raised beach, may really be two.

    " 4th. That, all other things being the same, raised beaches are likely to be
most numerous on a coast composed of durable rocks."

           The Relation of the Upper and Lower Crags in Norfolk.

              By John E. Taylor, Hon. Sec. Norwich Oeol. Soc.

The object of this paper was to prove that the present classification of shells in the
Norwich Crag is imperfect, on accoimt of an upper bed being included in the Crao-.
The mean percentage of the shells from the two Crags makes the relation of tlie
Eed and Norwich Crags very dissimilar, whereas there is really a near connexion
between them. By separating the shells of the upper bed, the underlying Noi-wich
Crag
      approaches  the                             Red                          whilst the upper bed  itself forms                                                                       a  graduating link
                                                                            ;

between the three Crags and the overlying drift beds.

   After gi\-ing the established percentages of recent and extinct shells in the three

Crags, as well as the proportion of Ai-ctic shells found in them, the author men-
tioned several places in Norfolk where the Upper Crag mav be seen overlying the
Norwich Crag, as at Coltishall, Horstead, Trowse, Thorpe, Whitlingham, and
Bramerton. The height of the upper bed ranges above the lower by three to

fifteen feet. It is marked by the total absence of freshwater shells, by the
paucity of littoral species, and by the abundance of deep-sea shells. It is also

distinguished by the greater abundance of Ai-ctic species, as at Bramerton and
Thorpe, where several species oiAstmie, Cyprina Mandica, Cardium Grwnlandicwn,
Lucina boreulis, and others abound.

    Theauthor also showed that the .shells of the Red and Norwich Crags separated
them into distinct beds, whilst the same method would also separate the Upper
from tlij Lower Crag in Norfolk. He therefore contended for the existence of
four crags, instead of the present classification of them into three. This arrangement

established a complete and beautifid sequence between the oldest Coralline Crag
and the latest Drift deposits.

On the Lower Greensand of Bedfordshire. By J. F, "Walker, F.O.S.

The discovery of a new deposit of phosphatic nodules was made about tlu-ee

years since in the Lower Greensand of Bedfordshire, in the vicinity of Potton.

This bed was formerly quarried for mending the roads, xmtil it was found to contain

the nodules for which it is now extensively worked.
A section at a cutting near Potton Railway Station shows, commencing at the
--bottom,
           1, sand of  different                                               colours  (in some places white)                                                                          2, conglomerate bed
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

(9 ins. to 1 ft. thick) ; 3, sand of different colours, containing oxide of iron, about

12 ft. At a coprolite-working, on the left side of the line, looking towards Cam-

bridge, a few yards from the edge of the cutting, the bed increases in thickness to

--two feet. At a large working on the hiU, the conglomerate bed is about six feet

thick, tlie section being as follows : 1, sandstone on which conglomerate rests

2, conglomerate  (G ft.)                          3, flaggy sandstone, not              exceeding    one                                                                                foot  in  thickness

(often less) and sm-face soil. The lower part of the conglomerate here is darker
and more indurated than the upper. On the other side of the road is another
working, where the nodules lie in a loose sand, and the phosphate-bed is about one

foot thick. There are several other workings in the neighbourhood. The con-
glomerate contains phosphatic nodules and pebbles in about the same proportion.
The bed is dug out, sifted, washed, and laid in heaps, then conveyed mto sheds,
where the nodules are picked over by hand. The quantity of phosphoric acid in

the nodules varies fi-om 15 to 22 per cent. The deposit consists of fen-uginous sand,
more or less indurated, rolled pebbles, light brown nodiUes of phosphatic matter

                                                                                                                                                                                              5*

(which have an earthy fraeturo, and often contain remains of shells), and lumps of

hardened clay. The nodules contain a much larger percentage of alumina than

those of the' Cambridge Greeusand. Tliis would indicate that the phosphatic

nodules had been formed of clay soaked in decomposing animal and vegetable

matter, since the alumina could not be derived from animal or vegetable sources.

The nodules are often covered with perforations, which Mr. A. Wanklyn discovered

to be the work of small biralccf, of which he obtained several species.

The remains of organic life found in this deposit exist in different states of miner-

alization. Some are coeval with the deposition of the bed, whilst others have been

washed out of preexisting deposits.

   Of vegetable remains are found :--

1. Large masses of silicilied wood, resembling those found in the Pm'beck.

2. Small pieces of wood, mineralized with phosphoric acid, and often bored by a

nev7 species of Pholas, which I have named " Pholas Dallasii."

3. Cone of Cycadacean, from the Wealden.

Of remains of animal origin we find ;

Rolled bones and teeth of reptiles and fishes, also shells of mollusca existing in

two distinct conditions, viz., phosphatic casts and ferruginous shells.

The phosphatic casts of shells are generally so much worn, that it is impossible

to identify their species ^vitll precision. Their general aspect resembles those of

the Kimmeridge and Oxford clays.       They consist  of casts of BhtpiclioneUa                                                                                           Car-

of large Belemnites are also found.

Part of the ferruginous shells also ha^e been derived from extraneous sources,

and among these is Gryphma dilutata.

The rest of the ferruginous shells are of the age of the Lower Greeusand.

Amongst these there are fomid

been deposited in this bed subsequently to its destruction by denudation.

    Notes on the Fhysical Features of the Land as connected with Denudation.
                              By A. B, WxifNE, F.G.S., 4-0.

  --The author called attention to a prevailing sameness of character generally

 obsen-able in physical featm-es the results of denudation, arguing therefrom a

imiformity in the action of the natural causes which produced them. Ground forms
in England, Ireland, Africa and India were cited as instances to prove similarity of
results, depending iipon denuding agencies having been exerted upon rocks of similar
kinds or in similar relative positions with regard to their strata, notwithstanding

differences of climate, glaciation, rainfall, &c.

   The effect of rain and atmospheric weathering was alluded to, and also that variety
of denudation produced by the sea, to which, for want of a more apparent cause,
the formation of plains was attributed. The difficulty of reasoning upon questions
of general denudation from examples occun-iug in countries where atmospheric
agencies included the complex actions of both rain and ice, was adverted to ; and
the conclusion arrived at was, that although the sea may have done much towards
eating into the land, the atmospheric agencies which ha^·e been in operation ever
since land first rose above the sea, even in the earliest geological periods, and down
to the present time, must be admitted to have performed a most important part,
if not indeed the chief results, in obliterating former traces of marine action, and
giving to the land the varied physical forms which it now presents.

   The author stated that he proposed only to supplement the Eeport on the
Hebrides dredging, just read by Mr. Jeffreys, by a few remarks on the Forami-
nifera which had been found amongst the dredged sands, and to note the occur-
rence of certain interesting forms, either new or not before recorded from any
British habitat. As the examination had not been completed, details were neces-

sarily left to a future paper.

   Of the family MilioUda one important addition had been made to the British
list : viz., Hauerina cotnpressa, d'Orb., a species rarely met with in a recent state,
but well known as a tertiary fossil. Three or four specimens had been found in

one of the deeper dredgings.

   The abundance and variety of the arenaceous forms belonging to the Lituolidce
was perhaps the most striking feature in connexion with the Ehizopoda of the
area dredged ; and their investigations had led to some modification of the views
hitherto held as to the relationship of the genera. All the previously known
British species had been foimd, as well as three not before noticed on our shores,

                            clature. By Thomas Bkowx.

     On Oyster Cultivation. By F. Buckland.

   The author began by explaining that it was difficult to give, in a few minutes,

the result of a whole year's information. He would confine his remarks principally

to the history of the living spat of the oyster, the chemical analysis of the meat

and the mother-liquor of the oyster, to the adhesions of the various substances to

which they loved to adhere, and to the marketable value of the oysters as tested

by weight. He proceeded to describe the exceedingly interesting action and

movements displayed by the young oyster when first emitted fi-om its mother's shell,

giving the reason why they sometimes floated on the surface of the water, and

sometimes sank to the bottom, and the use to which the young oyster places its

cUife, expressing it as his opinion that these organs never dropped off, but were ab-

sorbed after the young 03'ster became fixed. He then exhibited a great variety of

substances to which the oysters seemed to have a natural preference for adhering.

,\mong these were several curiosities, such as a " plague pipe," to which an oyster

had fixed itself ; an ordinary pipe, presented to him by Sir Walter Trevelyan, in

the  bowl of which no less than three  oysters  had  talien  up  their  position                                              also
                                                                                                                     ;

some old-fashioned wine or spirit bottles, from the North Sea and Loch Ryan, pre-

sented to him by Sir William Wallace. He then proceeded to describe the result

of the chemical analysis which he had instituted in conjunction with A. Pythian '

Tamer, Esq., giving the amounts of mineral matter, the animal, and also the fatty

mmatter. The results obtained showed that the phosphates were more important

the composition of the meat of the oyster than any other of the ingi-edients, and

hence their great practical use for invalids and in sea-sickness. He also gav(!

practical deductions as to choice of proper places where oysters should be laid in

order to obtain a good supply of these phosphates. He then described the process

of the growth of the oyster-shell, and detailed the manner in which the ovsiei

fonned the shell from the mother-liquor, the mode also by which the little oj'sters

were enabled to form their shell inside the mother-shell. His observations enabled

him to come to the conclusion as to the possible way in which the yoimg oyster
was enabled to attach itself to various articles. He had been enabled to collect

samples of oysters from almost every part of the United Kingdom. These have
                                                                                     ;;

been accurately weighed, and he gave a table showing the relative value (com-
mercially speaking) of oysters from oyster-beds, or proposed oyster-beds of Eng-

land, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. He stated that he was still carrying on his
experiments near Heme Bay ; and he was happy to be enabled to report that the

French sytem of oyster- culture had been successfully carried out in a creek near
Havant, not far from Portsmouth ; and although he had not yet seen the results
of the experiments himself, he could not help congratulating the managers upon

their well-deserved success. Determined that England should be well represented,
and that her oyster-fisheries should not be entirely ignored by our neighbours in
France, he had at this moment one set of specimens at the Fish-Culture Exhibition

at Ai-cachon, in the south, and another at a similar exhibition at Boulogne, in the

north of that coimtry, as well as his own collection at the Royal Horticultiu-al
Gardens, South Kensington, where he was gradually making a complete series il-

lustrative of the culture of oysters, as well as that of salmon.

On the Scientific Cultivation of a Salmon River. By Frank Buckland.

The author compared the ascent of salmon from the sea to the interior of the

country (where it laid its eggs) to the process of following a tree from its root
upwards to its upper branches. The salmon is a very clever fish ; the feeling it

shows when preparing to lay its eggs is so well marked, that he preferred to call it

" reason " rather than "instinct." The distance which salmon ascend into hill

country under the powerful feeling by which they are influenced when preparing to

deposit their eggs, he instanced by their ascent of the Rhine to a distance of 400

miles, where they are stopped by the falls of Schaflhausen. Allow the salmon to

lay, he said, and it will abimdnntly repay the care put ladders on weirs for it to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

--swim up, not nets to catch it. The salmon has many enemies hakes, cormorants,

and herons ; otters also hunt the salmon, not only for food, but as we ourselves do,

for sport. Of aU the enemies the salmon has to contend against he has not a more

terrible than the millers. When a salmon comes to a water-wheel it will stay by

it for days. The miller stops the wheel, and lets down a trap at the lower end of

the mill-race and catches the fish. Steamers, too, are its enemies ; and though the

salmon is not a nervous fish it is delayed by them. It is very sensitive to smell
when it comes near large towns it will not venture to pass up rivers filled with im-

purities. What does it do then ? It waits until a flood conies, and then ascends

in purer waters. Waterfalls are no friends to the salmon. There is a waterfall at

Knaresborough. People thought the salmon used to jump every Sundaj' morning

to please them, but the fact was the millers were obliged by law to let the water

down on Sunday, and then the fish leaped. Poachers are gi-eat enemies of salmon.

During the winter months it was not an uncommon thing for one poacher to destroy

many fish. He heard from a converted poacher a confession that made his hair

--stand on end he used to feed his pigs with salmon eggs ! Mr. Ashworth, of Gal-

way, has now the model fisheiy of the United Kingdom. The wonderful increase

in the number offish caught, and therefore its money value, showed the use of cul-

tivation. To cultivate a salmon fishery, however, one must not lie in bed in winter

this business admits of no idleness. Mr. Ashworth asked the salmon poachers how

much they made by poaching during the winter, and gave them double the money

to let the spawning fish alone. He had from 120 to 130 men employed to see that
the salmon were not disturbed during the winter. He himself was proud of having

opened up the river Stour at Canterbury. There had been no salmon (Salmom'dee)
-- Afor many years a net had been placed across the river.

the mayor and corporation, an association was founded, and the result was, the

Salmonidse were on the increase. The Thames used to be a sabnon river. The

Eton boys used to catch " skeggers;" but now there were none in the Thames, for the

salmon were not allowed to go up by the weirs erected on accoimt of navigation.

If they were allowed to go up, there would soon be sufficient eggs. He himself

had hatched in his back kitchen 30,000 eggs. He was pleased to say that a salmon

-had been brought to him which had been caught at Gravesend in a whitebait net.

 He trusted it was from one of the eggs hatclied eitlier by himself or hy the Thames
 Angling Preservation Society, He collected the fishermen at Gravesend, and they

 said that for more than thirty-three years a salmon had not been caught there before.

 He was certain tliat if the cultivation of salmon in the Thames were attended to,

 in a few years this valuable fish would be restored to the river.
    Mr. Buckland then gave some details respecting the Exhibition of Fish-culture

 at Boulogne. He Avas happy to say that this congress did great good, commercially

 and intellectually, inasmuch as representati-ses of all nations^from Norway and

--Sweden in the north, to Spain in the south met to interchange ideas, as well as

 to establish business correspondence. He had received one silver and two bronze

 medals from this Exhibition, a« well as a silver medal from the Exhibition at Arca-

 clon for his labours in fish-culture.

                             By Dr. T. S. Cobbold, F.B.S.

   In this extended communication the author gave an account of twenty-one dif-
ferent species of canine Bnfozoa. Amongst the most important forms were the
Tania echinococcus and the Trichina spiralis. In regard to the latter he remarked
that " it was probably not indigenous in the dog ; but the ease with which the

parasite was transmissible obliged us to class it as a canine parasite." He had

frequently reared it in the dog. Except in an indirect manner the dog would not

be likely to give the Trichna disease to man ; nevertheless, if infested dog's flesh
were eaten by us we should undoubtedly take the disease. At all events, there

was danger in allowing trichinized dogs to roam at large, since the consumption of
their flesh after death (by other animals) tended to propagate the disorder. Kats
especially would thus become liable to the disease.

                    On the Teachinq of Science at the Public Schools.
                      By the Eev.' ^\ W. Eaeeab, 31. A., F.B.S.

   After alluding to the strangeness of the fact that science, to which the most
characteristic progress of this epoch was due, should have been hitherto disregarded

at our oldest seats of learning, the author proceeds to argue that the introduction of

scientific instruction into the public-school system was necessary on three grounds

first, because it called into play a different order of fixculties in boys who had studied
Language with success ; secondly, because it evolved those faculties in boys who

were naturally unsuited for classical training; and thirdly, because the schools had
ceased to be solely preparatory for the Universities, and were therefore bound to
give boys the opportunity of acquiring some knowledge which would be of direct

practical use to them in their future professions. He next treated of the difficulties
in the way of carrying out these views. Those difliculties did not in the least arise
from the prejudice of public-school masters, the majority of whom had used their

best efibrts to introduce more or less of scientific teaching into the schools, but
from the conflicting opinions of scientific men, from the absence of any definite

and well-considered scheme, from the badness of many existing text-books, and
from the immense amount of time already devoted to the teaching of the modern
languages, mathematics, and classics, a teiTu which now involved a very -nnde range
of studies._ The author suggested that many of these difliculties might be removed
if a committee were appointed by the Association, partly composed of scientific men

and partly of masters accustomed to the methods of piihlic schools. He stated that

at almost every school something was being done, but that the plans mainly

adopted were three; viz., 1. Modem schools in which science was made a part of

the   course                            2.  occasional                                                                                           and  compulsory lectures, of      which notes were taken                                              by
                                     ;

the   boys                      and 3.        a     voluntary system, by which boys were encoio-aged rather than
                             ;

compclicd to make themselves acquainted with various sciences. Euo-bv is the only
school at which science is now regularly and completely introduced ; and the author

therefore described the system there introduced, and the no less characteristic

voluntary sj^stem which has been established with much care at Harrow, and which

is working most advantageously. Finally, the author suggested his o-\vn scheme

which was a combination of the voluntary and compulsory sj-stenis for which in

--the case of many boys ample time could be gained by a wise abandonment of the

practice of Greek and Latin composition an abandonment which (in the case of

all but first-rate scholars) he warmly advocated ns most desirable after a certain

age.

    In this short paper the author observed that Eotifers are not common in sea-

water, though one, Colurm uncinatus, may he foimd in any tanli. That especially

noticed, hovfQxev, Synchata Baltica, is more choice in its habitat, though it may

always be found in water from the mouth of the Mersey, from Ilhj-1, or Llan-

dudno. The author has not noticed it to be luminous. It evidently has the power of

forming a very fine thread from its posterior extremity, by which it attaches itself

to   other  bodies                            and   when                                                                                         so  attached it  performs  those  remarkable                                                circular  move-

to be present, from small particles adhering, and it may be made visible with the

pincers at its pleasure, when it goes off with great velocity. Other Rotifers may

have a similar power, as indeed is mentioned by Cohn in the common Hydatina.

Deviations in the origin of the great vessels from the aorta were seldom or

never recognized during life                                                                                                                         whether they   exerted  any liability or disposition                                              to

morbid action, the author thought improbable. In the first of his examples the

aorta ga^e olf four branches, instead of the usual three. These were the left

carotid and subclavian, arising in the usual manner, and the right carotid and

subclavian, each arising direct from the arch of the aorta by a distinct and separate

trunk, there being an absence of the innominata. The two vessels on the right

side were larger than the left ; the left carotid was the smallest of the four. The
com-se of these vessels was the usual one, but the laryngeal branch of the superior

thyroid artery of the left side perforated the thyroid cartUage, instead of passino-

inwards through the thyro-hyoid membrane in the usual manner. Both femoral

arteries, and                           the   left  great ischiatic ner^-e varied in their division                                                                                                                                          all the   arteries
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

of the extremities were calcified into hard unyielding cylinders.

In the author's second instance, the main trunk or ascending portion of the arch of
the aorta divided into two great branches, the first of which subdivided into the
innominata and left carotid, the latter crossing the trachea obliquely upwards to
                                              innominata
the left  side                          the                                                                                                           divided into  the  two usual  branches                                                 of right  sub-
                                 ;

clavian and carotid. The other subdivision of the arch was into the left subclavian

and descending aorta, both vessels taking their usual course. If his interpretation

of this peculiarity were correct, the author considered it a unique instance of divi-
sion of the aorta into two branches which in their subdivision gave oft" the proper

trunks. No similar example had been found, even in Mr. Quain's oreat work-
and the inference was that it was unique. The division of the aorta in this second
example was not unlike that of the abdominal aorta into the two iliacs.

                    By JoBL^ Hogg, M.A.,' F.R.S., F.L.S., &c.

   The author, in his remarks on the plants which have been introduced with
ballast by ships on the coasts of Durham and Northumberland, limited himself to
the sea-coasts, and chiefly to the banks of the rivers Tees, AVear, and Tyne.

   Of the latter are the gi-eat ballast-deposits at Port Clarence, and those at West

Hartlepool and East Hartlepool, and the embankment of the railway to the north

of  the  latter  town                             the  mounds  of ballast at     Seaham,  at  Sunderland,  and  near
                                               ;

Wearmouth ; as well as those at South and North Shields, and others along the

Tyne nearer to Newcastle.

 --The lists of the numerous species were divided into two heads viz., I. Exotics

or plants forcic/n to our island ; and H. the rarer indigcnvus or tiaturalized species

of Great Britain, which were rarely seen in the before-named districts.
   The number of imported erotics in the Jirst division amounts to 69 species

and that of plants comprised in the second division is 124. These numbers mclude

the species which have been, during many years past, discovered bj' Messrs.

Winch, Storey, Norman, and Lawson, as well as by the author.

   The ballast of the localities specified is mostly chalk with flints, and therefore
many plants which grow naturalh' in cretaceous formations, are there found. Yet

Mr. Hogg stated that several orders of plants are imrepresented ; as, for example,
there are no Orchidea; not even any of those species of Orchis, which flourish in

calcareous soils ; and no Saxifraga ; one or two of the conuuonest Hosee, Rubi, and

Haminculi only occur.

    It was noticed that after some years' observations, the more tender species,

especially the exotics, flourish for two or three years, but that they perish either

by the frost of the first hard winter, or by the severe east winds in the spring.
Also several sorts of British plants, which were seldom if ever met with before the

numerous railways were made, have been carried with shingle along the lines of

railway, and so have now fidly established themselves.
   They have not, however, as yet caused any great decrease in the more common

plants of the district.

   It was further remarked that after the ballast had been deposited, Annuals mostly
sprung up, but that in two or three seasons they gave way to a variety of Pei-enniak,

which siicceeded to them.

    Mr. Hogg inserted in his paper several lists of plants, which he had carefully

prepared.

    On the Asexual Reproduction and Anatomy of Chcetogaster vermicularis
           {Midi.). By E. Eay Lankestek, of Christ Church, Oxford.

   This species of Chsetogaster is a minute chaetopodous worm, one-eighth of an inch
long, parasitic on the common water-snail. Its most remarkable peculiarities are, the
presence of oral bristles diftering from those of the body, the very small number of
segments composing it, and the total absence of reproductive organs. The author
described its anatomy minutely, and its mode of reproducing by budding.

On the Indians of Vancouver Island. By J. K. Lord.

The author gave a description of the customs of the Indians, their weapons,

domestic animals, together wdth other most most interesting pecidiarities. He

began by showing that the numbers of these Indians were steadilj^ decreasing he
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

described their personal appearance as being strangely modified'by the habit the

coast tribes have of sitting continuously in their canoes and in theirlodges. Espe-

cial reference was made to the curious fact that the teeth of most of the inland

Indians are ground down to the gum by the sand which is drifted on to the salmon

when exposed for drying in the sun ; for it is upon this dried fish the savages sub-

sist entirely during the winter months. The author exhibited an under "jaw, in

which the teeth were thus worn away. He pointed out the curious fashion the

people have of altering the form of the skull dming infancy, either making it flat

or conical, by means of pressure. Engi-avings of these skulls, &c. are given in the

author's 'Naturalist in Vancouver Island.' The strange ideas relative to the

disposal of the dead and the rites of burial were also mentioned. The author then

gave many pai-ticulars relative to the native dogs, and the probability of a doo-

having been imported from Japan which had a long, silky coat ; the natives used to

shear these animals as we shear sheep, using the coat for the manufacture of rugs

but since the introduction of blankets by the Hudson's Bay Company, the doo- has

disappeared from want of protection, and become extinct.' He showed that the

art of weaving was known to these tribes at a very early period of their histoiy.

The religion of these people is very remarkable, and'they entertain beliefs in sacred

days and periods and sacrifices to the sun ; they believe "in witchcraft and in deities

representing good and qxtI. Animals, plants which are eatable, fish and birds, were

believed to have been at one time human. The remarkable custom of obtaining

the "medicine," to guard them through life, called "tomanawax," was described.

They measure the sequence of the seasons by the ripening of berries and opening

of flowers, the arrival of the crane and wild goose, spawning of fish, &c. Copious

vocabularies of the different languages, and the jargon called Chinook, as spoken

by the different tribes west of the Rocky Mountains, were submitted to the Section.

The names and words seemed to be harsh, and decidedly unmusical. He then

explained a valuable collection of stone weapons dug by himself from the ancient

river-gravels of the ripper Columbia river                                                                                                                                                                                          these were intermixed with stone beads,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

shells of the Ventaliodd, the parasitic barnacles foimd on the skin of the whale,

buttons made from sea-shells, human skidls and bones. These relics were buriei

at a great depth, and no trade exists at present betwixt the Indians there resident

at the present time with those dwelling on the sea-coast ; the distance from the

sea is nearly a thousand miles. The author drew new and important conclusions

from these facts. Lastly, the lodges and canoes were described, and these, it

Aappears, vary among the different ti-ibes, each tribe to a great extent having a fomi
of canoe pecidiar to itself.                                                                                                            wonderful " medicine," called a " copper," was exhi-

                                   By Dr. C. M'Intosh.

   The specimen was foimd on the beach at St. Andrews, after a severe storm, in
1861, measuring 1| inch in length, in shape like an elongated Florence flask with
the bottom a little produced and the neck much elongated. Its test is constructed
like sand-paper, the particles forming essential constituents of the mass ; and at the
wide end there is a series of hairs formed by prolongations of the basis structure,

witli sand particles and mud attached. "Witin this test lies a series of interlaced

 muscular fibres, which cross each other at right angles, and which muscular coat
can be readily separated from the internal (and somewhat fibrous) surface of the
test. The branchial sac is elongated, has its meshes of a square or slightly oblong
form, ciliated at the edges, and is continued along the narrow part of the animal
to the terminal apertures, the oral one of which has no tentacular fringes. Its
structure, so far as the specimen was preserved, was detailed, and it was mentioned
that its digestive system agreed in general with Pelonaia. In conclusion, the
species differs from Pelneaia, as described by Forbes and Goodsir, in the extreme
production of the portion sustaining the apertures ; and in the structure of the
test, which in P. glabra is thin and diaphanous, like parchment, and in P. corrit-
gata thick, cartilaginous and transversely wrinkled, while here it is like sand-
paper. The shelf or transverse ridge in the interior of the mantle, as shown in the
figure of P. glabra, is absent. It differs also very characteristically from the Bol-

--tenia. The same author communicated some remarks on the Tiirbellaria and

Annelida of North Uist, of which he had found about 110 species, including many
rare and some new examples. He also exhibited numerous coloured drawings of
new and rare marine animals recently got in the Hebrides and St. Andrews Bay.

On a Bare Molluseoid Animal (Pelonaia corrugata).

By W. C. M'Intosh, M.D., F.L.S.

This was at first considered to be a new species, from the erroneous or imperfect

descriptions previously published, especially tliat in the ' British Mollusca ' of

AMessrs. Forbes and Hanley.  minute description was given of its appearance
--and anatomy ; its unyielding flask-shaped sheath of sand particles, covered with

sandy hairs towards its bulbous portion, and to which sheath the muscular coat

does not adhere closely ; its elongated branchial cavity, curious digestive system, &c.

   Large coloured drawings of new and rare marine animals from the East and
West coasts of Scotland were also exhibited.

                     List of TurheUaria and Annelida of North Uist.

                          By W. C. M'Intosh, M.D., F.L.S.

   The list of Annelida from North Uist consists of about 110 species, some of
which have hitherto been procured only at rare intervals, either in Britain or on
the Continent, while others are new to science. Amongst the rarer forms may be

noticed Lineiis albus, Stylus fasciatus, Serpentaria fragilis, Polynoe scolopendrina,
Lepidonotus clava, Spinther oniscoides, Gatfiola spectaoilis, Uteone jntsilla, Scalibregmu
injlatum, Ophelia acumitiafa, Travisia Forbesii, Terebella macidata, Tcrebellidcs

stra7nii, &c. The rare or new forms come under the genera Lcptoplana, Borlasia,

Ominatoplea, Lepidonotus, Lumbrincrcis, Ncrine, Trop)honia, Phyllodoce, Clytnene,

Terebella, Apihlebina, and Dendrostomu?n,
   Attention was called to the fact that every specimen of Polynoe scolopiendrina

was found in the tube of a littoral Terebella. This habit of frequenting the tubes
of other annelids is not imcommon in its allies. The P. scolope7idrina was also

phosphorescent.

  The author mentioned that Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, F.E.S. had just placed in his

hands a large collection of deep-water forms from the Hebrides, so that a con-
siderable addition to the foregoing list might be expected.

attention to the contents of the germinal vesicle, which he showed to be gela-

      On the Systematic Position of the Pronghorn (Antilocapra amerlcana).
                       By P. L. ScLATEE, M.A., Ph. B., F.R.S.

   The author stated that his chief object in the present communication was to
bring into more pi'ominent notice a very important discovery regarding this animal,
that had been made in the Zoological Society's Gardens in the Regent's Park
during the past year, and had formed the subject of a paper read by Mr. Bartlett,

the Superintendent of the Gardens, at one of the Society's meetings in 1865*.

--This discovery was, that the horns of the Pronghorn were naturally shed every year

phenomenon hitherto quite unknown among the Bovidfe or hollow-horned Rumi-
nants, with which the Pronghorn had always hitherto been associated, and only
occurring in the allied Deer-family or Cervidae. Mr. Bartlett's observations had
been made upon a young male of this scarce mammal, which had been acquired
for the Society in January 1865t, and had since lived in good health in the Mena-

gerie. This animal had shed both its horns on the 7th of November, 1865 ; and a finer
pair had since otowu, which woidd, no doubt, be shed in like manner in Nov. 1866,
bince Mr. Bartlett's publication of this novel fact, full confirmation of it had been
received by the Zoological Society, in a communication from their CoiTcsponding

Member, Dr. Colbert A. Canfield, of Monterey, California, who had come to the

same conclusion as Mr. Bartlett, from observations on this animal in a state of
nature made in the county of Monterey, in some parts of which the Pronghorn was

very common |.
   The author exhibited a skull of the Pronghorn with the horns fully developed

and ready to be cast oft' shortly, and explained the mode in which he supposed the
shedding to be effected. After the old horn was cast off, the horny matter, which
was at first entirely confined to the upper end of the new horn, gi-adually spread
itself down to its base, enveloping the numerous hairs with which the new horn
was clothed when first appearing, and ultimately checking their growth and
destroying their vitality. After the horn was perfected and hardened, new hairs
developed themselves beneath the epidermis, and, not being able to force their way

through the horny covering, became, as the author believed, the chief agent in

causing the shedding of the horn. As regards the general structure of the horns of
the Pronghorn, it was quite evident that they had little or nothing in common with
those of the Deer. The latter were formed of bone developed upon a process of the
frontal bone, and were more correctly termed antlers, whereas the horn of the Prong-

horn consisted of true horn (like those of the ordinary Bovidfe) gradually developed
from the epidermis, the skin remaining complete underneath them.

   Two other points in which the Pronghorn differed from all the other known

Bovidie, were the furcation of the horns and the absence of the " false hoofs," as the
stunted terminations of the rudiniental second and fifth digits of each foot ai"e
termed, in which latter respect it resembled the Giraftes {Camehpardalis). These

three important modifications of structure, when taken together, induced the author
to believe that it would be necessaiy to raise the genus Antilocapra to the rank of
a family in the series of Ruminanti'a, which he proposed to arrange somewhat as

given in the subjoined Table.

   In this paper a new species of Arius, from Ceylon, which the author named A.

Boakeii, atter the Rev. I3arcroft Boake, of Colombo, Ceylou, by whom it was first'

sent to this country, was described. This fish lays eggs about the size of small
bullets, which the male fish takes into his mouth and retains there until the young
are ready to leave the eg^. About twelve eggs come to intra-ovarian maturity at
one time, which is the number that the male can hold in his mouth. Although

On Reversed Sexiud Characters in a Butterfly, and their Interpretation on the

       Theory of Modifications and Adaptive Mimicry (^illustrated by specimens).

      By A. R. Wallace.

   The author exhibited a Malayan butterfly (Dtadema, n. sp.) the male of whicli

--was of a dull brown colour, while the female was i-ichly glossed with metallic blue
  Hecolours which in all the allied species are characteristic of the male sex.
then showed that the female butterfly so closely resembled the very common Euplaa

midamus that it could not be distinguished from it on the wing. The Euplcece, and
the whole family Danaidre to which they belong, as well as the Heliconidte of
South America, are protected groups, and are the subjects of imitation by many
other butterflies and moths. The special protection the Danaidse possess was sup-
posed to be their very strong and peculiar odour, which rendered them distastenil

to insectivorous birds ; and the reason why the female only of the Diadema had

acquired protection by closely resembling the Euplcea was, because in all insects the
female is of more importance than the male, and it is necessary, in order to ensure
the continuance of the race, that her life should be preserved while she is engaged
in depositing her eggs. This was held to be a crucial instance of the truth of the
Darwinian hypothesis ; as what appeared at first sight a strange and unaccountable
anomaly, was shown to be under certain conditions the necessary consequence of
the " preservation of favourable variations in the struggle for life."

           On some points in the Structure of Limulus, Recent and Fossil.

                     By Heket Woodward, F.Z.S., F.G.S., &c.

   In this communication the author pointed out that although the classification

proposed by Professor M'Coy for Litnulii,", Belinurus, and Eioypferus in 1849 was
founded upon veiy imperfect data, yet subsequent researches tended to show that

a near relationship did exist betv\'een the Xiphosnra; and the Euryptcridce.

   Air. Woodward cited the published observations, descriptions, and figures of

species belonging to these two groups, by Professors Agassiz and Hall (in America),

Dr. Nieszkowski ( in Russia), Professor Huxley and Mr. J. W. Salter (in England),
and Mr. W. H. Eaily (in Ireland), and he likewise referred to his own investi-

gations in confirmation of his views.

   The autlior entered at some length into the anatomical structure of Limulus,
BeUnunis, Eari/ptcrus, Slylomirus, Pleri/f/otus, Hemiaspis, &c., in order to show that
by a series of intermediate forms which have of late years become known, he was
able to reconcile the apparently wide diversity existing between Pteri/gotus and
Limulus; and he submitted that they may appropriately form two subdivisions of

the order Mcrostomata of Dana.

   These views have since been published by Mr. Woodward at length in the Quart.

Notes on Lithosia caniola. By Dr. E, Perceval "Weight, F.L.S.

   This species was discovered by Mr. Barrett on the Hill of Howth, near Dublin,

--in 1860 so very local was its habitat that it might be said to be found only on one

closely sheltered bank on the south side of the hill. Since 1860, many specimens

have been taken by Mr. Birchall, Mr. Dunlop, and the writer ; and the limits of

Howthe species, so far as Howth is concerned, would seem to be on the increase.

this South European insect obtained a settlement on one point of the Irish coast

and in no other part of the British Islands, was, Mr. Birchall confessed, a cm'ious

problem, which he ventm-es to solve, by supposing it may have been introduced in

the larva state among moss and lichens. In the spring of 1866 Dr. Wright was
botanizing on the coast of Waterford, when he was struck by the close similarity in

appearance between certain portions of the Tramose strand, and that where the L.

caniola was found at Howth : it had the same aspect, the same plants, and was just

the place where one would  expect to find the  species                                   but it was  too  early in the
                                                                                      ;

season for it. In the course of the summer Dr. Wright requested his brother to col-

lect all the Lithosia to be met with at the place ; and, as he had anticipated, L. caniola

was among them ; one of the specimens was slightly different from the ordinary

form of Caniola. In addition to adducing this new locality for this insect. Dr.

Wright mentioned his belief that L. caniola was little more than a climatal variety

of such a form as L. complamila.

       Botanical Notes of a Tour in the Islands of Arran, West of Ireland.
                                    Bij Dr. E. P. Wkight, F.L.S.

   The islands consist of limestone, forming on their western sides high frowning
headlands, and on those facing Galway Bay a series of coarse shingly beaches, in-
terrupted here and there by several sandy bays. The surface ot the larger island

presents the appearance of a series of gigantic tombstones arranged in vast tiers,
the interspaces between the large slabs of stone and the faces of the terraces con-

taining almost all the plants to be found on the island. Dry stone walls abound
everywhere, sometimes enclosing plots of groimd onlj' a few feet square ; and by
the help of these enclosm-es some few crops are sown and garnered. In some cases
the potatos are planted on the bare rock, and covered over with a basketful of
earth and seaweed ; in others the rock gets covered over with a thin sod, which
supplies a precarious nourishment to a few sheep brought from the mainland.
Dr. Wright stayed eleven days on the island, visiting now and then the middle
and south islands. The weather was most unfortunate, and scarcely a day passed
over without rain, while a strong north-west wind, blowing with great force, made
the constant jumping over stone walls particularlj' trying. The season was too far
advanced for many of the characteristic Arran Island plants ; still a sufficient
number of interesting species were met with. Dr. Wright first enumerated the
list of species actually collected, for convenience of reference using the nomen-
clature of the ' Cybele Hibernica ' of Dr. Moore and A. G. More, the publication
of which, though too late this year to do much for Irish botany, would, he doubted

not, mark a new era in the investigation of this subject. He next proceeded to

mention those plants which might be considered remarlfable or rare, or which had
not as yet been recorded as found in the district marked VI., according to the

scheme adopted in the ' Cybele.' Among these he alluded to the Aquilcr/ia vulgaris,

foimd on the northern part of the large island; Helianthenmm camcm, Sedum
                                                                                       ;;

Wiodiola, Gentiana verna, of wliicli nothing but the leaves remaiued ; Suhinion

dulcamara, 3farrubitan vuh/arc, Allium Bahiiu/tonii, i'oiiud on all the islands, and

very -svidely scattered over the large islands; Adiantum capdlus-veneris, &c.

Several common plants, such as Sisymbrium officinale, Cucldearia officinalis, Torilis

nodosum, &c., were mentioned simply to supply the deficiency in this respect in the

' Cybele.' On the exposed -western side of the island many ordinarily met with

plants were remarkable for theu' peculiar stunted growth. Thus the samphire,

which grew in the greatest abimdance, was found in full tlower, and yet hundreds

of the plants were not more than three inches in height; and plants oi Sedum

rhodiola were met with scarcely more than two inches in height. In all such
Acases the plants were growing in the chinks between the stones.
                                                                  dwarfed con-

dition of growth was not, however, by any manner of means the rule, for under

favourable conditions fronds of the Maiden-hair fern were found twenty inches in

length. Specimens of Verbascum thapsus were met with nearly five feet high

and in one instance a cluster of that tine thistle, SiU/liim marianum, was seen

three or four of the flowering-stallis of which were five ieet four inches in height.

Dr. Wright next proceeded to contrast the Flora of the Arran Islands with that of

the coast of Clare, referring to INIr. Foot's very interesting paper on the Burren

flora, in the Transactions of the Ivoyal Irish .Vcademy, for this purpose ; and sug-

gested that the general affinity of the flora was rather to the Clare than to the

Galway coast. This would at first sight be expected, seeing that Arran is, geolo-

gically speaking, but an extension of Clare. Almost every plant met with on the

islands is met with in the Burren district, and vice versa, whereas manj^ plants are

met with in the Connemara district which are not found either in Clare or Arran.

The inhabitants are indebted altogether to the mainland for their supply of fuel

and the turf which they chiefly use is brought from the immediate neighbourhood

of Eoundstone and Birterbuie Bay. To this circumstance Dr. Wright was inclined

to ascribe the appearance of some few plants which were found very plentifully

about the villages of Kilronan and Kilmeany, and yet not at all inland, such as

C'oronopue didtjma, Urtica nrens, &c. In conclusion, Dr. Wright trusted that

these notes, made under very disadvantageous circumstances, might not be without

some interest. Every one, he thought, was bound to contribute what he could

(no matter how smaU that contribution might be) to make our knowledge of the

Flora of Ireland complete.

                              Physiology.

       Address hj Professor Humphry, F.R.S.

It is, I feel, no small honour to be called iipon to preside over this section, which

represents the very highest branch of physical science. I say the higliest branch

of physical science, because it has to deal with the highest and broadest of physical

.problems. The animal frame, which it is our worlc to investigate, stands at the

 summit of the great physical cone, with man at the a^Jt-x, by whom it is, as it were,
 slung from heaven, in whom the material is worked up to the point of contrast

with, and made subservient to, the purposes of the spiritual. Indeed so complex is

the animal organism, so intricate and varied are the questions in physiology, that

it is apt to pass out of the range of science, and become too much a matter of spe-

culation and an object of mystery ; so that there is some danger of its being de-
graded by the very difficulties and features which should really place it in the high-

est position among sciences.

Infinitely varied in its fonns and structure, suited to every conceivable condition,

where air, moisture, and heat are present, yet developed from one simple type,

composed of various elements combined in the most intricate manner with endless

modifications of mechanical, chemical, and electrical processes, besides others which

it is scarcely possible to recount or observe, much less to comprehend, and which
we group under the term " vital," the animal machine presents interests for every

mind, puzzles for every genius, and challenges the whole annj' of science and phi-

losophy through all coming ages to concentrate theii' fire and attempt even their

outer works. Impelled by the in-esistible impulse for knowledge, clieered by con-

tinual Tictory, we march, and not slowly, ever onwards, and value our laurels none

the less because each fresh one tells of more that must be won, and shows the final

goal receding as we near it.

Finding, as we do, that the animal machine is the resultant of all the propei-ties

or forces of matter, combined and harmonized by that most mysterious ot them
which we call the " vital force," we claim as fellow labourers the workers in every

division of science, and watch with interest each discovery, knowing that in what-
ever direction it is it has a bearing, more or less direct, upon oui- own study, wel-

coming all, digesting and appropriating what we can.

Both as regards the ground, therefore, which has been already turned, and that

which remains to be explored, physiology affords the grandest tield for labom- and

provides occupation for every faculty. In no other science, perhaps, do observation

and reflection so distinctly stimulate and help one another. It is chiefly by clear

reasoning, by induction from ascertained facts, that physiology is to be studied and

advanced ; and thougli a short flight into the regions of imagination now and then
may show a beacon light and help us better to track the path to knowledge, the

lights there seen are too commonly if/nesfatui, exciting and misleading. Hence the

study of phj'siology is one of the best exercises  of the  mind                             and the gi'eater ap-
                                                                                         ;

preciation of it as such is being shown by the admission of it, slowlj' and cautiously

it is true, into our educational system. It is taking its place in our Uni^-ersities

and I am convinced that it and the other branches of natural science will be found

at least as suitable instruments for cultivating and strengthening the various facul-

ties of the mind, particularly those of obser\atiou and reflection, as any of the more

favoured educational subjects. In looliiug to the future of yoimg England, and its

prospects in the struggle (the hard struggle), I will not say for existence, but for

position among nations, that seems to be impending, one cannot but feel that very

much must depend upon the eftectual development of the mental faculties. It has

been by force of mind and not by force of coal that our country has been raised to

its present height. "Wq must look to the same power to keep her in the full front

of nations. It is not the bayonet, it is not the needle-gun, but the mind that con-

ceives and the energj' that makes and wields them, which gain the victoiy. If, as

I am sometimes disposed to think, the old educational soil, upon which so many

generations have been trained, is in some degi-ee wearing out, it will surely be none

the less productive for the introduction of new elements ; at any rate they will

bring out fresh powers to meet the changing circumstances of the times. I will

not, however, detain you vnX\\ this, but pass on to one or two other matters.

For the higher reasoning, couiliining, and analytic faculties, abundant scope and

exercise will be found in the attempts to unfold the laws by which we grow, and                                   i

move, and have our being ; and full reward is given by the glimpses, from time to

time, we obtain of the wondrous workings of creative power. As an illustration of

this, I need only mention the discovery of development by cells, a discovery which

is, perhaps, second only to that of gravitation, evincing as it does a simple, uniform

law, underlying and working out the vastly diverse forms and structures of

vegetable and animal life. Surely the knowledge that the tough oalc-plank,

the blade of grass, the lion's claw, the contracting muscle, and the thinking

brain all emanate from simple forms which, so far as we can tell, are per-

fectly alike, and, further, that the entire plant or animal also emanate from a

single form or cell which is undistinguishable from the rudiments of its several

parts, is as fidl of interest and as suggestive of high thought as any one of the

fragments of knowledge which man has worked out for himself in the whole range

of physical science and what better exercise can there be than teaching the ope-
                                                                                                        ;

witnessing the manner in which it holds its ground through all the inflnite modifi-

cations by vv Inch plants and animals are adapted to their several positions and to

one another.

The microscope has lately been to physiology much what the steam-engine has

been to manufacture and transit ; it has opened up new regions for observation,

and given an entirely nevv' direction to our thoughts. The structure of the several

tissues and orgrais has probably been made out as far as the present means permit,

and we are occupied now in investigating their mode of formation and connexion
with one anotlier. There seems much reason to think tliat they are more closely
related, more continuous, than we have been in the habit of regarding them. There
is now little doubt of the continuity of the nerve-fibres and the nerve-vesicles ; and

it is not improbable that the other parts of the nerves are continuous with the

several tissues among which they ramifj^, with the deeper prolongation of epithe-

lium, with the elementary structure of muscle, and with the filaments of areolar

tissue. The continuity of the areolar tissues with serus, fibres, and mucus mem-

brane on the one hand, and with the intimate structure of the various organs on
the other, is more clearly shown, and a very general and extensive continuity is
thereby established. The cornea is continuous with the sclerotic, and so with the

speri sheath and dura mater. Even epitheliimi, which we were wont to regard as

a distinct external and easily separable sheath, is found to send its filamentary
prolongations into the subjacent organs, wliich become blended with the areolar
and nervous and perhaps with the lymphatic systems. The epithelium of the

glandular tubes is in some organs imdistinguishable from the cells which occupy

the stigma. The blood-vessels in many animals are continuous with the areolae of

the tissues ; and in all, the ultimate circulation take place through the tissues, the

nutritious fluid passing freely to and fro between their interstices and the interior

Weof the capillaries where capillaries are present.  are thus reminded of the fact

that in their embryonic period the several structiu-es, or the potential rudiments

of them, were all blended in a homogeneoiis germinal mass ; and we learn that

though they have become differentiated they have not become separated, but re-

tain in their mode of connexion the traces of their common parentage and of
their early continuity. Such a blending of ultimate tissue, as a remnant of em-
brj'onic condition, assists ns to explain many things, such as the transfer of im-
pressions and what we call sympathy, that are at present difficult to imderstand,
and is an additional illustration of the simple method by which, in nature's works,

great ends are attained.

  We perhaps scarcely realize and appreciate the bearings of the fiict that all the

various tissues are formed from a primitive homogeneous and continuous plesina, by
the formation and separation from one another of " portions," "centres," " masses,"
"cells," or whatever we please to call them, and their development into structure

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

attention has been directed almost exclusively to the formation and development

of these masses and too little to their separation, though the latter is a process
little, if at all, less important than the former, and must be eft'ected by something

analogous to what we call abruption. Indeed the work of abruption, or hollowing

out, during the embryonic state is little less active than that of secretion or building

the fact that the various cavities, canals, and spaces in the interior of the body are

due to the same progress, and that the failure or arrest of it may be the cause of
many of the so-called adhesions of seams and other surfaces, of the imperforate con-
dition of canals, and the union of parts that should be free. The transition from

the investigation of the fine processes of the animal organism to the consideration

of the forces by which they are brought about is a natural, a necessary step, though,

we need have no apprehension. Increasing^ knowledge only further shows our
io-norauce, that kind uf ignorance, at loa^t, which gives more stimulus to know-

led"-e ; and thus the acquisition of knowledge and the attendant consciousness of

io-norance together, carry ns on till the time when we shall know as we are known.

   It is quite clear what we call chemistry, with its attendants heat and elec-
tricity, plays a most important part in the animal machine ; and, probably, more

information as to the nature of the organic processes is to be expected from their

chemical study than in any other way. ViJe have found out that there is a very

close relation between a complete atomic formula and the vital processes, the

amount of chemical tension which is expressed by the former being commensurate

with the character of the latter, and the amount of chemical change which takes

place in the textures being comuiensurate with the activity of the vital processes.

There seems good reason to believe that a muscular filn'c is the container of a given

amount of chemical force compressed by the medium of a high chemical formula,

and existing, therefore, in a high state of tension, that during its constmction the

compressed force is set free by the decomposition of its structure, that is, by the

resolution of its component elements, chiefly hy a process of oxidation, to a lower

formula or a state of lower tension, at the same time that heat is evolved and elec-

trical changes take place, though the latter are not yet distinctly defined. It is

impossible, therefore, to avoid the application here of the doctrine of contractile

force, which is being so clearly worked out in the inorganic vcorld, and which
seems to be the greatest advance that has for some time been made in our know-

ledge of the laws of matter. "\^'e can scarcely doubt that the chemical force which

is set free during the decomposition attendant npon muscular action is the equiva-

lent of the contractile force that is evinced and of the heat that is evolved. In

other words, a muscle may be regarded as the medium by which force is accumu-

lated, rendered latent, or condensed in a condition of high chemical tension, and is,

from time to time, as occasion may require, set free and converted into muscular or

contractile force and heat.

It seems probable that such is the case, and we may look for the more clear

demonstration of it with some confidence as a real gain to physiology, inasmuch

as certain of the animal formations will be thus withdrawn from the mysterious

region of life into the more intelligible domain of science.

Not that we must make too much of this and be too proud, and assume that,

because we arc alile to refer a little more of animal process to the ordinary pheno-

mena of matter, we may relinquish the idea of a vital agency altogether. Let us

first remember that we really know very little of those phenomena, not much more

than we do about life. Attraction and chemical affinity, heat, light, electricity,

magnetism, and motion, are all expressions for forces of the nature of which we

are, and perhaps shall ever remain, ignorant. They may be, and probably are,

modifications of one, force, and one force showing itself in difi'erent ways ; and it

is something to arrive at this. It may be that life is another modification of the

Wesame force ; and it will be something more to arrive at that.  need not shrink

from such a result ; but we have not yet attained to it, and have no right to pre-

judge that it is, or that it is not, and to quarrel with those who hold a different

opinion. Suffice it to admit that there is still much in vegetables and animals that

we cannot explain by reference to the ordinary laws of nature, and which we refer

to another law or power and call it life. For instance, in the case of muscle just

alluded to, though the state of chemical tension may explain much, we know not

how that tension, that complex formula, is brought about ; we cannot approach to

WeWean imitation of it.                                       know not how the
know not how it is maintained.

force so pent up is liberated and converted into muscular action. "We cannot ex-

plain these phenomena, much less those of growth and development, by reference

to the chemical or other ]3roperties of matter, and until we can, we must be content

to fall back upon the additional mysterious agent of life.

So with certain other vexed questions which are, in some measure, allied to this

one. Can, or rather does, any combination of the ordinary forces of matter ever

lead to the phenomena of life ? If they are proved to be correlative with the vital

SO far as our observation at present goes, absolutely necessary ; tbat is, life has

never been known -n-itliout a living- being-, without a form, without a medium for

the exercise of the vital force, just as there is no nianiftstation of attraction or

heat without the medium (matter) through whicli they act. Thus we are im-

--paled upon the horns of the dilemma life is not manifested without a living; being
--or medium, and the medium cannot exist without life a dilemma from which our

knowledge of the properties of matter is, so far as I can see, unequal to

rescue us ; and our only refuge is in the admission of a creative power to

which the medium and' properties of life, in the same way as the medium
Weand ordinaiy properties of matter, owe their simultaneous existence.
                                                                        must

allow this for the present, without reference to the future progress of discovery

and, without being seduced into that over-much wisdom which is another expres-

sion for foUy, must be content to reason from what we know. Further observation

may supply other bases for our reflection and widen the area of our thoughts by

showing that matter is endowed with properties which enable it to aggregate into

li\-ing fonns, but no sufficient groimd for such an assumption has yet been given,

  A subject for investigation, nearly akin to that last mentioned, and which may,

perhaps, some day, tend to throw some light upon it, is the transition fi-om life to

death, a change which, under ordinary circumstances takes place in the most deli-

cate, insensible manner ; so that it is impossible to say when and how life euds and

death begins. I speak not of that wide and sudden termination of the body's life

from disease or decay (that somatic death) which we usually associate with the
word " death," but which is in nature comparatively so rare that it may probably

rather be regarded as exceptional and abnormal than natural. I refer to the

mode in which the parts of the ultimate tissue of the body become changed and

cease to exist, a process so fine as to elude observation and to prove that the boun-

dary line between life and death is hard to define. Even in the instance of the

cuticle, a structure comparatively under the eye, as we watch the transition of the

spherical deeper components to the flattened forms of the superficial strata, and

the disintegration of the latter, partly by external influences, we are at a loss to

decide where living force ends ; indeed there seems to be no point at which that

can be said to take place. And if, with regard to the components of it and the

other tissues, we assent to the view that their external or "formed" parts are life-

less and their internal or "germinal " parts are alone endued with living properties,

we still have to ask, "Where is the division between the two ? Where does the
"germinal" or living end, and the "formed" or lifeless begin, and how is the

latter done away with ? Clearly it is not by an abrupt disintegration or solution,

but by some slow insensible process which savours rather of atomic change than of

destruction. Then, one is inclined to ask, if the passage from the living to the

unliving condition be of this insidious inappreciable natm-e, may there not be aeon-

verse of a like kind, an insensible origination of, or conversion into, life and life's

forms, going on somewhere in the far recesses of natm-e's womb. I do not think

we ai'e bound to shut out the thought of such a possibility. It seems a fair ques-
tion to entertain ; but admitting it as a question, we must refrain from the tendency

to give a hasty answer in the affirmative.

Granted, therefore, for the present, that the medium, the living form, was given

or created with the vital property, does it remain the same in kind through all

succeeding generations ? or is it capable of undergoing changes, slowly and gra-

dually, or, perhaps, if needs be, more rapidly, so as to adapt it to various circum-

stances and conditions, so as, in short, to evoke in time tlie div erse forms which

animal life is known to assume ; or must each of those forms have been the result
of a special creation similar to those which we suppose in the first instance ? One

might have judged this to be a question which a careful examination and com-

parison of the different species, and the circumstances under which they are found,

would have enabled us to decide with tolerable ease and certainty ; but it was

found not to be so. On the one hand we see changes in each individual whereby

the complete being is evolved from the simple germ, changes that are suggestive

of a corresponding evolution of the varied animal forms from one huml)le beginning.

"We find all the difterent animals emanatiug from the same point as its centre, tlie

when the conditions cease to be favourable to it, and as a necessary consequence of
the alteration of those conditions, as to suggest that it was modified from a com-
mon standard not merely /or but hy the conditions which surround it. The records

of the earth's history prove this adaptation to have been the case in former times

as well as now, the faunas varying in correspondence with the variations in the

surface and climate and temperature of our planet ; and we can clearly prove cer-

tain modifications in species to be caused by changes in the external conditions in
which they have been placed. Moreover, by attention to external curiosities and

selection in breeding, we can induce deviations in the offspring, and so imitate, it

has been suggested, the process that goes on in nature.

These, with some other considerations, coincide with our scientific yearning to

unfold the plan of the universe and trace in its growtli and the development of its

parts the operation of natural law. They seem to give us hints as to the mode of
construction of the animal kingdom which it is the legitimate work of physiology
to gather up and weave into a consistent theory according with some new con-

ceptions of creative plan.

   But, on the other hand, so higli a point on the hill of knowledge (a point ima-

goined rather than yet seen) can be but slowly reached. Much labour is required
to clear away the tliicliets and level the groimd, lest the springs of genius carry us

down rather than up. Much obseiwation must be made and much evidence accu-

mulated before we can see our way to a theory of transmutation of species. The

only valid, but it is a cardinal, objection to such a theoiy is the want of evidence

that a change of the kind inferred really takes place, and that so little proof of it

is forthcoming in spite of the attention wliicli has for many years been anxiously
directed to the subject. The nearly allied species tantalize us by a certain flexi-

bility of type and by their near approach to one another ; but tliey seem rigidly

to abstain from the boundary lines ; and tlie variations that take place seem to

have no especial reference to an approximation to those lines, but rather to a cer-

tain power of accommodation to external circumstances necessary for the preser^a-

common origin. Some of tliese are more, some less, allied to the monkey ; but
between the lowest of the human and the highest of the monkey there is a gap,

the width of which will be differently estimated by diiferent persons, but so

wide that there has never j'et been any doubt to wliich side any specimen should

be referred. Now, if the one has been transmuted from the other, how comes it

that the series has been broken and the connecting links ceased to exist ? The
conditions are still favourable to the existence of the man and to the existence of

the monkey ; why are they not stiU favourable to the existence of the species that
have connected tlie one with the other ? we may wonder, not only that the traces

of species in intst time are not forthcoming, but tliat the species are not now living.

IMoreover, we do not know that any conceivaljle conditions, operating through any

number of years, would bring the gorilla or chimpanzee one vv'hit nearer to man,

would give them a foot more capable of bearing the body erect, a brain more

capable of conceiving ideas, or a larTOX more capable of communicating them. It

is possible that such changes might be effected. One would fancy it probable but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

we have at present too little right to assume it, and the more extended the

research without increasing the evidence the less does the probability become.

 ing away very far from the original stock. To the former their seems no limit
  but the latter is stopped by the increasing uuproductiveuess and unhealthiness of
  the individuals, liy the susceptibility to disease, and the tendency to revert to the
  original type. So that increasing departure requires greatly increasing care ,· and
 we do not know that any amount of care and time would be sufficient to produce
 what might fairly be called a new species. The bringing about any marked
 change by nature's selection is shown to be verj^ hard of proof, and ha.s opposed
 to its probability the fact that the members of a species which are most unlike
 have the greatest tendency to pair and are the most fertile ; so that we have here,
 in addition to the ready reversion of modified breeds to the original stock, a law
 by which the growth or perpetuation of ]5eenliarities is prevented and a constancy
 given to the characters of the species. This law is more striking from its conti-ast
 with the bar that exists to the pairing of different species and the infertility of
 hybrids. Within a given range dissimilarity promotes fertility ; beyond that
 range it is incompatible with it.

    These and other considerations have always inclined me to the opinion that

 modifications of animal t}'pe, occurring in nature, are more likely to be the result

 of external influences operating upon successive generations, influencing their
 development, their growtli, and their maturity, than of " natural selection " and
 "struggle for existence." But greater eifects of these and other similar agencies
 must be shown before we ought to admit even the reasonable probability of their
 power to work out the great changes that have been attributed to them.

     In pondering over the definiteness of animal t^^es, so marvellously elaborated
 fi'om a simple fonn, their slight variability through long periods, the clear manner

 in which they, many of them at least, are worked out from one another, and which
 increasing investigation seems to render more and more apparent, the prospect of

 proving that they are educed from one another ^3y any of the hitherto supposed
 processes seems to gi-ow more and more distant, and the feeling arises that there
 must be some other law at work -which has escaped our detection.

   We are familiarized with the fact that in the inorganic world combinations take

 place only in certain definite proportions ; for instance, that oxygen unites with
 nitrogen in one proportion to make nitrous oxide in a second proportion, a mul-
 tiple of the first to make nitric oxide, and so on to the fifth proportion or multiple,
 which gives iiitric acid, and that between them five several fixed proportions as
 combinations take place. So that the resultants of these and other similar com-

 binations (the inorganic species, as we msij call them) are remarkably constant

 and fixed in their characters each has its one fomi, as in the case of crystal, of
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

 chloride of sodium, or sulphate of magnesia, which may be broken down or dis-
 solved, but which cannot be modified or made to approach, still less to pass into,

 any other form.
    ilay there not be something analogous (some corresponding law of combining

 proportion) presiding o\ev living matter, educing the various forms, fixing their
 characters, gi\'ing tliem constancy, in fact evolving and fixing the species and pre-

 venting their transmutation.

   It will be understood that I am not speaking of the combining propoi-tions of the
 elements in the several animal tissues, which we know, or have every reason to

 believe, is as fixed as in ordinary inorganic matter, though the combinations are
 more complex and the forumlfe are, in consequence, harder to work out. I speak

now not of this, but of something comparable with this and suggested by this,

 operating not upon individual particles, but on masses, regulating not the chemical
 composition and form and feature of the tissues, but the form and features of the
 animal. As oxygen unites \vith nitrogen only in the definite multiple proportions
 represented by the figures 1, 2, .3, 4, 5, and under certain circumstances, producing
 in each instance a special compound unlike any other and marked off fiom the
 nearest approaching compounds by distinctive features, and ^^^thout any interme-
. diate gTadations, so in the animal and vegetable world the combinations requisite

for evolving living beings may be regulated in a similar manner, taking place only

 in certain fixed proportions and under certain circumstances and educing certain
 definite forms, each of which is unlike any other and is marked off from its

 nearest approach by clearly distinctive features and without intermediate grada-

tions. As each cliemical compound (say nitric oxide) remains in its given condi-

tion, -without chanp:e, till ciicnmstanccs have culminated to favour and induce a

chau'^e, which then takes place, not by slow gradation, but by sudden start, to

some other definite compound (say nitrous or nitric acid), so the several animal

forms may remain fixed till the conditions for a change, which conditions may be
external to themselves, are complete. Thus the change may take place, and not

bv slow gradations, but by sudden start, by something resembling a new creation,

and their definite and clearly distinct form, or species, is produced. Thus, as

complementary and similar to the laws of uniformity in design and variety in

detail, we may suppose to work on together the laws of gTadation and internip-

--tion by the one the living ladder is shaped and bound together as a whole ; by

the other the steps are preseived distinct, /. e. the individuality of the species is

given and retained.

At any rate, whatever be the law and forces which effect and regulate the evo-

lution of species, they are probably of the same kind as those which are operating

in the inorganic world. The orderly and definite manner in which forms and fea-

tures and specific characters are given and preserved in the one instance may be

assumed to be of the same nature as in the other ; and we must probably refer the

fixed animal and vegetable types to influences identical with, or similar to, those by

which the forms are assigned to crystals and the stratification is given to rocks,

by which the geological epochs have been determined and the boundaries of our

jilanetary and solar systems have been set. One cannot but think that it may be

within the power of man to work out and to comprehend, in some degree at least,

the principles by which these breaks in the organic and inorganic works, constitut-

ing as they clearly do an important feature in the plan of creation, ate brought

about and regidated.

The pendulum of opinion on this great question (the question of working by

general law, or working by special interferences) may be expected long to swing

to and fro ere it rests upon a settled conclusion. In the meantime it will help to

keep the wheels of science going and add fresh knowledge to our heap.

And let us not shrink from the free, bold, fair discussion of these and other kin-

dred subjects under an apprehension that the}" are calculated to lower the religious

elements and shake the faith. Such discussions, and the thoughts which gi-\e

rise to them, are a necessity, an inevitable result of advancing science, which it is

as impossible to stop as the progTess of time itself; and that which is inevitable

must be accepted. 'Twould show a want of faith to resist it. Knowledge may be

man's trial ; but that applies to knowledge of all kinds, of that which is esteemed

good as well as of that which is esteemed evil. Certainlj- the fruit of its tree

--and representatives of good elements in man's nature the element of faith and the

element of thoiight. Both should cooperate in tlie work of purifying and eleva-

ting the character ; indeed the one cannot advance safely without the other. Still

they will now and then come into collision and threaten to rmdermine one

another, needing forbearance and discretion to restore their harmony. One cause

of the occasional outbursts of the odium tJieolor/icuni is, I think, due to a fault

on the side of the theologians. Not satisfied with, or distrusting the really unas-

sailable position on which their future stands, with its foundations deep laid in

man's consciousness and God's work, they have endeavoured to raise outworks

on the shifting ground of natural science, by drawing arguments from analogy,

by associating special views of creation and resm-rection with true religious belief,

and by insisting on certain literal interpretations of the physical medium through

which spiritual truth has been conveyed to us. Hence each unfolding of the

material laws is liable to be regarded with suspicion, lest it should sap the foun-

dations that have been thus unwisely propped. Religious arguments drawn from

the physical world are very liable to prove two-edged swords cutting both ways

according to the manner in which they are wielded, or staffs that penetrate the

hands of those that lean upon them. Theology may rest safe upon her own posi-.

tion. and watch with confidence and satisfaction the advancing waves of science,

heart. The contents of the sacs displayed a complete cell-formation, the ultimate

particles being gi-auular. Each graniile or pseudo-navicel, as it might be called,

The warmer the climate, the less the difference of colour of arterial and venous
blood. The Esquimaux are neither fair nor dark brown, but intermediate. The
long, continuous solar effect for one half the year associates them with the inha-

the opposite conclusion, viz. that the carbonate of lime in the shell is in an amor-
phous and finely granular state. In this state I have found it in the e^g of the

common fowl, taken from the oviduct when the carbonate of lime was only

sparingly deposited in the investing membrane. Again, in the instances of the

eggs of the smaller birds, which are exceedingly thin, are easily crushed and

reduced to a fine powder, well fitted for microscopical examination, I have never

 observed any appearance of crystals, only of granules, tliese of various sizes, the

 smallest only just within the limits of vision. Farther, v.hen I have subjeeted a
 minute portion of shell to the "blowpipe, and rapidly destroyed by combustion the
 animal matter, in the residual liuie couuniuuted with a drop of water added to it
 there has been no appearance immediately of crystals, only of granides: I say
 immediately, because, after a short exposiu'e to the air, the lime, that which had
 been deprived of its carbonic acid, reuniting with carbonic acid derived from the
 atmosphere, then assumed a crystalline form, and presented minute well-defined
 crj'stals, chiefly of the cubical kind, and this the more rapidly the more free the
 exposure, as shown by comparing a portion covered wnth thin glass and another

not so covered. And if no water be used, no solution formed, then no crystals
 were produced, even when the lime, attracting moisture from the atmosphere,

 becomes converted into a hydrate*.
    That crystallization is of rare occurrence in connexion with organic develop-

 ment is an admitted fact, and where it has been observed, as in the blood, it
 seems to be yet a problem waiting solution, whether the crystals detected were
formed in the living fluid and were a part of it as such, or were formed after
privation of life; in other words, whether by a formative process analogous to
secretion, or by a destructive process pertaining to excretion. That coagulable

lymph or fibrine may lose its vitality whilst in the living blood-vessels, and

undergo a softening similar to that which takes place in it out of the body at a

certain temperature, is now an established pathological fact; and as blood-corpuscles
are always included in the coagulum, these two may be inferred to be in the same
category in relation to vitality. Were life and crystallization compatible, might we
not expect to find crystals in bones ? But I am not aware that they have ever been
detected in any bone, however early its examination may have been in the
embryo. It may perhaps be said that crystals are frequently met with in calcidi.

Admitting the fact, is it not more reasonable to refer their formation in these
bodies not to vital action, but to the absence of vitality, and to ordinary physical
causes, calculi themselves being anorganic, and the result of causes of the same

land, ('. e. physical ? And here I maj- mention a fact whicJi I am disposed to view

in the same light. I have found in the ovary of a fowl a white opaque matter,
resembling in appearance lithate of ammonia, as seen in the urinary excrement of
birds ; but on examination it proved to be not a lithate of anmionia, but carbonate
of lime mixed with auimal matter, the former partly granular and partly crystal-
lized, chiefly in minute cubes.

    The rapid manner in which the carbonate of lime is deposited on the e^g in the
oviduct, and always, as it would appear, associated with animal matter, might
perhaps be used as an argument against its deposition ou the membrane in a crys-
talline form : be this as it may, both the shortness of time in which the incrus-
tation takes place and the quantity of carbonate of lime which enters into the
incrustation is remarkable. -V hen, a good layer, in fidl vigour, commonly laj's
an eg(!: every day, and 1 have never found more than one egg in the oviduct at the
same time. Of an egg newly laid, which weighed 906-9 grs., the entire shell was
found to weigh 69'4 grs., of which, on analysis, 16-1 grs. proved to be animal
matter, 53-3 grs. carbonate of lime, with a trace of carbonate of magnesia and
phosphate of lime ; so this large quantity of carbonate of lime must have been
poured out from the blood in the short space of twenty^-four hours or less !

   Another fact I would mention, which also may be adduced in fa'som- of the

idea that crystallization is not incompatible -with vital action. I refer to the

microscopical crystals, chiefly prismatic, which are found to occur in the brain
and spinal chord of the frog and toad, and which I have detected also in the

newt, and this normally, as far as I am aware, without exception, and, I may add,
which occur also in profusion in the retina. From the trial I have made of

them, they appear to consist chiefly of phosphate of lime. The existence of these

--crystals is a fact that does not seem to admit of the same explanation as calculi.

It seems altogether exceptional a problem waiting solution.
   In certain vegetables, too, as is well known, crystals have been found in their

production of calculi. It would be foreign to my piu'pose to express any opinion as

mto the great question whether, in the vital economy, the forces action are merely

physical forces, or, admitting, as must be admitted, that these forces are concernecl

in the phenomena of life, whether something more is not required, a special force,

a vital force, to give them direction, or modify their influence.

Note on an Addition to the Sphygmograph. By Dr. Balthazar W. Foster.

   After describing the construction and application of Marey's Sphygmograph, the
author pointed out that the screw regidating the amount of pressm'e exerted- on the
artery under examination required adjustment for nearly every case. Too great
pressure often materially altered the form of the pulse ti-ace"; and as it is essential for
accuracy in comparative observations that the pressure on the vessels should be the
same, the author stated that by having an index attached to the pressure-screw,
and a graduated circle described round the screw as a centre, the position of the
index woidd always enable the obsei-ver to exercise the same amount of pressure
in any number of cases.

On a Peculiar Change of Colour in a Mtdatto. By Dr. Balthazar W. Foster.

After alluding to the present state of our knowledge of the conditions connected

with the development of pigment, the author related an instance in which he had

observed a gradual disappearance of the cutaneous pigment in a Mulatto aged 43.

Minute white spots first appeared on the man's back, and by coalescing gradually

formed large white patches. These constantly extending, in the com-se of six

years the whole of the trunk became perfectly white, spots of the original colour

remaining onlj- on the extremities. The face retained its dark hue, and an irre-

gular margin encircling the neck formed the limit of the upward advance of the

white colom-. Isolated spots of white had appeared, however, on the forehead and

at the angles of the jaw. The white skin was perfectly healthj" in appearance and

not to be distinguished from that of a European. The man's hair was black and

crispy, and of a flattened elliptical form on section. Blisters applied to the bleached

surface restored the dark colour in in-cgular spots, which remained unchanged for

several months. No discoverable condition in the man's constitution or habits

could be regarded as the antecedent of the remarkable change, except possibly a
Avery weak and sluggish state of the circulation.
                                                                       series of large photographs

     On the Action of Carhonic Oxide on the Blood. By Dr. A. Gamgee.

  When carbonic oxide is passed through venous blood it acquires a persistently

florid colour, which was first pointed out by Claude Bernard, and the colouring-
matter, although it possesses a spectrum identical with that of ordinary blood, is
distinguished from it by not yielding, when treated with reducing agents, the spec-
trum first described by Stokes as that of reduced or purple cruorine. This pro-
perty of carbonic -oxide blood was first published by Hoppe. As a result of his

--own investigations, Dr. Gamgee has found : First, that the peculiar compoimd of

carbonic oxide and blood colouring-matter is formed even when the latter has

been reduced, and is still in the presence of a large excess of a reducing solution.

Secondly, that when the compoimd of carbonic oxide and colouring-matter is

treated with acetic <acid, whilst hsematine is formed, carbonic oxide is disen-
gaged. Thirdly, that carbonic oxide, besides modifying the optical properties
of the colouring-matter of blood, affects in a remarkable manner the point at
which it coagulates, so that, under its influence, an almost perfect separation of
the hremotogiobulin (using the term to express the normal colouring-matter of

the blood) from the albumen may be eftected. Normal ox's-blood, when diluted
with nine times its volume of water, becomes tiu-bid at 145° Fahr., and when the

temperature has reached 172^ Fahr. its colour is completely destroyed. If such a

blood-solution haxe been treated ·witli carbonic oxide, whilst, when the tempera-

ture has been raised to 172°, the albumen has separated in flakes, the blood co-

louring-matter remains wholly unchanged. It is only when the temperature is

raised to about 185° that the colouring-matter commences to coagulate. The co-

agulum which is obtained on further heating is of a reddish colom*, unlike that of

normal blood. Fourthly, if blood be saturated with CO, and evaporated to dry-

ness at a temperature below that at which the colouring-matter coagulates, the dry

residue yields its colouring-matter to water, and the solution presents all the op-

tical properties of carbonic-oxide blood. When the solution is boiled, the com-

pound with the colouring-matter yields carbonic-oxide gas. Fifthlj', poisoning by

pure carbonic oxide, or by the fumes of charcoal, invariably' leads, before death

occurs, to those changes which are characteristic of carbonic-oxide blood, be-

coming quite irreducible. Sorby's microspectroscope answers admirably for these

investigations                                                                  and  the  solution which  Dr. Gamgee  recommends  for  this  special
                                                                             ;

process is one containing tin, in preference either to sidphide of ammonium or

protoxide of iron. Sixthly, whilst it residts from Dr. Gamgee's researches that no

gas or poisonous agent exerts the peculiar action on blood colouring-matter which

is pro'luced by CO, it is specially to be noticed that prussic acid and laughinn^-

gas, which hare the power of rendering blood florid, do not prevent its being

reduced. Thus the question which Claude Bernard suggested some j'ears ago, as

to whether prussic acid exerts on blood a similar action to that of carbonic oxide,

is answered in the negative.

backs, with the view of determining the essential and modifj-ing conditions of the
movements seen in their yelks.

   He related tlie effects of various poisons, of increasing or reducing the tempera-

ture, of the application of galvanic currents and deprivation of oxygen. The chief
conclusion attempted to be drawn was that these movements demand the presence
of oxygen in the surromiding medium as an essential condition of their existence.

   The subject of this paper was the action of medicines when taken in health.
   That drugs ought to be experimented upon by liealthy persons was suggested by
Haller; the importance of such experiments, and their necessity, was unanimously
agreed upon by the Medical Section of the Scientific Congress at Strasburg in 1842.

On the Movements, Structure, and Sounds of tJie Heart. By Dr. Sibsok, F.B.S.

Antheopologt.

Address by A. R. Wallace, F.R.G.S., 4'C:

Anthropology is the science which contemplates man imder all his varied aspects

(as an animal, and as a moral and intellectual being) in his relations to lower
organisms, to his fellow men, and to the ur.;-, erse. The anthropologist seeks to collect
together and systematize the facts and tlic laws which have been brought to light

by all those branches of study which, directly or indirectly, have man for their
object. These are very various. The physiologist, for example, studies man as a

wondrous and most complicated machine, whose parts and motions, actions and
reactions he seeks thoroughly^to understand. The comparative anatomist and the

zoologist compare his structure with that of other animals, take note of their like-
nesses and dift'erences, determine their degrees of affinitj-, and seek after the com-

mon plan of their organization and the law of their development. The psychologist
studies the mind of man, its mode of action, and its development, compares it with

the instincts and the reasoning faculties of the lower animals, and ever aims at the

--solution of the greatest of problems whence and what is mind. The historian col-

lects and arranges the facts of man's progress  in recent  times                              the geographer de-
                                                                                           ;

termines the localities of the various races that now inhabit the earth, their man-

ners, customs, and physical characteristics ; the archaeologist seeks, by studying

the remains of man and his works, to supplement written history and to carry

back our knowledge of man's physical, mental, and moral condition into prehistoric

times ; the geologist extends this kind of knowledge to a still eai-lier epoch, by

pro'^dng that man coexisted with numerous animals now extinct, and inhabited

Europe at so remote a period that the very contour of its surface, the form of its

hills and valleys, no less than its clim.ate, vegetation, and geology, were mate-

rially different from what they now are, or ever have been durino; the epoch of
authentic histoiy ; the philologist devotes himself to the study of human speech,
and through it seeks to trace out the chief migrations of nations, and the common
origin of many of the races of mankind ; and, lastly, the phrenologist and the cra-
niologist have created special sciences out of the study of the human brain and

skull. Considering the Drain as the organ of the mind, the phrenologist seeks to

discover in what way they con-espond to each other, and to coimect mental pecu-
liarities with the form and dimensions of the brain as indicated by the con-espond-
ing form of its bon^' covering. The craniologist, confining his attention to the
skull as an indication of race, endeavours to trace out the afiinities of modern and
ancient races of men, by the forms and dimensions of their crania. These various

studies have hitherto been pursued separately. There has been gi-eat division of

Nowlabour, but no combination of results.       it is our object as anthropologists to

accept the well-ascertained conclusions which have been arrived at by the students

of all these various sciences, to search after every new fact which may throw addi-

tional light upon any of them, and, as far as we are able, to combine and generalize

Wethe whole of the information thus obtained.   cannot, therefore, afford to neg-

lect any facts relating to man, however trivial, unmeaning, or distasteful some of

them may appear to us. Each custom, superstition, or belief of savage or of civi-

lized man may guide us towards <an explanation of their origin in common ten-

dencies of the human mind. Each peculiarity of form, colour, or constitution may

give us a clue to the affinities of an obscm'e race. The anthropologist must ever

bear in mind that, as the object of his study is vian, nothing pertaining to or cha-
--94 REPORT 1866,

racteristic of man can be vinwortliy of his attention. It will be only after we have

brought together and arranged all the facts and principles which have been esta-

blished Lv the various special studies to which I have alluded, that we shall be in

a condition to determine the particular lines of investigation most needed to com-

plete our knowledge of man, and may hope ultimately to arrive at some definite

--conclusions on the gi-eat problems which must. interest us all the questions of the

origin, the nature, and the destiny of the human race. I would beg you to recol-

lect also that here we must treat all these problems as purely questions of science,

Weto be decided solely by facts and by legitimate deductions from facts.  can

accept no conclusions as authoritative that have not been thus established. Our

sole object is to find out for ourselves what is our true nature, to feel our way
cautiously, step by step, into the dark and mysterious past of human history, to

study man under every phase and aspect of his present condition, and from the

knowledge thus gained to derive (as we cannot fail to do) some assistance in our

attempts to govern and improve uncivilized tribes, some guidance in our own

national and individual progress.

Recent Explorations in Cliamhered Cairns in Caithness. By J. Andeeson.

        On the Stature and Bull- of the Irish, and on Degeneration of Race.

                                                Btj Dr. J. Beddoe.
   The author had derived his data from the measurement of 1517 recruits of Irish
birth, and of 23 years of age and upwards. The average height and weight yielded
by his figures were 5 feet 7"25 inches and 1.38'03 lbs. ; these he supposed to represent
corrected averages of 5 feet 7'4 inches and 138'5 lbs., allowing for surplusage. The

men were measured and weighed naked. The true average stature of the general
population, or of that portion of it which supplied recruits, including men of insuffi-

cient height for the army, might be conjectured from the culminating point of the
numbers at each inch on tlie scale. It would probably be 5 feet 6-6 inches, or a trifle
more, for all Ireland, varying from 5 feet 7'3 inches in the agricultural population
of the eastern and southern provinces, to as low as 5 feet ryii inches in Connaught.
Dr. Beddoe endeavoured to investigate the proportions of the principal race-elements
in the several provinces by the aid of an analysis of the surnames ; he sliowed .that
the degradation of stature, so far as the numbers observed enabled him to decide,
was greatest among the Connaught people with Saxon or imported names ; and argued
the question whether this might be due to the original differences of race, or to the

influence of causes of degeneration.

   On Skulls from Round Barrows in Dorsetshire. By C. C. Blake, F.G.S.,

    The autli or remarked that they were obtained by Dr. Hunt, the President of the
 Anthropological Society, from some barrows near Blandford. Dr. Thurnam, in a
 dissertation on the two principal forms of English and Gaulish skulls, gave a table
 containing the measurement of twenty-five skulls from the English round barrows.
                                                                                  --

                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                95

The longest of Dr. Thurnam's specimens exhibited a cephalic index of -74, and the

shortest -87, the avevage being -81 ; and Dr. Thurnani therefore concluded that the

typical character of the skulls found in round barrows was that which presented tlie

brachycephalic type. When the skulls taken from the Blandford barrows were care-

fully measiu'ed, it appeared that the rate of breadth was much smaller than the ave-

rage of those measured by Dr. Thumam. AVhere Dr. Thurnam's lowest breadth was

·74, the lowest of the Blandford slculls was -66 ; and where his highest was -87, the

highest of those from Blandford was -81, the average being in each case respectively

·81 and ·73. If the Blandford skulls (nine in number) were added to Dr. Thurnam's

table of twenty-five, the average of the whole thirty-four would be found to be '77.

The distinction between an average of '81 and '77 must strike all observers, and

some might consider the deduction of 4 per cent, as invalidating many of the gene-

ral conclusions arrived at by Dr. Thurnam. If the author were inclined to base

any conclusions on his measurements, he might reverse Dr. Thurnam's " sort of

axiom," and say ''long barrows, long skulls; round barrows, long skulls too, and
Asometimes longer."
                     description of the sliulls would follow at another time, and
--the conclusions he would draw at present were as follows: 1st. That the state of

materials at disposal precluded any generalization as to the prevalence of a brachy-

cephalic type of the skull in the round barrows of the south of England. 2nd. That

a much larger series of skulls from the round, as well as from the long barrows must

be measured before any conclusion could be arrived at as to the cranial modulus.

                  Oil a Human Jaw from the Belgian Bone-Oaves.

                Bi/ C. C. Blake, F.G.S., Curator and Librarian, A.S.L.

   The jaw was discovered in the Trou de la Naulette, near Dinant, Belgium, by Dr.
E. Dupont, acting under the orders of the Belgian Government. It was found in
undisturbed sandy clay (lelun or limonjluviatilc) at a depth of 3| metres (11 ft. 4 ins.),
the clay alternating with stalagmite, and affording evidences of gradual deposition.
The characters which it presented were very different to those exhibited by the jaws
of the white races of the present day, and presented in many points an exaggeration

of the characters of the lowest Australian jaws. In some respects it differed widely

from the human jaws known to anatomists, and afforded great resemblance to the
jaw of tlie yoimg orang (Simia morio). Tlie author gave a careful comparison be-
tween this jaw and certain tj-pical jaws selected from three thousand which he had
examined, and expressed his belief that the jaw was of vast though unascertained
antiquity, and that on the whole the jaw more closely resembled those of the
Sclavonic races than any other jaw, while in some points it presented an analogy

to and exaggeration of the Australian.

    After giving a minute account of the circumstances which led to the investigation
of the Belgian caves by the Anthropological Society in conjunction with Dr.Dupont,
the author entered into considerable details respecting the number and character of
these caves, the various levels and palfeontological horizons at which they were
found, the characteristic fossils of each, the nature of the human remains, and the
geological condirions under which the successive deposits of rolled pebbles, stratified

lehm, or liynonfliiviatile, angular pebbles, and loess were found. He concluded :

   1. That the deposit of stratified " lehm " under stalagmite, in the Trou de la
Naulette, Avas due to the action of slowly operating causes.

   2. That the individual whose jaw was found therein was contemporary with the
elephant and rhinoceros, whose remains are imbedded under like conditions.

   .'5. That some of the characters afforded by the jaw indicate a resemblance to the
jaws of the Sclavonic peoples of Eastern Europe, as especially exemplified by the
Masures and Wends.

   4. That some of the characters of the jaw from tlie Trou de la Naulette indicate
a strong resemblance to, and exaggeration of, the characters afforded by the
melanous races of men, and especially the Australian.

   5. That the above characters afford a distinction between the remains found in the
Trou de la Naulette and the Trou de Frontal, which latter contained the reindeer-
period individuals strongly resembling the C'alniucks of the present day.

                      By Di: J. Hunt, F.S.A., President A.S.L.

   The cranial nieasiirements of the majority of the cases indicated that the form
of the skull in the Norwegians is much rounder than had hitherto been supposed.
The average height of seventy-eight cases of males was 5 feet 8 inches. The hair
in the majority of cases was light hro^-n, and the eyes light blue. The author
contended that there was no such thing as a Norse race, the races inhabiting that
country differing quite as much, if not more, than any inhabiting this country.
The author gave some details of his examination of Swedes and Lapps, and con-

   One of these skulls, that of a Tartar, was exceedingly round, being nearly equal
in breadth and length (977 : 1000). The other was probably that of an Australian
or Negrito, and represented the very extreme of the narrow type of skull, the

cephalic index, or proportion of breadth to length, being one oi' the smallest on

record (629 : lOOOj. Professor Huxley then proceeded to show how far the relative

chai-acters of these skidls might be lost sight of in the ordiuaiy method of measure-

ment. He insisted on the necessity of due care being taken to compare sections of

skulls by super-position of the basi-cranial axes.

On Phenomena of the Hiyher Civilization traceable to a Biidimenfal Origin

                 among Savage Tribes. By Edavard B. Ttlor.

   The value of iuvestigations among savage tribes, as aifordiug explanations of
many opinions and customs prevalent among the higher races, is, in the opinion of

the writer of this paper, only beginnuig to become fully apparent. His object was,

accordingly, to give examples of the province and method of such investigations.

Comparative mythology being one of the best-knoA\Ti fields in which this kind of
research has been carried on, it was shown by examples quoted from Polynesia that
the myth-producing state of mind is there to he studied in actual existence among

modern savages. Not only may the sources of mytholog}- in general be thus ex-

flored, but even myths occurring in an isolated and unintelligible shape among the
 igher races may be shown to be fragments of consistent and intelligible mythic

conceptions still existing among savage tribes. Thus the story of the opening and

shutting rocks of the Symplegades, through which the ship Argo passed by the aid

of Athene, was compared with a New-Zealand myth, in which the Night is con-

ceived as a monstrous creature whose jaws are to be seen opening and shutting on

the evening horizon, and into whose stony mouth the Sun-god Maui enters and
Aperishes.
            similar accoimt to this is found in the mythology of the Karens of

Burniah, where two strata of rocks are described which open and shut, and between

which the sun enters at sunset.

Again, the ceremony of sacrificing "animals, food, clothes, &c., especially to the

souls of the dead, as found among races in a comparatively high state of culture,

was instanced as having come down as an inherited custom from an earlier mental

condition, in which an evident and practical purpose belonged to it. Among the

lower races, the opinion is evidently found that not only men and beasts, but trees

and corn, and even inanimate objects, such as boats and weapons, have each some-

--thing of the nature of a spirit or soul, generally a shadowy resemblance of the

material body. In the offerings made to the dead, not only are wives, slaves, and

animals put to death, that their souls may serve the soul of the deceased in a future

state, but food, clothes, arms, ornaments, &c., are buried, burned, or exposed, that

Whentheii' spiiits may be despatched for his benefit.  such sacrifices are made to

gods, elves, and other spiritual beings, there is considerable evidence of a similar

Aintention of presenting the spirit of the oflering to the being worshiped.  num-

ber of details were brought forward to illustrate this opinion as prevalent among

the lower tribes, and furnishing a satisfactory cause for ceremonies inherited and

practised with a changed meaning by higher races.

In a similar manner the practice of ceremonial fasting was discussed as belonging

originally to the lower races, and handed down with much change of meaning among

more cultured peoples. The subject of magic was then introduced, to show that

the arts of divination and sorcery are, when found among the higher races, mere

relics of practices which are perfectly intelligible undei", and consistently belong to,

the mental condition of the savage. Thus the ordeal of the suspended Bible and

key was compared with such similar practices as that of divining by a suspended

sickle among the Khonds of Orissa. In conclusion, the author spoke of the aid

which may be rendered by the study of lower phases of civilization, in the problem

of separating among civilized men the results of inherited opinion from those of

scientific inquiry.

GEOGEAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY.

Address hy Sir Charles Nicholson, Bart., LL.D., President of the Section.

In opeuiug the business of this Section the President passed in review the

recent acquisitions and speculations in the sciences of Geography and Ethnology.

Geography, he said, in the restricted sense in which it is now used, was chiefly

confined, in its scope, to inquiries as to the leading features of the earth's phy-

sioguoni}', without dealing with those special causes and remoter influences

to which all the gi-eat phenomena of the smface of the globe were referable.

This circumscription, and yet indefiniteness, of aim was not, however, peculiar to

the subject we had to deal with ; it belonged to every other department of himian

Imowledge, the bounds of which are more or less arbitrary, each being but a part

of one great whole, each separated from the other by faint and often invisible lines,

reciprocally melting into each other. The same remark applied to ethnology, the

Aindefiniteness of the name having become a source of difEciilty.  fastidious cri-

ticism might find equal objection to the employment of such terms as ethnography,

zoogTaphy, anthropology, tiology, and others. Many of these terms are sufficient^

elastic not only to include man in all his objective relations (in which anatomy

and physiology^, human as well as comparative, could be embraced), but all the

ethical and moral qualities of his nature would become alike objects of contempla-

tion and research. Facts are, after all, the ultimate aim of all inquirj^, and it was

of little consequence with what special machinery or under what particular desig-

nation they might be gathered together. lu reviewing the recent progress of geo-

graphical research, he alluded to the discovery of the Lake Albert Nyanza by Sir

Samuel Baker, and described the nature of the problem which now remained to be

solved in the geography of this part of Africa. This was the connexion or separa-

tion of the two great inland seas, the Tanganyika and the Albert Nyanza. The

difference of level between them (800 feet) militated against the supposition of their

rmion ; but a doubt existed as to the correctness of the levels given in the case of

the Tangan3dka, the measurement having been made by Burton and Speke with a

single and very imperfect instrument. It was hoped that this point might be

settled by Livingstone, the last news from whom informed us of his arrival at the

moutli of the Rovuma river on the east coast, whence he was about to travel by

land into the interior. Tlie road to the great southern lake, Nyassa, was reported

to be open, and towards it this distinguished and intrepid traveller was, in all proba-

bility, now on his march. In other parts of Africa, the expeditions of the Baron

\'ou der Decken and M. Du Chaillu were mentioned, and he announced to the meet-

ing that the latter traveller would commimicate a paper to the Section embodying

his principal observations on the physical geography and tribes of the new region

he had traversed in his last joiu'ney. In Asia several very important geographical

expeditions had recently been undertaken. Two of these were in connexion with

the great trigonometrical survey of India now in course of execution. To Capt.

Montgomerie, who had been charged with the survey of Cashmere and tlie North-

western Himalayas, we were indebted for one of these Central Asian explorations
the other was undertaken by Mr. W. II. Johnson, a ci^'il assistant in the survey.

This gentleman, ha'\ing carried the survey to the summit of the Karakorimi

Pass, the extreme limit of the territory under British influence, had been there

invited by the chief of Khotan, in Chinese Tartary, to visit his dominions. Mr.

Johnson had boldly undertaken the journey over the as yet vmknown plateau

stretching between the Himalayan and Kueu Lun ranges, and reached Bchi, the

capital of Khosan. The plateau was surveyed, and the position of Ilchi accurately

determined. The vast plains of Central and Western Asia still presented, however,

innumerable features deser\-ing of minute investigation. Amongst these was the

problem of the alleged ancient course of the Oxus into the Caspian Sea, instead of

the Aral, as at present. In South-eastern Asia, a young man, Mr. J. Thomson,

had recently returned from a successful enterprise in Cambodia. Mr. Thomson

had been excited by the account which the late Mr. Mouhot had given of the

splendour of the ruins of ancient temples buried in the tropical forests of that

country, and had resolved, alone and imaided, to visit them, and bring away pho-

tographs and plans of these structures. He had returned, and brought with him a

reiy large series of pictures of great beaut}-, wliicli -R-ould he exhibited to tlie Sec-

tion. The useful laboiu's of the Palestine Exploration Fund were next noticed,

and aftei-wards the minute and accurate siu-ve5s made by Mr. W. Chandless on the

river Purus, in South America, and also the recent expedition into the interior of

Australia imdertaken for the purpose of discovering- remains of the imfortimate

Leichhardt expedition. This search, so munificently supported by several of the

Australian governments and by Pier jNIajestj^ the Queen, had not yet accomplished
Amuch.
                                                       severe drought had impeded the progress of the searching party ; but

they had succeeded in traversing the continent to the banks of the Flinders river,

and examined the trees on which the L's were cut at a spot which was supposed

Nowto be the last halting-place of the lost explorers.                                    that settlements are formed

along the whole east coast of Australia, at short distances from each other, it was

very desirable that exact registers should be established at various points, so as to

determine whether there be any appreciable change in the relative levels of land

and water along the coast, and thus throw light on an interesting question in phy-

sical geography, nameh', the gradual subsidence of the Pacific coasts of Australia.

After noticing the great extent of unknown land, especially in Afiica and New

Guinea, yet remaining to be explored, the President concluded by a review of the

recent great strides made in the science of ethnology since the discovery of stone

Weimplements in the alluvial deposits of St. Acheul.                                      here see the vsddest field

opening for speculation and inquiry. There was a tendency with many ethnolo-

gists in their inquiries to disparage the force of the evidence" afforded by language

as a key to the histoiy and the relationship of the diflerent sections of mankind to

each other. Yet it was impossible to gainsay the absolute correlation that exists

between cei-tain organic forms of speech and some of the great typical divisions of

man. Language, in his opinion, constitutes one of the most permanent and in-

delible tests of race, and no system of ethnology could dispense with tlie aid of

philology. The early xitterances of man have become stamped with a certain degree

of immortality. The Celtic and the Hindoo, the early Persian, the Hellenic and

Latin races betray the community of their origin in the dialectic affinities of the

tongues they speak. On the baulcs of the Tigris and the Euphrates the Arab employs

a language which is the lineal descendant, with few fimdamental changes, of that

spoken by his forefathers in the days of the Hebrew patriarchs ; whilst in the

Semitic names scattered along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and eastern

coast of Africa, we have imerring indications of the progress and settlements of

early Semitic tribes. However plastic and evanescent, under certain local con-

ditions, characteristic forms of speech may be, they still afford, in the history of

man, the key to many of the vicissitudes that liave marked his migi-ations, his con-

quests, his religion, his social polity, the measure of many of the attributes by

which as an individual or a race he is distinguished from his fellow men.

On the Physical Geography of the Eastern Part of the Crimea and the
            Peninsula of Taman. By Prof. Ansteb, F.R.S.

The peninsula of Taman stretches out west beyond the whole range of the

Caucasus                                               but it would  only be  a delta of  the Kuban were  it  not for  the very re-

markable phenomena due to recent volcanic agencj' which it exhibits. Tliese con-

sist of a series of conical hills of mud, ranging for many miles, and connecting the

volcanic district of Tiflis with the Putrid Sea, which constantly emits sulphurous

fumes. The physical condition of this part of Europe is quite exceptional, the
phenomena extending for a distance of 1000 miles. The conical hills of Taman are

about 2-50 feet high, and extend for about thirty miles. There is a constant shift-

ing of the actual points of eruption. The physical geography of the north-eastern

shores of the Black Sea and its dependencies is certainly modified by these curious

phenomena. They produce hills where we should otherwise have a dead flat, and

the land is for tlie most part barren and improfitable. Continuous but very slow

subterranean action along this line is consistent with what we know concerning the

axis of elevation that has for a very long geological period affected the land of the

eastern hemisphere. All that part of the world has been elevated, and pai-ts of it

have been depressed in the later periods. The great plains of Europe and Asia

·were covered by the sea during a time comparatively recent, and the elevation has

                                                                                                                       7*

On the District of Lalce Pangong, in Tibet. Bi/ Capt. H. H. Godwin-Attsten,

       F.G.S., F.R.G.S., Assistant in the Trigonometrical Survey of India.

   The author left Leh to survey the shores of Lake Paugoug in July 1863. North

of the Indus, from its junction with the Dras river, lies a high range of mountains,
which separates the Indus drainage from that of the Shayok or Nubra. The passes

over this range are of gi-eat elevation on the direct road from Leh to the Pangong
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

lake there are two, viz. the Chang La, 17,470 feet, and the Kay La, 18,250 feet
above the sea-level. Having crossed the Chang I^a to the village of Tankse, the

surveying party proceeded along the valley leading to the western extremity of the

lake. The stream which flows down the valley contains but little water. If the
waters of the Pangong (which have now no exit) should reach the altitude they
formerly attained, they would force a passage across this ban-ier.

  A Trigonometrical station of the Indian Survey lies close to the water's edge,

its height being 13,931 feet above the sea-level. The waters are of an intense blue
colour, clear as crystal, but too saline to be drinkable. The author commenced his

march along the southern shores on the 22nd of July. He pursued this route

until he came to a point where the lake contracts to very narrow dimensions : he
then crossed to the northern shore, and reached to within a short distance of Noh,
a Chinese to-vsTi of the province of Rudok, where he was compelled to turn back,
owing to the entreaties of the governor. Beyond, the lake again expands for a
long distance ; it then again narrows, and further east again expands into a fine
sheet of water, the termination of which is unknown. The first, or lower lake, is
40 miles in length, the second 33 miles, and the upper, or easterly portion, at

least 18 miles.
    Captain Godwin-Austen showed that the waters of this remarkable lake must

formerly have been fresh, and must have attained a much greater elevation than
they do at the present time. At present the waters are too salt to nourish a single
molluscous animal. The lower lake does not contain in its waters or on its banks

a vestige of any kind of plant, although formerlj^ there must have been a con-

siderable vegetation to sustain so much animal life. There are signs of the climate
of the region having been formerly much more humid than it is now. The absence
of streams whose waters find an exit in it is a curious feature ; but there are nume-

rous lateral valleys leading up towards the glaciers of the surrounding mountains,
and the bottoms of the valleys near the lalve are composed of beds of silt contain-
ing fossil shells, showing that considerable streams, bringing down detritus from
the mountains, must formerly have flowed down them.

     On the prohahle Lower Course of the Limpopo Kiver, Soutli-east Africa.
                              By Thomas Baines, F.B.G.S.

   Captain Comwallis Harris, who reached the sources of this river in 1836 and
1837, considered it identical with the Manice, or King George Eiver flowing into

Delagoa Bay.
   About this time the great emigration of Dutch-African farmers was going on from

the Cape Colony northward, and though they did not then take possession of the

country now knowni as the Transvaal, many of them penetrated the country of the

Limpopo, and defended themselves desperately against the attJicks of the savage

Matabili.

    In 1850 I visited the eoimtiy of the Transvaal emigrants with Mr. Joseph
Macabe, but their independence not having then been acknowledged by our govern-

ment, they prevented our passing to the interior, and fined my friend for having

published a short itineraiy in a frontier paper.

   From information supplied me by Macabe and several Dutch himters, I drew a
map of the upper Limpopo and its ti-ilnitaries, and a very intelligent German,
named Coqui, who had travelled from Origstadt, in the Transvaal, to Delagoa Bay,
di'ew me a sketch-map of his route, which I added to that I had already made.

lulah or " Olifant's EiYier," pass on the west and north of the to-mi of Origstadt, and

appear to join after passing down theDralvensberg, which, rising near Natal, stretches

parallel with the coast far to the north, and is in fact the sea face of the great in-

terior plateau (which, however, where the Limpopo rises is broken into rugged hills,

instead of showing the dead level in which the Okovango rises near the west coast).

The descent of the Drakensberg occupied an entire day ; and the country between

it and the sea was level, sprinkled with bush and forest, and abounding with game.

lie crossed the Manice, the Omquinie, and the Tamatie, all of which rise in the

Urakensberg, and are not connected with the Limpopo, and which at their junction

form a large sluggish sheet of water, probably the same seen by LouL" Triechard

about twenty years before. Canoes were used by the natives ; and the grea;>,,:lu,, 6-
dealing Chief Mannekos held the country to the east. The Mattol, a broad, sluggish,

marshy river, was crossed above where it falls into the bay, and the waggons halted

on the beach opposite a tongue of sand with about twenty huts, constituting the

village of Lorenzo Marques, which is isolated at high water.

To the east of this was the Manice, with 8 fathoms at its mouth, and 2 at forty

miles up, where the smaller slave schooners went to receive their cargoes. All the

party, except Mr. Coqui, died of fever and fatigue dm-ing the return jom-ney ; the

messengers sent s\'ith  letters perished on the  route                             only one  reached his destina-
                                                                                ;

tion, and two young farmers with fresh oxen came immediately from Origstadt, and

were fortimately in tune to rescue Mr. Coqui.

Mr. Gassiott, who travelled in 1851-52, heard that the Limpopo and Elephant

rivers, after joining, flowed to Inhambane.

   Mr. J. Chapman told me that his partner Edwards, visiting Moselekatse, asked
particularly about the mouth of the I^impopo, and was told that lower down it was

called Saabe, and the direction in which the Matabili pointed corresponds exactly

with the position of Sabia. Chaijman considered the information thus obtained to

be thoroughly trustworthy ; and I may add that when I have tested the Iniowledge

of the natives, even in the dark, I have found some of them point out the direction

of distant places as accurately as I could set them with a pocket compass.
   While I was in the Transvaal I was told of natives to the north who retained

many Mahometan customs, and also of ancient buildings of stone in ruins.
   These are mentioned in the early Portuguese records, which attribute them to

the Queen of Sheba; and about 1854 or 1855 two gentlemen of the Ehenish

Mission Society obtained leave to visit them, but were deterred by the prevalence

of small-pox. The natives described to them pyramids, subterranean galleries,

sphjTixes, and hieroglj-phic inscriptions ; and whatever be the character of these

ruins, there is no doubt but they are woi-thy of careful investigation.

The Zambesi and its prohahle Westernmost Source.

                        Bij Thomas Baines, F.E.G.S.

The Zambesi flowing into the Indian Ocean, in latitude between 18° and 19°

south, drains nearly all that part of Africa lying between the parallels of 10° and

20°. During nearly half its course from the western side of the elevated plateau

of the interior it is a broad siu-face river, in which open reaches navigable for many

miles alternate with extensive swamps so choked with reeds, rising from 10 or 15

feet below the water to an equal height above, that it is dilhcult to force a canoe
through them. Nearly in the centre of the continent (lat. 17° 55' 4" S., long, ap-

proximate 25° 47' E.), where the river is 1900 yards in breadth, a tremendous

chasm, rifted right across it, engulphs the water 400 feet into the earth, and foi-ms

the mighty cataract called the Mosi-o-a-tuuya (smoke-sounding), or Victoria Falls ;

the width" of this chasm is from 75 to 130 yards, and the spray cloud (by approxi-

mate measurement) rises 1200 feet, showing under the tropic sun a rainbow of sm--
Apassiug brilliancy, and keeping ever wet the dense forests on the verge.
                                                                                             little

more than two-thirds from the western end the dark portals of the outlet allow the

water, now compressed into a deep green stream, to escape through a prolongation
of the chasm, winding and redoubling abruptly for many miles, opening into long

navigable reaches, or closing in narrow mountain-gorges.
   The rock seems split from the centre to the sea, a distance of 800 miles, by some

those at Senamanes and Logier Hill, lat. 18° 4' 58" S., long, approx. 26° 38' E., lear-
ino- no doubt that tliej^ were formed by the same cause. Most of the siu-face rocks

seem igneous. Slight earthquakes are common iu Damara Land, and cattle graze in

a supposed extinct volcano in Naniaqua Land.

  It is not my intention to speak now of the northern branches of the Zambesi, but

only of the westernmost, and of the means by which it might be made available for

the exploration of the great river.

   Since 1824 it has been known that the Cunene, or Nom'se River, reached the
Atlantic in lat. 17° S. ; it was supposed to rise iu the centre of the continent, and
the Mukuru Mukovanga was connected with it on the maps of Messrs. Galton and
C. J. Andersson iu 1851 and 185.3. In 1859 Mr. Anderssou reached the Okovango
in 17° 30' S., and long, approx. 19° E. ; it was a noble sti-eam flowing not to the west,
but to the east, and he naturally concluded it must be the Chobe, or that branch of
the Zambesi which is called so. He descended forty miles in canoes to the Chief
Chikongo, and agaiu saw the river a degree above his first point, or lat. 17° 46' S.,
long. 18° E., when, worn out by fever, he was relieved by Mr. Fred. Green.

  A native tracing a map on the ground made the river give otf at Libebe's Island

a smaller stream called the Teoughe, which flowed south-east to Lake Ngami, while
the main one continued east to Sekeletu's Town, at Linyanti. In confirmation of
this, it was said that the Makololo had come up all the way iu canoes from Linyanti
to Libebe's, and had carried off vast herds of cattle and many slaves.

   Mr. Green, Wilson, Lindholra, and others agree in the belief that the Okovango,
rising near the west coast, gives onlj- a small part of its waters to the Teoughe,
while the main stream flows east as one of the principal branches of the Zambesi.

   ]Mr. Green, accompanied by his wife, has at length succeeded in penetrating from
Damara Land to the Cunene, and appears to think that the two rivers have their
sources in the same extensive marshy tableland, the Okovaugo flowing blue and
clear toward the east, while the Cunene, turbid with the soil, glides between over-
hanging trees, or rushes down the Atlantic face of the plateau.

   If the traveller enters the Portuguese coimtry north of the Cunene he may hire

native porters with calico and blue Selampore ; the American yard-wide calico is

much prized, as two widths of a fathom each make a six-foot wrapper ; our o\\ni

stout double width unbleached beats it out of the market, but narrov.- stuff' is of
little value. It is necessary he should sliow himself independent of nati^'e help,

that he may obtain it more readily ; and for this piu'pose the boxes in which he
carries his goods ought to be of uniform size, and taper so that he may put them
together as a skiff! Copper is the best material. Tin rusts, and wood is eaten by

ants. I have used a light frame of reeds covered with two thicknesses of oiled

Oa the Relations of the Ahysshiian Trihutaries of the Nile and the Eqivatorial

            Lakes to the Inundations of Egypt. By Sir S. W. Bakek.

tioiis and river deposit whicli caused the fertility of Egypt. He then gave, in the

form of a brief narrative of his own explorations, fii'st of the Abyssinian tributaries

and then of the lakes at the head of the White Nile, an account of the two sepa-

rate sovn-ces, first, of the inundations and fertilizing mud, and, secondly, of the

perennial flow of water which prevented the Lower Nile from becoming annually

dry when the inundation ceased. His exploration of the Atbara and Blue Nile,

in'l861, was undertaken mainly for the purpose of investigating their relations to

the main stream. The attempts of the ancient Egyptians, and afterwards of

Nero's centurions, to ascend to the sources of the Nile all failed ; the latter

ascended to a point where the White Nile expanded into vast marshes in about

9° N. lat. No other expedition went so far, until the one under St. Arnaud,
despatched by the Viceroy Mebemet Ali, one result of which was the establish-
ment of the trading settlement of Gondokoro, the starting-point of his own expe-
dition to the great Lakes. When he reached the Atbara, from Caii-o, on the 13th

of June 1861, he found the broad and deep bed of the river almost entii-ely dry.

He looked in vain for a river, but not a drop of water flowed from it into the

Nile. Ascending for 180 miles to Gozerajup, he witnessed, on the 23rd of June,

the sudden on-coming of the flood caused by the heavy rainfall of Abyssinia at
the commencement of the wet season. In a few minutes the Atbara was no
longer a desert, but a noble river, 20 feet deep and 500 yards wide. Rulber iip,
at Goorass(5, he reached the country whence the Atbara derives the vast amount
of rich soil which it carries down towards Egypt. The waters were of the con-

sistency of soup. He crossed in succession a number of its tributaries, and foimd
the general trend of the drainage from S.E. to N.W. The Settite, or Taccazzy,

is the principal tributary, and iDrings down almost the entire drainage of Eastern

Abyssinia. It has the same character as the Atbara, with the exception that it

does not become dry in the dry season. After being delayed for many weeks by

the heavy rains, he resumed his "journey, and, descending by the banks of the Blue
Nile, reached Khartum on the 11th of Jime 1862, having been just twehe months
on tbe joui-uey. The fuU significance of the fluvial phenomena which he had

observed on th"is expedition he did not appreciate until he arriyed in the region of

the gTeat lakes near the equator, which he now prepared to visit. On sailing up

tbe ^Vliite Nile he found a complete contrast to the rivers which descend from

Abyssinia. For fortj--five days he struggled through the almost boixndless swamps

through which it flows. He passed the point at which Nero's centurions had

tm-ned back, and the thought came to his mind that what the Romans had failed

to do might perhaps be accomplished by Englishmen. At length tbe elevated land

on which Gondokoro is situated was reached, and from thence, with great diffi-

culty, and after many perils, the narrative of which he had already presented to

the public, he reached the shores of the great lake. The result of his examination

was to prove that the main river of tbe Nile makes its exit in a perennial stream

from the Albert Nyanza, and that the river discovered by Speke, and flowing from

the Victoria Nyanza, was a tributary, discharging its waters into the Albert, and

following the same course as aU the eastern afiluents of the Nile, namely, from

S.E. to N.W. AVith regard to the disputed question of the sources of the Nile,

we ought to speak comparatively, and not look to the idtimate spring wbence the

remotest ti-ibutary of such a lake flowed, but accept this great reservoir as the true

source. He believed geographers were in error in denying that a lake could be a
source. He believed that no geographer in England or on the continent now

refused his assent to the statement that the White Nile flowed out of the Albert
Nyanza. The continuity of the river discovered by Speke and Grant, now called

the Victoria Nile, was also now accepted as a fact. He believed that there was

no connexion between the Tanganyika and the Albert Lake, but that the watershed

of the drainage to the south and north lies between the two. The fullest credence

might be given to the altitudes which he had given, as they were made by

Casella's thennometers, proved at Kew before leaving England, and again proved

Nowafter his return.  the relation of the White Nile to the fertility of Egypt

was this : Egypt woidd be utterly annihilated if it depended for its irrigation on

the Abyssinian rivers. These simply cause the annual inundations, and are full

only three months in the year, corresponding vnth the three months' rainfall in Abys-

sinia, from June to September. The supply of water from tlie gi'eat White Nile
lakes is constant, for they are fed by a ten months' rainfall over the high lands
near the equator. It is this ready flow which prevents Egypt fi-om becoming a
desert, and it is great enough to overcome the gi-cat absorption in the extensive

sandy regions which intervene. When no rain faUs in Abyssiuia, the supply from

the lakes keeps up the flow of the Nile until the rainy season comes round again.

On the other hand, the fertilizing soil which annually overspreads the Delta is due
exclusively to the rich sediment brought down by the Abyssinian tributaries.

Ohservations on the Character of the Negro Tribes of Central Africa.

                          By Sir Samuel Bakee.

In this discourse the author passed in review the various tribes he had visited

on his journey to the region of the Equatorial Lakes of the Nile, and in a series

of sketches illustrated the principle that the character of the tribes depended on

the physical conditions and productions of the locality they inhabited. He said

that true negroes commenced, in ascending fi'om Egypt, at 15° north latitude.

The first tiibes he met with were those inhabiting the region of morasses extend-

ing on each side the White Nile to about 5° N. lat. These were the lowest, both

in corporeal condition and moral character.  Their  forms  were  emaciated and
                                                                                                                       _

filthy ; they went without clothing, had no religion, and their cookery consisted

in grinding the bones of animals between stones to make soup of No iron ore

was found in this region, and consequently they were deprived of the great

civihzing advantages attendant on the art of working this metal. Other tribes

farther south who practise this art have been helped by it to attain a considerable

degree of culture. The iron weapons of the Latooka tribe are of exquisite work-

manship, and the Unyoro people have even invented a kind of hoe, which Euro-

peans might imitate to their advantage. All the tribes who are thus favoured live

m the elevated lands near the equator, and the iron-dust which supplies them with

the metal is found in the mountains. The presence of the Tsetse fly has a remark-

able indirect influence on the civilization of the tribes. This fly is most capricious

--in its distribution present in one area of the country and absent from another.
Wherever it is present no cattle can be kept ; consequently the natives are

deprived of this civilizing influence, for the possession of cattle elevates the

character of a tribe in various ways ; it promotes industry, ensures a supply of

nourishing food, and, by the necessity of defending the herds against all comers,

developes a warlike spirit and organization. The Unyoro people, under the in-

fluence of these local advantages, have become the most advanced nation in

Central Africa ; they are well clothed and clean in their persons, courteous and

dignified in demeanour, and susceptible of enlarged political organization. The

speaker pointed out, in a clear manner, the way in which the tribes of Central

Africa may be brought imder the influence of European civilization and into an

intercourse" which would be beneficial both to us and to them. He showed that

formerly a considerable trade existed between the east coast and the Equatorial

Lakes, and that the line of trade extended south and north along their shores.

Ptolemy was indebted for his knowledge of these lakes to the traders of his time.

A trade with Europe might be developed along this line ; but before any bene-

ficial intercourse can be commenced the internal slave-trade must be extinguished.

He ga^·e his view of the negro character in general, and stated, as his conviction,

that it was improveable only vmder the wise and considerate guidance of the white

man. Coumierce, properly conducted, would idtimately civilize the negroes of

these rich countries of Central Africa.

          On the Lahe Kura of Arabian Geographers and Cartographers,

                  By Charles T. Beigs, Ph.D., F.S.A., F.E.G.S.

   In Lelewel's ' Geographie du Moyen Age/ there is a map, said to be taken from
an Arabian work a.d. 883, in which a lake, named Kura-Ka^ar, giving rise to the

Nile, is found situated on the equator. This has been adduced as a proof that the
Arabians 1000 years ago possessed a more accurate knowledge of the upper waters

of the Nile than geographers of the present century previously to the recent disco-

veries. The author argued that Lake Kura does not represent the equatorial ^Yaters
discovered by Burton, Speke, and Eaker, hut the lakes or marshes in about 9°

north latitude, at the junction of the Bahr el Ghazal with the Bnhr el Abyad, known
as Lakes No, Nu, or Berlcet el Ghazal. Ancient geographers placed much too far south

all the lakes connected with the iS'ile of which they had heard, their error being
caused by an incorrect computation of itineraries or estimate of distances. Lake
Kura, or No, was described by the author in 1840, in his paper on " The Nile and

its Tributaries," printed in the ' Journal of the Boyal Geographical Society,' vol.

xvii. p. 67. It is also laid do-mi in the map of the basin of the Nile (1859) accom-
panying his work, ' The Sources of the Nile,' published in 1860.

On the PossihiVdy of Turning tlie Waters of the Nile into the Bed Sea.

                 Bij Cii.iELES T. Beke, Ph.D., F.S.A., F.B.G.8.

   It too often happens that a tradition which is founded on fact is so misimder-
stood and misrepresented by commentators, as to assume a character totally at
variance with the truth, and thus eventually to be regarded as a mere fable. The

separation of the original history from the commentary would at once prove its
fabulous character to have been derived from the latter ; but in many cases so in-
timately have the two become incorporated that it is difficult, if not impossible, to
distinguish rightly between them.

The author referred to his work ' Origines Biblicse ' as showing how extensively

an erroneous construction was put on points of Biblical geography and history by

early_ translators and commentators                                                                                                                                                                and he now adduced a remarkable instance of
                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the like process with respect to the tradition that the rulers of Ethiopia possessed,

and had at times exercised, the power to prevent the waters of the Nile from flowing
down into Egypt and fertilizing its lands.

   The Egyptian historian, George Elmacin, in the l-Sth century, records that the
Nile having failed in the time of Michael, Patriarch of Alexandria (a.T). 1092-95), he
was sent byMustansir Billah, Khalif of Egyi^t, on a mission to the King of Habesh,
who at his instance caused the dam that had been constructed to be removed, so

that in one night the Nile rose three cubits, and the fields of Egypt were in conse-
quence watered and sown.

In confirmation of this is the statement of the Emperor John Cantacuzene, in the

15th century. And further, in the beginning of the following centm-y, Albu-

querque, "\lceroy of India, applied to Emanuel, King of Portugal, for labom-ers to

be sent from the Island of Madeira, who were practised in digging canals, in order

thatthey might turn the course of the Nile towards the Eed Sea. That in the

opinion of the native Abessinians they always possessed the power to do so, is

evidenced by the representations made'to the learned Job Ludolf in the 17th cen-

tury by his Abessiniau friend, Abba Gregorius.
AH these authorities point to the low countries lying to the north of Abessinia

as the general position of the scene of operations.' In opposition to them is the

circumstantial statement of the traveller Bruce, tliat about the year 1200, Lalibala,

King of Abessinia, intersected and carried into the Indian Ocean two large rivers,

which have ever since flowed that way, and that, had he lived, he would have

carried a level to Lake Zuwai, in the south of Shoa, where many rivers empty

themselves. Dr. Beke adduced conclusive proofs of the enth'e gi-oundlessness of

this statement                                                                     which, however, is made so circumstantially and authoritatively as
                                                                                ;

to have caused the two secondary ideas of King Lalibala and Lake Zuwai to be

blended with the primary one, so that subsequent travellers and writers have treated

the subjectas if they were integral portions of the original tradition.

   Considering the tradition in its original form, unincumbered by any notions re-
specting King Lalibala and Lake Zuwai, Dr. Beke pointed out that the dominions

of the early sovereigns of Ethiopia extended in a northerly direction, probably as
far as 18° N. lat., where they bordered on the territories of the Sultans of Egypt
and he showed that it was to the ruler of this low and level country that the patriarch
Michael was sent.

   The river flowing through the dominions of this sovereign was neither the main
stream of the Nile nor yet its principal iibesshoiau branch/the Astapus, Blue Hiver,

or Abai ; but^ ou tlie contrary, the Takkazye or Setit, of -which the lower portion is
the Atbara or Astaboras. This is established by the Ethiopian rersion of the
Scriptiu-eSj and by the Adulitic inscription of Cosnias Indicopleustes, in which

--the two names are synouynioiis ; so that the Atbara or Takkazye was ^/ieriyer, the

Nile of the tradition.

   From the description given of this river by several modern travellers, especially
M. Linant, it appears that the Atbara is called Bahr el Aswad, or Black River,
from the quantity of black earth brought dowai by it during the rains, which is
so gi'eat as to discolour the main stream of the Nile ; it is this branch which is the

best source of irrigation, as it contributes most of the slime that manures the lands

in Egypt ; that it might easily be tm'ned into the Red Sea near Suwakia ; and that,
in fact, the remains of a bed or canal, already traced by human hands, exist from the
Atbara to the Red Sea.

   The paper of which the foregoing is an abstract was written by Dr. Beke for the
Meeting of the British Association at Ipswich, in 1851. But, reflecting on the
importance of the subject, he decided on first suljmitting it to the late Viscount

Palmerston, by whom it was not returned till tliat Meeting was over ; and the

author had not cared to avail himself of any other opportiinit}' until now, when he
possessed the means of establishing the correctness of his former opinions.

   In 1856, when preparing for the press his work, ' The Sources of the Nile,'
published in 1800, Dr. Beke identified the position of the city of Ptolemais Theron,
founded on the western coast of the Red Sea in the reign of JPtolemy Philadelphus,
the identification having been made by the simple comparison of two descriptions
of the spot gi\-en at an interval of 2000 years, the one by the Greek geogTapher
Artemidorus, and the other by Captains Moresby and Elwon, of the Indian Navy.

This identification led to the appreciation of the truth of the further statement of

Artemidorus, tliat, in the neighbom'hood of Ptolemais, a branch of the Astaboras

discharged itself into the Red Sea, which branch had its source in a lake, and emp-
tied part of its waters here, but the larger portion went to the Nile.

   This " branch of the Astaboras " Dr. Beke identified with the Khor el Gash, the
lower course of the river Mareb of Abessinia, whose waters in the rainy season
spread themselves over the district of Taka, which then resembles a lake, and thence
discharge themselves by two outlets, the one going towards the Atbara, and the
other towards the Red Sea, near Suwakin.

   That this is the case as regards the latter outlet is now established as a fact by
the investigations of Dr. Schweinfiirth, who in April 18(35 ti'avelled from Suwakin to

Taka, and states that the Gash is a tributary to, or synonymous with, the Wady

Langeb, which is laid down by him as running northwards to Tokar, near Suwakin,
where Dr. Beke had approximatively laid do-wn this " branch of the Astaboras " on

the authority of Artemidorus.

   To show how the waters of the Atbara or Astaboras might be turned into the
Khorel Gash, and so made to flow towards the Red Sea instead of dov.Ti the main
stream of the Nile to Egypt, the author cited M. Ferdinand Weme's narrati^-e of
an attempt made in 1840 by Ahmed Pasha, governor of Sennar, to turn the waters
of the Gash into the Atbara ; and though the attempt was frustrated by the natives,

the particulars recorded prove the practicability of the undertaking. But if the

Gash may be turned into the Atbara by means of a mere dam and canal, the con-

verse must in like manner be practicable ; that is to say, the waters of the Atbara
might, by similar means, be tiu-ned into the Gash, and so made to run towards the

Red Sea, to which the fall is 1200 feet or more.
   Thus the main stream of the Nile being deprived of so great a bulk of its waters,

and especially of that portion of them which contains the fertilizing principle, the

dire results recorded in history could not fail to ensue.

   In conclusion, the author adverted to the not improbable rise of a great Etlii-
opian empire, having the power to subject Eg^^t by the possession of the country
through which the Ethiopian Nile flows, even more readily than by the force of
arms ; and he pointed out the important relation which the solution of this geo-
graphical question of the diverting of the waters of this river bears, not merely to
the material prosperity, but also to the political and even the social existence of a
coimtiy, which plays so important a part both in ancient and modern history, and

On the Physical Geography and Tribes of Western Equatorial Africa.
                             By P. B. Dtj Chailltj.

The author commenced by giving- a general description of the region of Western

Equatorial Africa, which he traversed during his last journey in 1864-65. There was

a remarkable absence in the forests he explored of the species of animals which are so

Hecharacteristic of Africa.  found neither lion, rhinoceros, zebra, girafle, ostrich,

eland, or gazelle. On the other hand, several peculiar species of apes were found, and

it was the central home of the gorilla. The scarcity of birds and of animal life

generally was also remarkable. The highest temperatm-e obseiTed in the interior

was 98° Fahr., the lowest 6.3°. In July the heat was never gi-eater than 72°. The

hottest months were February to April, in which the rains were heaviest : as much

as 73 inches were once measm-ed by him as having fallen within twenty-fom- hours.

In the interior there was no distinct dry season, as on the coast. The author

never, except on two occasions, saw the sky entirely free from cloud ; and the

cloudiness of the heavens increased the further he marched towards the east.

Whilst making astronomical observations at night the sky would very often

become suddenly covered by a coat of gi-ey vapour, always coming from the^ south-

east, and lasting an horn- or two, but renewed more than once during the night.

The distribution of the native ti'ibes oftered some interesting peculiarities. For

instance, two tribes speaking the same language are sometimes separated by a

third ti-ibe speaking a totally dift'erent language. The state of political disinte-

gi-ation is complete. No tribe is imited imder one chief, but is divided into many

clans, each having its own chief ; and in many cases each little -tillage has its

independent chief. The chiefs have not the power of life and death over their

subjects, as in tlie tribes of Eastern Afi-ica described by Speke, Grant, and Baker.

Their ride is mild and patriarchal. The population everywhere was scanty, and

the distinctness of the tribes he believed to have been kept up by their not having

come iu contact in their migrations, but, owing to the wide extent of rmoccupied

temtoiy, settled dov^^l without knowing of the existence of neighbours. It is only

on the river-banks that they have come into contact, as all the tribes press to-

wards the rivers. There are no cannibals south of the equator. The curious hairy

dwarfs live scattered in small hordes amongst other tribes. He found a few

words in the native languages almost identical with words in the East African

languages. It was an interesting inquirj', what existed in the thousand miles of

imexplored coimtiy lying between the author's furthest point and the shores of tlie
WeAlbert Nyanza ?
                   might conclude, however, that it was a country of con-

siderable elevation, and probably wooded, varied, and picturesque ; for Baker saw

towards the west a range of momitains, and the country fi-om the west coast

becomes gi-adually higher towards the east. Considering also the humidity of

the climate, and the small size of the rivers which find their way into the sea it

might be concluded that there was a great drainage of waters towards some

inland sea, or that there were other great lakes on the equator west of Albert

Nyanza.

wild fruits, seeds, and roots, the species necessarily varying with climate. Some

 races of man are still confined to these primitive articles. The most important
 of these food-jDlants are those which can be made into bread, such as the cereals.
 With the exception of rice, not one of the cereals can be traced with imdoubted
 certainty, nor can we state their parent countries : this must be received as evidence
 of the vast antiquity of their cultivation. Wheat and barley must have been well
 Imown to the Egyjitians before the earliest of the pyramids was built, for a people

 feeding on roots and fruits could not have possessed the power or the skill indis-
 pensable to the construction of those stupendous monuments. With regard to
 legumes, several of the cidtivated kinds can be traced to their wild originals. Lan-
 guage often throws light on the birthplace and migi-ation of cultivated plants, and
 the result of this line of investigation in regard to the cereals has been to show
that they originated at many separate points. The influence of the various food-

plants on the character and civilization of the races of man was dilated upon by
the author, who concluded that no people ever attained a tolerable degi-ee of
cultivation without the possession of the higher cerealia. Had the food of the

Britons some 2000 years ago been confined to the potato, Julius Ctesar would
unquestionably have foimd our ancestoi-s far greater barbai'ians than he describes
them to have been.

                              By John Ckawftjed, F.E.S.

   The first attempts of man towards making a visible record of ideas must have
consisted of pictorial representations of natural objects. The imperfect and un-

tractable nature of sjmbolic writing must, however, have early presented itself to
most nations, and accordingly two people onlj', the Egyptians and Chinese, ap-

peared to have persevered in using it. Among the more precocious races of man

gifted with a fair share of intellectual capacity, vocal or phonetic -^Titing seems to
have been invented as soon as such a state of society had been reached as allowed

of the existence of a class of men that had leisure for meditation. There conse-

quently exists hardly a nation of Asia, from the Mediterranean to the western
confines of China, that has not invented phonetic WTiting and been immemorially in
possession of alphabets of more or less perfection in proportion to their degrees of

civilization.

   Mr. Dimn began by remarking that there was a fascination about the subject

--of prehistoric times and prehistoric man about the revolutions of our globe as

revealed to us by geological investigation, and of the generations of mankind by
arch.'cological researches, and that the very obscurity of the subject whets our zeal
in its investigation, lie asked what could be more fascinating than the wonders

of geology as we ponder over the revolutions which the earth has undergone

search after the evidences of the first appearance of life upon its sm-face, and
recognize in its successive and changing phases the varying animal forms, rising

--higher and still higher in the complexity of their structure up to the advent of

man himself to us the crowning theme of all these wonders. But when did he
first appear ? Was he pliocene, miocene, or still more ancient ? All that we can
assume is that in the fullness of time, when the earth was fitted for his reception
by the fiat of the Almighty, man made his appearance. Then -s^-as brought into
existence a being in whom that subtle force which we call miixtsvsxs the grand and
distinguished attribute, raising him so immeasurably in the scale of being above
the whole brute creation. He dwelt on the antiquity of man, remarking that the
men of the Drift shared the possession of the forest-clad valleys and ])lains of
Europe -ndth the mammoth, the cave bear, and the woolly-haired rhinoceros, when

the British isles were alike imited to one another and to the continent of Europe
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

as provmg the high antiquity of man, but as tracing back the sacred rights of
bmial, and also the still more important belief in a future state of existence, to

times long' anterior to history and tradition. To tlie cave men of those days and
to tlie rude tribes on tlie valley of the Somme, with their rude flint implements,
he found a parallel among existing savages and the Esquimaux tribes of the
present day. Arcliteology, he said, was the link which connect* prehistoric man

--with history ;" and, as Sir J. Lubbock had so well remarked, "they were too

studied in their works houses for the living, tombs for the dead, fortifications

for defence, temples for worship, implements for use, and ornaments for decora-

tion." In their modes of sepulchre, their tumuli, cromlechs, dolmens, and

cistvaens, we had unmistakeable evidence of differences of race and of phases of

civilization, for these ancient tumuli did not belong to one period nor to one race
of man. In the tumuli of Denmark, during the stone and bronze ages, the di-

stinctive characteristics were so marked and striking as to point to men of the
bronze period as being a new race in a much higher state of civilization, and who

had exterminated the previous inhabitants. Their very general practice of crema-
tion had deprived us of one important source of e^-idence, in the shape of the skull,

as to their facial type. Human paleontology, however, had made plain to us that

in the pre-Celtic times there existed both a brachycephalic and a dolichocephalic

race, as primitive peoples, in Europe. He next passed to the consideration of
primeval man. After comparing civilized with savage man, our own condition
with that of those to whom the illuminating rays of civilization had never reached,
or among whom thej' had become extinguished, and after having pointed out, in

their respective bony crania, distinctive differences impressed and stamped upon

them, as vmmistakeable and indisputable evidence of elevation and degradation of

type, he discussed the important questions as to whether in time these types were
convertible, and, if so, which was primordial.

            On a Proposed Ethnological Congress at Calcutta.

                                                                              By Sir Walter Elliott, /sT. 0.5.

  A congress of a novel kind has recently been proposed at Calcutta by Dr. Fayrer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

namely, an assemblage of living examples of all the races of men of the old world

for ethnological study ; to take place on the occasion of the Industrial Exhibition
to be held in 1869-70. The proposition has been warmly taken up by the Asiatic

Society of Bengal. At the same time the Council of the Society suggested a

modified scheme confined to the subordinate governments of Bengal, for an ethno-

logical congress of all the tribes found in Bengal, Nipal, Burma, the Andaman and

Nicobar Islands                                                               to form part  of the  Local  Agricultural Exhibition  of 1867-68.
                                                                           ;

The author proposed in his paper a third scheme, intermediate between these two,

namely, an assemblage of individuals of all the races found in^British India. This

would be more practicable than the larger scheme, and more useful than the smaller.

To show the large field for ethnological comparison in this assemblage, the existing

population was described as consisting of three principal divisions. 1. As de-

scended from aboriginal races and the servile classes ; 2. from the Tamil or Dra-

vidian races ; 3. from Hindi immigrants, whose language has been modified and
perfected by Sanscrit. The first are represented by the small communities in-

habiting mountain-ranges and dense forests, and speaking the most ancient

dialects deemed of Tui-anian origin. The second contains the more civilized Tamil

peoples. The servile classes have naturally adopted the modern or polished Tamil,

but that it is foreign to them is shown by their inability to pronoimce words

containing a remarkable Tamil letter, equally a Sibboleth to Europeans, and which

Ais generally rendered by an /, or sometimes by an r.                                                      striking characteristic of

all the aboriginal races is their demonolatry, in the sense of the Greek word.

AThey honom- the spirits of their ancestors as beneficent beings.                                                                   festival

observed annually or at longer intervals, in honour of the village goddess, to

propitiate her protection from loss of crops or epidemic disease, affords a curious

illustration of the religious belief of this class. The officiating priests all belong to

the servile class ; and the ceremonies consist of oflerings of cattle and saturnalia.
The author referred to the Dhangars as remarkable for their love of truth, and

their similarity in this respect to the Gonds of Central India and the Southals of

the North.

Notes on Eastern Persia and Western BeloocMstan. By Col. F. J. Goldsmid,

   This memoir gave the principal results of journeys into little-known countries

undertaken by the author (iu 1864-G6) in surveying- the line for the Indian tele-
graph. The 'most important portion of his travels was that between Sabristan,
S.E. of Kirman, and Chou, on the coast of Beloochistan via Bampur and the Pass
of Fauoch. The author found that the city of Kirman lies very much more to the
eastward and less to the southward of Yezd than it is supposed. In the march
from Regan to Bampur Colonel Goldsmid passed along a track different from that
marked on Pottinger's map ; and between Bampur and the sea the road lay entirely

through new country. He believed that the laying of telegraph wires through

Mekran and the upper regions of Beloochistan would be productive of good results

--iu our relations with those little-known countries results quite as important as

rapid communication between England and the East.

--APalestine Exploeation Fund.  Report on the TopograpMcal Results of

the first Expedition sent out hy that Association, toivards tuhich, at the last

Meeting, a grant of £100 had been made hy the General Committee. By

G. Geove, Hon. Secretary to the Fund.

The expedition was placed under the charge of Capt. C. "W. Wilson, R.E., with

whom was associated Lieut. Anderson, R.E., and Corporal Phillips as photo-

grapher. The party were well supplied with chronometers and other instruments,
and their instructions were to make accurate and systematic observations between

Damascus and Jerusalem. They were constantly occupied from December 1865 to

May 1866. The present Report embraced the topographical investigations only,

v\'hich, however, were very important. Forty-nine separate places, the positions of

which were before unknown, have been accurately fixed, both in longitude and lati-

tude, detailed reconnaissance sketches for maps have been made, on a large scale,

of the whole backbone of the country from north to south, and of several outlying

districts, such as the basin of the Lake of Galilee, the district of Samaria, and the

valleys between Jerusalem and the sea. Passages were read from reports by Capt.

Wilson and Mr. Anderson, detailing the method pursued in obtaining the observa-
tions, and testifying how carefully and systematically their work was done. An

an-angement had been made with IMr. Murray by which these maps would very
Ashortly be made public, under the superintendence of Mr. Grove himself
                                                                         very

substantial step has been taken by this Association towards putting the map of the

Holy Land right, and one which should encourage its supporters to still further

efforts. The Report comprised a recommendation by Capt. Wilson that stations

should be established and supplied with instruments for regular meteorological

observations. Competent persons resident in the country had promised their

services, and thus a great want would be supplied, as no observations on climate

have been taken, except at Jerusalem and Damascus. Mr. Grove announced the

intention of the Association to persevere until every square mile in Palestine has

been properly and accurately surveyed and mapped ; tiU every mound of ruins has

been examined and sifted ;' the name of every village ascertained, recorded, and

compared with the lists in the Bible ; till all "the ancient roads have been traced;

the geoloo-y made out ; the natural history and botany fully known. In further-

ance of these intentions, a second expedition will shortly be sent out to excavate in

detail at Capernaum, Cana, Samaria, Nazareth, and Jerusalem. Another party (of

v>hom it was hoped Mr. Prestwich, F.G.S., would be chief) will attack the geology
Aand the natural history, so ably hegim by the Rev. II. B. Tristram.
                                                                      work on the

modern Syrians is in preparation by Mr.' Rogers, of Damascus, under the encourage-
ment of the Palestine Fund, as a companion to Lane's ' Modern Egyptians.' The

names of villages, &c., are being collected by a competent resident Arabic scholar,

and five meteorological stations are to be appointed, to which instruments will be

furnished under the sanction of the Kew Committee. In conclusion, Mr. Grove

drew the attention of the Meeting to the importance of these researches as cor-

roborating the statements of the Bible, Avliich purported to be mainly a record of

facts, and of facts about certain definite localities. Hitherto the book has been

tested by internal e-\idence chiefly ; the time has arrived when other tests must be

members of the British Association to support the investigation.

       On some New Facts in Celtic EthnoJogi/. By Heney H. Hoavokth.

   The author endeavoured to show that the so-called Turanian race extended to
Britain. Starting with the facts collected by Lhuyd, he showed, by means of the
comparison of vocabularies and gi-ammatical forms, that a large element in Celtic,
whose relations have been previously unassigned, is to be referred to an Iberic source.
This element was found to be much more marked in Ii-ish than in Welsh, and
explained the differentia of the former tongue. The Gascon dialects were held to
be links connecting Breton with the corrupted Basque of the French provinces
and this cormexion was sho-mi to extend to Cornish. Where Welsh differs from

the other Celtic tongues, it was shown to be chiefly in an approximation to Low

(Termau forms. To the Pictish Lowlanders were assigned the Welsh pecidiarities
of Scotch Gaelic ; to the Irish invaders of Anglesea and the Cornish Dorderers of
the Severn, the dialectic idiosyncracies of North and South Wales. Cornish was
held to show a mixtm-e of types, in which the Breton predominated ; while aber-
rant forms connect it with Irish. These facts were considered to support the
traditional connexion of Ireland with Spain, or perhaps with Aquitania, by proving

Irish to be a Celt-Iberic tongue. Breton, corrupted by Belgic contact, was held to

--represent the language of the pm'ely Celtic area of Cresar a contact exemplified in

Britain, where tlie Cornish or Lloegi-ian Celtic is found bordering on Welsh. The

--dual elements of Welsh point to its being the language of the German and Celtic

Marches or fi'ontiers a condition fulfilled by identifying the Welsh with the Belgse

of Caesar. Lastly, the presence of this Iberic element in early British ethnology

was considered by the author to explain much that is obscure in its oldest archae-
olog}', and to throw considerable light on the traditions of Western Europe.

      Explorations from Leh, in Cashmere, to Khotan, in Chinese Tartary.

                                   By W. H. Johnson.

   The author is a ci^ol assistant in the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, and
the exploration which he described originated in an invitation which he received
when at Leh from the Khan Badsha of Khotan to visit him at Ilchi, his capital.
The author accepted the inA'itation, and caiTying his instruments with him, was
enabled to make a good general survey of a ti-act of country which was previously
almost entirely unknown. His memoir was of considerable length and fuU of
interesting details. Between the Karakorum and the Kiuni Lun ranges the author

crossed a series of extensive tablelands from 16,700 to 17,.300 feet above the sea-

level, which are so free from ruggedness that a horse may be galloped over them
anywhere. One of the plains bears traces of having been the bed of a large lake,

and at present contains two lakes covering areas of sixteen and sixty square miles

respectively. He struck the Karakash river (of Tartary) in lat. .35° 53' and long.

79° 2-3', at a point where it was 15,500 feet above the sea-level. It took him six-
teen days to march from the Karakash to Ilchi. The whole country of Khotan is
an immense plain, sloping downward to Aksu (fifteen long marches north of Ilchi),
and watered by numerous streams, which all faU into the Aj-gol river, and thence
into the Lob Nur Lake. Six miles north-east of Ilchi begins the great desert of
Gobi, with its shifting sands that move along in vast billows, overpowering evei-y-

thing. It is said to have once buried 360 towns in 24 horn's. Fine dust from the
desert was seen by the author to fill the air so densely that he was obliged to use
a candle at midday to read large print, although the air was perfectly' cahu at the
time. The country is very fertile, and equal to Cashmere in this respect. Ilchi is
a great manufacturing city. The chief articles are silks, felts, carpets, and coarse

cotton cloths. Its population is about 40,000, and that of the whole country of
Khotan about 250,000. Ilchi lies 4329 feet above the Sea-level. The people of

Khotan had recently shaken ofl' the Chinese yoke. The Khan had an anny of
6000 infantry and 5000 cavalry. The author soon learned that his object in in-

T-iting a British official to his capital was to solicit the alliance of the Englisli ; and

lie ran some danger of being detained as a hostage. He experienced great difficulty,

owino- to the jealousy of the Khan, in taking observations of the sun and pole-star
for determining tlie latitude of Ilchi. After a stay of sixteen days, he returned by

way of Zilgia and the Karakash river to Cashmere.

                   On Priority in Discovery of the Madeira Group.
               By E. H. Majok, F.S.A., F.R.G.S., Hon.Sec.B.G.S.

   The authors howed, first, that the Portuguese historian De Barros exceeded the
authority of the ancient chronicler Azurara, when he stated that tlie respective

names of the islands were given by the Portuguese in 1419-20, thereby diiiusiug
the erroneous belief that the gi'oup was first discovered by the Portuguese. The

inaccuracy was shown by an extract from a map dated 1351 in the Lam-entian
Library at Florence, in which the group is laid down with its present names, ex-

cepting Madeira, there called Legname, of which Madeira is simply a translation.
Secondly, the truth of the romantic, accidental discovery hj the Englishman,
Machin, in the fourteenth century, was establislied by a combination of arguments,
in which the author availed himself of an extract from a Portuguese MS. at
Munich, never yet priaited, and earlier by half a century than the earliest printed

account. Thirdly, he presented arguments based on the evidence of the map of
1-351, in combination with other historical fiicts, to show that the group was dis-

covered by Genoese in the service of Portugal, in the first half of the fourteenth

century.

   Politically the question was without importance, inasmuch as not only could
Portugal claim these islands on the ground of the earlier actual discovery, but the
accidental rediscovery nearly a century later had led to the first colonization and fer-
tilization ; and it would be as futile to dispute such a claim as it would be to nega-
tive that of the English to the colonization of Australia on the gi'ound of those
early authenticated discoveries iu that vast island by the Portuguese, which it had
previously been Mr. Major's good fortune historically to establish. But for those

who care for historj' for its own sake, this paper brought into a focus a large
amount of curious and interesting matter derived from MS. or little-known sources.
By bringing into correlation a variety of points hitherto unobserved, the author
was enabled to prove the reality of the former existence of a MS. which has been

missing for centuries, but which contained not only the description l)y an eye-
witness of the rediscovery of the Madeira group in 1419, but also the declaration
of the circumstances under which it had been already discovered in the previous

century. It is to be hoped that this precious MS., by Francisco Alcaforado, may

not long remain a desideratum.

                    On the Kaffirs of Natal By Dr. R. J. Mann,

   The number of black people in Natal, subjects of the Queen, is about 170,000,
The most powerfid tribe in South Africa at the beginning of the present century
was the Zulus, who became greatly augmented, under their chief Chaka, about the
yefir 1820. This gi-eat chief pm-sued a career of conquest until, from a very small
clan, the Zulus acquu-ed a territory 500 miles in length, the conquered tribes being
absorbed or driven into the interior wilderness. The settlement of the colony by
the English put an end to the tide of conquest, and a large number of Kaffirs placed
themselves under British protection. The Natal Kaffirs are scattered throughout
the colony, living in huts and kraals, having their chiefs, but subject to British
authority. In the main, they are savages still. The question arises, what is to
become of them ? It is clear they show no signs of melting away before the pale-
faces, as many other savage tribes have done ; for by constant accessions from
without they have increased in number twentyfold in thirty years. They nre gi-a-
dually resolving themselves into a labouring class in the colonj'. They take rea-
dily to labour in sugar-plantations ; they are also capital managers of oxen, and
make very usefid uidoor servants. It is difficult, however, to retain them long in
one place. Some labourers work for six months, and then retire with their wages
to their kraals ; but they have acquired a taste for earning money, and almost
always return to service. Wherever there is a white settlement near, to furnish

tlieiu with a marlvct, or a sugar-Biill, missionaiy stations soon get to bo suri'ouudul
by an orderly and prosperous Kaffir community, grov\-iug up with great promise of

steady advance. At one place there is a school for teaching English, to which the
Kaffirs voluntarily contribute £70 a year; two of the black men here possess pro-
perty amounting to £2000, and many own a few hundreds each. Many other facts
were cited by the author, all tending to encom-age hopes of the ultiniate civiliza-
tion of the Kaffirs, which he maintained ought to precede attempts to christianize

them.

    On the Physical Geography and Climate of Natal. By Dr. E. J. Mann.

    Natal has a sea-coast of 150 miles, and is separated from the drier region of the
 interior by a range of moimtains, or rather the ledge of the interior tableland,
 which lies at a distance of from 100 to 140 miles from the coast. The average
 summit of the ledge is from 5000 to 6000 feet high, isolated pealis rising to between
 7000 and 9500 feet. The climate is sulitropical, modiiied and softened by the
 eftects of its peculiar configuration. In area Natal is equal to about one-third of

 England. From the frontier mountain ledge a subordinate ridge stretches across

 the middle of the colony, and from this again numerous short spurs branch ofl",
 between which flow the streams, about fifty in number, which drain through the

 land to the sea. As the mountains rapidly increase in height towards the frontier

 ridge, the general gradient of the land, from the sea upwards, is one in seventy ; as
 a natural consequence the colony possesses no navigable river, and the streams are

liable to sudden floods, which impede travelling at certain seasons. Much of tlie

 excellence of the climate, however, depends on this gradual elevation. In the cen-
tral region there is a perennial rainfall, and the valleys of the coasts are fllled with
plantations of sugar, coffee, arrowi-oot, oranges, pine-apples, and bananas, whilst
the hills are covered with cattle, horses, sheep, and grain-crops. The northern part

 of the colony lies in the basin of one considerable river. In the southern parts the
mouths of the numerous rivers are closed by sandbanks, which are broken through

in the seasons of flood, and closed up again at the end of the rainfall. The general
surface of the land is composed of an endless succession of hills and valleys, the

uplands being bare pasture, the sides clothed witli e-sergreen trees, and the rapid
rivers often leap from ledges two or three hundred feet in height. The prevailing-
winds are from the Indian Ocean, and are heavily laden with moisture, which is

discharged over the land daily in the hot season, the cool moist air rushing in as soon
as the air over the land has been heated in the morning by the almost vertical sun.
In Maritzburg, 2000 feet high and forty miles from the sea, there are thunderstorms

nearly every third day during the six months' hot season. Summer heat in Natal

is therefore remarkablj' tempered by the cloud-screen and the frequent showers.
Almost every day in summer the sky gets cloudy soon after noon ; and the mean
of the month never rises to 72° Fahr. The mean temperature for the six summer
months is 09^-5, the night temperature rarely descends to 52^. In the ^\inter

months the sun shines with much less intensity upon the land, and the monsoon

air-currents are therefore less violent. Comparatively unbroken sunshine, however,
reigns at this season, and the temperature rises to between 70° and 80° in the day,
descending on rare occasions in the niglit to below the freezing-point ; the mean

winter temperature is 59°-9. In summer the vicissitude of temperature lies between
day and day ; in winter between day and night. The mean of the annual rainfall at
Maritzburg, for eight years, gives 30'11 inches. The author exhibited a series of
tables and diagrams in illustration of the meteorological phenomena of the country
as observed by himself dming an eight j'ears' residence.

       On the Alf2:>py Mud Bank. By C. R. Markham, F.B.G.S.

   On the south-western coast of the Indian peninsula there exists a system of back-

waters which forms a continuous natural line of communication from Trivenderum
to the Madras Railway, with the exception of one barrier of land. At no very

distant date the sea appears to have washed the base of the ghauts ; alhr^ial de-
posits gradually encroached upon the sea, checked by the waves of the monsoon,

and eventually a belt of land was formed, leaving within a line of backwaters, and

becoming densely covered -with cocoa-nut groves. This belt at one point forms the

Aleppy nnid banlc ; and the whole roadstead near it has a remarkably soft, muddy
bottom. It is curious that this muddy bottom moves up and do-wTi the coast for
about three miles, the cycle of movement occupying a period of several years.
During tlie height of the monsoon the waters of the backwater are four feet higher

than those of the ocean, and an enormous hydraulic pressure must thus be caused.
In the same season, at low water, a series of mud-volcanoes are observed to form
on the beach, which eventually bm-st and disgorge quantities of vegetable matter
mixed with mud. Boring instruments on the belt of land are found to penetrate
through alluvial deposit into a great depth of moving soft mud. It appears, there-
fore, that there is a subterranean communication between the backwater and the
sea, and that the tremendous pressure firom the backwater, when it is higher than

the sea, forces an immense mass of mud by the subterranean passage into the road-

stead. Various schemes had been proposed for cutting through the Wurkally
barrier, and thus completing the backwater communication ; the plan of Mr. Barton
was thought the most feasible, and will necessitate a cutting of fifty feet, and two

tunnels.

     On the Eeported Discovery of the Remains of LeichharcU in Australia.

                       Bij Sir K. I. MuECHisoN, Bart.,K.C.B., F.E.S.

   Sir Roderick annomiced that on the previous day he had received from Dr. F.

Mueller, of Melbourne, the news that the Leichhardt Search Expedition, now in
the interior of Australia, had discovered traces of the lost explorer. The news had

been sent by Dr. Mueller in great haste, the departure of the mail having been
delayed a short time to admit of his forwarding the despatch, and no details of the
nature of the discovery were given. Sir Roderick gave a sketch of the movements
of the Leichhardt Search Expedition down to the time when the latest authentic
information had been received. It had met with great losses in horses and materiel
at Cooper's Creek ; but the leader, Mr. Duncan M'Intyre, had succeeded in pushing
his way across to tlie banks of the Flinders river, which -flows into the Gulf of

Carpentaria.

               On North and South Arabia. By W. Gr. Palgbave.

   The author described the division of Arabia into two distinct regions, marked
by peculiarities in physical conditions and modifications in the character of their
inhabitants. The more northerly division included the highlands of Nejed, the
seat of Wahabee domination, the more southerly the district of Oman. The
population of the two regions is about equal. The two diA'isions are typified
by theii" national colours, white for the northern and red for the southern ; and

--wherever Arabs are found, two factions exist, who adopt these colours as their

sj'nibols, -('iolent factional feeling often existing amongst people who have lost all

Ijuowledge of the original cause of difierence. The northern Arabs were a fine,
intelligent, courteous race, with a cast of features like the typical Ishmaelite. In
the southern Arabs the type was difterent, the skin was darker, the features were
no longer Semii'c, but more nearly resembling the Coptic. The institutions of the
southern people were more progressive than those of the northern. The language
in the north was the pure Arabic of books ; in the south there were great difl'er-
 ences both in woi'ds and turns of expression, these pecviliarities not being acci-
dental, but due to an original difierence in language. It was the opinion of the
most learned German philologists that tlie peculiarities in the idiom of soxitheru
Arabia indicated a connexion vnt\\ Ethiopia, and must have originated on the east
coast of Africa. The Wahabee country was surrounded by deserts, and could never
be of practical importance to the English nation. It is difterent with Oman, which
 is a rich and beautiful region, similar to the district of Bombay, and will soon
 become much more important to us, politically and commerciall}', than it is at

present.

and 30° of east longitude, now known as the Transvaal Republic, is tlie country

of the emigrant Boers, who, disgusted with British rule and the emancipation of
their slaves, left the Cape Colony, and after founding Pieter Maritzberg in Natal,
again tracked further north and colonized this fertile region, then for the most part

in the possession of Moselikatse, an emigrant Zulu chief, who now lives beyond the
Limpopo. The Boers are physically a powerful race, but mentally and morally are in
a state of retrogression, showing no improvement for a period of many j^ears, and are

as backward in ci-s-ilization as any white existing race. Various tribes of Betchuana
race live on the west and north-west of the Boer territory, on the east and north-

east the Amatonga, and Zulu Kaffirs on the south, the Boers of the Free State, who
are little in advance of their brethren, across' the river. The towns are Potchefst-

rooni, Pretoria, Philadelphia, Rustenberg, and Schoemandal. Oryxstadt, foi-merly
populous, is abandoned as imhealthy.

   The country next the Vaal resembles the Free State, in the absence of timber
and the conformation of the hills, which resemble the Sussex Downs. The Dra-
kensberg, forming up to this the watershed of the eastern and western river di-
stricts, here ceases in that capacity. The Limpopo and Oliphants rivers rising
west of the Drakensberg from hills which run east to west, after flowing several
miles to the north, through the INIagaliesberg, &c. ranges, turn east, and fall into
the sea near Delagoa Bay and Inhambane.

   The Magaliesberg is the favourite district of the Transvaal, having a healthy
climate, and being well supplied with wood and water.

   The Soutpansberg district is much warmer, lying partly in the tropic ; its inha-
bitants forsake farming for elephant hunting, which is here the staple pursuit.
Schoemaudel, the town of this district, is inhabited by hunters and traders only.

    Nearly all the large wild animals of South Africa are found in the Transvaal,
which is the best-watered and most fruitful disti-ict in South Africa, not excepting

Natal.

   Ivory, horns, and leather are the staples of trade ; but wheat and the vine grow
well in some districts, and it can become a wine-producing country. Delagoa Bay
is the geographical port of the Transvaal, but the roads are unmade, and the bay
is so imhealthy that the Boers dislike it ; the Tsetze also interferes in some districts
with transport. The Transvaal abounds in mineral wealth. Gold is found in
great beds of quartz, which crop out through the whole of the middle districts
lead-ore is in abundance, and eventually this little district, with a more entei-prising
population, will exercise no small influence on the destiny of South Africa.

On the Various Theories of Man's Past and Present Condition. ByZ, Eeddie,

                          On the Voguls. By Dr. H. Eonat,

   The Voguls are a tribe of Northern Asia, residing on the river Vogul. They call
themselves " Mancsis." The name of Vogid was given to them by the Szirjan
merchants, who, in their mercantile pursuits beyond the Ural Moimtaius, called
those living on the river Vogul, " Voguls," and those on the river Ob (in the
Mancsi language "Asz "), Osztjaks. The Voguls are of a dark complexion, small

in statiu-e, closely allied to the I^inish type. Their principal occupations are fishing,

hunting, and bird-catching. Agricultm-e is known only towards the south, in the
vicinity of Pelim and Loszva. Their food is very simple, air-dried or smoked fish
and meat ; they scarcely ever use salt ; bread is only known in the south. They

are good-natured, cheerful, talkative, but extremely superstitious, idle, and indolent.

Women are considered inferior beings. The girl, when of age, is given in marriage

by her father to the highest bidder in reindeer. Polygamy is allowed, but at pre-
sent very rarely met with. Their dwellings are built of the bark of trees or solid
wood, of which a few are called a village, scarcely ever more than seven. They
acknowledge a supreme heavenly being, called " I^fumi-Tarom " (High-time), the
rider of the earth, to whom, according to their belief, it would be useless to pray,
for he never departs from his rule, and grants happiness to men as they deserve it
consequently it will be of no avail to pray to him. However, they have their

family idols, to whom they pray in necessity, whose assistance they implore with

                                                                                                   8*

gifts aud sacrifices. It is only of late years (since 1848) tliat Christianity has made
any progress, thougli it is more than a century since Greek priests were sent to

them. For the dead they have great reverence, and keep generally a figm'e of the
departed in their houses for nearly a j-ear. Their language belongs to the " Altai
group," of which the principal are the Fin, Turkish, Mongol, and Mandsu, and

amongst these it belongs to " Ugor subgroup," to which may be referred the

Szirjiin, Votjak, Mordviu, Hungarian, Osztjak, and Vogul (Mansci). In 1844, on
a territory of 3780 square miles, their number amounted to about 6.342. Under the

new rule they are rapidly decreasing in number ; and we are greatly indebted to
Anthony Reguly, a Hungarian traveller, who, since 1843, spent several years

amongst the Voguls, collecting from their oral tradition their sacred legends and

ancient history preserved only in songs.

                       On the North-east Province of Madafjascar.

                         By Dr. Eyan, Bishop of Mauritius.

   The author narrated a visit which he had recently made to the province of
Vohimarina in north-east Madagascar, and gave numerous details of the harbours,
towns, productions, native tribes, and government of the various districts. The
province on the whole is raoimtainous, but possesses, along the courses of its nimie-
rons rivers, large and fertile valleys. The Betsimsaraka tribe was considered superior
to the dominant Hovas in many respects. They keep their houses clean and neat.
Many of them have beautifully fair countenances and a European cast of features.

A Visit to the ruined Teminlcs of Camhodia. B)/ J. Thomson.

The author, in the month of January 18G6, arrived at Bangkok, the capit.al ot

Siam, with the purpose of visiting the ruined temples of Cambodia, making plans

and photogTaphing them. He proceeded easterly from that place through Sunsep

and Kanap to Kabin, the position of which town he determined by astronomical

observation to be in N. lat. 13° 5G', aud E. long. 101° 58' 1.5". He arrived at the

vast temple of Ongou on the 16th of February. The biuldings form a rectangle

1100 X 1080 yards, surrovmded by a ditch 250 varus wide. From its gxeat extent,

the bmlding appears to have been the work of generations ; but from its perfect

sj'mmetry and unity, the product of a single genius, ^vith the resources of a vast

empire at his disposal. The road to it is by a path through a luxuriant tropical

Aforest.  causewaj' conducts to a gallery or outer entrance 200 yards long.

Ascending the worn steps of this, a colossal statue of a lion, half buried in the

sand, guarded the entrance. The western gallery is supported by massive square

pillars. The pillared galleries of the temple rise tier above tier, terminating in a

great tower. The galleries have all sculptm'ed stone roofs ; the staircases, colon-

nades, and corridors are also all of sculptured stone, and the courts paved. The

ancient city of Ongou Thom, situated a little north of the temple, is of superior

antiquity to the temple, and exhibits more grotesque sculptures. But the architec-

ture of the temple is more classical, the pillars have all finely sculptured capitals

and bases. There is the same advance shown in the bas-relief of the two ruins

the chief of these are nearly 100 j&rds long, filled with figures of wan-iors, ele-

phants, horses, and chariots. The inscriptions, copied by the author, are of three

periods, the first of which are not now intelligible, but the last can be read by any

Cambodian priest ; these last, however, ha^e no reference to the origin of the ruins.

The present inhabitants have no tradition even of their origin, but believe they

were buUt by supernatural hands in a single night. In the courts are the remains

of reservoirs, which, as they lie at a great elevation above the suiTounding countrj^,

imply that the ancient Cambodians possessed a knowledge of hydraulics. The
stone of whicli the ruins are built must have been brought from the Lynchie
mountains, forty miles distant. The great lake of Cambodia, Tale-saj), lying a few
miles south of Ongou, ofl:ers the rare phenomenon of a large backwater to a river

it is filled only when the river Mekong is in flood. An outlet from the lake unites

with the Mekong, a few miles distant from the lake itself, aud the waters of the

river flow baclcwards up this channel to fill the lalce, the natm-al current being
driven back. The depth of the Tale-sap is thus raised from foui- feet to forty-fom*

not liberated until the end of the rainy season. The author exhibited to the Section
a large series of photographic views, copies of inscriptions, and ground-plans.

                    Notes on the Physical Geocjrapliij of tlie Lotver Indus.

                              By Col. Tkemenheeke, B.E.

   The immense plain of Siud presents a remarlvable peculiarity throughout-- 1, in

the entire absence of channels for natural drainage ; 2, in its almost uniform slope,
both towards the sea and away from the river banks ; .3, in its mineral character.

The slope of the valley in a direct line to the sea, 330 miles, is 9-3 inches per mile,
and the lateral slopes on either side of the river are in many parts quite as much.
The liver, in fact, passes along a ridge. For 540 miles the surface slope of the Indus
during the inundation is 57 inches per mile. The soil consists entirely of a very
fine siliceous deposit mixed with argillaceous matter and mica ; not a grain of sand
is to be foimd as large as a pin's head. The solid matter in the water of the Indus
during its immdation amoimts to 43'G parts in 10,000 by weight. The mean dis-
charge of water being 200,000 cubic feet, and the mean' solid matter 25 in 10,000,

it results that 21 7 J millions of cubic yards of solid matter are carried annually to the
sea, which is suiRcient to cover seventy square miles of area with deposit one yard

in thickness. The author investigated the various old channels of the river, and
came to the conclusion that the stream has gi-adually worked to the westward. lie

also concluded that the larger the body of water in rivers flowing through such
plains, and the less the surface-slope of the plain, the more direct will be the course

of the liver ; and, on the contrary, the sharpness of the bends of a large river will

indicate the existence of a considerable slope. The longer, therefore, a ri^er becomes
by extending its delta into the sea, the gxeater tendency will there be to assume a
more direct course. The author also carefully examined the delta of the Indus, and

gave in detail the result of his observations.

  On the Progress of the Pusso- American TeleyrapJi Expedition via Behring^s

                         Straits. By F. Whymper, F.P.G.S.

   The author, after exploring parts of Vancouver's Island, attached himself, in the
capacity of artist, to the expedition which proceeded last year from San Francisco
to survey the line for the proposed Siberian and American telegraph. There exists

already a line to New Westminster, Fraser Eiver, from which point the new line

is to commence. Five vessels started with the exploring parties in July 1805 ; one
of them proceeded to Plover Bay, in Siberia, whilst the others were to meet at

Sitka, in JRussian-America. The vessel in which Mr. Whimper sailed proceeded

through the Aleutian Archipelago to Norton Sound, in Behring Sea, and thence
crossed to the river Anadyr, in Siljeria. .\ small screw steamer, brought on board

one of the larger vessels, took an important section of the party, under Major
Kennicott, to explore the Kirchpak River. The average depth of Behring's Straits
between 64° and 60° N. lat. did not exceed 20 fathoms. The author returned to
San Francisco in November, the fleet having deposited the various exploring par-
ties in their winter quarters on the coasts of America and Siberia. The preparations
for 1806 were on a more extended scale ; and by the end of the year it was supposed
that about 1500 miles of the line would be laid northward of Fraser lUver.

            ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address ly Professor James E. Thoeold Eogees, M.A., President of the Section.

The Presidents of the various Sections among which the scientific labours of the

British Association are distributed have, beyond the general conduct of their
several departments, the obvious and important duty of dwelling in their introduc-
toi-y address on the progress made during the past year in the special science with
which they are for the time being identified. Nor is there ever wanting abundant

material on wliicli this congratulatory comment may be made, as scientific research

accumulates its observations, and arranges its inferences. The ^lathematiciau, the

Chemist, the Physiologist, the Geologist, the Mechanician, can point with satis-

faction to the annual gTOwth of their special sciences, can compare the demonstra-

tions of the present with the hjiaotheses of the past, and can confidentlj' claim the

acknowledged progress which research and method have achieved.

The case, however, is somewhat diflerent vnth the Section over which I have the

Wehonour to preside.  can but rarely claim that we have made any new dis-

coveries in the subject which occupies our attention, for we deal '(\-ith that which

has been constantly' matter of anxious thought long Jiefore the beginnings of other

inductive sciences. Our science is as old as civilization, coeval with the fir.?t

Wespecidation on the canons of practical and political philosophy.                                    cannot claim

to discover new elements, new forces, new economies, for we are interpreting that

one force which effects the cooperation of man in social life ; a force whose esti-

mate has occupied the keenest minds since men began the habit of consecutive

Wereflection.  have before us the phenomena of society, and we know that there

is a standard, always ideal, but ever the legitimate, the chief object and aim of

social practice ; we know that there are hindrances to the attainment of such a

standard, and in a general way that such a result may be best approximated by

the wise balance of liberty and restriction. But the limits of the former and the

endm'ance of the latier are matters of keen and constant debate, of doubt wliicli

may well be honest, even when it seems to be interested. V\^e are invariably re-

minded that by the practice of men our demonstrations are forced to appear in the

shape of problems, that our theories are often acknowledged to be indisputable,

but are perpetually liable to dispute. No one I presume doubted, even when our

system of trade was protective, that free exchange was the natm-al and normal

state, however much it was conceived that artificial or political exigencies needed
its modification. When our fiscal system, as we know now, was one mass of foUy

and injustice, the financiers of the age certainly imagined that they were patriotic,

never doubted that they were intelligent, always affirmed that they wished to deal

honestly with all interests.

But what our science lacks in novelty, what it needs in practical conclusiveness,

it makes up in importance and interest. AVe do not, when we insist on the theo-

retical exactness of our principles, afl'ect to deny that they are, perhaps must be,

modified by certain overruling exigencies, and that the science and philosophy of

social life will never exactly square with the habits of mankind. With many

persons, the economist will always be a dreamer, the author of an impossible

optimism, the dweller in a new Atlantis, in an impracticable Utopia, in a Cloud-

cuckoo town of unnatural alliances. Assailing, as he constantly does, the policy

of restriction, he is attacking a fortress of undoubted strength. Striving as he

constantly does against a social habit, a political maxim, a fiscal expedient, a com-

mercial trick, he is struggling to undermine a position which becomes untenable

at a time its defenders are reduced to acknowledge that its defence is impolitic,

though it has hitherto been   thought  to  be  judicious                                              mischievous, though  it has
                                                                                                   ;

seamed to be salutary ; destructi'se, though it has been believed to be expedient

interested, when it was averred to be national. He is constantly labouring to

refute men's hasty sympathies by appealing to their deliberate reason.

  We cannot then dispute the disadvantage under which economic science labour?,

when compared mth other efforts of research, whose course encounters no ob-

stacle because it clashes with no interest, whose conclusions are accepted gi-aci-

ously because they provoke no prejudice and awaken no fear. But we can, on the

other hand, claim no small victory in this domain of human thought, and con-

gratulate ourselves on a progi-ess, not the less real because it has been resisted,

disputed, and won, after many laborious st''uggles.

In the first place, then, no science occupies a more eminent position, because none

deal with such exalted purposes. Political economy is pei'petuallly contrasting

general with special interests, lu'ging men from naiTow ends to the broadest aims,

teaching the interdependence of men, of races, of nations. The W^isdom which

has parcelled the earth out for various products, all necessary towards the develop-

ment of the best civilization, instructs men also in the fact that as men cannot

labour for themselves alone, so nations must needs depend on otlier nations, and be

knit together by the strong bands of reciprocal benefit, if they would work out

their own highest good. Political Economy, as Adam Smith fully recognized,

does not discuss the prosperity of a single people, but proposes as its object the

discovery of the wealth of nations. It has been the privilege of the economist to

disprove the fallacy that one people's gain is another people's loss, a delusion which
was not too gross to possess the mind of Bacon, as it was the secret of the foreign
policy pursued by this country for many centuries, as it has been the chief cause
bj' which national rivalries and antipathies have been developed and sustained.

   In the next place, the spheres of the economist and the statesman are rapidly
becoming one. Domestic legislation is increasingly interpreted on economical

grounds, assailed because at variance with economical axioms, supported because
Ain accordance with economical demonstrations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                         statesman would iu these daj'S

be at once bold and foolish who aflected to disdain economical consequences

Nowor defy economical laws.  at least we find all parties, the representatives of

all interests, appealing to the cougTuity of their policy with the truths of Political
Economy. The abolition of the excise duty on malt is argued from one set of
economical principles, its retention is vindicated on another. The regulation of

the currency is defended on groimds which involved, on the part of those who

uphold our existing system, the recognition of certain causes whose regidarity was

supposed to partake of the strictness of physical science                                                                                                                                                                                                            while  those who  dispute

the wisdom of om* monetary laws disparage the universality of the cause, and

point to other principles which they assert the legislature has ignorantly violated.

But, in effect, every com-se of public policy, eveiy law or custom which deals

with or affects the material interests of the community, is in course of being re-
viewed by the light of economic science. The incidence of taxation, direct or

indirect; the tenure of land; the right of settling land; the relations of labour to

capital, with the artificial machinery employed to diminish or increase the share
which each of these contributories demands from the gross product ; the functions

of credit, and the power which it possesses over currency, or couAersely, the

influence of currency on credit ; the interference of government with labour,

particularly the labour of the young                                                                                                                                                                     and a host of other public questions,                                         are not

or cannot hereafter be treated from a sentimental or a politic point of view, but

must be discussed in their economical bearings, in their influence on the general

well-being of society.

Again, the same influences are being brought to bear on the relations subsisting

between this and foreign Governments. The ancient habits and instincts of

political diplomacy are silently or uoisilj^ wearing out or passing away, and a new

diplomacy of commerce, assuming for a time the guise of formal treaties, is oc-

cupying no small part of the ground once assigned to labours which were called

into activity by distrust, and effected their pm-pose by intrigue. And if, indeed,

impolicy and injustice are legitimately open to remonstrance, and there be any

defence for interfering, either by advice or threats, with the affairs of foreign

nations, when their action is relative solely to those topics which once formed

the material for diplomatic correspondence ; such a course of procedure is just as

legitimate when a Government is wilfully crippling its own resources, and inflict-

ing wrongs upon the nation whose general interests it is bomid to maintain, by a

restrictive and minatory commercial policy.

  Among the various questions of great economical importance which have been

before the public during the past year, there are two on which, with your per-
mission, I will make a few brief comments. These are the contingency, at no

remote date, of a considerable exhaustion of certain mineral resources in this

country and the altered position which England might consequently assume, and

the present condition of what is familiarly called the money market. The first of

these questions raises a variety of issues, the magnitude of which cannot be over-

estimated ; the second is a crisis unparalleled for its severity and its duration.

  Attention has been called by an economist, who has exhibited great research

and original thought on a number of subjects, to the relations subsisting between

the consimiption of British coal and its future supply. Geologists, it appears, are

well-nigh agreed as to the extent of the deposits, and as to the depth within
120 REPORT--1866.

wliicli, according to our present and in all probability our future appliances, such

deposits can be rendered available. It is farther admitted that the source of

motive-power is heat, and that coal is, for practical pui-poses, the sole material

from which heat can be derived. Should the consumption of coal in this country,

it is argued, progress at the same rate as now, the supph' will be exhausted at no
distant date, and with such an exhaustion there must ensue a cessation of most of
those industries which have hitherto characterized us. So energetically was this

alami seconded by one of our most distinguished economists, that a financial

operation was proposed, with a view to palliate some of the evils which might

be likely to ensue from such an event.

It cannot of course be denied that a limited quantitj' of any natural product, the

demand for which is incessant, must ultimately be exhausted. But the real ques-
tion, it seems, is, when will the scarcity -price operate on consumption, and when

it does so operate, in what will the saving be etfected ? That the scarcity-price

is not yet operative is manifest from the increase in the aggregate consumption

of coal, and from the increased production  of metals                                                for  it is  in  the                                smelting  of
                                                                                                  ;

metals that the largest consumption occurs. Nor can it be doubted that when the

saving becomes necessary from enhanced price the economy will be exercised in

this direction. But the "total value of aU metals produced in this country in the

year 18G4 (the largest in value, though not the largest in anioimt, yet recorded)

was worth little niore than 16 millions, a great but not a dominant quantity in the

annual aggregate of British industry. It would seem, then, that the alarm, if it

be not premature, is certainly excessive ; that there will be abundant warnings of
future scarcity, and necessaiy economies in dealing with the residue, long before

that residue verges to exhaustion.

   Themateri al wealth of this country, it may be observed, greatly as it is related

to its manufactures, one of the raw materials of which is locally limited, is for

more fidly derived from its geographical position, and thereupon its trade, the

advantages and aids of which are permanent. Occupying, as Great Britain does,

the most central position between the New and the Old "\Vorld, it is and will be,

so long as its people are industrious and resolute, the highway and the mart of

nations. Its commerce, by virtue of causes which cannot be reft from it, increases

at a far more rapid rate "than its manufactiu-es ; and if that commerce remain

imfettered and uushaclded there seems no limit to the width which its markets

may attain.

It would not become me, in an introductory addi-ess, to enter on the vexed ques-

tion of the cun-ency, and in particular to criticise the Act of 184-i. Opinions ai'e,

as is well known, broadly and sharply di-s ided on that famous measure. The Act,

myas readers are aware, is restrictive. It interferes peremptorily, on giounds, as

was asserted bv the late Sir liobert Peel, of the highest public expediency, with

the freedom of issuing paper credit. It secures the convertibility of a paper cur-

rency, not by the circumstances which a bank might be supposed to interpret for

itself, by guarding on its own account on the possible risk of seeing its paper dis-
honoured, but by the rigid yet not imbroken rule of a proportional issue. With

some thinkers this system is  lauded  as  one  of  consummate wisdom                                                                                    with  others
                                                                                                                                                     ;

it is censured as one of needless and mischievous interference with that part of the

machineiy of trade which would be self-adjusting without it and which is not really

supported by it. As a rule, indeed, when one set of persons, confessedly competent

to form a judgment, decide that a law dealing with commerce is wise and usefid,

and another set of persons equally competent declare that it is foolish and mi.s-

chievous, it will generally be found, in course of time, that the latter are in the right.

Such was the case with the Colonial Svstem, with the Corn Laws, with the Naviga-

tion Laws, with the Sinking Fund, with the laws regulating or prohibiting the ex-

portation of Coin, with Bounties, with Export Duties, with the Favoured Nation

clause in Commercial Treaties.

It has been slated, but not I think proved, that the cause of the present crisis

has been excessive, or over-trading. As far, however, as can yet be discovered, it
seems to be due far more to imprudent action on the part of certain banks, who

have made advances at long dates, or on securities not readily convertible. The

distrust which has followed on the failure of some among these banks has led to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

view to nialiiny their position inipregualjle. But this retention of notes, as it has
limited tlie amount of accommodation, has indirectly raised the rate of discoimt

and thus it follows that as lon;^- as the rate is hig-h the notes are hoarded, and as

long as the notes are hoarded the rate will be high. It is wortli the attention of

the Section to consider whether the contingency of such a dead-lock as the present

may not, concurrently with the restrictions of the Act of 1844, or independently of

them, be rendered more frequently imminent by the increased inducements in the

shape of high rates of interests offered to the public on deposit accounts.

At all events, the present state of aftiiirs is without parallel. Once (in 1857) the

rate of discount touched 9 per cent., just before the relaxation of the Act. It has

stood on the present occasion for some weeks at 10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and miless  British  commerce

--nine years ago, the eilect must ultimately be ruinous to the trader must speedily

be followed by a great rise in general prices^ and in all probability by a glut of

capital at no distant date.

   The discussion, however, of purely economical questions forms in effect the
least, but generally the most exciting, among the topics laid annually before this

Section. Its largest business lies, and will it may be hoped, constantly lie, in the

direction of statistical inquiry.

The statistics published by the various Government Departments are annually

of increasing fulness, of larger importance, of improved method. Their utility

cannot be overrated, their value to those who are led to familiarize themselves

with these certain and unprejudiced witnesses is of the highest character.

   During the past year two papers have been issued, both I believe fi-om the Poor

Law Board, or at least compiled by means of its machiueiy, which have had a

considerable public interest. I allude to the returns of Live-Stock, and to the

Statistics of the Borough Franchises. The first of these is, we imderstand, to be

continued, and to be accompanied by general Agricultural Statistics.

   The origin, as we all know too well, of these returns of live-stock is to be found

in the instance of the Cattle Murrain. The preventive measures employed to

check the disease, and the scheme of compensation accorded to those whose" cattle

were sacrificed in order to sa^e those of other cattle owners, almost necessitated a

rough cattle census. Such a census has been taken in other countries for some

time past, and, in common with other agricultural statistics, has been regularly

supplied for Ireland. It is to be hoped that the prejudice which agriculturists

have entertained against the supply of these and similar returns will speedily be

obliterated. It may, I presume, be taken for granted that no Administration wishes

to use these facts for any other purpose than that of general information as to

the domestic resources of the nation at large.

The value of agricultural statistics does not lie simph^ in the aid which they may

afford in indicating the probable course of the market.'and in saving it from need-
less fluctuations, but in suggesting what is the probable annual deficiency in supply

Many j^ears have passed since this country gi-ew enough food for its inhabitants.
That its prosperity may be uninterrupted, it will be necessary that it should rely

increasingly on foreign produce. That its people should be well fed, it is necessary

that every facility should be given for the growth and importation of live-stock and

meat.

The Table of statistics giving information of the amount of cattle, sheep, and

pigs, on the 5th of March, 1866, on the presumption that the returns are accurate,

is singularly instructive. In drawing any inference on this subject, we should

treat Great Britain separately from Ireland, as the importation of cattle from this

part of the United Kingdom is more difficult than it would be from Belgium or
France, and nearly as difficult as from Denmark and the Elbe. In round numbers,

the population of Great Britain is about 24 millions.

In one particular onlj^, that of sheep, is Great Britain on a general level with

other countries. There is nearly a sheep to every head of population. But^of

homed cattle there is only one to about every five                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       of pigs only one to every nine.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

Were the amotmt of horned cattle in France proportionate only to Great Britain,

France would have a little more than six millions ; in fact it has rather more than

fourteen millions. The same" may be said of Austria. In many of the German
States the proportion is higher still. In Deniuark the cattle are not very much

less numerous than the popidauou. In the United States there is rather more than

one head to every two of population.
   With pigs, as I have stated, Great Britain is very scantily provided. In France

and Prussia the pigs are one to seven in Austria one to four and a half. Taking
                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the whole of Europe the proportion is one to six. In the United States there are

more pigs than population.

   Had the returns supplied us with information as to poidtry, the deficiency would

have been still more striking. In the year 1865 this countrj^ imported more than

400 millions of eggs, if the hundred of eggs be taken, as it has been from the

earliest time, at 120.

 --I need hardly inform my hearers of the fundamental canon of prices that when

the supply of any neccssarj' of life falls short of the demand, the price rises in a

proportion which I may perhaps venture on calling geometrical ; that is, the quan-

tity available for sale is worth more, increasing according to the deficiency, than

the noimal or natural supply would be. The statistics of the cattle retiu'us supply
the key towards interpreting the high price of meat ; aud we may be sure that the

price would be higher than it actually is, were it not for those improvements in

stock-keeping by which cattle become more available for consimiption at earlier

--dates improvements which are yearly developed.

   This deficiency is not gi-eatly supplemented by importation. Small as the stock
of cattle is, the annual importations do not amount to more than one-twentieth

of the ordinary stock, while that of sheep is, as a ride, but one-fiftieth. During

the present year even these quantities must have imdergone a serious diminution.

Nor is the import of meat large. The most important item is that of bacon. But

even here the largest estimate will not give more than the eqidvalent of 300,000

pigs. The beef seems to be about equal to the supply of 50,000 oxen.
   It is a matter of regret that no facts have been collected by which we might

compare the present and the past supply of live stock in Great Britain It is of

course always dangerous to trust to impressions,  or to  memoiy                                           but  I  cannot  but
                                                                                                       ;

be convinced that there has been a general and considerable diminution in the

amount of live-stock in Great Britain for some years past. It is now comparatively

seldom that agricultural laboiu-ers are able to keep pigs ; it is still more rare that

they breed poultry. The enormous importation of eggs suggests tliat the fowls
kept in Great Britain are comparatively scanty. But it is probable that the main-

tenance of insect-eating birds is an important provision in agi-icultural economy,

and that when we find fault with the destruction of small birds, we forget that our
practice is dispensiug with a still more important means for checking the ravages

of insects, as well as for supplying that great deficiency in live-stock which seems
to characterize our domestic economy. It is possible, too, that the abandonment

of much pasture in the northern part of the Island to deer forests and grouse moors

has considerably lessened stocks of lean cattle and mountain sheep.
   It is a little dangerous to offer any comment on the second important contribu-

tion to the statistical infonnation of the present year. Under existing circum-
stances we must, if we allude to the Electoral statistics, remember the caution of

the Roman poet :

                                                                " Incedis ]}er igues

    Suppositos cineri dolose."

It will be clear, however, that \aluable as the Blue Book is to which I am ad-

vertino-, and singiilar as were some of the obvious inferences from its contents, the

facts are imperfect and the tabulation still more so. One woidd have desired to
see, alono- with the figm-es declaring the value of lands and tenements as estimated
for income-tax, other similar charges, such as the proportion of assessed taxes, and
the amount of the poor rate. It would have beeu well also had the distribution
of the 25 per cent, of " working classes " among the several constituencies beeu
distinctly indicated. Thus, for instance, the persons designated bj' this name
amount to nearly all the constituency at Birkenhe.ad; at not much less in
Nottingham ; whereas at Birmingham they are taken at less than a fifth, at Brad-
ford considerably iwder a tenth. Is it possible that the expression ' ' working classes "

has been variously interpreted by those who transmitted their reports to the Poor
Law Board ? But as the retui-ns published in this parliamentary paper are of con-
siderable interest, it may be confidently expected that the facts will be tabulated

in a fuller manner hereafter, as they are keenly criticised at present.
   The progress of statistical inquiry is not due to the direct action of the Govern-

ment only, great and important as have been the aids which the various public

departments have conferred on this branch of social learning. Among the scien-
tific bodies who hold sittings in the metropolis and issue reports of their meetings

and their labours, none is more industrious, more impartial, and more useful, than

the Statistical Society of London. Its Journal, now in the thirty-second year of

its existence, contains a mass of exceedingly important monographs and well-di-
gested summaries, and is continually enriched by laborious and thoughtful com-
munications. During the past year, this Journal has published more than its
customary amount of statistical facts which illustrate the social condition of various
European nations. There is a special value in information such as that given by

my distinguished friend Dr. Farr on the mortality of children, for there cannot,

I conceive, be a better gauge of the moral, the social, and the material progress of

a people than a low death-rate among children. The labours of Mr. Walton and
INLr. Hyde Clarke have thrown light, the former on the condition of France, a
country which asserts a great social and intellectual place, and certainly occupies
a commanding political influence ; the latter on that of Turkey, the lowest and
apparently the most iiTeclaimable of European communities.

   I cannot but feel a lively interest in such inquiries as those which have been
imdertaken by Mr. Jevons. The interpretation of prices, when the facts are large
enough to preclude the influence of exceptionally disturbing causes, is one of the
most interesting as well as the most instructive among the whole range of eco-
nomical investigations. Nothing, I believe, is more likely to correct those hasty
generalizations which ha'ce formed peculiar temptations to some of om* most dis-

tinguished economists than the careful analj'sis of prices. The illustrious cory-
pheus of political economy, .Vdam Smith, was as laborious in collecting facts as
he was subtle in gathering inferences; and I have been constantly struck, in

following out certain researches into the history of prices, by the remarkable sagacity
with which Smith occasionally anticipated or suggested the facts of social life

many centuries ago.

   It might be expected that there would be a close conformity between values at
A'ery remote periods of social history. The proportions subsisting between the prices

of labour and food are, or should be, so close and unvarying, that we may always

suspect, in fully settled countries at least, that any marked discrepancy' between

values at difterent periods is suggestive of removeable evils. For instance, if the

price of food is considerably in excess of the average rate of wages, some cause,

which may be elmunated or corrected, can almost always be assig-ned for the phe-
nomenon. I may mention here in illustration of this rule, that during the thirteenth

and fourteenth centuries the prices of barley and oats, wheat being taken at 100,
are represented by the numbers 73-14 and 42-05, and that ^vithin the last ten years
the numbers have been 70 and 46-95. Close as this relation is, the slight discre-
pancy may, I think, be accoimted for by the incidence of the malt tax in the first case,
and the gi-eat increase in the number of horses kept in the second. Other con-
current causes may, I make no doubt, be detected, but these I think are likely to
be the most dominant.

    Estimates as to depreciation and exaltation in the value of the precious metals

are, however, to be made with extreme caution, because they are liable to many
fallacies. Some of us may remember the alarms entertained by M. Chevalier as

to consequences likely to be eftected on prices by the gold discoveries. It is not,

I think, too much to say that these fears, though natural, were grossly exaggerated

for in order that such inductions should be valid, they should be taken from a

very -wide area, and many disturbing causes should be accounted for or eliminated.
The eflects of unfavourable seasons and interrupted importations--it is only twenty

--twenty since it has experienced the advantage of that policy should be recognized

 in interpreting- the money value of the first necessaries of life ; while the effects
.of speculative purchases and forced sales are equally dominant in the price current
of its conveniences. To interpret a rise and fall in the value of money (the efflux
and influx of which, as a merchanlable commodity, is inevitably more free than
that of any other article of value) by the money measure of that which is open to
a vast variety of influences, must be an operation in which infinite caution is
necessary, in order to prevent the inference from becoming wholly imtrustworthy
and delusive.

   On such occasions as those in which the British Association has met in consider-

able manufacturing towns, the Section over which I have the honour to preside has
generally had the benefit of local trade reports. In so considerable a town as
Nottingham, one too which for a long time has been distinguished as the centre

of important and special manufactures, the Section may hope to have the advantage

of hearing these reports, and obtaining information as to local expenditure and

improvement. To such reports it is our practice to give priority in so far as may

be consistant with the general convenience of the business before the Section. For
the rest, the committee will endeavour to group the papers which are to be read
80 as to make the discussions of each day as congruous as possible.

On the Transfer of Beal Property. By Thomas Browke.

It was calculated, the author said, that one-third of the land in England was

mortgao;ed. Every mortgage might be estimated to cost £5, exclusive of stamps,

Weand to be of an average duration of only five or six years.  could therefore

readily gather what an immense sum was annually paid for the preparation of

mortgage-deeds alone. Perhaps in no case were the fictions of the law better

exemplified than in a mortgage-deed, which was nothing better than a sham.

Two-thirds of the matter was the repetition of an established form. The amoimt

of the remuneration of the lawyers depended on the length of the deeds ; and for

short deeds, therefore, the payments would be ridiculously small. If it should be

decided to abolish the present system of convej'ance, on the ground of its artificial

character, and there being no longer any reason for distinguishing between real

and personal property, the time would be opportune (especially as the Board of

Trade were obtaining statistical details to show the acreage of England, and the

owners of landed property and the modes of cultivation) to attach to some standard

survey map of England, and dulj' apportion by figures for reference all the landed

property of England. It might be allotted, on the principle of a limited liability

company, into so many shares, say one acre each. These might be issued in the

form of scrip, from a foot-registry, to the present owners of the land, upon their

affording satisfactory proof of ownership ; and they would then be transferable

in the same manner as other shares. This plan need in no measure interfere with

the law of primogeniture. Q^he author deprecated any rash change.

Some of the Besults of the Free Lkensiny System hi Liverpool during the last

        four years. By the Rev. William Caine, M.A., of Manchester.

   Five years ago the magistrates of Liverpool adopted the plan of granting public-

house licenses to all supposed respectable persons who applied for them, without

regard to the requirements of the neighbourhood in which the houses were situated,

or the vsnshes of the inhabitants. In Manchester and other towns the wishes of

the inhabitants of the districts are in some measure attended to. It may be inter-

  Let me compare the number of drunken cases given above with the number of

similar cases in other towns, and, first, in the leading commercial and manufac-
turing towns.

  But it may be said, and said truly, that Liverpool ought to be compared with

seaport towns. Let us so compare them.

   It is often said that the beer-houses are more productive of crime and vice than

public-houses. In Manchester we have nearly twice as many beer-houses as there
are in Liverpool, and I>iverpool has more than three times as many public-houses

as there are in Manchester. Let us compare the two towns with respect to the
drunkenness and vice in them.

poverty. Let us see how Livei-pool stands in this in comparison with Manchester.

The crime of Liverpool appears to be increasing every year at a rate out of all

Aroportion with the rate of increase of the population.                   few da3's ago, Baron

IMartin, in charging the grand jury at Liverpool, said, that "never since he had been

on the bench had he seen a more deplorable calendar than thatofthe present assizes,

particularly with reference to the serious nature of the crimes. Sixteen of the

cases were of homicide, and in his opinion several of the cases put down as man-

--slaughter ought really to have been styled murder                       They were the worst

list of cases of homicide that he had ever seen he did not think he had ever seen

anything so bad during the course of a long experience on the bench." On the

same day, before sentencing a person charged with manslaughter, his lordship

stated that "this case arose out of drunkenness, which seemed to be the cause of

nine-tenths of all the crime that was committed."

At the Salford Hundred Quarter Session, held a few weeks since, Mr. Edmimd

Ashworth, one of the visiling justices, made a remark which ought not to be omitted

in this paper. He said, " In the borough of Liverpool they had nearly 10,000

prisoners a year, and the recommitals were .58 per cent., while the number of pri-

--soners to the population of the borough of Liverpool was 1 to 45| the extreme

of criminality of any population in the north of England, but the sentences there

only average 35^ daj's. Some of the Liverpool magistrates had an opinion in

fa^·our of giving a license to sell liquor to almost every house for which an appli-

cation was made ; and looking at that state of things, and the figures already given,

it appeared that Liverpool was the most drunken, and had the highest range of

criminality of any town, perhaps, in England. Hence it became the duty of the

authorities to consider a little the position they occupied." At this time, when

--cholera has invaded our shores, I cannot conclude without some reference to the

alarming mortality in Liver|)ool so alarming that the medical papers speak of
"a ALivei-pool as
                   national danger."                   Livei'pool paper, of the 9th instant, thus

speaks of the mortality there : " Thousands of pounds have been expended in

attempting to remove the causes of disease and death, and to introduce better sani-

tary regulations yet fever and other contagious diseases not only exist but prevail
                                                                           ;

to an alarming extent, increasing the bills of mortality so fearfully above the

average of the United Kingdom that six thousand lives were sacrificed during the

past 3'ear, which, in the opinion of Dr. Trench, would have been saved if Liver-

pool iiad been as healthy as other towns."

This statement is so appalling that it may well occasion apprehension, and

attract the attention of comparative strangers to this town as a " national danger."

chester respectively, from 1856 till 1865 :

 --The Registrar-General's Report for England, ending March Slst, makes the fol-

lowing remarks respecting Liverpool : " If the map of England were shaded to

represent the rates of mortality of last quarter in the registration districts, the eye

travelling from the ligliter south to the darker north would he instantly drawn to

a spot of portentous darkness on the Mersey ; and the question would be asked

whether cholera, the black death, or other plague, imported with bales of mer-

chandise, had been lately introduced into its busy and populous seaport. Happily

this has not been the case ; but fever probably developed or aided by the mild and

damp atmosphere of the season, and by overcrowding in an increasing population,

has been busy and fatal in Liverpool and in other towns of the same county, and

of Yorkshire. The annual mortality of the borough of Liverpool in the three

months was excessive,  and demands immediate               and  earnest  consideration                                                                it rose
                                                                                                                                                   ;

to 4"59.3 per cent. This implies that if this death-rate were maintained for a year,

forty-six persons out of a thousand in the population would die in that time, or

fifteen more than died in Glasgow, its northern rival, and nineteen more than in

London."

On the Number of Graduates in Arts and Medicine at Oxford for the last tivo

                         centuries. By Dr. Daubeny, F.E.S.

   Dr. Daubeny comnumicated a statement of the number of degrees of Bachelor in
Arts conferred by the University of Oxford each year from the middle of the seven-
teenth century down to the present time, from which it would appear that the
increase in that respect which has taken place is by no means proportionate to the

progress of the countr}', in population, wealth, and intelligence.

   Amongst the causes which have led to this result, he would suggest as one, the

circumstance that an University education, instead of being regarded, as is the case
in other countries, the fitting preparation for all the liberal professions, has by us
been chiefly confined either to youths educated for the Church, or to those not in-

tended for any profession at all.
   Confining himself to the Medical Profession, he had ascertained that the number

of Gradutes had sunk in Oxford from about four annually to every five millions of
the population, which was the case two centuries ago, to less than one at the

present time.

   The reasons assigned for medical students so rarely resorting for their education
to the University, may be briefly stated as follows :

   1. The prevailing notion, that neither professional knowledge, nor even the

sciences regarded as preparatory to it, can be acquired so well there as elsewhere.

   2. The large outlay which a University education is supposed to entail.
   3. The necessity imposed upon the student of devoting the greater part of his
time during his residence to the dead languages, thus throwing back pm'suits of a
more professional character to a later period of life than that at which they are
commenced elsewhere.
   4. The danger of acquiring habits and tastes incompatible with the successful
career of a medical man, from daily intercourse with a class of youths intended for

difi"erent walks in life.

   Now the first of these obstacles has been removed, so far as relates to the preli-

minai-y studies, by the recent establishment in Oxford of a staff" of Professors as
efficient, and of means and appliances for the prosecution of Chemistrj% Anatomy,
and the like, as ample, as are to be found in any other rival institution, whilst with
regard to studies purely professional, it is conceived that they can be best acquired
after the preliminary ones are fully mastered, and may therefore be reserved with
advantage till the time when the necessary residence in the University has been

completed.

   Secondly, that the large sum supposed to be required for an Oxford education,
 128 REPORT--186G.

 arises, not from the charges of board, lodging, and tuition, which every student
 must incur, but from tlie expensive liabits and costly amusements in which so many
 indulge. The latter, therefore, might be avoided bv au}^ body of youths wlio were
 sufficiently considerable in point of numbers to associate chiefly amongst them-

 selves, and who were placed where they woidd not be in constant communication

 with students of ampler means and different pursuits.
    Thirdly, the objection raised from the undue postponement of their studies has

been already in part removed by the new regulation, which enables the Under-

 graduate to terminate his classical reading after two years of residence at the

 University.

   Fourthly, in reply to those who apprehend that habits unfitting for a medical
man are likely to be acquired by a residence at the University, it was suggested,

that the risk of this would be mucli lessened by establishing a Hall or College

which should be resorted to principally by medical students, who would thus form

a community of their own, and feel less temptation to join in the pursuits of the
wealthier and idler portion of Oxford society.

    It is not, however, suggested that Oxford should be substituted for London as
a place for acquiring clinical instruction. All that is maintained is, that the pre-
paratory studies, such as Chemistry and Anatomy, may be mastered as well out of
London as in it, and that it can never be advisable that the acquisition of so large
a part of that knowledge which is looked for from an aspirant to a Medical Degi-ee
should be compressed within the short compass of the time he is expected to reside

in the metropolis, whilst all the previous years of his life, since the period of his

leaving school, have been engrossed by an apprenticeship to an apothecary, with
few opportunities of learning an}i:hing beyond the art of compounding medicines.

   Would it not, it was asked, be more advantageous to a large proportion at least

of these students, if, before they were considered old enough to reside in London,
exempt from all moral supervision, they were to spend half the year in keeping
terms at the University, and in there obtaining a sound knowledge of those sciences

which constitute the basis of a medical education ? And would it not be found

sufficient for them to devote merely the remaining half to the routine of an apothe-
cai-y's shop, for the purpose of acquiring whatever knowledge can be derived from

such a quarter ?

       On tJie Lace and Hosiery Trades of Nottingham. By "W". Felkin-.

   The author observed that the progress of the town and suburbs of Nottingham
in population and material wealth during this century has been much advanced
by the increase of the lace manufacturers of the place. In regard to the popula-
tion of Nottingham, from the figures which appear in the population returns, much
misconception prevails. Nottingham there appears to have a population of about
75,000, that is within the limits of the mimicipal borough only ; while, including
the suburban parishes, which are practically parts of Nottingham, there are about

--150,000 in all. It has risen from 35,000, the number in 1811. The following ac-

count of the machine-wrought lace trade in 1865 is based on a census made by Mr.
Birkin and Mr. Heymann in 1862, of the machinery in the business, and given by
the former in his report to Class 24 in the London Exhibition of that year. At
that time there were 1797 circular machines making bobbin net; of these 200 were
at Tiverton, 100 at Barnstaple, 360 at Chard, 500 in Derbyshire, and 700 in and
near Nottingham. Also 1588 levers, 125 traverse warps, 42 pushers, all in Not-
tingham and its neighboiuliood, making a total, with 353 standing, of 3552 bobbin
net, and 400 warp lace frames. Of these, 2149 were making silk lace, and 1450
cotton lace. There were employed on plain net 1442, and on fancy 2157, the latter
being closer imitations of cushion lace than ever before made. Although since
1862 there have occurred gi'eat fluctuations in demand, and the prices of both silk
and cotton materials have advanced full 75 per cent., tlie amount of machiner}' and
emplojnnent was in 1865 about the same as in 1862. The entire production con-
tinues'to be finished and sold in Nottingham, except that at Tiverton, which is of
silk, and sold in Loudon. The approximate number of hands employed in 1865 is
calculated upon the account taken by the wi'iter recently of the hands actually en-
gaged in making and finishing the production of lace from a large body of bobbin-
                                                                                                                                --;

net machines. These, for the whole body of the lace machinery, maybe thus stated :

900 men employed in 180 shops for making machines, boboins, carriages, points,

guides, combs, needles, &c., at average wages of 33s. a week ; 10,300 men and youths
at work in 130 larger factories and in lesser machine shops, 1800 of whom may earn

16s., 5000 25s., and 3500 first-class Levers' hands 35s. a week on an average. These

all work alternate shifts of four and five hours each, in the entire day of 18 hours,

during which the engine is going. 4200 boys clearing, winding, threading bobbins,

5s. 500 women filling bobbins and overlooking, 12s. 15,000 brown net menders,
who usually receive nets from factories, and free them from foul or imeven threads.

It is generally supplementary labour to household work, by which 4s. to 8s. may

be gamed, averaging 5s. a week. 300 men, warpers, 25s. ; 300 men, moulders,

founders, and superintendents of machinery, .3os. ; 60 cai-penters, 30s. ; 360 porters,
17s. ; 120 carters, 20s. ; 90 watchmen, &c., 20s. ; 260 steam engineers, 22s. ; 150

bleachers, 30s. ; 100 male dressers of lace, 8s. to 30s. ; 900 female dressers, 10s.

1000 female white menders, 12s. ; 500 female lace-folders, 10s. ; 1000 paper-box
makers of both sexes, 7s. ; 450 warehouse women, 13s. ; 250 female overlookers,

15s. ; 100 draftsmen and designers, 40s. ; 1300 warehousemen and clerks taking sala-

ries. There are employed in each finishing lace warehouse from 6 to 600 females,

as the size and nature of the business may require. The number cannot be knovm

except by actual census. They are taken from outdoor hands in brown-mending

and other employments on lace. The hom'S are 8 a.m. to 6 or 7 p.m., and the

wages are about 9s.  on an average                                                                   overtime is  paid for.  The kinds of work must

be seen to be undei'stood, but are in general more wearisome than heavy. In some

of the factories and work-rooms, in lace warehouses, and in dressing-rooms, the

heat is sometimes oppressive. In general ventilation is provided for, but hands do

not always care to make use of it. There is a far greater number of females em-

ployed, sometimes from a too early age, in the houses of "mistresses," often their

own mothers, upon drawing, scolloping, carding, &c., processes light and simple

enough, upon goods which have been obtained from finishing houses. These young

people must exercise care and cleanliness on the goods, or they would be spoilt.

When retm-ned to the warehouse the mistress receives a price, out of which she

takes a portion for her labour, risk of damage, fire, light, house-room, &c. Some

of these persons employ twelve to twenty young gu"ls. The total number cannot
be known accurately except by census. It being considered domestic employment,

they are not xmder registration or visitation, except upon complaint made on sani-
Atary groimds.
                great improvement has been going on in regard to the age at

which these children begin to do this kind of work, and the hours of their daily

labour. The change dates from Mr. Grainger's report on this important subject
in 1844. The remaining department of female labour in connexion with the ma-

chine lace trade is that of embroiderers with hook or needle, Tambom-ers, or lace-

runners, once amounting to 150,000, now reduced to a sixth of that number. Their
average weekly earnings in 1836 was 4s. ; now it is doubled, and more for the
better kinds of work. As fast as the improved machinery produced figured work,

nearly finished on the machines ready for sale, the lace-embroiderers were cast aside.
About 1840 an emigration set into Nottingham from all the districts within fifty

miles, to supply the increasing warehouse and outdoor female labour required in both

the lace and hosiery trades. There has thus been added to the alreadv prepondera-

ting female population of the place 13,000 within the last 26 years. In these three

classes are computed from 90,000 to 100,000 females, which, added to the 38,000

above enumerated, makes a total of about 135,000 employed in the lace trade of
Nottingham in 1865. The materials worked up cost about £1,715,000 ; the wao-es

--and profits amounted to £3,415,000 or thereabouts ; and the net returns mav be

stated at £5,130,000. In the hosiery business of Nottingham there were at work

in 1865 11,000 narrow hand-machines, employing domestically 7500 men and 3500
women and youths, at wages from 6s. to 26s., averaging by the statements of the

hands themselves 10s. 6d. weekly ; also 4250 wide hand-machines, likewise domes-

tically employing 4250 men, from 10s. to .30s., averaging, according to the work-

men's statement, 15s. weekly wages. These 15,250 hand-frames were place in

4620 shops in 80 parishes spread over the county of Nottingham. The entire

average wages of 42,000 frames in 1844 was about 6s. a week only. These two

classes of hand-machines, it is computed, give employment to about 20,000 women

and girls as winders and seamers, earning 4s. each on an average. There are about
1000 wide-power rotary frames, employing 700 men, at from 20.s. to 32s. ; and

about 16,000 girls and women, seamers and winders, on an average of 5s. weekly.
There are about 1200 sets of circular round-power frames improved, employing 500
men and 500 youths, at from 12s. to 35s. weekly ; and 1000 women, getting 12s.

to 20s. weekly wages. The winders, cutters, menders, and others attached to these

are about 11,000 Momen and girls, averaging 7s. to 12s. a week. And there are

about 400 warp msuihines making hosieiy by power, employing 400 men, at 14s. to

35s. ; aud 200 youths, at 12s. to 20s. ; besides 400 warpers, &c. (men), gaining

about 25s. ; and also 2000 women and girls stitching, &c., at 8s. a week on an
average. It is probable that there are 2000 men employed in bleaching, dyeing, &c.,

and as porters, &c., at 20s. to 35s. weekly ; besides 5000 menders, folders, &c.,

working in warehouses, at from 8s. to 12s. weekly. To these must be added the

warehousemen and clerks in 80 establishments for finishing and sale of goods in

Nottingham. The Nottingham hosiery business is now believed to be giving em-

--ployment to about 17,000 males and 44,000 females together, 61,000 worlq)eople.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             '

The estimated returns amoimted in 1865 to about £3,000,000. The two staple trades

of Nottingham, therefore, distributed in returns an amount of somewhat more than

£8,000,000 sti rling last year, and furnished, in the aggregate, employment to nearly

200,000 workpeople. The hosiery hand-frames here stated were enumerated

throughout the whole trade by my census in 1844 ; and the results are given with

much minuteness in a paper read in this Section at the York Meeting of the British

Association, where the terrible details of suft'ering then, and for forty years pre-

viously, endured, caused much interest and sympathj'. Happily the state of things

then desciibed is now entirely changed, and the labour ol the stocking-maker being

in larger demand than the supply, both employed and employer are enjoj^ng an
amoimt of prosperity never before realized, but which, we hope, may be long con-

tinued. It will be an explanation of some interest to those who are strangers to

the process of these trades, to state that the hand-knitter of a stocking, if assiduous

and clever, will knit 100 loops a minute ; and that Lee, on his first machine, made
1000 of worsted, and on his second 1500 loops of silk per minute. The visitor may

now see made on the round frame, patented by Brunei in 1816, but since modified

and improved, without any effort of the attendant but to supply yam, 250,000 loops

of the finest textures made, in various colours, per minute, with safety ; an advance

of 2500-fold upon the hand-lniitter. Also, that while a pillow-lace maker can

form 5 meshes per minute by her skilful and pliable fingers, Heathcote, on his first

essay upon his bobbin -net machine, made 1000, and, before the expiration of his
patent, 10,000 of these meshes per minute ; a man sitting to overlooK his machine

now will watch its movements, producing 60,000 meshes per minute--an increase of

10,000-fold on the cushion labourer's aj-duous and painstaking task. The mathe-

matical nicety of the construction of each of these machines necessary to their

secure worlving, the beautiful simplicity of the looping stocking frames, contrasted

with the complexity and rapidity of movement through confined spaces of the

thousands of bobbins and carriages, in the mesh-making and embroidering bobbin-

net machines, vdll be found to sm-pass the greater part of the machinery employed

in any other manufacture whatever. Two or thi-ee particular points in connexion

Awith the present operations of these trades will interest this Section.  himdred

years ago almost all stockings were widened and narrowed on the frame, as they

had been by hand-knitting, so as to fit the leg and foot exactly with neatness and

comfort to the wearer. These were called full-fashioned hose. Seventy or eighty

years ago the practice of making goods straight down in  the leg first began                                                                      these
                                                                                                                                               ;

were called .ipurious goods. From that time tiU 1845 Parliament was on several

occasions informed that this practice caused distress, and applied to to declare this

mode of making stockings illegal ; but these petitions were without legislative re-

sult. Brunei's round frame makes knitted socks without fashion, and the roimd

web is shaped by scissors and sewn up by stitching machines or hand. One head

will produce weekly 30 dozen of women's hose, sold at 3d. to Gel. a pair.. At first

these goods were hateful to the greater portion both of masters and men. So far

from the trade being ruined, it has become better than for a century past, in every
                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but, meanwhile, we arc clothing the feet of millions of people, who twenty years

ago knew nothing of stockings                                                                                                                                              and will in all  probability prove  preciu'sors of de-

mand for the better and more costly articles ; 30,000 persons are employed by tiieao

round frames. In the working of power laco machines there is the anomaly of

eighteen hours' continued working of the engine in the midland factories. The
women and children are now withdrawn from night labour. It is more than ques-

tionable whether the natural hours of adult male labour might not now, if univer-

sally adopted, result in, at least, equal advantage to the owners of these machines,

costly as they are, yet working to little profit, and with greater comfort to the

workmen and their families. In conclusion, the condition of the children, probably
not much lower than 40,000 employed by mistresses, and the circumstances at-
tending such numbers being confined so many horn's in rooms not intended for
workshops, would seem to caU for authorized inspection, and, I think, for registra-

tion also.

            On Inventors and Inventions. By G. Bell Gallowa?.

On the Suhjeets required in the Classical Tri])OS Examination and in the
   Trinity College Fellowship Examination at Cambridye. By James Hey-

   wooD, 3LA., "^F.B.S.

   The author contended that a wider range of subjects in the triposes or examina-
tions for honom's at Cambridge and in the fellowship examinations would raise
the standard of qualifications for schoolmasters, who are often selected from the
classes of honour-men aud coUege-feUows at the University. Royal Commis-
sioners, who regulated public schools and academical studies in the reigns of the
Tudor sovereigns, no doubt acted conscientiously according to the ideas and
enlightenment of the sixteenth century ; they followed in the same line ndth their

Roman Catholic predecessors, deeming Latin and Greek learning the only sure
basis of the higher education of the country. An example of their plans forthe
supremacy of Roman and Grecian studies may still be seen in the papers which

are every year set to the candidates for fellowships at Trinity College, Cambiidge.

Of nine papers appointed at this fellowship examination, six are classical, two
mathematical, and one comprises mental and moral philosophy. It is probable

that a revision of the Cambridge Classical Tripos sj'stem will sliortly take place in
the University, and Mr. E. C. Clark, late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,

mhas suggested that both the verse composition papers Greek and Latin should 1)6

omitted from the subjects of examination for the Classical Tripos ; he proposes to
substitute for them a general philosophical paper, and a philological paper, includ-
ing questions not only relative to the languages of Greece and Rome, but also to
the connexion between these and other languages. Such an alteration would
enlarge the scope of the Classical Tripos, and increase the knowledge of the future

schoolmasters, who distinguish themselves whilst at Cambridge in that important

examination.

ence on the Institution. In 1862 the subject of science classes was brought under

the notice of the committee by Mr. Buckmaster, the organizing teacher of the

Science and Art Department. Subsequent inquiry and deliberation led to the

commencement of a class in October for the study of inorganic chemistry, Dr.

Thomas Wilson midertaking the duties of teacher. An introductory lecture was

deli^-ered on the advantages of a knowledge of chemistiy to workmen occupied in

dyeing, bleaching, and dressing lace and hosiery goods, the manufacture of which

forms the two staple trades of the town and neighbourhood. Theclass numbered sixty-

one students, to whom forty lectures were delivered during the six months from Octo-
ber to March inclusive ; and in the May follo^^^ng prizes were awarded to those stu-
dents who had passed the examination appointed to be held by the Council of the

Science and Art Department. In 1863 the class was resumed by the same teacher,

when, as might be expected, the novelty of the movement having passed away, the

students were reduced to seventeen. In 1864 two classes were organized, one for
the study of human physiology being added to the inorgonic chemistry class, and

both being conducted by the same teacher. In this year there was a considerable

accession of students, the inorganic chemistry class having sixty-five, and the phy-

siological class thirty. In 1865 a further step was taken, three science classes

being organized, namely, an inorganic chemistry claas, with twenty-five students;

a physiological class, with thirty- two students and a geological class, with thirty-;

Aseven students.  former student in the chemistry class, Mr. Sissling, who had

passed the examination for teachers required by the Science and Art Department,

took charge of this class, and Dr. "Wilson superintended the classes in geology and

physiology. From these figures it will be seen that in the session which has

recently closed, there were ninety-four students in the Science Classes of the Not-

tingham Mechanics' Institution. The Avi-iter next proceeded to show by the yearly

returns, that during the period in which these classes have been organized, a large

number of persons, especially young men, who are employed in the various branches

of local nianufactm-es, have become members ; in fact, that the institution has

steadily increased in numbers since the time when the committee adopted science

classes as a part of the plan of instruction to be followed. In 1862, the year in

which the Chemistry class was first commenced, the number of ordinary members

in connexion with the Mechanics' Institution, paying a subscription of 6s. per

annum, was 7o2 ; in 1863 the number rose to 913 ; in 1864 it was 922 ; in 1865 it
advanced to 1025 ; and at the beginning of the present year there were 1105 ordi-

--nary members. The conclusions arrived at from these facts were : 1st. That these

classes draw the attention of the more intelligent among the working population to

the institution in which they are conducted, and in this way lead to an increase of

members. 2nd. The discipline of mind required to follow the teacher through a

course of lectures creates a taste for reading and study, which it was the aim of

those who founded Mechanics' Institutions to develope and gi'atify ; and therefore

the formation of science classes is the legitimate outworking of these institutions,

in providing the education as contemplated as desirable to place within reach of

the working-classes. 3rd. The establishment of science classes is calculated to

exercise an important influence on the manufacturing interests of the commimity,

by bringing to bear on production a higher degree of intelligence acquired in the

class-rooms of mechanics' institutions, and so utilizing it for the general advantage

     On the Diminution of Accidents in Coal Mines since the Ajjpointment of
               Oovernment Inspectors. By George Seniok, F.S.S.

   After briefly explaining the Acts of Parliament relating to the inspection and
management of mines, the author showed that the saving of life from gaa explo-
sions in pits amounted to nearly fifty per cent., and from accidents in the shafts
to forty-six per cent, since the appointment of inspectors in 1854. The average
loss of life in raising coal in 1864 was 1 to every 110,000 tons raised.

On Hindrances to the Stuxess of Popular Education. By the Eev. C. Sewell.

   The author said that our imperfect success in education must not be charged
upon the construction of the system we had adopted, but upon its administration.
It was almost impossible to plant an organization in an inorganic mass so as to be
prolific ; and for all purposes of popular education England was thoroughly inor-

ganic. Her education had always been done for her. What popular education she

had had in past generations had come from charity, neither general nor systemati-

cal in its operation. What little the State had done had been done by the free

royal bounty of an Edward or an Elizabeth. England had never felt her want of
education sufficiently keenly to submit to direction in the matter. One great

secret of the success of popular education abroad is, that the preparation of a
system of instruction and the preparation of the people to receive and use it had
gone hand in hand. Tlie absence of such a natural organization to work out tlie

svstem of education was a great hindrance to om* success. It was the statesman's
duty to supply such an organization, and it was the educator's to supply a system
and method of instruction. It would be no unworthy occupation for a statesman
to win the legislature to sanction an ordinance which should compel every part of
our country to provide the means of education for the poor, as it is already com-
pelled to find them food and shelter in distress. It appeared to some not imprac-
ticable for the religious bodies and the State to work in real harmony together, and

not, as it were, upon the terms of an armed tmce. After dwelling on the fact that

many children were not sent to school for various reasons, s ich as the ignorance
and greed of the parents, he said he doubted wliether it would be wrong to impose
some restriction on a parent's right to his child's labour, when he had not intelli-
gence enough to consult that child's interest. Whether the State regulated the
attendance of childi-en, or, the next best thing, regulated their absence, it would be

intolerable that the State should organize so great a boon, and her subjects be left

at libei-ty to neglect or ignore it.

Statistics of the Charitable, Educational, Industrial, and Public Institutions

  founded by the Native Gentry of India during the last five years. By

    Colonel Syees, M.P., F.B.S.

' The author commenced by giving an account of the contributions during the

years 1862 and 1863, which had been given by fire-worshippers, Hindoo idol-wor-

shippers, Jews, Jains, and other natives for educational, hospital, and other pm-poses.

He o-ave numerous instances of the spontaneous and princely munificence by which

many of the native gentlemen had distinguished themselves. For example, David

Sassoon, a Jew, gave £5000 for the erection of an hospital at Poena for aU creeds

and opinions, and supplemented that sum immediately by a fm*ther sum of £10,000

for its endowments; Nerwanjee Framjee gave £16,O0O for establishing a fund for

the  relief of  indigent Parsees of  his own community                                                                                                 David Sassoon, a Jew,  gave
                                                                                                                                                    ;

dowdess, of Goojrat, contributed voluntaiily the sum of 1000 dollars for the relief

of families who had suffered by the war ; Cowajee Jehsangeer, a Parsee, came for-

ward with £5000, which he oflTered to increase to £10,000, if necessary, for the

establishment of a strangers' home in Bombay. The author then proceeded to give

details as to the amount of these contributions for charitable and philanthropic
purposes, given by certain influential native gentlemen in India, showing that in
many cases the contributions of one individual during a single year amounted to
upwards of £5000, and that all these contributions were vohmtarily given without
regard to any sectarian feeling or prejudice of any kind whatever. Amongst the
subscriptions he mentioned was one for the presentation to the Prince and Prin-
cess of Wales of some of the choicest products in India. The object of supply-
ing the particulars contained in this paper was, he remarked, to prove the

character of the miuds of the people of India, who are British subjects. He con-

cluded with a few remarks on female education in India, remarking that from the

feelings which were now developing themselves among the people of India, at
least among the educated classes, there was reason to believe that a change would
yet take place in that country by which the native women of India would be
improved in their social position, and there would be a softening of men's man-
ners, minds, and habits to an extent that was much required in India. This

change had already to some extent taken place, for he could give instances of
elevation of sentiment, of high honour, of delicacy of feeling, and of personal sacri-
fices on the part of the people of India, which were not oidy creditable to them,
but would have been so to the most enlightened among ourselves.

   Colonel Sykes said, that when the donations which he had mentioned were made
to any educational institution in India, they were made without any condition
stipulated as to the teaching or government of the schools. The public schools of

India were all secular, and the missionary schools, which were established by dif-
ferent religious denominations, were regarded as being simply private institutions.

             On Modes of Banking in America, Manchooria, and China.

                            By Colonel Sykes, 3LP., F.E.S.
   The author gives an account of the devices of Mr. W. W. Brown, an emanci-

pated slave in America, to set up a bank, after a visit to Europe. Cheated out of
his first wages in the autumn of 1835, he visits a barber in Monroe, Michigan, and
asked employment as a jom-neyman barber. Failing, he set up in opposition, and
engaged a room opposite, and placed a sign over the door, " Fashionable Hair-

dresser from New York, Emperor of the West." Not succeeding, he was advised by

a friend to set up a bank, after the manner of the " Wild Cat Banks," the notes
of which were called " Sliinplasters," his capital being to the value of 20 dollars.
But lie soon experienced the difficulties of " a rim " upon his bank from the
jealousy of the opposite barber, and a ludicrous accoimt is given how the redemp-
tion and recashing of " .Shinplasters" was efi'ected.

   With respect to banks in Manchooria in Tartary, the information is obtained

from Mr. Consul Meadow's Report to the Foreign Office. He gives a description

of Manchooria bank notes. There is not any regidation of paper cm-rency. One

--hundred and twenty-three houses in Manchooria issue notes at pleasure, expressed

in " tcamis'" a teaou being equal to about 9|d, or about 50 equal £2. The
smallest note issued in Manchooria is equal to 2 teaous, or 19d. ; the largest,
50 teaous, or £2. The , rate of exchange between notes and silver bullion alter
daily in each city. The bankers meet every morning at daybreak to settle the
exchange. The rate during the last five years, dated from 1861, averaged about 5

teaous for 1 tael, or 6s.

--the Chinese.' The folio-wing ai-e heads of Doolittle's information : Banking is not

On the Violation of the Pnnciples of Economic Science caused hi/ the Law of
                  Distraint for Rent. By Charles Tebbutt.

The author contended that the law of distraint for rent was a violation of the

principles of Economic Science, especially as regarded land, the owner of which

often had a secm-ity not possessed in houses, in the investment of capital, which

was iiTemoveable. The law secured rent to the landlord, even if he had so neg-

lected his duty as to choose for his tenant a man utterly without skill, character, or

capital. The violation of its equity was equalled by its impolicy, as it affected the

occupation and cultivation of the soil. OAvnership was a gi-eat inducement to the

development of the cultivation of the soil ; but in "England little land was OAvned

by its cultivator. It was needfid that in an an-angement between landlord and

tenant nothing should inten-upt the play of motive and interest. Yet at this point

in stepped the law of distraint, giving absolute security to the landlord, and remov-

ing from his mind that pressiu'e of motive and interest which rendered it needfid

for him to have the best tenant he could obtain, and to make him every reasonable

concession to obtain this end. The whole equity of the transaction was lost ; little

weight was given to the skill and capital of the tenant ; and the landlord was

enabled without danger of the loss of rent to bring in any man of straw to compete

Awith the tenant of capital and skill.  lower standard of cultivation prevailed

generally than would be the case if the disturbing law were entirely abolished.

   This paper was supplementary to one on the Medical Topogi-aphy of Notting-
ham, read before the British Medical Association, and referred to the returns of the
Institution dui'iiig 10 years, tabulated as follows :

   I. Annual admissions, distinguishing sex of patients, and arranged according to
       the diseases or injuries for which they were admitted into the hospital.

   U. Ages of patients, without distinction of sex, according to the same ai-range-
       ment.

   III. Duration of illness previous to admission into hospital.

   IV. Time of stay in hospital.
   V. Result of treatment.

   VI. Occupations of patients.
   VII. Period of the year in which they were adnutted.
   VIII. Locality from which they were received, as town, suburbs, coimty of Not-

       tingham, or other counties.
   There were admitted into the hospital during this period 6936 males and 4880
females, being 100 males to 71'3 females, a proportion which had been found to
hold very nearly dm-ing each of the ten years, and which agreed, within a very
small number, with similar returns from fifteen other provincial hospitals ; whilst

in ten of the London hospitals the proportion of males to females was found to be
1491 to 1143, or 100 to 757.
--136
EEPOB.T 1866.

   After analyzing the ahove Tables, wliicli referred especially to the medical sta-
tistics of the hospital, another Table was added, which bore more particularly upon
the subject of hospital economics and management. This Table extended over a
period of thirty-five years, from 1831 to the present time, and showed, in the first
place, the number annually admitted into the hospital, and of those attended to as
out-patients. Both these bore a proportion to the rapidly increasing popidation of
the town, and the latter was also somewhat afl'ected by the state of trade, which
in times of activity caused a number of accidents of a comparatively trifling kind
to swell the number of out-patients. It was noticed as a remarkable fact that, in
a population whose occupation brings them constantly into contact with weighty
and complicated machinery, the vast majority of injuries received by those engaged
in the lace and hosiery manufactures were of so slight a kind as to render admis-

sion into the hospital unnecessary. The number of more serious accidents occur-
ring amongst the large manufacturing population of the town and suburbs was far

outweighed by those from the colliery and agiicultural districts of the county.
   The 3rd colimm (the average number of patients in the house) of course varied

nearly in a direct ratio with the numbers admitted, but not absolutely so, as it was
influenced by the mmiber of days during which each remained in the hospital, the
average of which was shown in the 4th column. The latter return had always
been considered a most important point in the economy of the hospital. Various
 causes tended to prolong the stay of some of the patients beyond the time which
might be considered absolutely desirable ; and for this reason it had been the
 practice in the Nottingham Hospital to have, on the first Tuesday in each alternate
 month, a general inspection by the whole of the medical stafi" of such patients as
 might have been in the house upwards of eight weeks. Those patients whose
 cases required further treatment in hospital were then recommended to be retained,

whilst those who would be equally benefitted as out-patients, or those who were

 not likely to be further relieved by remaining in the wards, were recommended to

 be removed as soon as possible. By the careful carrying out of this arrangement a
 gi'eat saving to the hospital was eflected, and room was thus made for the ad-
 mission of those urgent cases which were generally waiting for beds. By these
 and other means the average number of days during which the patients have

 remained in the hospital had fallen in thirty years from 50 to 35'7.
    The 5th column showed the total cost of the Matron's department (i. e. pro-

 visions, coals, gas, water, &c.) in each year, and as this was of course influenced by
 the varying price of provisions, the contract price of meat and bread, a fair index
 of that of other articles of consumption was given in the two following columns,

 6 and 7.
     The 8th column gave the annual cost of wines, spirits, and porter ; and the 9th

  that of medicines, instruments, and appliances.
     There was one item under the latter head which had in a few years undergone

  so remarkable a change that it was thought deserving of a separate column. This
  was the cost of leeches, which in 1835, with an admission list of 750 in-patients
  and 1650 out-patients, amounted to the sum of £90 ; whilst ten years later, in
  1845, with 1214 in-patients and 3069 out-patients, the same item of expenditure
  had fallen to £53 10s. Qd. Since that time, with a rapidly-increasing number of
  patients, there had been a rapidly decreasing cost of leeches, so that in 1857, with
  1379 admissions into the hospital, and an out-patient list of 7620, the cost was
  only 12s. lOd., and in the following year, with 1361 in-patients and 7724 out-
  patients, the cost was stUl only 13s. Id. Since that time the sum paid for leeches
  had been so small that its notice as a separate item of expenditure had been dis-

   continued.

     The 11th column gave the average cost of each in-patient in each of the thirty-
  five years, which varied from £4 12s. in 1836 to £2 8s. 2|f7. in 1845 ; but as the
  comparison of those years was rendered difiicult by the varying time during which
  each patient remained in hospital, the 12th column had been added to show the

   cost per day of each patient during that period. It thus appeared that the highest
  cost was 2s. 2^d. per day in 1834, the lowest Is. 3fd. in 1848 and 1850.

      The last column gave the average cost of each out-patient, which had varied
  from 5s. lOd in 1836 to Is, id, in 1859, a diflerence which had, it was believed,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  137

been in a great measure owing to the rapidly increased number of minor accidents
occurring amongst the manufactui-ing population, and which, whilst they added

little to the cost, tended greatly to swell the number of the out-patient list, and
considerably reduced the average cost of each.

   There was one result indicated in this Table, which tended to illustrate the

important bearing of careful statistical returns upon the economical working of a
large institution. In 1837 it had been observed that for several years the hospital
expenditure had been gradually increasing in a ratio greater than the increase in
the number of admissions would account for. The cost of provisions had risen in
three years from £1386 12s. lid. to £1954 5s. lO^d., although the price of meat
had fallen fi-oni 7s. to 6s. id. per stone, and the price of bread from 2s. 6d. to Is. lOf^,
The cost of wine, spirits, and porter had risen in the same period from £48 19s. to
£120 17s. 6f/. The cost of medicines, from £433 2s. 7d., to £764 2s. l^d. The

average cost of each in-patient, from £3 13s. 2d. to £4 12s. O^d., and the average

cost of each out-patient, from 3s. 9d. to 5s. lOd.

  A subcommittee was appointed to investigate the cause of this increased expen-

ditm-e, and for many months this committee was employed in instituting a rigorous

investigation into the whole domestic management, and into every portion of the
expenditure of the hospital, and in carrying out a laborious series of experiments for

the purpose of ascertaining, as nearly as possible, the precise quantity of each

article of provision required for a given number of patients, oificers, and servants.

A plan, based upon these investigations and experiments, was adopted, for making

a careful periodical examination of every article of consimiption, so as to ensure

that, whilst there should be a liberal allowance of every necessary wherever re-

quired, there should be no waste or extravagance ; and the plan then adopted has

been since that period assiduously carried out.

   The beneficial result was soon apparent. In one year, with about the same
number of patients, the cost of provisions had fallen from £1954 5s. lO^d. to
£1669 10s. Oy.. ; of wine and spuits, from £120 17s. 6d. to £84 4s. ; of medi-
cines, from £764 2s. lid. to £448 4s. 6^^/. ; the average cost of each in-patient,

fi'om £4 12s. 0\d. to £4 2s., and of each out-patient, from 5s. lOd. to 3s. 6d. And
now for nearly thirty years the effect of the labours of that, and subsequent com-

mittees, had been apparent in the continued diminution of expenditure, and the

continued reduction of average cost of patients, which the several divisions of the
Table tended to show.

On a National Bank and Payment of the National Debt. By F. J. Wilson.

On the Occupation and Ownership of Waste Lands. By F. J. Wilson.

The colonies having large tracts of laud which they bring into cultivation, the

question arose on what terms they should be transferred to the public. According

to the laws of England and her colonies, the country belonged to a few, and the
Werest lived on sufferance.
                             had no right to bind posterity beyond the limits of

necessity. All land belonged to the community, the Government of which had no
power to sell, but simply to let it for the benefit of the community and the occu-

piers who were anxious to cultivate it. Therefore, all lands should be let at an

annual rental of £10 per cent., or the produce of the farm with a permanent right

of possession, so long as the land might not be required by the community for
more important purposes, when the full value should be paid to the occupier for all
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the improvements he might have effected in the property. No person shall have

power to hold another person as tenant, provided such person is willing to pay on

the land he may farm for such improvements as have aheady been expended, thus
becoming- the proprietor. The result of such a system would be, that no occupier

of land would sublet it to a tenant, but farm it himself. Shoidd he have more than
he could farm, he would siu'render it for sale, and therefore the farms would be
large and productive, and the inhabitants of villages and towns claiming through

the corporation such lands as they may require for building purposes, paying of

course to the occupier the full value of his improvements, would not, as in England,
be crammed into narrow streets (for example, this very town of Nottingham) and
miserable cottages, but would have creditable homesteads, which they had been
enabled to purchase at a reasonable price, still paying the increased ground-rent to
the State on the increased value of the soil.

 On Classification of the various Oecuimtions of the Peoph. By F. J. Wilson.

On the Dis]_iroportion between the Male and Female Population of some Manu-
    facturinci and other Toiuns. By the Rev. A. W. Woethington, B.A., of

      Mansfield.

   The population of England appears by the Census of 1861 to be divided in the
proportion of 105 women to 100 men, although 105 males are born to every 100
females. But this proportion is not equally distributed through the country. The
natm-e of employment differs in different towns and districts ; and as men or
women find most ready employment, one or the other predominate in number.
Thus in the mining-districts of Newcastle-ou-Tyne, Dudley, "Wolverhampton, and
Wakefield ; in the steel-manufacturing town of Sheffield ; in Stafford, where shoes
are made; in Stone and Stoke, where pottery is the staple manufacture; in Burton,
where brewing is carried on ; in the barrack towns of Canterbury, Winchester,
and Colchester, and to a smaller extent in the agricultural districts, such as Bake-
well, and the country parts of Nottinghamshire, there is a predominance of men
while in the manufacturing towns, such as Manchester, Preston and Carlisle,
Bradford and Leeds, Worcester, and more notably in Norwich, there is an excess
of women. In Nottingham and Radford together there were in 1861 48,424 men
and 57,820 women, an extraordinary excess of nearly 10,000 women. This excess
is most marked between the ages of 15 and 60. This is also the case in seaport
towns, e. g. Plymouth, Yarmouth, King's Lynn, Hull, and Bristol, while in Liver-
pool there are far more women than men between the ages of 15 and 45. More

women than men live in watering-places, e. g. Bath, Brighton, and Cheltenham.

   This attraction of female labour to manufacturing towns is not likely to dimi-
nish, but wiU rather increase, owing to the comparative cheapness of female labour.
Its advantage is in the addition to the familj^ income, and the independence it gives

to women. But it seems to be attended with considerable e\-ils. Where mai-ried
women are emploj'ed from home, or even have work at home, there is a very large
increase in the rate of juvenile mortality. This may be partly accounted for, it is
true, by the want of sanitary arrangements in large towns ; and in the mining
towns, e.g. Dudley, where the rate is very high, it may be owing to ignorance and

neglect ; but there can be no doubt that it is very frequently owing to the inability

of labom-ing women to give due attention to their children. Wliere immarried
women work away from home, and sometimes leaving home to labour in distant

towns are compelled to live in lodgings, illegitimacy increases, probably attended
with infanticide, even also with the occasional procuring of abortion. Thus the
rate of illegitimacy is generally high where there is an excess of women. It is

mmarked manufacturing towns, and in Nottingham reached the high rate, in 1864

(according to the last retm-u of the Registrar-General), of 10 per cent, on the whole
number of births ; while in Birmingham, where there is an average proportion of

men and women, it is as low as 5 per cent., which is below the general average of

the coimty. Again, early marriages are thus generally promoted in manufac-
turing towns, though this does not seem to be the case in Nottingham, where the

number of women who marry under age is below the general average of the

country.

   Such results are not necessary ; witness the case of the Lowell Mills in America,
and of Bradford in Yorkshire, where the numher of illegitimate bh-ths scarcely ex-
ceed the average. The means of amendment are to be found in the promotion of
family life, especially by leaving the wife and mother to attend to her domestic
duties, which will promote family happiness, increase juvenile health, and decrease
juvenile mortality. For this purpose also the improvement of education is much
needed. Both these means would also tend to decrease illegitimacy.

   The legislature might continue to direct the labour and education of minors in
additional fields of employment. Employers of labour might add to these bene-
ficial results by not engaging married women, and by judicious ai'raugements for

the benefit of their unmarried female hands.

MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

Address hy the President, Thomas Hawksley, V.P. Inst. C.E., F.G.S.

The subject matter of the department of the British Association over which I

have on this occasion been called to preside is that of Mechanics ; and although,

properly speaking, this department embraces within its confines the whole of the

vast range of mechanical philosophy, extending from the infinitely great of the

universe, down to the infinitely small of the ultimate atom, yet, as I apprehend,

it is our more immediate pm-pose to limit our inquiries for the most part, if not

altogether, to those branches of Statics and Dynamics which are or may be

employed for the realisation of so-caUed "practical ends," I now ofler for conside-

ration a few thoughts with regard to the unhappy necessity which the events of

the last few years have only too sadly established, for devoting much of the science

and skill of the members of the Association to the defence of the homes of the people

of this great nation. Whatever may have been the advancement which civilized

eople have made iu the arts of peace, it is only too evident that those people

Wea.ave even outstripped themselves in advancing the arts of destruction.  have

seen in the great internal contention of our American brethren, and still later in

the struggle in which several of the most important states of Europe have engaged,

that war is no longer carried on by means of mere animal courage and brute

force. On the contrary, we perceive, much to om* amazement, I believe, that the

highest branches of mechanical science and the most refined processes and opera-

tions of the mechanical arts are resorted to by the modern warrior for the purposes

of oftence and defence ; and we are taught by the logic of facts that the modem

soldier must cease to remain a passive machine, but, on the contrary, must hence-

forth be trained as a skilled labourer, if not, indeed, even as a skilled artisan. At the

present moment the defences of this country are in a most unsatisfactory condition.
Many endeavours have been made, and much money, reckoned by millions, has

been expended, for the most part uselessly, in endeavom-s to secm-e our coasts

against the attacks of a foreign enemy. Forts have been erected where an adver-

sary woidd never seek to land. Ships of an enormous size, and carrying enormous

armaments, have been consti-ucted, which can neither sail on shallow waters, nor

safely encounter a hurricane in deeper ones, which, with vast mechanical power

on board, can yet not carry a sufficient quantity of coal to enable them to find

their way to, and act as protectors of, our colonies, and which, for the same reason,

are wholly unable to convey our merchantmen to those distant climes, without a

safe communication with which the trade and commerce of England must be anni-

hilated. Arsenals have been enlarged, if not constructed, in situations in which

they can only be secured from an enemy's fire by fortifications which it will

require an additional army to man. Guns, each one larger or more elaborate

than the last, have been invented and constructed and tried, and floating castles,

each one heavier and uglier and more unmanageable and more useless, except for

special applications, than the former one, have been built and cast upon the waters

to resist them, and yet nearly all ua,val and military oflicers acknowledge that this

great country is not in a position to defend either herself or her colonies against

a combined attack from more than one of those foreign fiiends we have heretofore

recognized under a different appellation. It is a function of this department of
our Association to study and discuss the forms of ships suitable for the purposes
of commerce and war, to ascertain the conditions imder which they will attain

the highest velocities, or carry the heaviest burdens, to know and define the laws

of resistance to motion in water (a subject to which I have devoted a not alto-
gether useless attention), and to apply the motive force necessary to overcome
that resistance in the most economical, most convenient, and most serviceable
manner ; and it is also a function of this department to deal with the theory and
practice of projectiles, and to contrive the means by which these warlike instru-

ments, both large and small, may be most advantageously employed by our military
and naval forces. But whilst, as good Englishmen, we feel the necessity of being
prepared for war in order to secure a lasting and respected peace, we must not
neglect the consideration of so much more of our science as contributes to the

material wealth and prosperity of our countiy, and to the social comfort and

intellectual improvement of its inliabitants, and, I may add, of the whole world.
Before sitting down, permit me to request your attention to the many points of
interest peculiar to this town and its neighbourhood. You win find here, in the

lace-machine, combinations and arrangements of mechanism of the most compli-
cated yet of the most exact kind, all tending to the cheap and rapid fabrication

of an article of commerce, which has made its way over the entire world, and

without the possession of which no home, and I had almost said no lady's dress,
can be considered complete. The present state and extent of this really wonderful
manufacture is an instance, and a remarkable one, of the effect of that law of con-
tinuity which last evening formed the staple of om* President's addi'ess. It has
only been by little and little, but by slow and continuous progression, that the lace
mechanism of Nottingham has become developed into that condition of almost

perfection to which it has now attained. The excursionists wUl find in the
geology of this district much to invite their attention. Within a very few miles
many of the most interesting formations of the eai'th's crust come to the surface,

from the syenite at the base of the system to the more recent deposits of lias and
oolite. Coal and ironstone are \erj abundant ; and although it is to be regretted
that the tovra of Nottingham has not yet availed itself of the vast amoimt of
mineral wealth within its reach, yet, in the large undertakings of Biitterly, Rid-
dings, and other places, as well as the great extent to which the Midland Coal-
field is being wrought for the supply of distant countries, you will see evidences

mof the growth of a local industry, which, as I believe, is yet its infancy.

           By M. Bekgeeon, Manager of the Swiss Western Ea'ilways.

    The author proposes to propel the carriages through a tube by means of
 a column of air, and not to use exhaustion. This column of air he derives from
the gradual sinking of a large beU, or succession of beUs, after the manner of a gas-
 holder. The raising of the bells will be effected by means of the direct action
 of hydraidic power from an elevated head, where such is available, and in any
 case the power, whether water or steam, used for raising the bell is only auxiliary,
 as the ascending carriages will drive the air before them, and thus raise the bell a
 certain portion of the necessary elevation. M. Bergeron is about to construct a
 short line on this system at Lausanne, for connecting that town with the terminus
 of the present railway there. The tube is to be constructed of concrete, the
 materials for which can be obtained at a low cost.

Description of the Means employed for removing and replacing in a new por-

   tion the Iron Columns of a Fireproof Cotton Mill. By "William Faib-

   BAiRN, LL.D., F.R.S.

   The improvements that have been effected in the machinery for spinning cotton
have given rise to new conditions, new buildings, and new appliances to meet the
numerous changes that have taken place. The machinery for carding, roving and
spinning has been renewed three different times within a period of less than sixty

years, the old machines having been three times removed to give place to others
of a more improved construction. The old narrow buildings of former days have

consequently proved unequal to present wants, and it has been necessary either to

alter the old mills to suit the new machinery, or to build new ones. The latter

plan was occasionally preferred ; but more frequently the spinning-rooms of the old
mills were converted to the new mules, which from their increased number of
spindles had to be fixed in the longitudinal direction, instead of transversely as

formerly.

    Immediately after the invention of the mule by Crompton, or about the com-
mencement of the present century, a cotton-mill 45 feet in width was considered

of proper dimensions for mules of 350 to 400 spindles. Two of these mules
were looked upon for many years as the correct number for one man to work · and

this might have been continued for a longer period, but for the invention of the

self-acting mule by the late !Mr. Roberts and otners, which gave a new impetus to

the spinning process ; and in place of 400 spindles, as formerly, the mules of the
present day contain from 800 to 1000 spindles. This increase in the length of the
mule requires a corresponding increase of width in the mill ; and hence arose the
tower-like form of modern cotton factories, varying from 90 to 100, and in some-
cases from 110 to 120 feet wide.

In the construction of modern miUs no difficulty exists, as they are built to suit

the machinery ; whereas in adapting the old narrow buildings to "the new mules it

was necessary to break up the old mules, and place the new ones in the opposite

or longitudinal direction of the mill. In mills with wooden floors, this was easUy

accomplished by removing one row of columns to admit a pair of mules in the

middle                            but in  fireproof  buildings, constructed with  iron beams and brick arches
                               ;

the greatest possible care was necessary to be obsen'ed in effecting the desired

alteration, as illustrated in the case forming the subject of the present paper

where 90 to 100 tons of arches and machinery had to be supported on two columns

or one bay, in a building eight stories high, the mill being kept working during

the whole time the alterations were going on.

   The objection to this operation on the part of the proprietors, Messrs. M'Con-
nel and Co., was, that the columns could not be removed without cutting them
which might incur the danger of the floors above being " brought down by the
run." Each column had, in fact, to be cut in two, taken entirely out and new
ones substituted at the required distances apart. As the particulars may be useful
143 REPORT 1866.

and interesting, the writer offers the following description of the process by which
this object w.as successfully accomplished under his directions.

   The factory which required one row of cast-iron columns in each story to be cut
out and removed to a distance of 2 feet 8 inches, is a fireproof building, eight
stories high. It extends for 1(30 feet along Union Street, Manchester, fronting the
Rochdale Canal, and runs parallel with it as far as Murray Street, where it termi-
nates with an angular wing to a further distance of 80 feet. The width of the
mill is 45 feet, divided by two rows of columns of three equal spans of 15 feet each,
as seen in the annexed sectional diagram, which shows the position of the columns,
those cut out being represented by the dotted line n (fig. 1 ), and those which re-
placed them by the black line b. The columns indicated by the line c were not
disturbed. The figures d, e, f, g represent the position of the mule spinning-ma-
chinery, for the admission of which the original columns in the position of the dotted

                                                                                                                  Fig. 2.

line had to be removed. The other mules next the side walls had quite sufficient
room with the addition of the passage o, which extended along the side wall for
 the whole length of the mill.

    In can-ying out the process by which these alterations were effected the first con-

 sideration was, how to support the ends of the middle beams and arches during the
process of removing the columns from under them ; and also how to support the
middle beam permanently after the columns had been removed. This could not
be done simultaneously throughout the mill when at work, as it would have involved

 a very heavy expense to support the ends of all the middle beams at once, with a su-
 perincumbent weight on each of 90 tons of brick arches, and machinery. Moreover
 it was essential that only one pair of the old mules in each room should be stopped
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  143

at one time, and that only during the operation of fixing the new columns and

cutting out the old ones.

   The first thing to be done was therefore to prepare the new columns with
projecting brackets (as shown in sketch), of sufficient lengtli to reach beyond the
ends of the wall beam h (fig. 2), so as to support the ends of the middle one after the
old columns were removed. As it was impossible, however, to remove that part
of the column which went through the beams, it was necessary fii'st to fix the
new columns under the wall beams in the line d, and subsequently to cut out the
old ones at c progressively, as the work advanced from one end of the room
to the other. The bi-ackets on the new columns were made to project to about

the same extent on both sides ; but as the)' could not be extended the whole length

on the side next the original colunms, until the latter had been cut out and removed,

the bracket intended for supporting the end of the middle beam at c was left 12

inches short, so as to leave sufficient space for attaching the appar.atus for cutting

out the old column ; and a loose end was afterwards bolted to the bracket, and made
to fit the stump end of the old column after it had been neatly cut off and removed
as shown in sketch at c.

   The carrying out of this work was ably accomplished by the contractor, Mr.
Andrew Ker ; and in order to save time and labour, an apparatus was devised by
him to talie advantage of the shafts in motion, and thus to cut out the columns with
great rapidity and success. The apparatus itself consists of two cast-iron clips

embracing the column, and fomiing a table for supporting a spur-wheel, which
revolves roimd the colunm and cames a steel cutter. The wheel is driven by a
worm-shaft and pulley, which received motion from one of the driving-shafts in
each room. The shank of the cutter is screwed to receive the rachet, and by means
of a finger or peg the cutter receives the required advance, equivalent to the thickness

of the cut every time the rachet passes the finger.

   By this means the old colunms were quickly cut out and removed, and the

loose end of the bracket having been inserted, with two strong bolts, the end of
the middle beam was thus supported with the same security as if the original
columns had never been disturbed.

       Improvement in Pontoon Trains. By G. Fawctts, North Shields.

  A complete pontoon train has been arranged to go either way or turn on its

centre, vrith all the detailed fittings made reversible and interchangeable. This
is a combination of a light and strong waggon-frame, with traversing frames
between the wheels, where the beams and planks for forming the platform of a
bridge are packed in separate compartments for simxdtaneous handling, and are
secured there by a novel system of bolting, the load thus strengthening the
carriage and increasing its stability. Above these frames the required number of
inverted boats are packed.^See ' British Association Eeport of Transactions of
Sections,' 1863, pp. 172, 173, article " Waggons and Boats" (Newcastle). In form-
ing a bridge, the rowlocks on both gunwales form a double support for the beams,
which are scarphed and keyed together with bolts and forelocks. The bolts are of
an elliptical section, and fit into oblong holes and plates forming a rigid jointing.

On Locomotive Engines and Carriages on the Central Rail System for working

    J. B. Fell.

   It appeared that this work is proceeding most satisfactorily, and that it will pro-

bably be completed by the end of the year, and will be opened about May next.
When this is done, the line of rail will be mibroken between Paris and Brindisi,

on the Adriatic, from which port the Italian Government are nmning a line of
steamers to Alexandria. Should our Government adopt this route for our Indian

mails, as it is expected will be the case, instead of that of Marseilles, a savinw of

something l^ke forty hours will be effected in their transmission between Lomlon
and Alexandria. The works at Mont Cenis could be executed for £1000 per mile
for the railway, and £250 per mile for permanent way ; the stations would amount
to another £1000 per mile, the rolling stock amounting to £750 per mile, the total

cost being £300,000. The tolls were high, being double those charged on an
ordinary railway. Locomotive power for conveying passengers and goods over
the mountain cost Is. Ad. per passenger, and 4s. 8d. for each ton of goods. The
total revenue was estimated to amount to £100,000 per annimi. Assuming the
traffic to increase at the rate of 10 per cent., the whole of the capital woiild be
repaid within fom- years. The cost of this line would he-only one-third that of a
tunnel line. The working expenses would amount to 2 per cent, of the ordinary
expenses. There would be no probability that the line would be choked with
snow. About eight or nine miles of the line would be constructed in galleries
some of masonrv and some of wood.

An Invention for the Purpose of attaining greater Adhesion between the driv-
                  ing-wheel and the Rail. By W. D. Gainsfoed.

   The proposed plan consists merely in adding a second flange to the di'iving-
wheel. The two flanges being closer together at the base than the middle of the
rail, thus causing the weight of the wheels to be carried by the flanges pressing
upon the sides of the rail instead of the face of the tire. The tractive power

obtained by this means is 1|- to 1^ times the imposed weight.

   As the flange is flat, and the rail, an ordinary double headed one, is round in

section at the point where the tire touches it, the contact is little more than a
Eoint, and consequently there is no grinding between the flange and the rail, both

  ecoming as bright and smooth as the face of an ordinary rail.
   In passing round cm-ves, the inner rail is laid with a nan-ower head, so that it

falls to the bottom of the groove in the wlieel, rendering the latter of a smaller

diameter, and allowing it, if necessary, to slip, as in the ordinary railway wheel.

  A locomotive was constructed upon this principle to rum upon a colliery rail-

way. Its weight was 20 cwt. loaded ; 12 cwt. were borne by the driving-wheels,
and 8 by the leading -nheels.

   The gradients experimented upon were 1 in 14 and 1 in 7. Less a gradient of

1 in 14 the engine di-ew a load, including wagons of 5 tons, at a speed of 3 miles

per hour.
   Less the gradient of 1 in 7 the engine drew a load of 35 cwt. at about the same

speed.

   The dimensions of the engine were : cylinder 35 inches diameter, 10 inches

Btroke ; driving-wheels 12 inches diameter ; highest steam pressure 120 lbs. to

the inch.

Description of a Newly-invented System of Ordnaiiee. By W. D. Gatnsfoed.

The projectile thrown by the proposed gun is a sharp-edged disk, formed by the

jimction, at the basis of the frusta, of two equal and similar cones. Each frustum

IS half the height of the original cone, and each cone is one-third its base dia-

meter in height. Consequently, the major is three times the minor axis. The

disk is fixed in an upright direction, and the rotation is upon the minor axis. To

propel this projectile a gun is used, which internally consists of two parts, a

chamber for the powder and the barrel or receptacle for the shot. The barrel is

very short, so that when loaded the front of the disk is level with the mouth of

the gun. Direction is given by the close fitting of the sides of the ban'el to the

disk, rotation by a pin passed through the barrel in a hoiizontal direction, in its

lower part, so as to take hold in a notch cut in the edge of the disk. It is thus

evident that the disk, on leaving the gun, will acquire a rotation equal in speed at

the mouth to the speed of the disk itself where it last touches the catch. By

putting the catch nearly vmder the centre of the disk, a speed of rotation of the

peripheiy nearly equal to the initial velocity of the projectile would be obtained.

As, nowever, much less than this wiU suflice to keep the axis of the disk at right

angles to its line of motion, the catch is placed further back, and ofiers but little

resistance to the exit of the projectile. Thus an efficient rotation is obtained

without friction ; and fi-om the absence of friction great initial velocitj^ is obtained

and the recoil being small, from the same reason, large charges of powder may be
Aused.
        long maintenance of the A'elocity is ensm-ed by the shape and rotation

of the disk, which is more adapted for retaining its velocity than a conical or bolt-

shaped sliot. The recoil is small from the absence of friction, which in rifled guns
amounts to from one-third to one-half the power employed. In the proposed gun

the only recoil is that due to the simple propulsion of the shot. An experimental

gun has been made on this principle, tlirowiiig a shot of 4 lb. 2 oz. 'J'he charged
used was one-eleventh, or G oz. of powder. The first shot was fired from H.M.S.

' Cambridge,' the gunnery ship at IJevonport, at the target in the creek, a distance
of 1000 yards. The rotation was perfect, and the direction excellent. The gun
was again fired from Boviesand, Devonport, and gave a range of 2000 yards first

graze with the same chai-ge. Had the construction of the gun allowed a heavier
charge of powder, no doubt a much gi'eater range would have been obtained.

Further experiments were prevented by the cracldng of the gun at the muzzle.

    On the C'Jtalmers Target. By Captain Douglas Galtok, F.E.S., F.G.S.

   The target may be understood by looking upon it as a beam, in which the top
flange is the front plate, the bottom flange a thinner plate behind, these two
flanges being kept apart by means of a web of plates at right .angles to the flanges.
These intermediate plates are supported laterally by layers of wood to prevent
their brealdng. The author stated that the results of the experiments made

by the Iron Plate Committee had been most successful, and showed that the prin-
ciple was con'ect.

The author described the method by which he secures the durability of his

rubber. Its high degree of insulation was pointed out, and its durability under

very trying conditions, over long periods of time, conflrmed by experiments con-

ducted by Sir Charles Bright, Capt. Mallock, and others. It was stated that

Mr. Latimer Clark had found it unnecessary to ship Mr. Hooper's cables in water-

tanks                         and the  Ceylon  cable, now  on  its  way  out,  is  coiled  dry.  The inductive

capacity of Mr. Hooper's wire remains practically the same at all temperatures,

while that of gutta percha increases considerably at 100^ Fahr. Diagrams, repre-

senting the effects of pressure and immersion, were shown, from wliicli it was seen

that pressure improves the insulation of his wire in the same waj' as is observed

with gutta percha. The result of carefully conducted experiments, extending

over three years, proves that the absorpticjjj of water is so small that the most

refined electrical tests failed to discover it.

lime, which, when the water from the engines is brought to bear upon it, expands

greatly, and forces out the walls to the destruction of the building. He advocated

the use of a concrete formed frorii gypsum, wliich is not liable to tliis defect. The
g^sum, which is of a coarse and inexpensive character, is formed into plaster of

JParis by roasting, and mixed with a peculiar kind of clay found in connexion with

the beds of gypsum.

warning,  to stop the                                                          engine in case     the cable fouled any part of                                                            the ship                                    and the

author had seen a cable broken owing to the impossibilty of stopping the engine
soon enough. Moreover, even when the above precautions were taken, it was

impossible to avoid a considerable variation of .strain, due to the pitching of the

ship, which   alternately slackened                                                               and  lengthened the cable as it hung vertically
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

and in most cases in the author's experience cables, while being picked up in great

depths, liad broken from this cause. All these dangers were avoided by the ma-

chinery invented by the author, of which two models were shown. These two

Aforms were identical in principle.                                                                    spur-wheel, fast on a main shaft, driven by

the engine, geared into another spur-wheel centered in the periphery of a brake-

drum, loose on the main shaft, and restrained from turning by an Appold's brake

the second spur-wheel in one form geared directly into an internal-toothed wheel

bolted on the picking-up drum, which was also loose on the main shaft above

mentioned. When the brake-drimi was stationary, the engine simply drove the

brake-drum through the spiu'-wheels in the ordinary manner ; but when the strain

on the cable reached the amoimt corresponding to that given by the weight

restraining the brake-drum, the picking-up drum ceased to revolve, because the

brake-di-um turned instead, carr3ang round the second or intermediate spur-wheel,

which rolled inside the internal-toothed wheel, instead of driving it ; the centre

on which this intermediate spur-wheel worked might be looked on as a fidcrum,

and the wheel itself as a lever, by which the engine pushed roimd the picking-up

drum : if the fulcrum yielded, the weight could not be lifted. The second form

Aof model was exactly similar in principle.                                                                      second intermediate wheel, of dif-

ferent diameter, fast on the same shaft as the first, geared into an external-toothed

spur-wheel connected with the picking-up drum. The action was identical with

that already described. If the strain increased beyond that required to stop the

picking-up drum, it would turn in the other direction, and the cable would be paid

out instead of picked up, although the engine would continue to run. in the same

direction as before, and exerted the same power. In practice, as was shown by

the  models,  the                                                              engine  might  be  driven  at  any speed                                                              the  cable would only be
                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

subject to the strain chosen, which might be increased or diminished at will; it

would come up quicker or slower as the ship fell or rose ; it woidd stop whoUy if

the cable fouled                                                               it would be paid   out if, ft'om  inattention, the ship drifted out of
                                                                            ;

position, or from any other cause the strain increased on the cable. More than

this, the cable might actually be paid out as the ship rose, and picked up as it fell,

and the whole would take place with perfect smoothness and constancy of strain.

The Appold brake gave a constant restraining power to the bralce-drum, whatever

the coefficient of friction might be. The gear exhibited formed at once a paying-

--out and picking-up machine. It might be termed an accm-ate slip-coupling, and

could be applied to many purposes as, for instance, to the measiu-ement of steam

power let out. With one of these couplings on the transmitting shaft, it would

be impossible to overload the shaft. Similarly, the coupling would serve to pre-

vent a break-down in cases where the machinery was liable to sudden starts or

stoppages. It woidd prevent undue strains on the ropes of collieries and lifts, and

other applications would readily occm- to mechanical men.

         On Zinc Sheathinc/ for /S7»jjs. By Samuel J. Mackie, F.G.S.

   Iron ships are subjected to a great amount of corrosion, and are so liable to
foul, that sailing-ships of iron cannot be sent on long A'oyages. Copper sheathing,
or Muntz's metal, cannot be applied to iron ships as it is to wooden ones, because
the iron being positive to copper, electrical action would be set up, by which the
iron woidd be destroyed at a greatly increased rate. If, then, a metal were found
which should be positive to iron, when the two metals were in contact in sea-
water, the conditions of the voltaic battery formed by the iron ship and its
sheathing would be reversed, and the sheathing would be destroyed while the

Airon would be preserved. further condition was required to be satisfied, namely,

that the metal forming the sheathing should not be destroyed too quickly, but
only sufficiently to prevent the growth of animal and vegetable parasites by the
slow but constant scaling of the surface. Such a metal was zinc, the cost of which
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                         147

was about two-tliirds that of copper, and the electro-chemical action upon it was
not only so slow as not to exceed the action of salt water upon the copper sheath-
ing on a wooden vessel, hut this action it was possible to control within certain
limits. These results have been confirmed by careful experiments made under the
dii'ection of the Admiralty at Portsmouth, where zinc-sheathed ii-ou plates had
been submerged for eighteen months, and had been taken up bright and clear of
any kind of fouling whatevei*. The method had been invented and patented by
Mr. T. B. Daft, C.E., who had also devised a plan for the construction of iron ships,
by which, instead of close-fitting butt-joints, the plates were lap-jointed on to a
back strap, with an intervening space of about au inch wide, which was filled
with a caulking of compressed teak, into which the nails were driven for fastening

the zinc sheathing to the hull of the ship. By this plan of construction a flush

surface was obtained, while the strength of the ship would be increased, and as
fouling woidd be entirely prevented by the zinc sheathing, iron ships could here-
after be sent on the longest voyages. One of the commercial results of this appli-

cation of that sheathing would therefore be the doubling of the iron ship-building
trade through the demand for iron instead of wooden sailins--vessels.

On the Theory of the Influence of Friction upon the MecJianical Efficiency of

principle. Let be the indicated work of a given quantity of steam, without

of heat required for the prevention of liquefaction in the cylinder.

Remarks on the Experiments of the Committee npon the Resistance of Water

   to Floating and Immersed Bodies, By Prof. W. J. Macquorn Rankine,

    LL.D., F.E.SS. L. 4- E.

   The author said that his object in reading the present paper was not so much to
bring forward an}- opinions of Iiis own as to open the way for a discussion on the
·subject of the resistance of water to bodies passing through it. The custom of the
Association was that a Report shoidd be discussed ; and, therefore, when it was

desired to hold a discussion on the subject of a Report, it became necessary to read

a commimication from some individual on the same subject. With respect to
the experiments recorded in the Report, he would observe that they formed a body
of facts which were available for every inqiurer to reduce in his own way. From
a brief investigation of their results, by the aid of graphic projection, he believed
that the following conclusions might safely be di'awn :--

   1. That agreeably to what was previously known as to the resistance of water to
the motions of bodies of small dimensions at low speeds, the resistance increased,
on the whole, somewhat more slowly than the square of the velocity.

   2. That when the velocitj' went beyond the maximum velocity suited to the

length, according to Mr. Scott Russell's rule (that is to say, about 3| ft. per second,
the models being 4 ft. long), the resistance showed a tendency to increase at a

rnoro rapid rate, and the water became so much disturbed by waves as to make it

difficult, and sometimes impracticable, to continue the experiments.

  A3. That while the midship section of model was to that of model B as 1-57

                                                                                                   10*

A Bto 1, and the meau girth of model was to that of model as l'4o to 1, the re-
Asistance of model was to that of model B in a somewhat less ratio than the

latter proportion, though not very much less at moderate speeds.
   4. That the resistance of model A, when just covered with watei', was almost

exactly douhle of its resistance at the same speed when half immersed.
   5. That the resistance of model B, when immersed to about three-and-a-half

times its depth, was sensibly more than double its resistance when half immersed.
   The author adverted to the great mass of detailed inforjnation as to the propul-

sion of vessels which had been accumulated by the late Committee on Steamship

performance ; and stated his opinion tliat much good might be done by digesting

and condensing that information, which at present was in a form too voluminous

for practical use.

    M.R.I. A.

   This particular kind of powder has been much experimented upon, both in Bel-
gium and in France, with a view to counteract the injurious elfect which is pro-
duced when large charges of powder are used in heavy ordnance. The principle
on whicli this barytic powder is compounded is simply that of substituting nitrate

of barytes in the composition of tlie gunpowder, instead of saltpetre, in certain

proportions, the consequence being that the powder, when ignited, consumes more

slowh', and the gases are developed less rapidly than in ordinary gunpowder,
while the same effect is produced upon the projectile as regards its ultimate
velocity. This lessens the injmious efiect upon tlie sides, vent, and chamber of the
piece of artillery. Capt. Wynants entered into the details of a very large number

of experiments made with this powder. The general result to be deduced from
these experiments is, that we have to choose between imparting a higher degi'ee of
velocity to the projectile, at the risk of damaging the piece more rapidly and more
considerably, or confining oin* attention to the American plan of projecting heavier
shot at a lower velocity. The preponderating feeling in the minds of English

engineers and artillerists, and particularly of sailors, is for a higher degree of
velocity, with a smaller weight of shot. The question is an exceedingly interest-
ing one, and lias excited considerable attention both in Belgium and in France, as

it has done in Prussia and America. If these experiments could be continued, we
should obtain some very useful information on the subject. Capt. Wynants con-

sidered that the principal difficulty in dealing with the present enormous artillery
arose from the too rapid consumption of the powder, by which the generation of
gas was so rapid that the interior of the gun was destriictivelv atfocted before the
projectile was moved. Capt. Wjiiants found that by substituting nitrate of barytes
for saltpetre in the composition of gunpowder the rapidity of the combustion was

--reduced without the propelling force of the powder lieing diminished in fact, the

propelling force was rendered more uniform in its action.
