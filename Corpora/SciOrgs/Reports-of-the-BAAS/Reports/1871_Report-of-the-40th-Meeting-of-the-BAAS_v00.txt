Report of the Council for the Year 1869-70, presented to the General
     Committee at Liverpool, on Wednesday, September lAth, 1870.

   The Couucil have received the visual reports from the General Treasurer

and'from the Kew Committee. Their reports for the past year will he laid

before the General Committee this daj'.
   The Council have to report upon the action they have taken relative to

each of the four resolutions referred to them by the General Committee at

Exeter.

   The first of these resolutions -svas
    " That the Council be requested to take into their consideration the ex-

isting relations between the Kew Committee and the British Association."

   The Council accordingly appointed a Committee of their own body to ex-
amine into these relations. This Committee had before them a special report

drawn up by the Kew Committee, and, after due deliberation, they recom-

mended

  V" That the existing relations between the Kew Observatory and the TB.ritisTh-

Association be continued unaltered until the completion, in 1872, of the mag-
netic and solar decennial period ; but that after that date ail connexion be-

tween them shall cease."

    The Council adopted this recommendation, and now ofi"cr it, as their own,

 to the General Committee.

    The second resolution referred to the Council was as follows :
    " That the full iuiiueuce of the British Association for the Advancement of
 Science should at once be exerted to obtain the appointment of a Eoyal Com-

 mission to consider

        First. The character and value of existing institutions and facilities for
               scientific investigation, and the amount of time and money devoted

                 to such purposes

       Secondly. What modifications or augmentations of the means and faci-

                lities that are at present available for the maintenance and exten-

                   sion of science are requisite ; and,

        Thirdly. In what manner these can be best supplied."

    By a third resolution the Council was " requested to ascertain whether the

 action of Government in relation to the higher scientific education has been in
 accordance with the principles of impartiality which were understood to guide
 them in this matter ; and to consider whether that action has been well cal-
  culated to utilize and develope the resources of the country for this end, and
  to favour the free development of the higher scientific education. That the

 Council be requested to take such measures as may appear to them best cal-
 culated to carry out the conclusions to which they may be led by these

  inquiries and deliberations."
     The Committee of the Council appointed to consider these two resolutions

reported their opinion to be favourable to the appointment of a Boyal Com-
mission to inqnire into the relations of the State to scientific instrnction and

investigation ; and they added that no such inquiry would, in their opinion,
be complete which did not extend itself to the action of the State in relation
to scientific education, and the cifcct of that action upon independent edu-

cational institutions.

   Your President and Coimcil, acting on the advice of this Committee, con-
stituted themselves a Deputation and waited upon the Lord President of the
Council. They are glad to be able to report that their efforts to bring this
important subject before Her Majesty's Government have been attended with
success. On the 18th of May, Her lilajesty issued a Commission " to make
inquiry with regard to Scientific Instruction and the Advancement of Science,
and to inquire Avhat aid thereto is derived from grants voted by Parliament
or from endowments belonging to the several universities in Great Britain
and Ireland and the colleges thereof, and whether such aid could be rendered
in a manner more cifectual for the purpose." The Commissioners ai)pointed
by Her Majesty are the Duke of Devonshire, the Marquis of Lansdowne, Sir
John Lubbock, Bart., Sir James Phillips Kay Shuttleworth, Bart., Bernard

Samuelson, Esq., M.P., Dr. Sliarpey, Professor Huxley, Dr. W. A. MiUer,
and Professor Stokes. J. Norman Lockyer, Esq., F.P.S., has been appointed

Secretary to the Commissioners, who, up to last July, were engaged taking
evidence with great assiduity, and have now adjourned their meetings until
November. There is every reason to hope that valuable results will follow
from their deliberations.

   The fourth resolution which the General Committee referred to the Council
was

   " That the rules under which Members arc admitted to the General Com-

mittee be reconsidered."

  A Committee of the Council devoted considerable care to a revision of the

existing rules. The modified rules approved by the Council are now submitted

for adoption to the present General Committee, whose constitution is, of
course, not aftcctcd thereby. The most important of the proposed changes

are that henceforth new claims to membership of the General Committee shall
be forwarded to the Assistant General Secretary at least one month before
the next ensuing Annual Meeting of the Association ; that these claims shall
be submitted to the Council, whose decision i:pon them is to be final ; and

that henceforth it is not the authorship of a paper in the Transactions of a
scientific society which is alone to constitute a claim to membership of the
General Committee, but the publication of any works or papers which have
furthered the advancement of any of the subjects taken into consideration at
the Sectional meetings of the Society.

    Your Council has, also, had under its consideration the desirability of re-
moving certain administrative inconveniences which arise from the circum-
stance that the next place of meeting is never decided upon by the General
Committee until near the close of the actual meeting. They are of opinion
that the arrangements of the General Ofiiccrs would be greatly facilitated,
and at the same time the convenience of those who invite the Association con-
sulted, if the General Committee were to decide upon each place of meeting
a year earlier than they do at present. In order to make the transition
from the existing practice to the proposed one, your Council recommend that
two of the invitations which will be received at the present Meeting be ac-
cepted, one for 1871, and another for 1872.

    It has often been urged that the Association labours under disadvantages
REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.  xlv

in consequence of its not possessing central offices in London, where its
Council and numerous committees could hold their meetings, where the books
and memoirs which have been accumulating for years could be rendered
accessible to Members, and where information concerning the Association's
proceedings could be promptly obtained during the interval between annual
meetings. The Council have had the subject under consideration, and in the

event of the establishment at Kew being discontinued, they arc prepared to

recommend that suitable rooms, in a central situation, should be procured.
The additional annual expenditure which this would involve would probably

not exceed .£150.

   The Council having been informed by the Local Officers of their desire to
have ilr. Reginald Harrison appointed as an additional Local Secretary, to
assist in making arrangements for the present Meeting, have nominated that
gentleman to the office.

   Mr. Arnold Baruchson and Mr. "Wm. Crosflcld, Jun., have also been nomi-
nated Local Treasurers, vice Mr. Duckworth resigned.

   The Council have added the names of Professor H. A. Newton and Pro-
fessor C. S. Lyman, who were present at the Exeter Meeting, to the Hst of
Corresponding Members.

    Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for the

                         Advancement of Science for 1869-70.

  The Committee of the Kew Observatory submit to the Council of the British

Association the following statement of their proceedings dm-ing the past

year :

   At the Meeting of the General Committee at Exeter it was resolved that

the existing relations between the Kew Committee and the British Associa-

tion be referred to the Council to report thereon.

   In consequence of this resolution, the Kew Committee on the 23rd No-

vember, 1S69, prepared for the infox-mation of the Council a statement on
the past and present condition of the Observatory, which was presented to
the Council on the 11th December.

   In this statement it was shown that while the establishment at Kew Ob-

servatory received its main support from the British Association, and was

under the control of that body, yet much of the apparatus in use at Kew was

furnished from other sources. Thus the Eoyal Society had from the Go-
vernment-Grant Fund sujiplied the establishment with the apparatus for
testing Barometers, with that for testing Sextants, with the dividing-machine
for constructing Standard Thermometers, and also with the set of Self-
recording Magnetographs at present in use, while from the Donation Fund
they had furnished the Photoheliograph and the Whitworth lathe and plan-

ing-machine. -

   The Roj-al Society had likewise defrayed from the Donation Fund the
expense of introducing gas into the Observatory, and of building a house for
the verification of magnetic instruments, besides whicli they had borne from
the Government-Grant Fund since 18-63 the whole expense of working the
Photoheliograph (including the purchase of a Chronometer) and of reducing

its results.

   The instruments used at Kew for determining tlie absolute magnetic

elements are the property of Her Majesty's Government, and have been lent
xlvi  KEPORT 1870.

to the Kew Observatory by the Magnetic Office at Woolwicli, under tbe di-

rection of Sir E. Sabine, and many of those magnetic instruments with which

Kew has been the means of furnishing scientific travellers have been derived

from the same source.

   Of late Kew has become the Central Observatoiy of the Meteorological Com-

mittee, and a commodious workshop has been erected near the Observatory
by that Committee, since otherwise the main buUding would have been too
small for the access of work consequent upon the arrangement entered into.

   The statement prepared hj the Kew Committee contained likewise a sum-

maiy of the scientiiic work done at the Observatory, as well as some

interesting liistorical remarks connected with the origin of the establish-
ment, drawn np by Sir C. Wheatstone, and in this shape it was submitted

to the Council of the British Association.

   The Council decided to recommend " that the present relations between

the Kew Observatory and the British Association be continued unaltered until

the completion, in 1872, of the magnetical and solar decennial period ; that
after that date all connexion between them shovdd cease."

   In consequence of this recommendation, the Kew Committee were led to
contemplate the dissolution of the Kew establishment in 1872, and they

became anxious to make such arrangements as might enable them to complete
their scientific labours in a creditable manner before the time of the antici-
pated dissolution. The magnetic work in particular caused them anxiety

for the annual income of the establishment is insufficient to permit of that
work being fully completed by the time of the Annual Meeting of the Asso-
ciation in 1872. Under these circumstances the Chairman offered to sup-
plement the deficiency (see Appendix, p. Ivi). It will be seen by this Eeport

that the magnetical tabulations and reductions are now proceeding very fast.
   The recommendation of the Council was also a matter of anxiety to the

Superintendent, Mr. Stewart ; and as the Professorship of Natural Philosophy

at Owens College, Manchester, became vacant about this time, he applied
for the appointment and was successful in obtaining it.

    This will render it necessary for Mr. Stewart to reside in Manchester, but

the staff at the Observatory are such that Mr. Stewart will undertake by
their aid to assist the Committee in the superintendence of the work of the
Observatory until IS o

 --1. Magnetic Worl: In the present state of magnetical science it would

appear to be desirable to preserve as completely as possible the details of

observations ,so that future theorists may have a large and valuable source of

information by which to test tlieir speculations.
   The Committee are therefore desirous that by the autumn of 1872 a

manuscript record should be completed, containing aU the hourly tabulated

values from the Kew Magnetographs arranged in monthly tables.

    This record should be carefully preserved, along with the original photo-
graphic traces, in the Archives of the Association.

   Pursuing the method indicated by Sir E. Sabine, and adopting the sepa-
rating values finally determined by him, the Committee further propose to
obtain monthly results indicating the following points for each of the three

--magnetic elements, distributed according to the hour of the day ;
                      REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                                                             xlvil

       1. Aggregate of clistui'bancc tending to increase the numerical values.
       2. Aggregate of disturbance tending to decrease the same.
       3. Solar-diurnal range of the undisturbed observations.

They suggest that the monthly results embodying these facts should be

published in detail.

Finally, they propose to continue the discussion of tlie Lunar-Diurnal

variations commenced by Sir E. Sabine, and carried on by him up to the end of

the year 1864. In order to work this scheme with sufficient rapidity to com-

plete it before the autumn of 1872, additional assistance has been procured, the

expense of which has been defrayed by the Chairman. Mr. "Whipple, Mag-
netical Assistant, has displayed much zeal and ability in organizing the work

and in superintending its immediate execution.

Already the hourly numerical values of the three magnetic elements have

been obtained and tabulated in monthly forms from the commencement of

the series in 1858 to the present date ; and considerable progress has also been

made in the next step of the reduction.

  A Unifilar, formerly em^jloyed by Captain Haig, and of which the constants

have been determined at the Observatory, has been lent to Lieut. Elagin, of

the Russian Navy, for use in the Japanese seas and elsewhere.

  A Dip-circle by Dover has been verified and sent to Prof. JeHnek, of

Vienna, and another, by the same maker, has been verified for Dr. A. B.

i[eyer, for use in the East Indies. This gentleman has likewise received

magnetic instruction at the Observatory.

  A Dip-circle by Adie, furnished with a deflecting cylinder aj^paratus, has

been verified and dispatched to Prof. Bolzani, of the University of Kasan.

Three Dipping-needles have likewise been constructed for Dr. Bergsma, of

Batavia, and one for Mr. Chambers, of the Colaba Observatory, Bombay.

A Deflection-bar has been procured and verified for the Eussian Central

AObservatory.  Dechnometer has been sent to the Lisbon Observatory, and

a Fox's Circle has been lent to Dr. Keumayer, after having been repaired by

Adie.

The instrument de\-ised by Mr. Broxm for the purpose of estimating the

magnetic dip by means of soft iron, and constructed at the expense of the

British Association in pursuance of a resolution of that Body passed at the

Oxford Meeting, has been forwarded to that gentleman at his request.

The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-

tinue to be made by Mr. Whipple, Magnetic Assistant.

A paper erabodying the results of the absolute observations of Dip and

Horizontal Force, made at Kew from April 1863 to April 1869, has been

communicated by the Superintendent to the Eoyal Society, and published in

the ' Proceedings ' of that body. The results obtained evidence the accuracy

with which the monthly observations have been made bj- Mr. Whipple.

The Self-recording Maguetographs are in constant operation as heretofore,

also under his charge                                                                                          and the photographic department connected with these
                                                                                                            ;

--instruments remains under the charge of Mr. Page.
   2. Meteorohgical worJc. The meteorological work of the Observatory

continues in the charge of Mr. Baker.

    Since the Exeter Meeting, 150 Barometers have been verified, and 30 have
been rejected ; 11 60 Thermometers and 103 Hydrometers have likewise been
verified. Nineteen Standard Thermometers have been constructed for Prof.
Tait, and two for the Meteorological Ofiice.

   The self-recording meteorological instruments now in work at Kew will
xlviii                   --REPORT 1870.

be again mentioned in the second division of this Report. These arc in the

--charge of Mr. Baker, the photography being superintended by Mr. Page.
   3. Photoheliogvajih. The Kew Heliograph, in charge of Mr. Warren De La

Rue, continues to be worked in a satisfactory manner. During the past year
351 pictures have been taken on 237 days.

    It was considered desirable that sis prints should be obtained from each
of the negatives of the sun-pictures taken at the Observatory during the
whole time that the Photoheliograph should remain at work, Avhich will pro-
bably be from February 1862 to February 1872.

   In order to accomplish this, an outlay of ^120 spread over two years was
found to be necessary, and this sum has been voted from the Donation Fund

of the lioyal Society.

  A large number of these prints has already been obtained, and it is pro-

posed to present complete sets to the following institutions :

        The Royal Astronomical Society,
        The Imperial Academy of Paris,
        The Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg,
        The Royal Society of Berlin,
        The Smithsonian Institution, United States,

leaving one set for the Royal Society.

  A paper embodying the positions and areas of the sun-groups observed at

Kew during the years 1864, 1S65, and 1866, as well as fortnightly values

of the spotted solar area from 1832 to 18G8, has been communicated to the

Royal Society by Messrs. Warren De La Rue, Stewart, and Locwy.

This paper is in the course of publication in the Philosophical Trans-

actions, aud wUl shortly be distributed.

  A Table exhibiting the number of sun-spots recorded at Kew during tho

year 1869, after the manner of Hofrath Schwabe, has been communicated to

the Astronomical Society, and published in their Monthly IS'oticcs.

   M. Otto Struve, Director of the Imperial Observator}- at Pulkowa, visited

England in the month of August last. He brought with him, for the Kew

Observatory, some sun-pictures made at Wilna with the photoheliograph,

which, it will be recollected, was made some years ago, under the direction

of Mr. De La Rue, by Mr. Dallmcyer. This instrument combines several

important iuaprovemeuts on the original Kew model, the value of which i.s

forcibly brought out in the superior definition of the Wilna sun-pictures. As,

however, the series of the ten-yearly record at Kew was commenced with

the instrument as originally constructed, it was not deemed desirable to alter

it in any way initil the series had been completed and reduced, and the

corrections for optical distortion ascertained and applied. In the event of

the sun-work being continued after 1872, it wiU be desirable to do so with

a new and improved heliograi)h.

   M. 0. Struve proposed to exchange tlie complete series of pictures obtained

at Wilna for that made at Kew. He also stated that it is contemplated to

--Aerect a second heliograph at the Central Observatory at Pulkowa.
4. Miscellaneous Worlc.  few experiments have been made on the ro-

tation of a disk in vacuo. By an arrangement devised by Mr. Beckley, a

very perfect carbonic-acid vacuum has been obtained, the residual pressure

being 0-02 inch as indicated by a mercurial gauge with a contracted tube, but

it was believed that the vacuum was even more perfect.

  A disk of paper and one of ebonite gave very sensible heat effects in such

a vacuum, and it was hoped that the experiments might have been satisfac-

torily completed ; but while they were iu progress the pressure of the outer
atmosphere shattered the receiver into a number of pieces, fortunately without
any injury to the experimenters.

   Another receiver has now been made, and it is purposed in future to use

it with a cover.

  A Transit instrument has been lent to Mr. G. J. Symons, and one Sextant

has been verified.

(B) "WoEK DONE AT KeW AS THE CENTRAL OBSERVATORY OF THE

                          Meteorological Committee.

It is stated in the Eeport for 1867 that the Meteorological Committee had

appointed Mr. Balfour Stewart as their Secretary, on the understanding that

he should, with the concurrence of the Kew Committee, retain his office of
Superintendent of the Kew Observator}^

On the 8th October, 1869, Mr. Stewart resigned his appointment as Secre-

tary to the Meteorological Committee and Director of their Central Obser-

--vatory a step which took effect on 31st of March, 1870, and which was

followed by a modification of the relation between the two Committees.

The Meteorological Committee, at their Meeting on 12th November, 1869,

resolved that they were prepared to make the following proposals to the

Council of the British Association :

  I. That Kew be continued as one of the ordinary self-recording observa-

tories, in which case the Committee would bo prepared to allot to it annu-

ally £250 ; or,

  II. In addition to the foregoing work, that Kew be maintained as the

central observatory for examination of records and tabulations from all the

other observatories, in which case the Committee will be prepared to allot a

further annual sum of £400.

  The Kew Committee having been furnished with this resolution of the

Meteorological Committee, resolved that it bo recommended to the Council

of the British Association that Kew be continued for the next two years as

one of the ordinary self-recording observatories of the Meteorological Com-

mittee, that body allowing it annually £250 ; and that, in addition, it bo
maintained as the central observatory for the examination of the records and
tabulations from all the other observatories, for the further sum of .£400 per
annum. This arrangement was approved by the Council ; and it was there-

upon resolved by the Kew Committee, that out of the £650 received from the

Meteorological Committee, £200 be given to Mr. Stewart for superintending

the meteorological work of the Observatory, this resolution to take efi'ect after

31st March, 1870.

  --1. Work clone at Kew as one of tJie Observatories of the Meteorological Com-

mittee. The Barograph, Thermograph, and Anemograph furnished by the
Meteorological Committee are kept in constant operation. Mr. Baker is in
charge of these instruments. From the first two instruments traces in du-
plicate are obtained, one set being sent to the Meteorological Office and one

retained at Kew ; as regards the Anemograph, the original records are sent,

while a copy by hand of these on tracing-paper is retained. The tabulations

from the curves of the Kew instrument are made by Messrs. Baker, Page,

--and Foster.
   2. Verification of Records. The system of Checks devised by the Kew

Committee for testing the acciiracy of the observations made at the different

Observatories continues to be followed, the only alteration being that the Kew

Staff, at the suggestion of the Meteorological Office, have undertaken to rule
on the Barograms and Thermograms a set of zero lines, which are of great
use in Pantagraphic operations.

    Mr. lligby continues to perform the main part of this -work ; Mr. Baker,

Meteorological Assistant, having the general superintendence of the de-
partment.

  --3. Occasional Assistance. The Meteorological Committee have availed

themselves of the permission to have the occasional services of Mr. Beckley,

Mechanical Assistant at Kew ; and ho has lately been visiting the various

observatories of the Meteorological Committee.

    The Self-recording Eaiu-gauge mentioned in last Eeport as having been
devised by Mr. Beckley has been adopted by the Meteorological Committee,
and instruments of this kind are at present being constructed for their various

Observatories.

   The Staff at Kew continue to make occasional absolute hygrometrical ob-

servations by means of Eegnault's instrument, "with the view of testing the
accuracy of the method of deducing the dew-point from the observations with
the dry- and wet-bulb thermometers.

   Two erections have been made in the grounds adjoining the Observatory
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and on one of these a large Robinson's Anemometer is placed, while a small
instrument of the same kind is placed on the other.

   By this means the indications of the large and those of the small-sized
instrument may be compared with each other. The cost of this experi-
ment has been defrayed by the Meteorological Committee.

                    Appendix to Keio Report of 9th September, 1870.

At the Meeting of the Kcw Committee held at Burlington House on 2nd March

       1870, it was Resolved that the remarks by Sir E. Sabine and Mr. Stewart
       be printed, along with extracts from the Eeport for 1866-G7, and from
       the Minutes of June 18, 1869 ; and that copies be forwarded to the
      several Members of the Committee, with a statement by Mr. Stewart
       as to the manner in which he proposes to complete the reductions, so as
        to carry out the Resolutions of the Committee.

                                                            No. 1.

 Memorandum by General Sir E. Sabino regarding the Investigations for

      v/hich the loan of the Kew Photograms from 1857 to 1862 was re-

          quested.

                                                                                                        March 1, 1870.

The photograms here referred to were duly received at Woolwich, and duly

returned to Kcw ; Mr, Gassiot has a paper stating the dates at which the

several photograms were returned to Kew.
    The investigations for which these documents were temporarily borrowed

formed the substance of a paper presented to the Royal Society in June 1863,
and printed in the Philosophical Transactions of that year (Art. XII.). The
REPORT OP THE KEW COMMITTEE.  H

 1st Section contained a Tabular Synopsis of ninety-five of the principal dis-

turbances of the Declination recorded by the Kew photograms from January

 1858 to December 1862, with a comparison of the Laws of the Distui-bances
derived therefrom with the Laws derived by the more usual method then
practised. The tabular summary at the close of Section 1 shows the result-
ing aggregate values both of Easterly and of "Westerly disturbance at each
of the 24 hours (or at 24 equidistant epochs) in each of the five years, as
well as in the whole period. It is strictly a tabular detail for the period in
question, showing the Disturhance-cliurnal Variation as it would result if the
investigation were limited to the 95 most disturbed days, and may be con-
sidered to represent the mode of investigation then practised by some mag-

neticians.

   The 2nd Section of the paper compared the Laws of the Disturbances thus
obtained with the Laws derived from a wider selection of disturbed obser-
vations ; i. e. a selection including eveiy anomalous record of which the ano-
malous character cannot with probability be ascribed to any other source than
that of the disturbing action whose laws are sought. This Section is also
accompanied by a tabular statement in full detail ; and from an examination
of the contents of the 1st and 2nd Sections the following conclusions arc
drawn :

        1. That the disturbances have systematic laws :

      2. That both easterly and westerly deflections have eacli their own

           systematic laws, distinct and different each from the other
        3. That the laws are approximately the same, whether derived from the

           more limited or the more extended selection, though the latter com-

          prises three times as many cases of disturbance as the former.

   Hence it is inferred that, by taking into account only the most notable
days of disturbance (as was then the practice of some magneticians), an
approximately correct view of the disturbance-diiu-nal variation may be ob-
tained ; but, if we desire to eliminate the influence of the distiu'bances on
the diurnal variation due to other causes, the more comprehensive method
must be adopted.

  A selection of this latter character was then made for the five years 1858

to 1862, and the results exhibited, both in tabular and graphical represen-
tations ; and the laws derived therefrom were compared with corresponding

investigations in other parts of the globe.

    In the 4th Section of the paper is discussed the " Diurnal Inequality,"
comprehending 1°, the disturbance-diurnal variation, and 2°, the undisturbed

solar-diurnal variation. This discussion may be regarded as exhibiting what

should be ih.Q primary step in the analysis of the periodical variations.
   The solar-diurnal variation derived from the record of the five years at

Eew, 1858 to 1862, is then compared with solar-diurnal variations similarly
obtained at Toronto, Nertschinsk, Pekin, St. Helena, the Cape of Good
Hope, and Hobartou ; and the several points of agreement or difference are

discussed.

   In the same 4th Section, the semiannual inequality which is seen to exist
at all the stations enumerated above is discussed, and is shown to manifest
a solar influence, evidenced by the diiferences exhibited in different parts of

the globe.

   In Section G the Lunar-diurnal Variation derived in each of the five years

                                                                        d2

are disciisscd, and a semiannmil variation is shown to exist having epochs

--coincident (or nearly so) with the equinoxes a conclusion which is shown

to be in accordance with similar investigations at Hobarton, 8t. Helena, and

the Cape of Good Hope.
   The 8th Section establishes the existence of an " annual variation " or " se-

miannual ineqiiality" of the Inclination and of the horizontal and total Forces,

derived from the observations made at Kew in 1858 to 1862, with instiii-

ments which had been supplied by the Magnetic Office at Woolwich, and

employed by Mr. Chambers at Kew. The calculation of the Kew results

made at the Woolwich Office was shown to be in accordance with the pheno-
mena at Hobarton, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope.

  A subsequent paper, communicated bj" mo to the Royal Society in 1866,

contained the Lunar-diurnal Variation of the three magnetic elements derived

from the Kew photograms from January 1858 to December 1864, being an

extension of two years upon the records discussed in the former paper, and

limited only by the epoch to which the photograms had then been carried,

i. e. to the close of 1804. The general agreement of the Kew results with

those derived at Hobarton and Philadelphia was satisfactorily established by

the discussion of the Kew records up to the date of December 1864, and

se\eral points of difference in minor respects, requiring further investigation,

were indicated : for these the continuation of the Kew photograms, subse-

quently to December 1864, may be expected to sujiply the materials.

                                 (a)

   What appears now to be required is the continuation of the same process

of examination, and comparison with the results obtained at other stations,

of the results derivable from the Kew photograms in the years which have

elapsed since the investigations were completed of which an account had thus

been given.
   These additional years are from December 31, 1864, to December 31, 1869,

i. e. five years. And this is the work which, if I correctly understood the
resolution of the Kew Committee, passed (I think) at the Meeting before the

last (viz. in June 1809), the Superintendent was requested to proceed with.

Suggestions by Mr. Stewart as to the best form of Publication of the llesults

              derived from the Traces of the Kew Magnetographs.

In the present state of magnetical science, it would appear to be desirable to

--preserve as completely as possible the details of the original observations,

course similar to that which has been pursued by Dr. Neumayer in his de-

scription of the results of the Elagstaif Observatory, Melbourne.

                                               Photographic Traces.

   The original documents of the Kew Observatory arc the photographic

traces. As these are supposed to be liable to fade in the course of time, I
woiild suggest that a careful copy of them on tracing-paper would be the
simplest and least expensive mode of retaining them. Such a copy would
not be sufficiently accurate for investigations regarding peaks and hoUows,
KEPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.  liu

 but these phenomena will, it is hoped, be investigated before the time whcii

 the Observatory ceases to be connected with Ihe British Association.
    The curves are as yet all in good order. The whole expense of preserving-

 traces would probably not much exceed .£100. And I would suggest that I

 might with propriety direct to this object a grant of .£100 which I have at
 present in hand from the Eoyal Society for procuring impressions of mag-

 netic curves.

                             (h) Hourly Tuhvlations from Traces.

    The documents next in order are the hourly tabulated numerical values,
as exhibited in monthly tables for each of the elements. Although indi-
A'idual results of this nature have been published by Dr. Neumayer, the cost

of the piiblication of the Kew series in this country would be very great

and bearing in mind tlie limited reference to such individual results, I would
suggest that a carefully preserved manuscript record would probably be suf-

ficient.

           (c) Separation of Disturbances and Solar-Diurnal Variations.
    Pursuing the method indicated by Sir E. Sabine, and adopting the sepa-
rating value finally determined by him, we should obtain monthly results

indicating the following points for each of the three elements, distributed
according to the hour of the day :

        1. Aggregate of disturbances tending to increase the numerical values.
        2. Aggregate of disturbances tending to diminish the same.
        3. Solar-diurnal range of the undisturbed observations.

   I would suggest that the monthly results embodying these facts should
be published in detail. The publication Avould not probably occupy more
than thirty-six quarto pages well filled with figures.

                                       Lunar-Diurnal Variations.

    Adopting Sir E. Sabine's method of treating these, I would suggest, in
addition, a classification according to the relative position of the sun and

moon. We might perhaps have quarterly means of lunar days, each quarter

being divided into four groups representing the four well-known relative
positions of the sun and moon.

   This might occupy about fifteen quarto pages well filled with figures.

                    (d) Secidar C]ian(/e and Semiannual Inequality.

   Presuming that these elements are best determined for the two compo-
nents of magnetic force from the absolute observations, I would suggest that,
as regards the declination. Sir E. Sabine's plan be pursued. As he has al-
ready given the details of his results up to the end of 1863, it would only be
necessary to continue these up to the time when the series is complete.

                                             Remarlcs on the ahove.

    If a condensed series of results be published as above, and if, in addition,
the traces and hourly observations be preserved, as is suggested, future theo-
rists would have a large and valuable source of information by which to test
their speculations. I should be happy, had I the opportunity of using such
a series, to discuss it after the manner that Sir E. Sabine has indicated in
the very valuable papers which he has presented to the Royal Society.

Memorandum containiug extracts from the Minutes of the Kew Committee

relating to Magnetic Reductions, and containing also an estimate of

the probable Expense of carrying out the list of suggestions (paper

No. 2).

                      Eew Observatory,

                      4tb March, 1870.

My deak Sie,

        In accordance with the wish expressed at the last Meeting of the Kcw

Committee for full information regarding the present state of the magnetic
reductions, I beg to send you the following statement :

   The first extract bearing on this subject is one from the Report of the Kew

Committee to the Aberdeen Meeting of the British Association. It is as

follows :

   " As the staff of assistants at the Observatory is not sufficiently large to
" undertake these tabulations, General Sabine has undertaken to have the

" results tabulated at "Woolwich for every hour."

   In a scheme for the working of the Observatory after it became the cen-

  .

tral Observatory of the Meteorological Committee, I suggested that it would
be very desii'able to undertake the tabulation and reduction of the magnetic

curves.

    Simultaneously with this scheme, their Report to be presented to the

Meeting of the Association in 1867 was discussed by the Kew Committee,

--and in the Report the following statement occurs ;

   " The magnetic curves produced at Kew previously to the month of

" Jauuarj' 1865 have aU been measured and reduced, under the direction of
" General Sabine, by the staff of his office at "VYoolwich ; and the results of
" this reduction have been communicated by General Sabine to the Royal

" Society in a series of interesting and valuable memoirs. It is now pro-

" posed that the task of tabulating and reducing these curves since the above

" date be performed by the staff at Kew working under the direction of Mr.

" Stewart."

   In accordance with this resolution, the magnetic tabulations were proceeded

with as fast as the funds at the disposal of the Observatory would allow, and
the exact progress made was from time to time reported to the Committee.

   In my Report to the Meeting of the Kew Committee held on June 18,

1869, the following passage occurs :

    " In the present organization of the Observatory, it is the surplus funds
" that are devoted to magnetic reductions; but it will hardly be possible be-
" fore the yearly accounts are closed to state the probable amount of the

" sm-plus.
    " It is, however, imagined that if the probable sur^dus for the year

" 1869-70 be anticipated and devoted to tabulation while the summer wea-
" ther lasts, then before the end of next whiter session the reductions will

 " be very far advanced for all of the three magnetic elements."

   At the same Meeting the following resolution was passed :

   Resolved,--" That Mr. Balfour Stewart be authorized to apply the eur-
" plus funds iu his hands to tho tabulation and reduction of the magnetio
REPORT OF THE UEW COMMITTEE.                                                        Iv

" photographic records ; and that he be requested to have the work done

--*' with as much rapidity aa is consistent with accuracy the final reduction

" to include both monthly and annual means, but in the first instance the
" phenomena of the disturbances from 1863 to 1870 to be proceeded with.

   " In reference to Mr. Balfour Stewart's proposal that a more intimate
" comparison between solar and magnetic records be made, it was resolved
" that he bo requested to prepare such a comj)arison for one magnetic ele-
" ment, for a whole period of solar disturbance, for the consideration of the
" Committee."

   Erom all these extracts it will, I think, appear that the Committee con-

sidered that they would have funds sufiicient to tabulate and reduce the
magnetic curves since the beginning of 1865, the date at which Sir E. Sabine
left off tabulating, and that any resolution having reference to curves of a
previous date did not contemplate any retabnlation of such curves. I con-

ceive, therefore, that at present I am under obligation to tabulate and reduce

the curves obtained since the beginning of 1865, the Committee acting on
the supposition that the funds which accrue to the Observatory from various
sources are sufficient for this purpose. If, however, the Committee should
consider that, in addition to this, it would bo desirable to systematize the

whole Kew results "after the method indicated in the suggestions by me which

accompany this letter, it would be quite possible to accomplish this work
before 1872, and to do so without materially interfering with the work of the
Observatory ; but it would require additional funds for the purpose ; in fact,
the question resolves itself into one of expense. The following estimate, pre-
pared by Mr. Whipple, and revised by mo, wiU give a tolerably good idea of

the probable expense of doing this :

                                                                    («)    £ s. d:

                                                                           63

                                                                         100

   This sum would probably enable aU these suggestions to be complied with,
except those relating to the means connected with the luuar-diurual varia-
tions. The production of such means since 1865 will, of course, form part
of the reductions at present in hand, and it would bo very easy to give the

tables such a shape as to exhibit a classification according to the relative
position of the sun and moon. If the results of this proved sufficiently
valuable, the same classification might be afterwards extended to the results
pi'ovious to 1865, provided the details of such results have been obtained and

preserved by means of the outlay of ,£472 14s., as mentioned above. This
particular form of reduction does not appear so pressing ; and as it would
cost i£130 to recast the individual results previous to 1865 into the precise

form of lunar tables mentioued in tho suggestions, this matter may be allowed

to wait,
--Ivi REPORT 1870.

   But the other matters mentioned in these siTggcstions are, I think, of
greater importance, more especially as, in the very valuable paper of results
produced by Sir E. Sabine, there would appear to have been contemplated
an exhibition to the world of the most valuable and important facts derived

from the Kew results, rather than an exhaustive reduction of the same (sec

paper No. 1), The Committee might, therefore, if the above outlay were
incurred, exhibit the distribution over the various months of every year of

the disturbed observations for the whole Kew series, and also esiubit the

solar-diurnal variations of the horizontal and the vertical force.

   If it be allowable to devote to this pui-pose £100 which I have in hand
from the Eoyal Society, it would so far lessen the expense, and in this case
c£400 might be regarded as the extreme limit of what would be incui-rcd.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE.                     Ixi

   That no Committee shall raise money in the name or under the auspices of
the British Association without special permission from the General Com-
mittee to do so ; and that no money so raised shall be expended except in

accordance with the rules of tlic Association.

l)urpose of reporting on Metric Standards, in reference to the communication
from Professor Jacobi, appended hereto.

   The Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburgh obser%-ing that the Standard
Metric Weights and Measures of the various coimtries of Europe and of the

United States, differ by sensible, though small, quantities from one another,
express the opinion that the continuance of these errors would be highly
prejudicial to science. They believe that the injurious effects could not be
guarded against by private labours, however meritorioiis, and they have
therefore recommended that an international commission be appointed by

the countries interested to deal with this matter. They have decided to

bring the subject before the Eussian Government, and have appointed a Comf-

mittee of their own Body, who have drawn up a careful Eeport containing

valuable suggestions ; and they have deputed Professor Jacobi to lay this

llcport before the British Association, and to request the Association to take

action in reference to it.

That Mr. AY. H. L. Eussell be requested to continue his Eeport on recent

progress in the theory of Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Functions.

lime " for the preservation of our indigenous animals ; and that Mr. Dresser

be the Secretary.

   That the Committee appointed last year " to consider and report on the

various plans proposed for legislating on the subject of Steam-Boiler Ex-

plosions with a view to their prevention," be requested to continue their

Wm.labours ; such Committee consisting of Sir  Fairbairn, Bart., Sir Joseph

 whether any ste])s can be taken by them, or by the Association, -which wiU
 tend to reduce to its minimum, the suffering entailed by legitimate physiolo-
 gical inquiries ; or any which will have the effect of employing the influence of
 this Association in the discouragement of experiments which are not clearly
 legitimate on live animals.

     The following resolution subsequently passed by the Committee of Section

 D (Biology) was adopted

     That the following gentlemen be appointed a Committee for the purpose of

--carrying out the suggestion on the question of Physiological Experiments

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE.                           Ixiii

 Resolui'ions referred io the Council for consideration and action if it
                                            seem desirable.

  That the discontimiance of the maiutenance of Kew Observatory by the

British Association having been determined on, the President and Council bo
authorized to communicate with the President and Council of the Poyal
Society, and with the Government, so that the future use of the Buildings

may in 1872 be placed at the disposal of the Eoyal Society, in case the Royal

Society should desire it, under the same conditions as those Buildings are
at present held by the British Association.

   That the Council be empowered to cooperate with the Eoyal and Astrono-

mical Societies, in the event of a new application being made to Government,

to aid in the observation of the Solar Eclipse of December 1870.
   That the Council be requested to take such steps as they deem wisest, in

order to urge upon Government the importance of introducing Scientific In-
struction into the Elementary Schools throughout the Country.

   That the Council of the British Association be authorized, if it should

appear to be desirable, to urge upon Her Majesty's Government the expedi-

ency of proposing to the Legislature a measure to insure the introduction of
the metric system of weights and measures for international purposes.

   That it is inexpedient that new Institutions for the teaching of Science,

pure or applied, such as the proposed Engineering College for India, should

be established by Government, imtil the Eoyal Commission now holding an

inquiry into the Eelation of the State to Scientific Instruction shall have
issued their Eeport. That the Council of the British Association be requested
to consider this opinion, and should they see fit, to urge it upon the atten-

tion of Her Majesty's Government.

THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY, LL.D., E.E.S.,

                                 PRESIDENT.

Mr Lord?, L.vdies, and Gentleitex,

It has long been tho custom for the newly installed President of the British

Association for tho Advancement of Science to take advantage of the elevation

of the position in which the suffrages of his colleagues had, for the time,

placed him, and, casting his eyes around the horizon of the scientific world,
to report to them what could be seen from his watch-tower ; in what direc-
tions the multitudinous divisions of the noble army of the improvers of

natural knowledge were marching ; what important strongholds of tlie great
enemy of us all, Ignorance, had been recently captured ; and, also, with duo
impartiality, to mark where the advanced posts of science had been driven

in, or a long-continued siege had made no progress.
   I jjropose to endeavour to follow this ancient precedent, in a manner suited

to the limitations of my knowledge and of my capacity. I shall not presume to

attempt a panoramic survey of the world of Science, nor oven to give a sketch

of what is doing in the one great province of Biology, with some portions of

which my ordinary occupations render me familiar. But I shall endeavour

to put before you the history of the rise and progress of a single biological

doctrine ; and I shall try to give some notion of the fruits, both intellectual

and practical, which we owe, directly or indirectly, to the working out, by

seven generations of patient and laborious investigators, of the thought
which arose, more than two centuries ago, in the mind of a sagacious and

observant Italian naturalist.

    It is a matter of every day experience that it is difficult to prevent

many articles of food from becoming covered with mould ; that fruit, sound

enough to aU appearance, often contains grubs at the core ; that meat, left to

itself in the air, is apt to putrefy and swarm with maggots. Even ordinary

water, if allowed to stand in an ojjen vessel, sooner or later ^becomes turbid

and full of living matter.

The philosophers of antiquity, interrogated as to the cause of these pheno-

mena, were provided with a ready and a plausible answer. It did not enter

their minds even to doubt that these low forms of life were generated in the

matters in which they made their appearance. Lucretius, who had drank

deeper of the scientific spirit than any poet of ancient or modern times ex-

Ixxiv  REPORT 1870.

 cept Goethe, intends to speak as a philosopher, rather than as a poet, when
 he writes that " with good reason the earth has gotten the name of mother,
 since all things arc produced out of the earth. And many living creatures,

 even now, spring out of the earth, taking form by the rains and the heat of
 the sun"*. The axiom of ancient science, " that the corruption of one thing
is the birth of another," had its popular embodiment in the notion that a seed
 dies before the young plant springs from it ; a belief so widespread and so
fixed, that Saint Paul appeals to it in one of the most splendid outbursts of

 his fervid eloquence :

    " Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die"t.
    The proposition that life may, and does, proceed from that which has no
life, then, was held alike by the philosophers, the poets, and the people, of the
most enlightened nations, eighteen hundred years ago ; and it remained the
accepted doctrine of learned and unlearned Europe, through the Middle Ages,
down even to the seventeenth century.
   It is commonly counted among the many merits of our great country-
man, Harvey, that he was the first to declare the opposition of fact to vene-
rable authority in this, as in other matters ; biit I can discover no justification
for tWs widespread notion. After careful search through the ' Exercita-

tiones de Generatione,' the most that appears clear to me is, that Harvey

believed all animals and plants to spring from what he terms a " primor-
clium vegetale," a phrase which may nowadays be rendered " a vegetative
germ ; " and this, he says, is " oviforme," or " egg-like ; " not, he is

careful to add, that it necessarily has the shape of an egg, but because
it has the constitution and nature of one. That this " prhnordium oviforme"
must needs, in all cases, proceed from a living parent is nowhere expressly

maintained by Harvey, though such an opinion may be thought to be implied

in one or two passages; while, on the other hand, he does, more than once,
use language which is consistent only with a full belief in spontaneous or
equivocal generation t- In fact, the main concern of Harvey's wonderful
little treatise is not with generation, in the physiological sense, at all,
but with development ; and his great object is the establishment of the

doctrine of epigeuesis.

    The first distinct enunciation of the hyjiothesis that all living matter has
sprung from preexisting living matter, came from a contemporary, though a

junior, of Harvey, a native of that countiy, fertile in men great in all de-
partments of human activity, which was to intellectual Europe in the six-

* It is thus that Mr. Munro renders :

       " Linquitur, ut merito niaternum nomen adepta
         Terra sit, e terra quoniam sunt cuneta creata.
         Multaque nunc etiam exsistunt animalia terris

         Imbribus et calido solis concreta vapore."

                                         De Rerum Natura, lib. v. 793-79G.

But TTOuld not the menning of the last line be better rendered " Developed in rain-water

--and in the warm vapours raised by the sun ? "     f 1 Corinthians, iv. 36.

quod ex 2}i(fredine oriunda sint : sed quod casu, naturaj sponte, et a^quivocS. (ut aiunt)

generatione, a parentibus sui dissimilibus proveniant." Again, in ' De Uteri Membranis' :

" In cunctorum viventivim generatione (sicut diximus) hoc solenne est, ut ortum ducunt a

primordio aliquo, quod turn mnteriam turn efficiendi potestatem in se habet; sitque adeo

id, ex quo et a quo quicquid nascitur, ortum suum ducat. Tale primordium in anima-

libus {sive ab aliis generantibus 2>^'ovenianf, sive spotife, cnit c.v puti-cdhw iiasccntur) est

respecting Harvey's opinions, 'Esperienzc,' p. 11.

tecnth and seventeenth centuries what Germany is in the nineteenth.
It was in Italy, and from Italian teachers, that Harvey received the most

--important part of his scientific education. And it was a student trained in the

same schools, Francesco Eedi a man of the widest knowledge and most versa-

tile abilities, distinguished alike as scholar, poet, physician, and natru'alist,
who, just two hundred and two years ago, pubhshed his ' Esperienze intorno
alia Generazione degl' Insetti,' and gave to the world the idea, the growth of

which it is my purpose to trace. Eedi's book went through five editions in

twenty years ; and the extreme simplicity of his experiments, and the clear-
ness of his arguments, gained for his views, and for their consequences,

almost universal acceptance.

   Eedi did not trouble himself much with speculative considerations, but
attacked particular cases of what was supposed to be " spontaneous genera-
tion " experimentally. Here are dead animals, or pieces of meat, says he
I expose them to the air in hot weather, and in a few days they swarm with
maggots. You tell me that these are generated in the clead flesh ; but if I

put similar bodies, while quite fresh, into a jar, and tie some fine gauze
over the top of the jar, not a maggot makes its appearance, while the

dead substances, nevertheless, putrefy just in the same way as before.

It is obvious, therefore, that the maggots are not generated by the cor-
ruption of the meat ; and that the cause of their formation must be a some-
thing which is kept away by gauze. But gauze will not keep away aeriform
bodies, or fluids. This something must, therefore, exist in the form of sohd
particles too big to get through the gauze. Nor is one long left in doubt
what these solid particles are ; for the blowflies, attracted by the odour of the
meat, swarm round the vessel and, urged by a powerful but, in this case,
misleading instinct, lay eggs, out of which maggots are immediately hatched,
upon the gauze. The conclusion, therefore, is unavoidable; the maggots are
not generated by the meat, but the eggs which give rise to them are brought
through the air by the flies.

   These experiments seem almost childishly simple, and one wonders how it

was that no one ever thought of them before. Simple as they are, however,
they are worthy of the most careful study, for every piece of experimental
work since done, in regard to this subject, has been shaped upon the model
furnished by the Italian philosopher. As the results of his experiments
were the same, however varied the nature of the materials he used, it is
not wonderful that there arose in Eedi's mind a presumption, that in all

such cases of the seeming production of life from dead matter, the real ex-
planation was the introduction of living germs from without into that dead

matter*. And thus the hypothesis that living matter always arises by the

                                                                                           ;

forward, a right to be considered and a claim to be refuted, in each particular

case, before the production of li\dug matter in any other way could be

admitted by careful reasoncrs. It will be necessary for me to refer to this

hypothesis so fre(iuently, that, to save circumlocution, I shall call it the

--hypothesis oi Biogenesis ; and I shall term the contrary doctrine ^that living
--matter may be produced by not living matter the hypothesis of Ahiogenesis.

   In the seventeenth ceutury, as I have said, the latter was the dominant
view, sanctioned alike by antiquity and by authority; and it is interesting to
observe that Kedi did not escape the customary tax upon a discoverer of
having to defend himself against the charge of impugning the authority of

the Scriptures * ; for his adversaries declared that the generation of bees
from the carcass of a dead lion is affirmed, in the book of Judges, to have
been the origin of the famous riddle with which Samson perplexed the

Philistiaes

             " Out of the eater came forth meat,

              And out of the strong came forth sweetness."

    Against all odds, however, Hedi, strong with the strength of demonstrable
fact, did splendid battle for Biogenesis ; but it is remarkable that he held the
doctrine in a sense which, if ho had lived in these times, would have infallibly

caused him to be classed among the defenders of " spontaneous generation."
" Omne vivum ex vivo," " no life without antecedent life," aphoristically
sums up B-edi's doctrine ; but he went no further. It is most remark-
able evidence of the philosophic caution and impartiality of his mind, that,
although he had speculativel)' anticipated the manner in which grubs really
are deposited in fruits and in the galls of plants, he deliberately admits that
the evidence is insufficient to bear him out ; and he therefore prefers the
supposition that they are generated by a modification of the living substance

of the plants themselves. Indeed, he regards these vegetable growths as
organs, by means of which the plant gives rise to an animal, and looks upon
this production of specific animals as the final cause of the galls and of, at

any rate some, fruits. And he proposes to explain the occurrence of para-
sites within the animal body in the same way t.

t The passage (Esperienze, p. 129) is ·n-orth quoting in full:

    It is of great importance to apprehend Redi's position rightly; for

the lines of thought he laid down for lis are those upon which naturalists

have heen working ever since. Clearly, he held Biogenesis as against Abio-

genesis ; and I shall immediately proceed, in the first place, to inquu-o how
far subsequent investigation has borne him out in so doing.

   But Eedi also thought that there were two modes of Biogenesis. By the
one method, which is that of common and ordinary occurrence, the living

parent gives rise to offspring which passes through the same cycle of changes

--as itself like gives rise to like ; and this has been termed Homogeyiesis.

By the other mode, the living parent was supposed to give rise to offspring
which passed through a totally different series of states from those exhibited
by the parent, and did not return into the cycle of the parent : this is what
ought to be called Heterogenesis, the offspring being altogether, and perma-
nently, unlike the parent. The term Heterogenesis, however, has unfor-
tunately been used in a different sense, and M. Milne-Edwards has there-
fore substituted for it Xenogenesis, which means the generation of something

foreign. After discussing Eedi's hypothesis of universal Biogenesis, then,

I shall go on to ask how far the growth of science justifies his other hypo-

thesis of Xenogenesis.

   The progress of the hypothesis of Biogenesis was triumphant and un-
checked for nearly a century. The application of the microscoi^e to anatomy
in the hands of Grew, Leeuwcnhoek, Swammerdam, Lyonet, Yallisnieri,
Eeaumur, and other illustrious investigators of nature of that day, displayed
such a complexity of organization in the lowest and minutest forms, and

everywhere revealed such a prodigality of provision for their multiplication
by germs of one sort or another, that the hypothesis of Abiogenesis began
to appear not only untrue, but absurd ; and in the middle of the eighteenth

century, w'hen Needham and Buffon took up the question, it was almost

universally discredited*.

But the skill of the microscope-makers of the eighteenth century soon

Areached its limit.  microscope magnifying 400 diameters was a chef-

cVceuvre of the opticians of that day, and, at the same time, by no means

trustworthy. But a magnifying-power of 400 diameters, even when de-

finition reaches the exquisite perfection of our modern achromatic lenses,

Ahardly suffices for the mere discernment of the smallest forms of life.

speck, only ^^ of an inch in diameter, has, at 10 inches from the eye, the

same apparent size as an object , ^^m,, of an inch in diameter, when mag-

nified 400 times ; but forms of living matter abound the diameter of which is

Anot more than ^nroinr '^^ ^^ inch.     filtered infusion of hay, allowed to

stand for two days, will swarm with living thiiigs, among which any which

reaches the diameter of a human red blood-corpuscle, or about .^ .,\ ^ of an
inch, is a giant. It is only by bearing these facts in mind that we can deal

fairly with the remarkable statements and speculations put forward by Buifon

and Needham in the middle of the eighteenth century.

"When a portion of any animal or vegetable body is infused in water, it

gradually softens and disintegrates ; and, as it does so, the water is found to

swarm with minute active creatures, the so-called Infusorial Animalcules, none

of which can be seen, except by the aid of the microscope ; while a large pro-

portion belong to the category of smallest things of which I have spoken,

and which must have aU looked like mere dots and lines under the ordinary

microscopes of the eighteenth century.

Led by various theoretical considerations which I cannot now discuss, but

which looked promising enough in the lights of that day, Buftbn and Need-

ham doubted the applicability of Eedi's hypothesis to the infusorial animal-

cules, and jS^eedham very properly endeavoured to put the question to an ex-

perimental test. He said to himself, if these infusorial animalcules come

from germs, their germs must exist either in the substance infused, or in the

water with which the infusion is made, or in the superjacent air. Now the

vitality of all germs is destroyed by heat. Therefore, if I boil the infusion,

cork it up carefully, cementing the cork over with mastic, and then heat the

whole vessel by heaping hot ashes over it, I must needs kill whatever germs

are present. Consequently, if Redi's hypothesis hold good, when the infu-

sion is taken away and allowed to cool, no animalcules ought to be developed

in it ; whereas, if the animalcules are not dependent on preexisting germs,

but are generated from the infused substance, they ought, by-and-by, to make

their appearance. Needham found that, under the circumstances in which

he made his experiments, animalcules always did arise in the infusions, when

a sufficient time had elapsed to aUow for their development.

In much of his work Needham was associated with Buflbn, and the results

of their experiments fitted in admirably with the great French naturalist's
hypothesis of " organic molecules," according to which, life is the indefeasi-

ble property of certain indestructible molecides of matter, which exist in aU

living things, and have inherent activities by which they are distinguished

from not living matter. Each individual living organism is formed by their

temporary combination. They stand to it in the relation of the particles of

water to a cascade, or a whirlpool ; or to a mould, into which the water is

poured. The form of the organism is thus determined by the reaction be-

tween external conditions and the inherent acti%'ities of the organic mole-

cules of which it is composed ; and, as the stoppage of a whirlpool destroys

nothing but a form, and leaves the molecules of the water with aU their

inherent activities intact, so, what we call the death and putrefaction of an

animal, or of a plant, is merely the breaking up of the form, or manner of
ADDRESS.                                      Ixxix

association, of its constitxient organic molecules, wliich are then sot free as

infusorial animalcules.

    It will be perceived that this doctrine is by no means identical ^vith

Abiogenesis, with which it is often confounded. On this hypothesis, a piece

of beef, or a handful of hay, is dead only in a limited sense. The beef is
dead ox, and the hay is dead grass ; but the " organic molecules " of the beef
or the hay are not dead, but are ready to manifest their vitality as soon as
the bovine or herbaceous shrouds in wliich they are imprisoned are rent by
the macerating action of water. The hypothesis therefore must be classified
under Xenogenesis, rather than under Abiogenesis. Such as it was, I think
it will appear, to those who will be just enough to remember that it was pro-
pounded before the birth of modern chemistry and of the modern optical arts,
to be a most ingenious and suggestive speculation.

  --But the great tragedy of Science the slapng of a beautiful hypothesis

--by an ugly fact which is so constantly being enacted under the eyes of phi-

losophers, was played, almost immediately, for the benefit of Bufi'ou and
Needham.

   Once more, an Italian, the Abbe SpaUanzani, a worthy successor and repre-
sentative of Eedi in his acuteness, his ingenuity, and his learning, subjected
the experiments and the conclusions of Keedham to a searching criticism.
It might be true that Needham's experiments yielded results such as he had

described, but did they bear out his arguments ? Was it not possible, in the

first place, that he had not completely excluded the air by his corks and

mastic ? And was it not possible, in the second place, that he had not suf-

ficiently heated his infusions and the superjacent air ? SpaUanzani joined
issue with the English naturalist on both these pleas ; and he showed that
if, in the first place, the glass vessels in which the infusions were contained
were hermetically sealed by fusing their necks ; and if, in the second place,
they were exposed to the temperature of boiling water for three-quarters of
an hour *, no animalcules ever made their appearance within them. It must
be admitted that the experiments and arguments of SpaUanzani furnish a

complete and a crushing reply to those of J^Ieedham. But we aU too often

forget that it is one thing to refute a proposition, and another to prove the

truth of a doctrine which implicitly, or expUcitly, contradicts that proposition
and the advance of science soon showed that though ISTeedham might be quite
wrong, it did not foUow that SpaUanzani was quite right.

   Modern Chemistiy, the birth of the latter half of the eighteenth century,
grew apace, and soon found herself face to face with the great problems
which Biology had vainly tried to attack without her help. The discovery
of oxygen led to the laying of the foundations of a scientific theory of re-
spu-ation, and to an examination of the marveUous interactions of organic
substances with oxygen. The presence of free oxygen appeared to be one
of the conditions of the existence of life, and of those singular changes in
organic matters which are known as fermentation and imtrefaction. The

question of the generation of the infusoiy animalcules thus passed into a

new phase. For what might not have happened to the organic matter of the
infusions, or to the oxygen of the air, in SpaUanzani's experiments ? What
security was there that the development of life which ought to have taken

place had not been checked, or prevented, by these changes ?
   The battle had to be fought again. It was needful to repeat the expe-

riments under conditions which would make sure that neither the oxygen

* See SpaUanzani, ' Opere,' vi. pp. 42 & 51.
IxXX                  BEPORT 1870.

of the air, nor the composition of the organic matter, was altered, in such a

manner as to interfere with the existence of life.
   Schulze and Schwann took up the question from this point of view in

1836 and 1837. The passage of air through red-hot glass tubes, or through

strong sulphuric acid, does not alter the proportion of its oxygen, while it

must needs arrest, or destroy, any organic matter which may be contained in

the air. These experimenters, therefore, contrived arrangements by which

the only air which should come into contact Avith a boiled infusion should be
such as had either passed through red-hot tubes, or through strong sulphuric
acid. The result which they obtained was that an infusion so treated deve-
loped no living things, while if the same infusion was afterwards exposed to
the air such things appeared rapidly and abundantly. The accuracy of these
experiments has been alternately denied and aiFirmed. Supposing them to

be accepted, however, all that they really proved was, that the treatment to

which the air was subjected destroyed something that was essential to the
development of life in the infusion. This " something " might be gaseous,

fluid, or solid; that it consisted of germs remained only an hypothesis of

greater or less probability.

   Contemporaneously with these investigations a remarkable discovery was

made by Cagniard de la Tour. He found that common yeast is composed of

a vast accumulation of minute plants. The fermentation of must, or of wort,

in the fabrication of wine and of beer, is always accompanied by the rapid

growth and multiplication of these Toridce. Thus fermentation, in so far as

it was accompanied by the development of microscopical organisms in enormous

numbers, became assimilated to the decomposition of an infusion of ordinary

animal or vegetable matter ; and it was an obvious suggestion that the
organisms were, in some way or other, the causes both of fermentation and of

putrefaction. The chemists, with Berzelius and Liebig at their head, at first

laughed this idea to scorn; but in 1843, a man then very young, who has

--since performed the unexampled feat of attaining to high eminence alike iu

Mathematics, Physics, and Physiology, I speak of the illustrious Helmholtz

--reduced the matter to the test of experiment by a method alike elegant

and conclusive. Helmholtz separated a putrefying, or a fermenting liquid,

from one which was simply putrescible, or fermentable, by a membrane, which

allowed the fluids to pass through and become intermixed, but stopi)ed the

passage of solids. The result was, that while the putrescible, or the

fermentable, liquids became impregnated with the results of the putrescence,

or fermentation, which was going on on the other side of the membrane, they

neither putrefied (in the ordinary way) nor fermented ; nor were any of the

organisms which abounded in the fermenting, or putrefying, liquid generated

in them. Therefore, the caiise of the development of these organisms must

lie in something which cannot pass through membrane; and as Helmholtz's

investigations were long antecedent to Graham's researches upon colloids, his

natural conclusion was, that the agent thus intercepted must be a solid ma-

terial. In point of fact, Helmholtz's experiments narrowed the issue to this
that which excites fermentation and putrefaction, and at the same time gives

rise to living forms iu a fermentable, or putrescible, fluid, is not a gas and is

not a diff'usiblo fluid ; therefore it is either a colloid, or it is matter divided

into very miniite solid particles.

The researches of Schroeder and Dusch in 1854, and of Schroeder alone in

1859, cleared wp this point by experiments which are simply refinements

Aupon those of Eedi.  lump of cotton-wool is, physically speaking, a pile of

many thicknesses of a very fine gauze, the fineness of the meshes of which
                 ADDRESS.                                                                                                                                                      Ixxxi

depends upon the closeness of the compression of the wool. Now, Schrocder
and Dusch found, that, in the case of all the putrefiable materials which they

used (except milk and yolk of egg), an infusion boiled, and then allowed to
come into contact with no air but such as had been filtered through cotton-

wool, neither putrefied nor fermented, nor developed living forms. It

is hard to imagine what the fine sieve formed by the cotton-wool could

have stopped except miniite solid particles. Still the evidence was incom-

plete until it had been positively shown, first, that ordinary air does contain

such particles ; and, secondly, that filtration through cotton-wool arrests
these particles and allows only physically pure air to pass. This demon-

stration has been furnished within the last year by the remarkable experi-

ments of Professor Tj'ndall. It has been a common objection of Abiogenists

that, if the doctrine of Biogeny is true, the air must be thick with germs ; and
they regard this as the height of absurdity. Eut Nature occasionally is ex-

ceedingly unreasonable, and Professor Tyndall has proved that this particular

absurdity may nevertheless be a reality. He has demonstrated that ordinary

air is no better than a sort of stirabout of excessively minute sohd particles
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

that these particles are almost wholly destructible by heat; and that they are

strained off, and the air rendered optically p\ire, by being passed through

cotton-wool.

   Eut it remains yet in the order of logic, though not of history, to show
that, among these solid destructible particles, there really do exist germs

capable of giving rise to the development of living forms in suitable menstrua.

This piece of work was done by M. Pasteur in those beautiful researches

which will ever  render his name famous                                                                                                                            and which,  in spite of all attacks
                                                                                                                                                                ;

upon them, appear to mo now, as they did seven years ago*, to be

models of accurate experimentation and logical reasoning. He strained air

through cotton-wool, and found, as Schrocder and Dusch had done, that it
contained nothing competent to give rise to the development of life in fluids

highly fitted for that purpose. Eut the important further links in the chain
of evidence added by Pasteur are three. In the first place, he subjected to
microscopic examination the cotton-wool which had served as strainer,
and found that sundry bodies, clearly recognizable as germs, were among

the solid particles strained off. Secondly, he proved that these germs

Avcre competent to give rise to living forms by simply sowing them in a solution

fitted for their development. And, thirdly, he showed, that the incapacity of

air straiued through cotton-wool to give rise to life, was not due to any occult
change eflPected in constituents of the air by the wool, by proving that the

cotton-wool might be dispensed with altogether, and perfectly free access left
between the exterior air and that in the experimental flask. If the neck of
the flask is drawn out into a tube and bent downwards ; and if, after the con-

tained fluid has been carefully boiled, the tube is heated sufficiently to destroy

any germs which may be present in the air which enters as the fluid cools,
the apparatus may be left to itself for any time, and no Hfe will appear in
the fluid. The reason is plain. Although there is free communication

between the atmosphere laden with germs and the germless air in the flask,

contact between the two takes place only in the tube ; and as the germs

cannot fall upwards, and there are no currents, they never reach the interior
of the flask. But if the tube be broken short off where it proceeds from the
flask, and free access be thus given to germs falling vertically out of the air,

Ixxxii  --REPORT 1870.

the fluid whicli has remained clear and desert for months, becomes, in a few

days, turbid and full of Ufe.
    These experiments have been repeated over and over again by independent

observers with entire success ; and there is one very simple mode of seeing
the facts for one's self, which I may as well describe.

    Prepare a solution (much used by M. Pasteur, and often called " Pasteur's
solution ") composed of water with tartrate of ammonia, sugar, and yeast-ash
dissolved therein*. Divide it into three portions in as many flasks ; boU all
three for a quarter of an hour; and, while the steam is passing out, stop the
neck of one with a large plug of cotton-wool, so that this also may be

thoroughly steamed. Now set the flasks aside to cool, and when their

contents are cold, add to one of the open ones a drop of filtered infusion of
hay which has stood for twenty-four hours, and is consequently full of the

active and excessively minute organisms known as Bactei-ia. In a couple of
days of ordinary warm weather, the contents of this flask will be milky,
from the enormous multiplication of Bacteria. The other flask, open and
exposed to the air, will, sooner or later, become milky with Bacteria, and
patches of mould may appear in it ; while the liquid in the flask, the
neck of which is plugged with cotton-wool, wUl remain clear for an inde-

finite time. I have sought in vain for any explanation of these facts,
except the obvious one, that the air contains germs, competent to give rise to
Bacteria, such as those with which the first solution has been knowingly and

purposely inoculated, and to the mould Funr/i. And I have not yet been
able to meet with any advocate of Abiogenesis who seriously maintains that

the atoms of sugar, tartrate of ammonia, yeast-ash, and water, under no
influence but that of free access of air and the ordinary temperature, rear-
range themselves and give rise to the protoplasm of Bacterium. But the
alternative is to admit that these Bacteria arise from germs in the air ; and if
they are thus propagated, the burden of proof, that other like forms are gene-
rated in a different manner, must rest with the assertor of that proposition.

   To sum up the effect of this long chain of evidence :

    It is demonstrable, that a fluid eminently fit for the development of the
lowest forms of life, but which contains neither germs nor any protein com-
pound, gives rise to living things in great abundance if it is exposed to
ordinary air ; while no such development takes place if the air with which
it is in contact is mechanically freed from the solid particles, which ordinarily

float in it and which may be made visible by appropriate means.

    It is demonstrable, that the great majority of these particles are de-

structible by heat, and that some of them are germs, or living particles,
capable of giving rise to the same forms of life as those which appear when

the fluid is exposed to unpurified air.
    It is demonstrable, that inoculation of the experimental fluid with a drop

of hquid known to contain living particles gives rise to the same phenomena

as exposure to unpurified au\

   And it is fiuther certain that these living particles are so minute that the

assumption of their suspension in ordinary air presents not the slightest

difficulty. On the contrary, considering their lightness and the wide

diftusion of the organisms which produce them, it is impossible to conceive

that they should not be suspended in the atmosphere in myriads.
   Thus the evidence, direct and indirect, in favour of Biogenesis for aU

known forms of life must, I think, be admitted to be of great weight.

   * Infusion of hay, treated in the same way, yiekls similar results ; but as it contains
organic matter, the argument which follows cannot be based upon it.
ADDRESS.  Ixxxiii

   On the other side, the sole assertions worthy of attention are, that

hermetically sealed flnids, which have been exposed to great and long-

continued heat, have sometimes exhibited living forms of low organiza-

tion when they have been opened.

   The fii'st reply that suggests itself is the probability that there must
be some error about these experiments, because they are performed on an

enormous scale every day, with quite contrary results. Meat, fruits, vege-

tables, the very materials of the most fermentable and putresciblc infusions,

are preserved to the extent, I suppose I may say, of thousands of tons every

year, by a method which is a mere application of Spallanzani's experiment.
The matters to be preserved are well boiled in a tin case provided with a
small hole, and this hole is soldered up when all the aii' in the case has

been replaced by steam. By this method they may be kept for years, with-
out putrefying, fermenting, or getting mouldy. Now this is not because
oxygen is excluded, inasmuch as it is now proved that free oxygen is not

necessary for either fermentation or putrefaction. It is not because the
tins are exhausted of air, for Vibriones and Bacteria live, as Pasteur has
shown, without air or free oxygen. It is not because the boiled meats or

vegetables are not putrescible or fermentable, as those who have had the

misfortune to be in a ship supplied with unskilfully closed tins well know.
"What is it, therefore, but the exclusion of germs ? I think that Abio-
genists are bound to answer this question before they ask us to consider

new experiments of precisely the same order.
   And in the next place, if the results of the experiments I refer to are reaUy

trustworthy, it by no means follows that abiogenesis has taken place. The
resistance of living matter to heat is known to vary within considerable
limits, and to depend, to some extent, upon the chemical and physical qualities
of the surrounding medium. But if, in the present state of science, the al-
ternative is offered us, either germs can stand a greater heat than has been
supposed, or the molecules of dead matter, for no valid or intelligible reason

that is assigned, are able to rearrange themselves into liviug bodies, exactly
such as can be demonstrated to be frequently produced in another way, I

cannot understand how choice can be, even for a moment, doubtful.

   But though I cannot express this conviction of mine too strongly, I must
carefully guard myself against the supposition that I intend to suggest that no
such thing as abiogenesis ever has taken place in the past, or ever will take
place in the futui-e. "With organic chemistry, molecular physics, and phy-
siology yet in their infancy, and every day making prodigious strides, I

think it would be the height of presumption for any man to say that the
conditions under which matter assumes the properties we call " vital " may

not, some day, be artificially brought together. All I feel justified in affirm-
ing is, that I see no reason for believing that the feat has been performed

yet.

    And, looking back through the prodigious vista of the past, I find no record

of the commencement of Kfe, and therefore I am devoid of any means of

forming a definite conclusion as to the conchtious of its appearance. Belief,
in the scientific sense of the word, is a serious matter, and needs strong

foundations. To say, therefore, in the admitted absence of evidence, that
I have any belief as to the mode in which the existing forms of life have
originated, would be using words in a wrong sense. But expectation is per-
missible where belief is not ; and if it were given me to look beyond the
abyss of geologically recorded time to the still more remote period when the
earth was passing through physical and chemical conditions, which it can no

more see again than a man can recall his infancy, I should expect to he a

·witness of the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter. I

should expect to see it appear under forms of great simplicitj', endowed, like

existing Fungi, with the power of determining the formation of new pro-

toplasm from such matters as ammonium carbonates, oxalates and tartrates,

alkaline and earthy phosphates, and water, without the aid of light. That

is the expectation to which analogical reasoning leads me ; but I beg j-ou
once more to recollect that I have no right to call my opinion any thing but

an act of philosophical faith.

So much for the history of the progress of Redi's great doctrine of Biogenesis,

which appears to me, with the limitations I have expressed, to be victorious

along the whole line at the present day.

As regards the second problem offered to us by Eedi, whether Xenogenesis

obtains,  side  by  side  with  Homogencsis                                                   whether,  that  is, there exist not-

only the ordinary living things, giving rise to offspring which run through

the same cycle as themselves, but also others, producing offspriug which are of

a totally different character from themselves, the researches of two centuries

have led to a different result. That the grubs found in galls are no product

of the plants on which the galls grow, but are the result of the introduction of

the eggs of insects into the substance of these plants, was made out by Yal-

lisnieri, Reaumur, and others, before the end of the first half of the eighteenth

century. The tapeworms, bladderworms, and flukes continued to be a strong-

hold of the advocates of Xenogenesis for a much longer period. Indeed

it is only within the last thirty years that the splendid patience of Von Sie-

bold, Yan Beneden, Leuckart, Kiichenmeister, and other helminthologists has

succeeded in tracing every such parasite, often through the strangest wander-

ings and metamorphoses, to an egg derived from a parent, actually or poten-

tially like itself ; and the tendency of inquiries elsewhere has all been in the

Asame direction.    plant may throw off bulbs, but these, sooner or later, give

Arise to seeds or spores, which develope into the original form.                                              polype may

give rise to Medusae, or a pluteus to an Echinoderm, but the Medusa and the

Echinoderm give rise to eggs which produce polypes or plutei, and they are

therefore only stages in the cycle of life of the species.

But if we turn to pathology it offers us some remarkable approximations

to true Xenogenesis.

   As I have already mentioned, it has been known since the time of Vallisnicri

and of Reaumur, that galls in plants, and tumours in cattle, are caused by

insects, which lay their eggs in those parts of the animal or vegetable frame

of which these morbid structures are outgrowths. Again, it is a matter of
familiar experience to everybody that mere pressure on the skin will give rise

to a corn. Now the gall, the tumour, and the corn are parts of the living

body, which have become, to a certain degree, independent and distinct
organisms. Under the influence of certain external conditions, elements of

the body, which should have developed in due subordination to its general

plan, set up for themselves and apply the noui-ishment which they receive to
their own pm-poses.

Prom such innocent productions as corns and warts, there are all grada-

tions to the serious tumours which, by their mere size and the mechanical ob-

struction they cause, destroy the organism out of which they are developed

whUe, finally, in those terrible structures known as cancers, the abnormal

growtii has acquired powers of reproduction and multiplication, and is only

morphologically distinguishable from the parasitic worm, the life of which

is neither more, nor less, closely bound up with that of the infested organism.
                                                                                                ADDRESS.                                      IxXXV

If there were a kind of diseased structure, the histological elements of which

were capable of maintaining a separate and independent existence out of the

body, it seems to me that the shadowy boundary between morbid growth and
Xenogenesis would be effaced. And I am inclined to think that the pro-

gress of discovery has almost brought us to this point already. I have been

favoured by Mr. Simon with an early copy of the last published of the valu-
able " Reports on the Public Health," which, in his capacity of their Medical

Officer, he annually presents to the Lords of the Privy Council. Tlie Ap-

pendix to this Report contains an introductory essay " On the Intimate Pa-

thology of Contagion," by Dr. Rurdon Sanderson, which is one of the clearest,

most comprehensive, and well-reasoned discussions of a great question which

has come under my notice for a long time. I refer you to it for details and

for the authorities for the statements I am about to make.

  AYou are familiar with what happens in vaccination. minute cut is made in

the skin, and an infinitesimal quantity of vaccine matter is inserted into the

wound. Within a certain time, a vesicle appears in the place of the wound,

and the fluid which distends this vesicle is vaccine matter, in quantity a

hundred- or a thousandfold that which was originally inserted. Now wliat

has taken place in the course of this operation ? Has the vaccine matter by its

irritative property produced a mere blister, the fluid of which has the same

irritative property? Or does the vaccine matter contain living particles,

which have grown and multiplied where they have been planted ? The

observations of M. Chauveau, extended and confirmed by Dr. Sanderson

himself, appear to leave no doubt upon this head. Experiments, similar in

principle to those of Helmholtz on fermentation and putrefaction, have proved

that the active element in the vaccine lymph is non-difi'usible, and consists of

minute particles not exceeding                                                                  -j-iyj-g-fr     of an inch in diameter, which are

made visible in the lymph by the microscope. Similar experiments have

proved that two of the most destructive of epizootic diseases, sheep-pox and

glanders, are also dependent for their existence and their propagation upon

extremely small living solid particles, to which the title of microzymes is

applied. An animal suffering under either of these terrible diseases is a source

of infection and contagion to others, for precisely the same reason as a tub

of fermenting beer is capable of propagating its fermentation by " infection,"
or " contagion," to fresh wort. In both cases it is the solid living particles

which are efficient ; the liquid in which they float, and at the expense of

which they live, being altogether passive.

  Now arises the question, are these microzymes the results of Homoc/enesis,

or of Xenogenesis ; are they capable, like the Torultv of yeast, of arising

only by the development of preexisting germs ; or may they be, like the

constituents of a nut-gaU, the results of a modification and individualization

of the tissues of the body in which they are found, resulting from the opera-

tion of certain conditions ? Are they parasites in the zoological sense, or are
they merely what Yirchow has called " heterologous growths " ? It is ob-

vious that this question has the most profound importance, whether we look

Aat it from a practical or from a theoretical point of view.                                                                  parasite may bo

stamped out by destroying its germs, but a pathological product can only

be annihilated by removing the conditions which give rise to it.

   It appears to me that this great problem will have to be solved for each

zymotic disease separately, for analogy cuts two ways. I have dwelt upon

the analogy of pathological modification, which is in favour of the xenogenetic

origin of microzymes                                                                            but I must now  speak of the  equally strong  analogies
                                                                                             ;

in favour of the origin of such pestiferous particles by the ordinary process

of the generation of like from like.
IxXXvi  REPORT 1 870.

    It is, at present, a -svell-established fact that certain diseases, both of plants

and of animals, which have all the characters of contagious and infectious
epidemics, are caused by minute organisms. The smut of wheat is a well-

known instance of such a disease, and it cannot be doubted that the
grape-disease and the potato-disease fall under the same category. Among

animals, insects are wonderfully liable to the ravages of contagious and in-

fectious diseases caused by microscopic Fungi.

   In autumn it is not uncommon to see flies, motionless upon a window-pane,
with a sort of magic circle, in white, drawn round them. On microscopic

examination, the magic circle is found to consist of innumerable spores,

which have been thrown off in all directions by a minute fungus called

Empusa musca, the spore-forming filaments of wliich stand out like a pile of

velvet from the body of the fly. These spore-forming filaments are connected

with others, which fill the interior of the fly's body like so much fine wool,

ha\-ing eaten away and destroyed the creature's viscera. This is the full-

grown condition of the Empusa. If traced back to its earlier stages, in flies

which are still active, and to all appearance healthy, it is found to exist in
the form of minute corpuscles which float in the blood of the fly. These

multiply and lengthen into filaments,  at  the  expense of  the fly's substance
                                                                                                                                     ;

and when they have at last killed the patient, they grow out of its body

and give off spores. Healthy flies shut up with diseased ones catch this
Amortal disease and perish like the others.
                                                most competent observer, M.

Cohn, who studied the development of the Empusa in the fly very carefully,

was utterly unable to discover in what manner the smallest germs of the

Empusa got into the fly. The spores could not be made to give rise to

such germs by cultivation ; nor were such germs discoverable in the air, or in

the food of the fly. It looked exceedingly like a case of Abiogenesis, or, at

any rate, of Xenogenesis ; and it is only quite recently that the real course

of events has been made out. It has been ascertained, that when one of the

spores falls upon the body of a fly, it begius to germinate and sends out a

process which bores its way through the fly's skin ; this, having reached the

interior cavities of its body, gives oft' the minute floating corpuscles which
are the earliest stage of the Empusa. The disease is "contagious," because a
healthy fly coming in contact with a diseased one, from which the spore-

bearing filaments protrude, is pretty sure to carry off a spore or two. It is

" infectious '' because the spores become scattered about all sorts of matter in

the neighbourhood of the slain flies.

   The silkworm has long been known to be subject to a very fatal conta-
gious and infectious disease called the Miiscardine. Audouin transmitted it

by inoculation. This disease is entirely due to the development of a fungus,

Boirytis Bassiana, in the body of the caterpillar ; and its contagiousness

and infectiousness are accounted for in the same way as those of the fly-
disease. But of late years a still more serious epizootic has appeared among
the sUkwoiTQS ; and I may mention a few facts which wiR give you some

conception of the gravity of the injury which it has inflicted on France alone.

The production of silk has been, for centuries, an important branch of

industry in Southern France ; and in the year 1853 it had attained such a

magnitude, that the annual produce of the French sericulture was estimated
to amount to a tenth of that of the whole world, and represented a money

value of 117,000,000 of francs, or nearly five millions sterling. What may

be the sum which would represent the money-value of all the industries con-
nected with the working up of the raw silk thus produced is more than I can

pretend to estimate. Suffice it to say, that the city of Lyons is built upon
                                   ADDRESS.                                  IxXXvii

French silk, as much as Manchester was upon American cotton before the

civil war.

   Silkworms are liable to many diseases ; and, even before 1853, a peculiar

epizootic, frequently accompanied by the ai^pearance of dark spots upon the
skin (whence the name of " Pebrine " which it has received), had been noted for
its mortahty. But in tlie years following 1853 this malady broke out "with.

such extreme violence, that, in 1856, the silk-crop was reduced to a third of
the amount which it had reached in 1853 ; and, up till within the last year
or two, it has never attained half the yield of 1853, This means not only
that the great number of people engaged in silk-growing are some thirty
millions sterling poorer than they might have been ; it means not only that
high prices have had to be paid for imported silkworm-eggs, and that, after
investing his money in them, in paying for mulberry-leaves and for atten-

--dance, the cultivator has constantly seen his silkworms perish and himself

plunged in ruin, but it means that the looms of Lyons have lacked employ-

ment, and that for years enforced idleness and misery have been the por-

tion of a vast population which, in former days, was industrious and well

to do.

   In 1858 the gravity of the situation caused the French Academy of

Sciences to appoint Commissioners, of whom a distinguished naturalist, M.

de Quatrefages, was one, to inquire into the nature of this disease, and, if
possible, to devise some means of staying the plague. In reading the Eeport*
made by M. de Quatrefages, in 1859, it is exceedingly interesting to observe
that his elaborate study of the Pebrine, forced the conviction upon his mind
that, in its mode of occurrence and propagation, the disease of the silkworm
is, in every respect, comparable to the cholera among mankind. But it

differs from the cholera, and, so far, is a more formidable disease, in being

hereditary, and in being, under some circumstances, contagious, as well as

infectious.

The Italian naturalist, FUippi, discovered in the blood of the silkworms

affected by this strange disease a multitude of cylindrical corpuscles, each

about  -g-inro  °^ ^^ ^^^^^ long.  These have been carefully studied by Lebert,

and named by him PanJiistopliyton ; for the reason that, in subjects in which

the disease is strongly developed, the corpuscles swarm in every tissue

and organ of the body, and even pass into the undeveloped eggs of the

female moth. But are these corpuscles causes, or mere concomitants, of the

disease ? Some naturalists took one view and some another ; and it was not

until the French Government, alarmed by the continued ravages of the ma-

lady and the inefficiency of the remedies which had been suggested, dis-
patched M. Pasteur to study it, that the question received its final settlement
at a great sacrifice, not only of the time and peace of mind of that eminent

philosopher, but, I regret to have to add, of his health.

   But the sacrifice has not been in vain. It is now certain that this devas-

tating, cholera-like, Pebrine is the effect of the growth and multiplication

of the PanTiistopliytoii in the silkworm. It is contagious and infectious
because the corpuscles of the Panhistophi/ton pass away from the bodies of

the diseased caterpillars, directly or indirectly, to the alimentary canal of
healthy silkworms in their neighbourhood; it is hereditary, because the

corpuscles enter into the eggs while they are being formed, and consequently

are carried within them when they are laid ; and for this reason, also, it

presents the very singular peculiarity of being inherited only on the mother's

side. There is not a single one of all the apparently capricious and un-
accountable phenomena presented by the Pebrino, but has received its expla-
nation from the fact that the disease is the result of the presence of the mi-
croscopic organism Panhistophyton.

    Such being the facts with respect to the Pobrlue, what are the indications
as to the method of preventing it ? It is obvious that this depends upon the

way in which the Fanhistopliyton is generated. If it may be generated by

Abiogenesis, or by Xenogenesis, within the silkworm or its moth, the extirpa-
tion of the disease must depend upon the prevention of the occurrence of the
conditions under which this generation takes place. But if, on the other
hand, the Panhistophyton is an independent organism, which is no more
generated by the silkworm than the mistletoe is generated by the oak, or the

apple-tree, on which it grows, though it may need the silkworm for its de-
velopment in the same way as the mistletoe needs the tree, then the indica-

tions are totally different. The solo thing to be done is to get rid of and
keep away the germs of the Panhistophyton. As might be imagined, from
the course of his previous investigations, il. Pasteur was led to believe that
the latter was the right theory ; and guided by that theory, he has devised
a method of extirpating the disease, which has proved to be completely
successful wherever it has been properly carried out.

   There can be no reason, then, for doubting that, among insects, conta-
gious and infectious diseases, of great malignity, are caused by minute orga-
nisms which are produced from preexisting germs, or by Homogeuesis ; and
there is no reason, that I know of, for believing that what happens in insects
may not take place in the highest animals. Indeed, there is already strong
evidence that some diseases of an extremely malignant and fatal character
to which man is subject are as much the work of minute organisms as is

the Pebrino. I refer for this evidence to the very striking facts adduced
by Professor Lister in his various well-known publications on the antiseptic

method of treatment. It seems to me impossible to rise from the perusal of

those publications without a strong conviction that the lamentable mortality
which so frequently dogs the footsteps of the most skilful operator, and

those deadly consequences of wounds and injuries which seem to haunt tho
very walls of great hospitals, and are, even now, destroying more men than
die of bullet or bayonet, are due to the importation of minute organisms into
wounds, and their increase and multiplication ; and that the surgeon who
saves most lives will be he who best works out the practical consequences

of the hypothesis of Redi.

   I commenced this Address by asking you to follow me in an attempt to

trace the path which has been followed by a scientific idea, in its long and
slow progress from the position of a probable hypothesis to that of an esta-

blished Law of Nature. Our survey has not taken us into very attractive

regions ; it has lain, chiefly, in a land flowing with the abominable, and

peopled with mere grubs and mouldincss. And it may be imagined with

what smiles and shrugs practical and serious contemporaries of Redi aad
of Spallanzani may have commented on the waste of their high abilities in

toiling at the solution of problems which, though curious enough in them-
selves, could be of no conceivable utility to mankind.

   Nevertheless you will have observed, that before we had travelled very far

upon our road, there appeared, on the right hand and on the left, fields laden
with a harvest of golden grain, immediately convertible into those things
       ADDRESS.  Ixxxix

--which the most sordidly practical of men will admit to have value namely,

money and life.

    The direct loss to France caused by the Pebrine in seventeen years, cannot
be estimated at less than fifty millions sterling ; and if we add to this what
Redi's idea, in Pasteur's hands, has done for the wine-grower and for the

vinegar-maker, and try to capitalize its value, we shall find that it will go a
long way towards repairing the money losses caused by the frightful and
 calamitous war of this autumn.

    And as to the equivalent of Redi's thought in life, how can we overesti-

mate the value of that knowledge of the nature of epidemic and epizootic
diseases, and consequently of the means of checking, or eradicating, them, the
 dawn of which has assuredly commenced ?

    Looking back no further than ten years, it is possible to select three (1863,
18C4, and 1869) in which the total number of deaths from scarlet-fever alone,

amounted to ninety thousand. That is the return of kiUed, the maimed and
disabled being left out of sight. Why, it is to be hoped that the list of killed
in the present bloodiest of all wars will not amount to more than this ! But
the facts, which I have placed before you, must leave the least sanguine
without a doubt that the nature and the causes of this scourge will, one day,
be as wcU understood as those of the Pebrine are now ; and that the long-
sufi'ered massacre of our innocents will come to an end.

   And thus mankind will have one more admonition that "the people perish

for lack of knowledge ; " and that the alleviation of the miseries, and the

promotion of the welfare, of men must be sought, by those who will not

lose their pains, in that diligent, patient, loving study of all the multitudi-
nous aspects of Nature, the results of which constitute exact knowledge, or

Science.

    It is the justification and the glory of this great Meeting that it is gathered
together for no other object than the advancement of the moiety of Science

which deals with those phenomena of Nature which we call physical. May

its endeavours be crowned with a full measure of success !

Report of the Committee appointed to consider and report on the
   various Plans prropwsed for Legislating on the subject of Steam-

 --Boiler Explosions, ivith a view to their Prevention, the Committee

   consisting of Sir William Fairbairn, Bart., C.E., LL.D., F.R.S.,
   &;c.. Sir Joseph Whitworth, Bart., C.E., F.R.S., John Penn, C.E.,

  F.R.S., Frederick J. Bramwell, C.E., Hugh Mason, Samuel

   Webster, Q.C, and Lavington E. Fletcher, C.E.

To the frequent occurrence of steam-boiler explosions, with the loss of life

and property caused thereby, attention was called in a Keport read before the

Mechanical Section of the British Association last year at Exeter, and in a

Paper read the year before that, at Norwich. These sad catastrophes still

continue with unabated frequency. In the interval between the Norwich

and Exeter Meetings, 46 explosions occurred, killing 78 persons and injuring
114 others. Since then 57 more explosions have occurred, killing 99 more

persons and injuring 96 others. So great is the regularity with which these

catastrophes occiu:, that it was stated at Exeter that it was to be feared that as
many lives would be lost by explosions before the next Meeting as had been

lost since the last. This, it will be seen from the figures just given, has been

more than fulfilled. Taking the average of a number of years, it appears that

about 50 explosions occur every year, killing about 75 persons and injuring

as many others.

It is not intended in this Eeport to enter on a consideration of the causes

of steam-boiler explosions. That has already been done on other occasions.

It need, therefore, merely be stated in passing that the experience of another

year only confirms the Committee in their opinion, previously expressed, that

explosions are not accidental, that they are not mysterious, but that they

arise from the simplest causes, and may be prevented by the exercise of

common knowledge and common care. Boilers burst simply from weakness,

that weakness arising in some cases from original maleonstruction, in others

from defective condition consequent on wear and tear, and in others again

from neglect of attendants (through allowing the plates over the furnace

to become overheated from shortness of water &c.). Competent inspection

1870.            B
--2 REPORT 1870.

is adequate to detect the weakness of the boiler in time to prevent explosion,
whether that weakness arise from malcoustruction or from defective condition,
while it tends to stimulate attendants to carefulness, and thus to diminish
the number of those explosions arising from oversight. It is very generally
thought that most explosions result from the neglect of the attendant. Such,

however, is not the case. On analyzing the causes of the explosions that

occurred from the 1st of January 1861 to the 18th of June 1870, it appears
that 120 explosio- equal to 40 per cent, of the whole number, were due to
the malconstructiou of the boilers, either in the shells or fittings ; 88 explo-
sions, equal to 29 per cent., were due to the defective condition of the boilers,
either in the shells or fittings ; 44 explosions, equal to 15 per cent., were
due to the failure of the seams of rivets at the bottom of externally fired
boilers ; 38, equal to 13 per cent., were due to overheating of the plates
5, equal to 2 per cent., were due to excessive pressure of steam through the
attendants tampering with safety-valves ; while 1, equal to, say, | per cent.,
occurred to an economizer, but whether from gas or overpressure of steam is
uncertain ; and 1 other, equal to, say, i per cent., arose from causes entirely

independent of the construction or condition of the boiler, and may thus be

termed " accidental." Of those due to overheating of the plates, 30 explo-
sions, equal to 10 per cent, of the whole number, arose from shortness of
water ; 6, equal to 2 per cent., from incrustation ; 1, equal to | per cent.,
from the use of boiler-compositions ; and 1, equal to | per cent., from causes
requiring further consideration. The total number of these explosions the

causes of which were ascertained, was 297. From this list it will at once

 be seen that the two leading causes of the explosions enumerated therein
 were malconstructiou and defective condition, a small proportion only being

 due to the neglect of the attendants. It may be put shortly, that for every

 explosion due to the boiler-minder through neglecting the water-supply &c.,
 six are due to the boiler-maker or boiler-owuer through making or using
 bad boilers. It is clear, therefore, that the adoption of competent inspection

 by every boiler-owner in the kingdom would do much to prevent the constant

 recurrence of boiler explosions, and to save the greater part of the 75 lives

 annually sacrificed. This fact is now generally admitted; and hence the

 question is not unfrequently asked. Since competent inspection would pre-

 vent explosions, and steam-users neglect so simple a precaution, why is not

 inspection enforced by law ? Juries, in bringing in verdicts consequent on
 steam-boiler explosions, frequently recommend that the Government should

 render inspection compulsory ; and this view appears to be very widely enter-
 tained, in consequence of which various plans for legislative enactment have
 been proposed. The object of this lieport is to deal with these plans, and

 give the result of the Committee's dehberations thereon.

    This is a particularly opportune moment for the presentation of such a
 Beport. Last Session of Parliament a Select Committee of the House of
 Commons was appointed to inquire into the cause of steam-boiler explosions,
 and the best means of preventing them ; and this Committee, whose labours

 are not yet completed, have been investigating whether it is expedient that

 boiler -inspection should be enforced by law, and, if so, what is the best way

 of enforcing it. It is therefore important at this time that discussion on this

 subject should be encouraged, and suggestions from all parties obtained. It

 is trusted that this Report will aid in promoting this object and in arriving

 at the best means of rendering the inspection of boilers universal throughout

 the entire country.

    With these introductory remarks the Committee will proceed to the con-
ON STEAM-BOILER-EXPLOSION LEGISLATION.  tJ

sideration of such of tlie plans " proposed for legislating on the subject of
steam-boiler explosions, with a view to their prevention," as have come

under their notice.

   Five systems of compulsory inspection appear to be now before the public.

--These may each be stated and considered in turn.
   Plan No. 1. It has been jiroposed that the inspection of all the boilers
in the kingdom should be carried out by the Board of Trade. To this plan
there are many objections. On the one hand, it would impose on the
Government additional burdens, which they have expressed themselves
unwilUng to incur; Avhile on the other it would prove harassing to the
steam-user. It would, it is feared, be found to work arbitrarily. Such a
system would lack that elasticity which is necessary to conform to the con-
venience of the individual steam-user. There would be a great danger of its
hampering progress. It would certainly not find favour -with the generality
of steam-users, nor ever be voluntarily accepted by them except as the

--Alast resort.  second proposition is, that, instead of the inspection being
   Plan No. 2.

caiTied out by the Board of Trade, it should be carried out by town councils

or other local authorities, such authorities appointing their own inspectors.

This plan would admit of more elasticity than the previous one, inasmuch as

the inspection would emanate from several centres instead of from one.

From the fact, however, of the inspections emanating from several centres

instead of from one, an element of discord would be introduced, from which

many contradictious and many absurdities would ensue. If it were a question

of establishing Greenwich time in every market town and country village

throughout the kingdom, there might be little difficulty in effecting such an

object by such an organization, since Greenwich time, by the help of the

Asti'ouomer Royal, could be put beyond all question, and the work of

estabhshing it throughout the kingdom would be one of diffusion and not of

origination. To regulate the construction of steam-boilers, however, is a

totally different matter. The science of boiler-making is a growing one. It

is in a transition state ; and, in spite of the amount of information constantly

disseminated, great ignorance prevails with regard to it. In consequence of this,

one corporation would declare a boiler safe which another corporation would

declare unsafe, so that a boiler carried by rail from one part of the country
to another might be counted safe at the beginning of its journey and unsafe

at the end. For instance : in Lancashire the practice of strengthening flue-
tubes at the ring-seams with flanged joints or hoops of T-iron, or other
suitable section, is highly approved. In fact it is thought that no high-
pressure boiler should be constructed nowadays without these appliances.

In Cornwall, however, nothing can convince steam-users of their necessity,

and Cornishmen persistently adhere to the ignorant superstition which the
Frankhn Institute of Pennsylvania endeavoured to dispel thirty-four years

ago, viz. that a boiler cannot explode as long as it is properly supplied with
water. They appear to believe that furnace- tubes, though of great length
and diameter, and though worked at high pressures of steam, can only
collapse from the neglect of the water-supply, or, in other words, from the

neglect of the attendant and not of the owner or the maker. In Cornwall,

boiler-flue after boiler-flue collapses, simply from weakness, till the Cornish

boiler stands in the return of explosions as one of the most dangerous. These

explosions are the result of gross malconstruction, coupled with neglected

condition. Yet Cornishmen wiU not see it, and they only attribute every

explosion to shortness of water. Local administration \inder such circum-

stances would be powerless; while, even apart from undue influence, and

simply from the want of due experience in so important a matter as the

construction of steam-boilers, the decisions of local authorities would be

frequently contradictory. Such a system would reintroduce the evils we are

trying to eradicate from our courts of law, viz. that a verdict given in one

couit* is frequently contradicted in another. Though the plan of intrusting

the inspection of all the boilers in the kingdom to local authorities might

answer in the neighbourhood of some of the large manufacti;riug centres, it

--would not do so throughout the entire country.
   Plan "No. 3. Another proposition is, to hand over the duty of inspecting

and certifying all the boilers in the kingdom to divers authorized parties,

such as accredited boiler-makers, private-inspection associations, insurance

companies, &c. This plan would, like the one just referred to, be liable

to produce contradictory verdicts, while it has the additional objection that

it fails to secure the responsibility of the inspections. To allow certificates

to be granted by boiler-makers would be a most invidious course. It could

not be a wholesome practice, especially under the influence of keen com-

petition, for one maker to be called in to approve or condemn a boiler made

by another ; while the fact that 40 per cent, of the explosions that happen

are due to malconstruction, shows that boiler-makers are not, after all, good

--judges in this matter, a view which is corroborated by the unsatisfactory and

contradictory evidence frequently given bj- them at coroners' inquests conse-

quent on boiler explosions. Further, it is presumed that every boiler-owner

would have to pay for his own certiflcate ; so that on this system the most in-
dulgent offices would clearly get the greatest amount of custom, and those which

only granted faithful certificates would be driven out of the market by the

less scrupulous. Under these circi;mstances it is feared that the sale of

certificates would soon degenerate into a sale of indulgences. Besides this,

how is this system to be practically worked ? Who is to see that the steam-

user has the certificates on his boilers regularly renewed as they fall out ?

These certificates would extend for a year only from each " entire " examina-

Ation, and would lapse at different parts of the year.  steam-user with

twelve boilers would want twelve certificates every year ; and one of these

might faU out each month. Is the Government to undertake the responsi-

bility of seeing that these certificates are regularly renewed ? Is it to inspect

the inspectors? Such a plan, it is thought, would be impracticable, while it

would be after all but another form of Governmental inspection, and one of a

very complicated description.

  --Plan No. 4.- The fourth plan starts on the same basis as the preceding

ones, viz. that of rendering inspection compulsory, and recommends that

Parliament should enact that no boiler should be worked unless periodically

inspected and certified, at least once a year, as safe and trustworthy. Instead,

however, of intrusting the duty of carrying out these inspections and

granting the certificates to the Board of Trade, or to the town councils, or

other local authorities, or to certified boiler-makers, private-inspection asso-

ciations, or insurance companies, it proposes that there should be formed a

National Steam-Users' Board, and that this Board should be empowered to

carry out the system of inspection required, including the granting of certi-

ficates, fixing the rate of charge for each boiler, &c. This Board to be an

honorary and representative body, about one-half of its members being men

of commerce (that is to say, mill-owners or others using boilers for mercantile
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      i

boilers, and to add weight to the counsels of the Board)*. None of the
members of the Board to retain office longer than four years without re-
election, one-fourth retiring every year, so that every four years the Board
would be entirely recruited, either with new members or re-elected ones.
The Board to be appointed in such a way as to secure the fair representation
of the general body of steam-users, and to merit their confidence, the
appointment being effected either by popular election, every steam-user
having a vote for each of his boilers, or by any other appropriate method. If
preferred, there might be a number of district steam-boards with geographical
limits assigned to each, instead of a single national one ; and it is weU worthy
of consideration which would be the better plan of the two. If the plan of
district boards were adopted, it would then be well for an annual conference

to be held, composed of deputies from each of the district boards, in order
that the results of the working of each district might be compared ; and this,

it is thought, would promote a wholesome rivalry.
   The following are set forth as some of the distinctive features and advan-

tages of this system of administration, and as equally applicable whether the

central Steam Board or the district ones are adopted.
   No. 1. This system would throw no administrative responsibility on the

Government, whether of a financial or engineering character.
   No. 2. It would secure the integrity and efficiency of the inspections,

inasmuch as the work would not be undertaken for profit, and the Board or
Boards would be established on too wide a basis to be influenced by local or
private interests. At the same time the boiler-owners would be protected
from arbitrary interference, inasmuch as the inspections in each case would
be controlled by a Board or Boards composed principally of steam-users, and

appointed by themselves.
   No. 3. This plan would secure to the country a large amount of valuable

engineering information. It would afford the opportunity of ascertaining

how many boilers there are in the kingdom, how many varieties of con-
struction, and how many boilers to each class, as well as the various pressures

at which they are worked. Also it would afford the opportunity of ascer-
taining the approximate horse-power throughout the whole lungdom, as well
as the consumption of fuel for boiler-purposes. Added to this it would afford
the means, at a perfectly nominal outlay per boiler, of establishing a fund for
scientific research on any doubtful questions with regard to the safety and

economical working of steam-boilers and engines.
   The above is but a very brief outline of the fourth plan^ proposed for

carrying out compulsory inspection ; and it is found impossible in the compass

of this Report to enter upon it in detail. The sketch given, however,^ may

be sufficient to afford a general idea. It wiU be seen that this plan is inde-
pendent of Governmental interference further than the passing of an act, in
the first instance, to enforce the inspection of every boiler in the kingdom,
and to empower the Steam Board or Boards to carry out these inspections
and adjust the rates, &c. Thus the steam-users would be left to govern
themselves, a responsibility with which it is thought they might be intrusted,
since they have a strong desire to avoid Governmental interference, and they
would know that, unless they succeeded, the Government would take the
matter into its own hands. The Committee consider this plan calculated to
guard the inspections against being las and contradictory on the one hand,

and private interests having a seat at the Board ; but details of this character are purposely

avoided in this sketch.
--6 REPORT 1870.

--or arbitrary and oppressive on the other dangers against which the three

previous plans would not, they think, afford sufficient protection ; and thus
they regard the proposed national Steam Board or national system of district
Boards as adequate to the prevention of explosions without harassing steam-

--users.
   Plai^ No. 5. This plan differs from the preceding inasmuch as it does
not propose to enforce inspection directly by law, but to impose a heavy
penalty on the occurrence of every explosion, with the view of inducing
steam-users to take precautionary mea-sures, and have their boilers in-
spected*. With this penalty system it is proposed to ally the principle of
steam-boUer insurance by joint-stock companies, thinking that while boiler-
owners would be driven by the penalty to insure, insurance companies would
be driven to inspect, as the penalty, though falling in the first instance on
the owner, would be ultimately paid by the insurance company.

   On considering this proposition, it appears by no means clear that a penalty

would have the effect of inducing all steam-users to enrol their boilers. The
incredulity of many as to the possibility of their boilers exploding is so great
that nothing would convince them but the occurrence of the calamity itself.
It would therefore, it is thought, be some time before the penalty system
took effect, and, this beiag the case, several lives would be lost in the mean-
time. Indeed, unless the simple announcement that the Government had
established a penalty were sufficient to promote general enrolment, the system
could not come into force until the penalty was exacted ; and before this
coidd be done, explosions must happen, and thus lives be lost. StiU the
Committee cannot doubt, though the effect of the penalty might be tardy in
its operation, that in process of time it would induce many steam-users, if

not all, to avail themselves of inspection.

Passing over the question as to the success of the penalty in promoting

inspection, the next question is as to the value of the inspections by com-

peting joint-stock insurance companies. This is by no means a simple

Asubject, and one on which a great deal of misapprehension occurs.  few

brief remarks upon it are all that can be offered in the limits of this paper.

Commercial insurance is founded on the principle of a commutation of

risks. Given the number of fires that occur per annum on an average, and

we have the risk of fire-insurance. Given the number of deaths that occur

throughout the country per annum, and we have the risk of hfe-insurance.

Given the number of persons injured every year by raUway-travelling, and

we have the risk of railway-passenger insurance. Now, it will be seen in

these cases that the companies adopt little or no preventive measures. It is

true that before a house or a life is insured, a general examination is made

in each case ; but these are not followed up by a series of preventive measures.

In the case of accidental-death insurance, no precautionary measures axe

Aadopted whatever.  passenger, on taking his railway ticket, takes also an

insurance ticket, and thereby enters what may be termed a legalized lottery.

If he is injured in his journey he receives some return for his outlay ; if not,

he loses it, and the company gains it. This is a perfectly above-board trans-

action. It is qiaite understood that the company adopt no precautionary

measures. They do not inspect the railway-line, they do not inspect the

axles or tires of the carriages, the points and crossings, the signals or the

signalmen. The whole matter is understood on both sides to be simply a

commutation of risk ; and the company merely profess to iasure against

   * These penalties to be applied to forming a general fund for compensating those
injured by the explosions.
ON STEAM-BOILER-EXPLOSION LEGISLATION.  7

Nowaccident.  it will be seen that before this principle can be applied to

the prevention of boUer explosions, some serious qualifications must be made.

It has already been seen that boiler explosions are not accidental. To term

a boiler explosion an accident is to mislead, and thus do much mischief.
Boiler explosions may be prevented by common knowledge and common care

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and these every boiler-owner is bound in justice to his workmen to exercise.

A boiler-owner has no right to insure himself against the pecuniary results

of his own neglect which may cost the lives of his workpeople. To this it

may be replied that when the principle of insurance has been applied to

boUers, inspection has been coupled with it, and further, that it is the interest

of insurance offices that such should be the case, since, inasmuch as they have

dividends to pay, they are bound to inspect in self-protection. This view

obtains very general currency. It is, however, a total fallacy that the joint-

stock insurance principle, as at present applied, affords any inducement to the

adoption of inspection. This can be plainly shown in a few words. The

--object of a joint-stock company is clearly pecuniary profit not philanthropy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and this being the case, such a company woidd not expend a pound to save a

shilling. Now it appears, from data which have been accumulated for years,

that the risk of explosion with steam-boilers is about one in two thousand ; so
that the cost of insurance is Is. per =£100. The cost of an annual " entii-e "

examination, which is essential to sound inspection, may be taken in round

numbers as about 20s. per boiler. Thus, inspection costs about 20s., while

insurance costs Is. ; or, at all events, inspection costs much more than in-

surance. Consequently it will pay an insurance office better to allow boilcz's

to blow up, and pay compensation, than to prevent explosions aud pay for

inspection. Inspection is dear, insiu'ance is cheap. Inspection eats away

the dividends. The interest of a joint-stock company, therefore, is to lavish

insurance and stint inspection.

There are further points in the mode in which joint-stock insurance is at

present applied to steam-boilers which may be called attention to. Insurance

companies adopt scales of charges according to the risk run ; and thus they

class the boilers A, B, and C, as they may be first-, second-, or third-rate.

This is insuring boilers simply on the principle of risks, and ignores altogether

the danger to life. If boilers can only be worked at a risk, they should not

be worked at all. Again, the charge for insurance rises according to the

pressure of the steam. This is to tax progress, and make a market of

engineering enterprise. Again, insurance companies charge so much for the

first ^100 insured on a boiler, the same amount for the second =£100, the

same for the third ,£100, and so on, though the payment for the insurance of

the first ,£100 included the charge for inspection. In this arrangement the

value of inspection appears to be ignored. The danger of explosion is

assumed to be as great after the charge has been paid for inspection as before.

An accidental-death company, insuring railway-passengers' lives, could not

adopt a scale of charges that would more consistently ig-nore the principle of

prevention, and adopt that of hazards. Again, insurance companies pay

compensation in case of minor damage, which emboldens a boiler-owner to

neglect any precautionary advice given in consequence of the inspections. If

he employ an inferior attendant in order to save 5s. a week in his wages, and

the boiler becomes injured thereby, the cost of repair is paid by the company,

and not by himself. This system entu'ely absolves a boiler-owner from the
results of his own neglect.

These remarks will suffice to show that the principle of insurance, as at

present applied to steam-boUers by joint-stock companies, is not all that is
--8 REPORT 1870.

to be desired for the prevention of steam-boUer explosions, and that before

the Government will be justified in handing over the inspection of all the

boilers in the kingdom to a number of competing joint-stock companies,
considerable modifications will have to be enforced ; and it wiU be well now

to consider whether the imposition of the proposed penalty would have the

desired effect, or whether any other steps would be necessary.

   The penalty upon the boiler-user in the event of explosion would, as already

--stated, ultimately faU upon insurance companies that is to say, in those cases

where the boilers were enrolled. Now if that penalty were made sufficiently

heavy, it might make it more expensive for companies to permit explosions

and pay compensation, than to prevent them and pay for inspection, and thus

just reverse the position that obtains at present. For this it would be neces-

sary that the penalty should not be less than £1000 or £2000. Added to the

penalty imposed on the boiler-owner, in the event of explosion, to induce

him to enrol, it might be well to impose another penalty of equal amount on

the company, more fully to induce them to inspect. The first of these

penalties, the one imposed on the boiler-owner, should be exacted uncon-

ditionally; the other, imposed on the insurance company, only after it had

been shown on an examination by a Government officer that the company had

failed in their duty. Added to the imposition of these penalties, it would be

necessary for it to be enacted that no company should have more than one rate

of charge ; otherwise they would meet the risk on dangerous boilers simply by

Araising the rate.  fixed rate would also put an end to the taxing of high-

pressure steam, as the rate would be the same for 10 lbs. as for 100 lbs. Added

to this, the present system of insuring against minor damages should be pro-

hibited, as this completely destroys the owner's responsibility. Such are some

of the restrictions which it appears necessary to impose upon the principle of

joint-stock insurance before it would be applicable, by a number of competing

companies, to steam-boilers, with a view to the prevention of explosions.

The Committee are not without apprehensions, however, that though the

principle of joint-stock insurance might be surrounded with a series of checks

and counterchecks, it yet would lead to inspection being cut down to the
lowest possible point. On the other hand, were the inspection enforced by

law, and nationally administered, either by a central Steam Board or by a

scries of district ones, they consider that a far more generous system would

be secured. The Steam Boards, uninfluenced either by private or local

interests, or by the desire to accumulate profits, would take altogether higher

ground, and inspect, not simply in their own interests, and just sufficiently

to narrowly escape explosion, but with a view to assist steam-users, dissemi-

nate practical information on the making and management of boilers, and

promote progress. These objects would be altogether foreign to competing

joint-stock insurance companies.

The Committee have now stated, they trust impartially, the various plans

which have come under their notice, remarking, as they proceeded, on such

of the points in each as appeared to them to be defective, and they would

now beg to solicit the most ample discussion of this important subject.

In drawing this Report to a close, the Committee wish to make a brief

reference to the one they presented to the Mechanical Section of the British
Association last year, on the subject of " Coroners' Inquiries in connexion

with Boiler Explosions." In that Report they pointed out the defects in

these investigations, and how necessary it was that improvements should be

effected, expressing their belief that full investigation and plain-speaking

would, of themselves, do much to prevent the recurrence of these catastrophes.
COMPOSITION AND DISTRIBUTION OF HAEMATITE IRON-ORES.  9

The Committee still hold this view, and think that, had coroners' vercUcts
been as satisfactory as they might have been, boUer explosions would not

have been as numerous as they now are. "With the additional experience

of another year they feel compelled to take one other step in advance, and

they have come to the conclusion that the time has arrived when the Govern-
ment should enforce the periodical inspection of all steam-boilers, though, as
ah-eady stated, they do not think that the Government should turn boUer-
inspector*. They are convinced that explosions might be, and ought to

be, prevented ; that competent inspection is adequate for this purpose, and
that any weU-organized system of inspection, extended throughout the entire
country, would practically extinguish boUer explosions, and save the greater

part of the 75 lives now annually sacrificed thereby.

"Your Lordship is doubtless aware of the remarkable process invented

--some years ago by Mr. Bessemer, for the conversion of crude cast iron into

steel or wrought iron, a process by the apphcatiou of which those important

materials can be manufactured at a much cheaper rate than formerly. The

royalty which at present exists on iron to which the Bessemer process has

been apphed will shortly expire, and its expiz-ation will probably give a great

impetus to the iron trade of the countrj'.
    " It is not, however, every ii'on-ore that u'on-masters have been in the habit

of employing which can be used for the production of cast iron destined for

conversion by the Bessemer process ; for there are certain impurities which
that process fails to remove, and which are extremely injurious to steel or

wrought iron. This difficulty is got over by preparing the iron from hsema-

tite, an iron-ore which is free from those impurities.
   " Accordingly, on the expiration of the Bessemer royalty, a great demand

for haematite is Hkely to arise ; and it will be important for the iron trade of

the country that it should be known where haematite is to be found. For

many of the counties of England the requisite information is contained in

the Memoirs referred to in the resolution quoted above ; and the object of
the British Association is merely to urge on Her Majesty's Government the

importance of continuing and completing, vrithout delay, the investigation

thus so ably begun.
   " Although the application of the British Association relates to trade, I

have addressed myself to your Lordship rather than to the President of the

Board of Trade, because it is to be presumed that the investigation would be
best completed by the same body by which it was begun, namely the Staff

of the Geological Survey ; and that belongs to the department over which

your Lordship presides.

Report on the Sedimentary Deposits of the River Onny.

              By the Rev. J. D. La Touche.

The principal rainfalls in the valley which supplies the waters of the Onny

during the past year, occurred from December 17th to 20th, January 6th

to 9th, 13th and 14th, February 1st to 10th, and March 1st to 4th. At

none of these dates did the river attain the height it has done on former

occasions. For this reason, and the long-continued droughts, the results of

these experiments have been rather barren.

   The accompanying Table shows that the relation of deposit to rainfall is
modified by many circumstances. As might be expected, the greatest quan-

tity is attained when a flood takes place after continued wet weather. Thus,

after the rains of last February, the floods of the 1st and 2nd of March were

followed by the largest amount of deposit observed in the year ; on this
occasion from 1318 lbs. per minute on the 2nd, to 2128 lbs. per minute on

the 3rd (that is, about 57 tons per hour), passed down.

In considering these quantities, it must be remembered that the Onny is

a small stream : its width is 60 feet ; the area of the section where these

experiments are made is, at summer level, 92 square feet ; and the discharge

at a high flood amounts to about 80,000 cubic feet per minute. The area

of the Severn at summer level is 512 square feet ; and its discharge, under

similar circumstances, would probably be about 900,000 cubic feet per

minute. Assuming that the ratio of deposit in the water of the Severn were

the same as that observed in the Onny, no less than 1239 tons per hour of

solid matter would be carried by it in suspension past each spot. This, of

course, leaves out of account the pebbles and sand, which are occasionally

rolled along the bottom in great quantities.

"Within the last year a gauge has been erected on the Severn, at Shrews-

Abury, at the cost of the grant made by the Association.  register of the

floods has moreover been kept ; but as yet there has been some difliculty in

obtaining water for examination. This, it is hoped, may be done during the

ensuing year, as well as at Hereford, where a record is regularly kept of a

gauge on the Wye.
--12 REPORT 1870.

   An attempt has been made, from the accompanying register, to estimate

the total quantity of sediment carried down in suspension during the year.
Each pair of succeeding entries in the fifth column, viz. "discharge per
minute," have been added together, the sum divided by 2, and the quotient
multiplied by the number of minutes between the observations. The result
is a total of 3564 tons for the year.

   The surface of the valley of the Onuy is 84 square miles ; and the effect of
the above result would be (taking the average specific gravity of the Silurian
rocks as 2-5) to reduce the level of the whole by -0025, or ^-i-jj of an inch.

Probably, however, the rate of denudation during the year has been exception-
ally low ; and, besides, no account is here taken of any but suspended matter.

Report of the Committee on the Chemical Nature of Cast Iron. The
    Committee consists o/F. A. Abel, F.R.S., D. Forbes, F.R.S., and
    A. Matthiessen, F.R.S.

"We regret to have to report that it has not heen in our power during the
past year to make any important progress in the investigation of the chemical
nature of cast iron, which was intrusted to us.

   In the Appendix to the Report which we submitted last year, a process

was described by which pure iron could be prepared in considerable quan-
tities ; and it was intended to apply this process at once to the preparation of
the material necessary for our investigations. The apparatus and arrange-
ments required for this purpose, however, have been unavoidably in a dis-
mantled condition during the greater jiart of the year, in consequence of the
reconstruction of the Laboratories of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. They are

now again in working order, and it is hoped that the experiments will be
resumed without much further delay.

   Numerous experiments have been made with a view to ascertain whether
the piire-iron sponge, prepared by the process above referred to, can be con-
verted, by welding, into thoroughly solid masses without detriment to the

purity of the metal. Hitherto the results obtained (though instructive in
connexion with the physical properties of the pure metal) have not been of
a promising nature in the particular direction desired. It is contemplated,

however, to continue these experiments with the aid of facilities which, we

believe, will be available for this purpose at the Eoyal Arsenal, Woolwich.

   For the foregoing reasons we beg leave to suggest that the reappointment
of this Committee be recommended ; but we do not consider it necessary to
apply for a grant of money on this occasion.

"AReport on the practicability of establishing  Close Time " for the

protection of indigenous Animals, By a Committee, consisting of

Prof. Newton, M.A., F.L.S., Rev. H. B. Tristram, F.R.S., J. E.

Harting, F.L.S., F.Z.S., Rev. H. Barnes, and H. E. Dresser

(Reporter).

The Committee appointed for the purpose of continuing investigations as to

the advisability of establishing a close time for the preservation of our indi-

--genous animals beg leave to report as foUows : Having regard to the state

of business during the late session of Parliament, your Committee have not
thought it expedient to press the object your Committee are directed to
obtain on the attention of Members of the Legislature, or the general public.
Your Committee have learnt with satisfaction that, in several cases where
the provisions of the Sea-birds' Preservation Act have been enforced, very
beneficial results have followed, instances of which are added in the appendix.
In consequence hereof, your Committee see good reason to hope that an
extension of similar protection to other groups of indigenous animals will
be attended by similar happy results ; and your Committee consider that
such extension could not be better commenced than with the group of

mambu'ds commonly known as " wild foivl," comprising as that does, very
14 REPORT 1870.

kinds of birds which, being largely used as food, are of great value to the

community, and are generally admitted to be entirely innocuous. At pre-

sent, very great numbers of Wild Ducks, of many species, Snipes, Wood-

cocks, Plovers, and other kindred birds are killed during the spring months,

even when in the act of breeding. The destruction thus effected cannot

fail to continue the ever-increasing diminution of these birds, if indeed it
does not promise, at no distant date, to result in their utter extermination.
Accordingly, your Committee are unanimously of opinion that protection
should be afforded by law, during the breeding-season, to such "wild fowl" as
these, in order to prevent that result ; while your Committee think that,

with protection, these birds may long continue to furnish, at other times of

the year, valuable food to the public, notwithstanding the changes which
some parts of the country are undergoing through agricultural improve-
ments and increase of the population.

   Your Committee respectfully suggest the reappointment of this Committee.

 --Extract of a letter from H. L. Stevenson of Norwich. " The beachmen at

Salthouse (Norfolk) are delighted with the new Act, as, through summer
shooters, their means of earning a few shillings were going fast. Only thi-ee
or four paii's of Lesser Terns nested there this year ; and, as the men reminded
me, ten years ago they had forty or fifty pairs at least. I am sure the
marshmen on the Broads would be equally glad of a close time there, as they
complain to me of gentlemen shooting Snipe into May."

 --Extract of a letter from the liev. H. F. Barnes of Bridlitigton. " With

regard to our Sea-bird Act, I am happy to teU you that here it has been very

effective. * * * It renders the birds, however, remarkably tame. They sit
on the cliffs only a few feet below the observer, and nod and bow in the
most amiable manner, as if all that breathed must needs be kin. Then,
again, they swim about the shore, on a calm day, like ducks in a pond. All
this may safely be set down to the degree of immunity they have enjoyed.
One noticeable and very valuable fact is, that they have bred (in small
numbers) this year at Flamborough, which they have not done for the last
twenty years."

    Captain Hadfield, of Ventnor, in a communication to the 'Zoologist'
(Jime 1870, p. 2184), has remarked on the " increase of the sea-fowl breed-
ing on the freshwater cliffs" since the passing of the Act.

The Committee are unable to report any material progress during the last

brous organization by which their work was commenced. When the Com-

mittee was first appointed, no coherent system of units for the measurement

of electrical resistance, cm-rents, quantity, capacity, or electromotive force

had met with general acceptance. The so-called absolute system existed
indeed on paper, but in far too intangible a form to be either understood or
used by practical men. At the same time, proposals for the adoption of
isolated units, variously determined, had been carried out, with more or less

success, so as to meet in some degree the immediate requirements of tele-

graphy. Many competing imits of this nature were in the field. The Com-

mittee chose a system based on the absolute measure, and so, at least as far
as electrical resistance was concerned, made this measurement a tangible and

practical operation                                                                             and their choice has been ratified by men of science over
                                                                                             ;

a great portion of the globe. Copies of the unit of resistance adopted by

the Committee in 1864 were deposited at the Kew Observatory ; and others

exist in the hands of electricians in various parts of the world. Comparisons

of several of the copies, which were published in the Report of the Committee
for 1867, showed that, with one or two exceptions, the ratio of their resist-
ances remained unchanged. It is, however, desirable that additional com-

parisons should be made from time to time. Incidentally many researches of
considerable value were carried out by th^ Members of the Committee; and
the yearly reports have been so generally in request that it may be advisable

to reprint the entire series.

No second unit, however, has been issued by the Committee, although

apparatus for the determination of the irnits of capacity, quantity, potential,

and intensity of current have been constructed, both with the funds of the

Association and from the private means of its members. The great numbere

of the Committee render meetings of rare occurrence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        and  the Subcom-

mittees appointed to undertake the work have been lately remiss in its exe-

cution                        the Committee, believing that direct responsibility to the Association
                           ;

and greater freedom of action will act as a stimulus to individual members,

beg to suggest that the Electrical-Standards Committee be not reappointed,

--but that three new Committees of smaller numbers be chosen, to determine

and issue: 1st, a condenser representing the unit of capacity; 2nd, a

gauge for showing the unit difference of potential ; 3rd, an electrodynamo-

meter adapted to measm-e the intensity of currents in a decimal multiple of

the absolute measui-e.

   They would also suggest that it be an instruction to each Committee that
it shall carry out the system adopted by the Electrical- Standards Committee,
and that these new Committees shall have the use of all instruments hitherto

constructed with the funds of the Association, a list of which is appended (in

account book).

    Considering that the principal instruments have already been constructed,

the Committee believe that a small grant of, say, £20 to each Committee,

will be sufficient to meet the expenses of the next year.
    In conclusion, should this suggestion be adopted, they beg to recommend

·that a volume, containing the complete series of reports, be issued by the Asso-
ciation, and sold to the public, feeling assured, from the demand for isolated

copies, that such an issue would involve no expense to the Association.

--Sixth Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cavern, Devon-
    shire, the Committee consisting of Sir Charles Lyell, Bart.,
   F.R.S., Professor Phillips, F.R.S., Sir John Lubbock, Bart.,
   F.R.S., John Evans, F.R.S., Edward Vivian, George Busk,
   F.R.S., William Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., William Ayshford
   Sanford, F.G.S., c>^c? William Pengelly, F.R.S. (Reporter).

During the year which has elapsed since the Association met at Exeter, the
Committee have continued their researches without intermission, and have
in all respects adhered to the method of exploration adopted at the com-
mencement and described in detail in their First Eeport (Birmingham,
1865). The Superintendents have continued to visit the Cavern daily, and to
send Monthly Reports of progress to Sir Charles Lyell, the Chairman of the
Committee ; the daily results have been regularly journalized ; the workmen,
George Smerdon and John Farr, have continued to give the most entire satis-
faction ; and the great interest felt in the investigations by visitors and resi-
dents in Torquay has undergone no abatement.

   At the close of the last Meeting of the Association, a large number of the
Members and Associates visited the Cavern, where they were received by one
of the Superintendents, who conducted them through it and explained the
most striking phenomena connected with it. In addition to this large party,
the Cavern has, from time to time during the year, been inspected, under the
guidance of the Superintendents, by Professor Stokes (President, British
Association), the Duke of Somerset, Lord Talbot de Malahide, Lord H.
Thynne, Sir H. Verney, Sir J. Kay Shuttleworth, Sir A. Malet, General

Cotton, Genei'al Lefroy, General Tremenhere, Rev. Dr. Robinson, Rev. Prof.

Maurice, Rev. 0. Fisher, Rev. H. H. Winwood, and Messrs. W. R. A. Boyle,
J. Dundas, A. MacmUlau, E. B. Tawney, R. Yalpy, W. Vicary, and A.
R. Wallace, and many others.

   The Committee have again the pleasure of reporting that they have been
enabled to render assistance to those engaged in similar researches elsewhere.
Sir J. Kay Shuttleworth, Chairman of the Committee who have recently
undertaken to explore the caves in the Mountain-Limestone near Settle, in
Yorkshire, opened a correspondence with the Superintendents of the work in
Kent's Cavern, which eventuated in an arrangement that Mr. Jackson, Super-
intendent of the Yorkshire investigations, should visit Devonshire for the
purpose of making himself fully acquainted with the mode of operation
carried out there. Accordingly, on March 1, 1870, he reached Torquay,
where every facUity was given him by the Superintendents and the workmen

--for familiarizing himself with the work in aU its details.
    It has been stated in previous Reports : that Kent's Cavern consists of an
Eastern and a Western Division, each composed of a series of chambers and
galleries ; that it has two Entrances, which are about 50 feet apart, 200 feet
above the mean sea-level, from 60 to 70 feet above the bottom of the valley
in the same vertical plane, situated in one and the same low vertical chff in
the eastern side of the hill, and which open at once into different branches
of the Eastern Division ; and that the labours of the Committee have been

restricted to the Eastern Division, the different branches of which were known

as the North-east Gallerj', the Vestibule or Sloping Chamber, the Gallery,
the Lecture Hall, the South-west Chamber, the Water Gallery, and the North
and South Sally-ports. In their Fifth Report (Exeter, 1869) the Committee
stated that, with the exception of the last two, the exploration of the entire
series had been completed to the depth of 4 feet below the stalagmitic floor.
       ON KENT^S CAVERN, DEVONSHIRE.                                   17

without, however, reaching the bottom of the cavern ; and that some pro-
gress had been made in the South Sally-port.

The Sally-ports were so named by the late Rev. J. M'Enery, who firmly

believed that if excavated they would be found to lead to new external

openings in the eastern slope of the hiU, through which, indeed, burrowing

animals, especially foxes, had found ready access to the body of the cavern.

The year which has elapsed since the Fifth Eeport was presented has been

spent in the exploration of these branches and their ramifications, the cha-

--racters and contents of which are to be the subjects of the present Eeport.
   The South SaUij-port. The entrance of the South Sally-port is in the

eastern wall of the Lecture Hall. It is about 10 feet wide, SO feet west

and 52 feet south of the Arched or Southern Entrance of the cavern. Its

direction is, ou the whole, towards the south-east ; and with its ramifications

it occupies a space of about 80 feet from east to west, and 40 feet from north

to south. Its width, however, varies from 21 to 2 feet, and averages about

10 feet. There is not the least indication that it leads to an external opening,

or that any animals ever found or formed a passage into it from the exterior.

Indeed, its direction is not such as to take it to the hill -side.

Before the Committee commenced their operations in it, the height of its

roof above the deposits at the entrance was about 4 feet. At 45 feet in the

interior this had so diminished as to render it necessary to excavate to the

depth of 5 feet, instead of the customarj' 4 feet, in order to secure sufficient

height for the workmen ; and through nearly 30 feet before reaching the

inner end the deposits and roof were in contact.

At the entrance, and for some distance within it, the roof and walls bore

no indications of either the corrosive or erosive action of water, the edges of

the beds of limestone being everywhere sharp and angular. Beyond this

they assumed a corroded or fretted aspect ; and still further in, the roof had

the appeai-ance of a fissure, in wbich the walls gradually approach at higher

and higher levels, and a large mass of limestone threatens to fall at no very

distant future ; indeed a block of great size, which had fallen over the en-

trance in what may be called comparatively very recent times, gave the work-

men a great amount of labour in blasting and removing it. It is probable

that the sharp, angular character of the roof and walls at this part, already

mentioned, is due to the recent severance of this mass. It may be doiibted

whether the fissure-like character of the roof just spoken of is any thing more

than one of the "joints " so common in all the palaeozoic rocks of Devonshire

and Cornwall, which has been slowly widened by the action of acidulated

water percolating through it. At and near this part the walls are much cor-

roded, and not unfrequently fretted into holes rudely resembling the so-called

lithodomous perforations met with in limestone rocks in various localities,

and which have been recently much discussed. Beyond the " fissure" there

are several conical holes in the roof, which, as they ascend, rapidly diminish

in size. Most of them are more or less tortuous, thereby rendering it impos-

sible to say whether they pass upwards to the surface of the hill in the form
of " swaUets " or Swallow-holes. Some of them are lined with stalagmitic

matter, whilst others, showing the naked limestone, have a very decided

Awater- worn aspect.  few of both kinds have faint traces of reddish soil or

loam, whilst others are perfectly clean. Near the inner end of this branch

of the cavern the walls in several places indicate the long- continued erosive

action of water.

  A floor of granular stalagmite, varying from 21 inches to 1 inch in thick-

ness, extended from the entrance to about 15 feet within it. Beyond this

--18 REPORT 1870.

there was no trace of any tiling of the kind until reaching 27 feet, where small
patches presented themselves at considerable intervals. At length they be-
came more numerous and decided ; and at 50 feet there was a continuous
floor from wall to wall, varying from 1 inch to upwards of 2 feet in
thickness, and extending, without interruption, to the end. It is perhaps
worthy of remark that, from its entrance to upwards of 40 feet within it, the
South Sally-port is remarkably diy at all seasons, but that beyond this area
it is greatly exposed to drip. There is no doubt that the stalagmitic floor
at its entrance was formed of calcareous matter which had not been fur-
nished by or through the surrounding roof or walls, but had flowed in from
the adjacent Lecture Hall. In short, here, as everywhere else in the cavern,

the presence or absence of a deposit of stalagmite is a trustworthy indication
that the locality is at present wet or dry respectively.

   On the stalagmite at the entrance there was a layer of black mould, differ-

ing from that found in the same position in other branches of the cavern in
containing an admixture of the typical red cave-earth, which became more
and more abundant further and further in, until, at about 30 feet from the en-
trance, the deposit was exclusively cave-earth from top to bottom of each
section. At 50 feet from the entrance, where the inner stalagmitic floor
began, the following was the succession of deposits in descending order :

    First. Red cave-earth, from 12 to 21 inches thick.
    Second. Granular stalagmitic floor, from 1 to 24 inches.
    Third, or lowest kno-mi. Cave-earth of unknown depth, but exceeding

5 feet.

  --The cave-earth was commonly of the ordinary character a mixture of

red loam and angular pieces of limestone in about equal quantities. Occa-
sionally subangular and well-rounded pieces of red grit were found in it ; and
it everywhere contained blocks of stalagmite, sometimes of considerable
size, which cannot but be regarded as remnants of a floor older than that
overlying the deposit in which they were incorporated, and which had been

destroyed by some natural agency. From the entrance to 45 feet from it,

there were also in the cave-earth numerous large masses of limestone,
several of which required to be blasted in order to their removal. In some
instances they projected upwards through the deposit and the overljang sta-
lagmite ; and in one case a block so interrupted the continuity of the latter
as to leave a passage, under the block itself, into the deposit beneath, of

which it was obvious that some burrowing animal had availed itself. No

such masses were found beyond the 45 feet just mentioned.
    From the entrance to 60 feet within it, the cave-earth was traversed by a

tunnel or tunnels, running, on the whole, longitudinally and horizontally,
 with an occasional bifurcation. In most cases they were adjacent to one of
 the walls of the cavern or to one of the large fallen masses of limestone just
 mentioned ; but occasionally they passed entirely thi-ough the earthy deposit,

 when their vertical transverse sections were either circular or elliptical, and
 varied from 6 inches to 2 feet in diameter. Their sides and roof were tole-
 rably smooth, but less so than their floors, which were firmly compacted and
 somewhat blackened, as if by frequent passing. Careful attention was given

 to the subject ; but very few objects were found in them, the most important,
 besides those mentioned in the Fifth Eeport, being a canine of Felis speJcea,
 and an accumulation of dry moss, probably the nest of some animal. There
 were no tunnels in the innermost 20 feet of this Sally-port.

     At 34 feet from the entrance and for some distance beyond, the deposit,
 below the third foot-level, adjacent to the south wall of the cavern consisted

of materials closely resembling those which composed the rock-like breccia
below the old crystalline stalagmitic floor iu the South-west Chamber and
the Water Gallery, described in the Fourth and Fifth Eeports (Norwich and
Exeter, 1868 and 1869), but differing from it in being quite incoherent and
destitute of fossils, whilst the typical cave-earth, at the same level and adja-

cent to the opposite waU (a distance of a very few feet at most), yielded the

usual complement and variety of specimens.
    From 57 to 60 feet fi-om the entrance, the deposit below the second foot-

level contained no stones of any kind, and consisted of very fine firmly com-
pacted earth, having very few fossils.

   At 38 feet from the entrance, where there was no stalagmitic floor, there
was a thin band of charcoal about 3 feet long and 2 feet broad, 10 inches
below the surface, and midway in the section, so as to leave interspaces
of lip wards of 3 feet between its ends and the walls of the cavern.

   The upper sui-face of the deposits was an iucUned plane dipping towards
the inner end, where it was lO'o feet lower than at the entrance, wliilst the
latter was 13 feet lower than the surface of the cave-earth at the Arched or
Southern Entrance of the cavern, at which the Committee commenced theii*
investigations. Indeed the extremity of the South Sally-port is at once the
most southerly and the lowest point of the cavern which has at present been

reached.

   Besides a large number of bones (includiag several of birds and a few of
fish) and portions of antlers, the South SaUy-port yielded about 1400 teeth
and identifiable fragments of teeth, some of which were in jaws or portions

of jaws. The entire series may be thus distributed :

In the Table the arrangement is throughout that of descending order. Thus
the teeth of Badger, Fox, and Rabbit formed about 3 per cent, each of the
entire series ; but the first were rather more, and the third rather less, abun-
dant than the second, and so on in other cases. The same arrangement wiU
be observed when describing the other Sally-port and the passages con-

nected with it.

   From the disturbed state of the deposits in this branch of the cavern, the

Committee were prepared for the commingling of bones and teeth having a
modern aspect with those bearing all the indications of antiquity. Accord-
ingly some remains of the principal extinct Cave-mammals were found in
the deposit above the stalagmitic floor where this existed, and on the sur-
face where it did not ; and, in like manner, though very few remaias were

found in the tunnels, a tooth of Hog was found 2 feet deep in the cave-

earth, and skulls, jaws, and teeth of Sheep were met with somewhat fre-
quently at all depths. As has been ah'cady stated, the tiumels ceased at
about 60 feet from the entrance ; and there also ceased the inosculation of
ancient and modern relics ; the latest recorded case of Sheep below the sta-

lagmite was one tooth, in the first foot-level, at 62 feet from the entrance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and beyond this point there was no instance of any part of an extinct mam-

mal above the floor. Agglutinated lumps of Beetles' wings and wing-cases
were met with at all levels within the disturbed area.

   The specimens found in the stalagmitic floor, though but few, were of
considerable interest. Amongst them were teeth of Bear, Elephant, Hysena,

and Rhinoceros, and a portion of the internal shell of a Cuttlefish {Sepia

officinalis), thus confirming the statements made by the Committee in pre-

vious Reports, that at least some of the extinct Cave-mammals outlived the

period represented by the cave-earth *.

   As elsewhere in the cavern, some of the bones of the extinct mammals

were gnawed, some were greatly discoloured, and some, irrespective of the
level they occupied, were invested with films of stalagmite.

   Some localities were rich, whilst others were poor in specimens. Occa-
sionally they were found almost exclusively against one waU of the cavern,

whilst in other instances their distribution was tolerably uniform. They

continued to present themselves in the higher levels after they had ceased to
do so in the lower ones ; thus in the fifth or lowest foot-level there were
none beyond 51 feet from the entrance ; in the fourth they continued up to
59 feet, and a solitary Hycena's tooth was found 17 feet beyond this in the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

third level they were met with in tolerable abundance as far as 60 feet, and
a tooth of Rhinoceros with a fragment of bone appeared at 65 feet ; the last
specimen in the second level occurred at 73 feet, and in the first at 76 feet.
jN"othing was found in the last 4 feet.

In this branch of the cavern twenty-one flint implements and flakes were

found, of which ten were mentioned and four briefly described in the Fifth

Report (Exeter, 1869). Of those which have recently been discovered, four

only require special notice. No. 4561 was found on September 11, 1869, at

55 feet from the entrance, with a tooth of Horse, a tooth of Rhinoceros, and

a coprolite, in the fourth foot-level of cave-earth, over which was a sta-

lagmitic floor 14 inches thick. It is of white flint, lanceolate in form,

strongly carinated on one side, and slightly concave longitudinally on the

other, which is crowded with facets, indicating the dislodgment of smaU

flakes in great numbers. It measures 4-4 inches long, 1-1 inch wide, and

·3 inch thick at its broader end, and tapers gradually towards its point,

which it has unfortunately lost. It is the best implement of its type which

the cavern has yielded. No. 4521 is of the same kind, and also of white

flint, but less delicate in its proportions, being 3-1 inches long, 1-1 inch

broad, and -4 inch thick at the butt end. It was found with a jaw of

Rabbit, a tooth of Horse, a tooth of Rhinoceros, and fragments of bone, on

September 6th, 1869, at 53 feet from the entrance, in the third foot-level of

undisturbed cave-earth, over which was a stalagmitic floor 2 feet thick.

inky band is from -2 to -3 inch broad. It was found, with a tooth of
Horse, bones, and a coprolite, on October 2nd, 1869, at 63 feet from the en-
trance, above the stalagmitic floor.

    The two specimens hist described are in their colours unlike any other
flint implements, or flakes, or cores found in the cavern. Specimens white
on the surface and dark in the interior are very common ; but in those under

notice the succession is reversed.

    Amongst the remains of animals there is part of an antler of the Eeindeer
(No. jhVt)' "'liich has been gnawed. One of the grooves or scores on it,
however, is unusually deep and extends almost completely round it, being
interrupted at two opposite points only. It is so utterly without a parallel
amongst the multitude of gnawed bones which have been found in the
cavern, that it seems less unreasonable to ascribe it to human agency than to
the teeth of any animal. It was found, with a tooth of Horse, bones and bone-
fragments, and a coproUte^ on September 23rd, 1869, at 59 feet from the
entrance, in the third foot-level of cave-earth, and beneath a floor of sta-
lagmite 16 inches thick.

   The exploration of the South Sally-port absorbed nearly six months, and

--was completed on November 12, 1869.
    The North Sally-port. The entrance of the North Sally-port is in the

east waU of the Great Chamber, 28 feet south and 42 feet west of the
Arched Entrance of the cavern. All that was known about it when the

Committee commenced its exploration was, that it was a rude tunnel about
27 feet long, and at its entrance 8 feet high and 6 feet wide, having a rugged
floor of stalagmite more or less interrupted by large and small masses of
limestone, and rapidly descending from the mouth to the inner end, where
it was about 3 feet wide, having the floor and roof in contact, with the ex-
ception of a small aperture on the ' right, and a slightly larger one on the
left, which suggested that on being excavated it might prove to be of greater
length and to bifurcate. It is now known to be a low labyrinthine passage,
varying from 1'5 to 9 feet in breadth, but rarely exceeding 3 or, at most,
4 feet, ramifying very tortuously, and with sundry bifurcations and transverse
passages, through an area measuring about SG feet from north to south, and
84 feet from east to west, and terminating in an external opening in the eastern
slope of the hill, in the same vertical plane as the well and long-known
Arched or Southern Entrance of the cavern, but about 18 feet below it,
and 10 feet further eastward.

   The North Sally-port, then, has an external as well as an internal mouth
or entrance. The former, that just discovered, is nearly due east from the
latter, and by the least circuitous route is upwards of 140 feet from it. Ex-
cursions, however, may be made in various other directions ; and, indeed, one
or two of what are supposed to be minor branches remain to be excavated.
In one part, nearer to its internal than to its external mouth, the labyrinthine
passages have cut the limetitone rock into thi'ee insular masses, known as the

« Islands."

   Up to 20 feet from the internal entrance the excavation was limited to a

depth of 4 feet below the base of the stalagmitic floor, as in the other
branches of the cavern generally ; but beyond this point it was found neces-
sary to sink to 5, and in some places 6 feet, on account of the lowness of the

I'oof ; and even now those who traverse the various passages have to be

careful in their movements, so as to avoid collision with the various projec-
tions and pendants.

   In what may be termed the first " reach " of the SaUy-port, that which
--23 REPORT 1870.

has always been accessible, the roof and walls are much fretted, except certain

portions of the southern side, which are clothed with heavy masses of stalag-
mitic matter. The passage on the north-west of the " Islands " has the

aspect of a water-course whose roof and walls have subsequently been much

fretted, and in some places corroded into holes, perhaps less rudely resembling
" lithodomous perforations " than those in the South Sally-port, which have
been already mentioned. Between the " Islands" aud the external entrance,

indications that the passages are deserted water-courses fi'equently present

--themselves, and " swallets " occur in the roof at various places some lined

with stalagmite, some naked, some slightly stained with soil, and some per-

fectly clean.

  A floor of stalagmite of granular structure, which in many cases was so

charged with fragments of limestone as to be a concrete extremely dLHicult to

break up, extended continuously from the internal entrance to 1 4 feet within
it, and in some instances attained the thickness of 33 inches. Thence to

16 feet it thinned out before quite reaching the north-eastern or left wall,
after which it was again continuous to the end of the first " reach," where it
was in contact with the roof and was 12 inches thick. Beyond this the sta-
lagmite was very partial, rarely extended quite across the passages, and more

frequently than otherwise there was no trace of it. In the passage on the

soiith-western side of the two principal " islands," as well as in the narrow

" strait" which divides them, there were two more or less continuous floors,

one over the other, with an interspace of from 5 to 20 inches. In various

places there were, adhering sometimes to one wall only and sometimes to

both, rude moiilding-like fragments of a floor which had been destroyed.

   From the Internal Entrance, through the entire length of the first " reach "

and 8 feet inwards in the second, but in no instance beyond, a black deposit

(the true " black-mould " of previous Reports), varying from 1 to 20 inches in

depth, lay everywhere on the stalagmitic floor, where the latter existed, and

on the cave-earth (next to be described) where it did not, its junction with

the latter being sharply defined. Beyond the end of the first " reach " the
upper surface of the " black mould " approached the roof to within at most

10 or 14 inches.

The deposit next below the stalagmitic floor was the red cave-earth,

being of the typical character to the depth of at least 2 feet, below which it

--frequently consisted of loam of darker red and subangular pieces of grit of

the same colour the materials of the breccia rather than of the cave-earth.

In every passage and at all levels there were incorporated in the cave-earth

fragments of stalagmite, varying in volume from a cubic inch to 10 cubic feet.
There were also, but in less abundance, well-rolled fragments of rock not de-
rivable from the cavern-hill. Amongst the latter was a portion of a yellowish

drab pebble of fine-grained grit or quartzite, which had obviously been broken

and subsequently rolled. This specimen was met with about 5 feet within
the new or External Entrance.

At 19 feet from the Internal Entrance, a tunnel was found in the fourth

foot-level of the cave-earth, adjacent to the north-east wall ; and at 22 feet

Aanother was broken into on the opposite side.  transverse vertical section

of the latter was a semieUipse, measuring 18 inches in breadth at the floor,

and the same in height, whilst another section of it, a few feet further in,

measured 33 and 24 inches respectively. That on the opposite side was not

quite so large. They were both continued through the remainder of the first

" reach " and to about 6 feet in the second, where they ended. Their depth

below  the  surface  was  tolerably  uniform  throughout                                     but  they  were  not
                                                                                          j

always adjacent to the walls of the cavern. Nothing of the kind was found
again, except at about 30 feet beyond the point just specified, where a small
one, about 2 feet long, was laid open. In this branch of the cavern the
tunnels had the aspect of water-coui'ses rather than of burrows. Occasionally
bones and pieces of limestone projected from their sides ; and it was observed
that the exposed portions of the latter had always the blanched appearance
of such stones when found in shallow soil on limestone and beneath a thin
covering of turf, whilst their remaining portions were of the same colour as

the deposit in which they were lodged. No modern bones or other objects

were found in the tunnels.
   The upper surface of the cave-earth at the internal mouth of the North

Sally-port was 5'5 feet below that at the Arched Entrance of the cavern
thence to the external entrance, by the most direct route, it formed three

--inclined planes, of which the first fell 16 feet, towards the exterior of the hiU
--(i. e. eastward), in a length of 67 feet the fall, however, being by no means

uniform in amount. In the second plane the dip was reversed, and the
workmen in their excavations ascended 8-5 feet in a length of about 45 feet;
after which the dip towards the exterior was resumed, and continued to the

new mouth, giving a fall of 5 feet on reaching it. Hence the surface of the

deposit at the external entrance was 12-5 feet lower than at the internal,
and 18 feet lower than at the Arched Entrance of the cavern.

   The branch of the cavern now under notice contained very large quantities

of bones and other remains of animals.
   So long as it presented itself, the overlying black mould yielded potsherds,

marine shells (including CarcUum, Pecten, and the internal shell of Cuttle-

--fish), and bones (chiefly modern, but a few of extinct animals the astragalus

of Rhinoceros being the most important of the latter).
   In one instance only, about 26 feet before reaching the external entrance,

did any bones occur in the stalagmitic floor ; and these were few and, in

themselves, unimportant.

   The distribution of the fossils in the cave-earth was very irregular. The
first four " foot-paraUels " contained no specimens of any kind. Nothing was
found in the second foot-level until reaching 7 feet from the entrance, and
nothing in the first until the excavation had reached 1 1 feet ; after which
fossils were met with in tolerable abundance in every parallel, and almost in
every level, as far as 33 feet, even where local peculiarities made it necessary

to excavate to the depth of 6 feet.

   Perhaps their irregular distribution was nowhere more strongly marked than

--in the various passages connected with the " islands," commencing at the

point just specified 33 feet from the entrance. Along the entire north-

western passage fossils were very abundant, culminating probably on January

19th, 1870, when two " yards " of cave-earth lying one on another (in other

words, a paraUelopiped of the deposit measuring 3 feet long, 2 feet deep, and
1 broad, and therefore containing 6 cubic feet of matter) yielded 51 teeth of
Hyfena, 45 of Horse, 27 of Rhinoceros, 8 of Deer, 3 of Elephant, and 1 of
Wolf, 4 astragali of Rhinoceros, 3 portions of antlers, and a huge assemblage
of bones and fragments of bones. Along the northern and north-eastern
sides of the " islands " they became less numerous, especially in the third

foot-level. On the east there were none in the lowest two foot-levels. On

the south 320 cubic feet of deposit was found to contain no more than four
specimens. The low passage terminating at the south-west angle of the
" islands," and in which the deposits very nearly reached the roof, opened
into one of much greater height, in which the cave-earth was covered with
--34 REPORT 1870.

a stalagmitic floor 4 iiiclies thick. In this floor, almost at the commence-
ment of the passage, there was a rudely circular hole, about 18 inches in
diameter. One of the Superintendents, who was present when this was dis-
closed, drew himself up through the opening so as to command a view of the
space above, when he found, mixed with a small amount of cave-earth, a vast
accumulation of bones and teeth, some of which were partially imbedded in
the stalagmite. Above this mass of remains was, as has been already stated,
another floor of stalagmite, the space between the two being at that point
about 20 inches in height. The workmen proceeded to break up both floors

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and the labour was rewarded by the immediate exhumation of 29 teeth of
Hysena, 21 of Elephant, 21 of Horse, 18 of Rhinoceros, 7 of Deer, including

the " Irish Elk," 2 of Dog (?), 1 of Bear, and such a heap of bones and bone-

fragments as to render it necessary to send for a cart for the removal of the
" find." The upper floor was about 6 inches thick, and had a considerable
space al)ove it, in which there were neither fossils nor deposit. The two
floors (the upper one being partially destroyed), with their rich intermediate
layer of bones and cave-earth, extended along the entire passage on the
south-western side of the "islands," and through the " strait " separating
the two largest of them. In short, the fossil treasures there were a con-
tinuation of those which had previously been met with on the north-west.
Nothing was found in the deposit beneath the lower floor.

not less than 280 cubic feet of matter was dug, the only things found were

   Amongst the peciiliarities of this branch of the cavern are the compara-

--tively large numbers of remains of Badger, Elephant, and Beaver and, when

compared with those in the other Sally-port, the small number of Sheep, of

which the only remnant was one tooth.

The teeth of Elephant are not only relatively more numerous, but some of

them exceed in size any that have been found elsewhere in the cavern ; and
the plates of a few of them are remarkably thick.

 --The number of Beavers' teeth is eight : three molars in part of a jaw

the former specimens.
ON RENTES CAVERN; DEVONSHIRE.  25

   Many of the bones are gnawed, some are more or less covered with films

of stalagmite, some are greatly discoloured, and a few have the aspect
of the remains found in the breccia beneath the old crystalline floor of sta-

higmite described in previous Reports.

   Taken as a whole, the osseous remains found since the Fifth Report (1869)
was presented are probably superior to those found in any former year.

    Instances of the commingling of ancient and recent remains occurred in the
North as well as iu the South Sally-port, but they were by no means so abun-

dant in the former as in the latter.

   In the branch of the cavern now under notice there were found seven flint
implements and flakes, of which one was in the black moul^i overlying the
stalagmite, one was in the first foot-level of cave-earth, two were in the se-

cond, two in the third, and one in the fourth foot-level. Three appear to

have been struck from common flint nodules, and are comparatively unim-
portant. The remainiijg four are good specimens, but one of them only

(No. 5124) needs description. It is ovate, worked to an edge aU round its
perimeter, 2*7 inches long, 1"6 inch in greatest breadth, and "3 inch in greatest

thickness. The bulb of percussion is weU displayed on the inner surface,

which is concave in every direction, but especially in that of its greatest axis.
The outer surface is convex, or, rather, is formed of a series of distinct ap-
proximately plane surfaces, which concur to give it a considerable convexity.
There are indications of a great amount of work along the entire margin on
its outer face. Its colour is a veiy light grey, inclining to white ; but there are
indications of a dark interior. It was found with a tooth of Hyaena, a tooth

of Rhinoceros, bones, and balls of fsecal matter. May 24, 1870, in the

first foot-level of cave-earth, about 40 feet from the external entrance.
   Of the seven specimens, five were foimd nearer to the external than to the

internal entrance, and one (No. 5165), a small but good specimen, was no
more than 15 feet from it.

   Two of the bones found in this branch of the cavern appear to have been

cut artificially. The first (No. ^ ^^ ^ ) was found December 22nd, 1869, with
remains of Badger, Fox, Horse, Hyaena, Ox, and Rhinoceros, 24 feet from the
internal entrance, in the fourth foot-level of cave-earth, over which was a
continuous floor of stalagmite 12 inches thick.

   The second (No. -^-^j^) was found about 47 feet from the same entrance,
on January 24th, 1870, with remains of Elephant, Horse, Hyaena, and
Rhinoceros, in the second foot-level of cave-earth, over which there was no

stalagmite.

   Of the fish-bones which have been found, one (No. 5036) appears to have
been pointed and used as a pin or awl. It was met with on ApiTil 21st, 1870,
in the second foot-level of cave-earth, which was not covered with stalag-
mite, rather nearer to the internal than the external entrance.

   The exploration of the North SaUy-port was begun on November 12th,
1869 ; and in something more than eight months the workmen had dug their
way through it. The new entrance was reached on July 19th, 1870. There
are, however, one or two of its ramifications which are not yet excavated,
having been passed intentionally in the progress of the work. Hoav far they
extend is at present unknown.

  --The Extn-nal 3Iout7i of the North SaTly-po7-t. -Though the Superintendents

have no doubt that the North SaUy-port really has an external entrance,

the workmen have not dug their way to the day at the so-called new mouth.

--The following is the evidence on the question : During eight months the

direction of excavation had on the whole been outwards, i. e. towards the
26 REPORT--1870.

hill-side, which, from the ground-plan of the work and the contour of the
hill itself, was obviously nearly reached. This was confirmed by the appear-

ance of very fine rootlets, not through the roof, but horizontally in the de-

posit, which, as the work advanced, grew larger and larger until they became

roots two inches in diameter. The deposit had always been bounded by

limestone walls on each side, and by a roof of the same material, between

which and the cave-earth the interspace, where any existed, never exceeded

a few inches in height. On July the 19th, 1870, the workmen suddenly ceased

to be able to find a wall on the right or outside, or a limestone roof above
them ; and at the same time, and as suddenly, they were imable to reach the

upper surface of the deposit, which had also undergone a change of characters.

The materials through which they had uow to drive were, first, or lowest, a

variety of the cave-earth, with remains of the ordinary Cave-mammals, above

which was an accumulation of small angular pieces of limestone, with but

little earth and no fossils, and more or less cemented into a very loose con-

--crete with stalagmitic matter ; and the roof, or that which supplied its place,

was of the same character materials, in short, which are found everywhere

in the upper portions of the numerous limestone fissures of the district. At

that moment they were, according to their measurements, in the same vertical

plane as the Arched Entrance of the cavern, at a level of about 18 feet below

it, and 10 feet outside. In other words, they had dug their way through the

cavern into a talus of earth and stones lining the hill-side, and which, from

its upper surface to that on which they stood, was 18 feet deep.

--Two reasons prevented their attempting to break through this mass to the
open day :                                                            first,  it  would   probably destroy the  only road   to  the  cavern                                and
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

second, the attempt seemed somewhat hazardous, as the material showed a

great tendency to " cave in." It being necessary, however, to confirm or

disprove the conclusion that they had found a new entrance, a tunnel was dug

through the talus 12 feet long, varying from 4 to 8 feet wide, and having the

limestone rock for its inner or left boundary. The result was the same

throughout                                                            the     floor  and lower portion of       the  right  or  outer wall  was a

variety of the cave-earth with the common Cavern specimens ; and the upper

portions of this waU, as well as the ceiling, consisted of the loose concrete

ah-eady described, and which contained no fossils.

As there was nothing further to be gained, and the work seemed unsafe,

the tunnel was discontinued, and no doubt remained that the workmen had

emerged from the cavern, and, in cutting the tunnel, had been lajdng bare a

portion of the limestone hill on the left. It may be of interest to remark that

this limestone overhung about 2 feet, so as to aff'ord a " shelter " to that extent.

riety of the cave-eartli. It was in fact a fine silt with scarcely a trace of the

common red colour, and closely resembled material which, from time to time,

had been found within the cavern. Amongst the remains found in it were

11 teeth of Bear, 7 of Horse, 5 of Hyaena, and 4 of Rhinoceros. The bones,

of which there was a considerable number, were frequently broken, decayed,

and discoloured.

   "With the animal-remains two implements and one flake of flint were found.
Both of the former are of the usual white colour. One of them (No. .5236) is
little more than the point of what was probably once a good implement ; the

other (No. 5222) is a good lanceolate implement, 2-5 inches long, 1 inch broad

at the butt end, and -2 inch in greatest thickness. It is strongly cariuated
on the outside, and has three longitudinal facets. It was found July 28, 1870.
The flake (No. 5226) is yellowish, and apparently discoloured.

 --Smerdo7i's Passage. The new mouth is the external entrance, not only

of the North Sally-port, but also of a previously unsuspected passage or under-

vaulting, which, so far as is at present known, varies from 4 to 10 feet in
width, and extends in a north-westerly direction. It has received the name
of " Smerdon's Passage." On abandoning the tunnel just spoken of, the
workmen were directed to commence the exploration of this Passage ; and at
the end of last month (August 1870) they had advanced about 20 feet into
it. The deposit it contains is the common typical cave-earth, having, here
and there, a thin patch of stalagmite, but nothing like a continuous floor, and
everywhere reaching the roof, or within a few inches of it. It contains a
considerable number of pieces of limestone, none of which exceed 10 lbs. in
weight, a few subangiilar and rounded pieces of red grit, and blocks of Old

Stalagmite in abundance, some of which measure from 5 to 6 cubic feet.
   Numerous bones and upwards of 700 teeth were found, the latter of which

may be thus apportioned :

As in other parts of the cavern, some of the bones were gnawed, some

discoloured, and some more or less covered with films of stalagmite. With

them were found several agglutinated lumps of boaes of very small animals*,

coproHtes, three limpet-shells, a bit of charcoal, and four good flint flakes.
   Amongst the foregoing facts there are some on which it is difiicult to abs-

tain from speculation.

As has been already stated, the late Mr. M'Enery named the Sally-ports

from a settled conviction that they led to external entrances in the hill-side.
The facts on which he relied were, first, the direction in which they extended,

and, second and chiefly, the tunnels, which he ascribed to burrowing animals.

The first was obviously not very conclusive ; for he could not but be aware

that unless the so-called Sally-ports extended considerably beyond the

--point to which he could penetrate, and without much tortuosity points on
--wluch no opinion could be formed they must fall far short of the exterior.

   With reference to the tunnels, even if ascribable to burrowing animals, it
by no means followed that they were commenced at, or connected with, the

exterior of                                              the cavern                                                         for  as there were well-known  spots in  each  of                      the

branches in question where there was no stalagmitic floor, there was no dif-

ficidty in supposing the animals to have commenced their burrows in these

unprotected localities, to have sunk more or less vertically in the deposit, and

at a suitable depth to have proceeded horizontally. In the Erfth Eeport,

mention was made of vertical shafts of this kindf; and that this was the
actual mode of operation is now rendered still more probable by the fact that

no tunnels occur at or near the inner end of either of the two branches J.

* One of tliese lumps was found to contain upwards of 1200 bones.

28 REPORT--1870.

As has been stated iu previous Reports, the Committee have long been fa-

miliar with the presence of blocks of stalagmite in the eave-earth, and

have inferred from them that an ancient floor of the cavern had been broken

up by natural agency before or during the introduction of the cave-earth.

There seemed no difficulty in conceiving of a machinery by which such a floor

might have been destroyed in the comparatively lofty chambers. For example,

it was known that the deposit which the old floor had covered, and on which

it had been formed, had been, in some parts of the cavern, partially dis-

lodged, or had subsided so as to leave the floor unsupported ; it was also
known that blocks of limestone, some of them scores of tons in weight, had

from time to time fallen from the roof ; and it was not difficult to see that

such blocks would break into fragments any such unsupported floor on which

they might faU.

This, however, utterly fails to account for the destruction of the floor

which once existed in at least some of the narrow passages of the North Sally-

port. That such floors have been destroyed admits of no question, since, as

has been already stated, remnants of them stiU adhere to the walls, to say

nothing of their abundant fragments in the deposit below. That they were not

destroyed by the fall of blocks of limestone is obxious from the facts that their

remnants on the walls show that they were almost in contact with the roof
even as it now exists, and that the roof itself presents no indications that sach

masses have been detached from them. This problem still awaits solution.

   Many of the potsherds in the North SaUy-port were found in the overlying

black mould considerably beyond the point where man could have actually

placed or lost them, though not perhaps bej'ond the point where he might

have thrown them, if he could be supposed to have had a motive for doing

80. It seems not improbable, however, that, being, as they were, on a highly

inclined plane of very contracted width, their presence in the spots where

they were found was due to a participation in a slow and gradual movement

of the black mould downwards and inwards, in consequence of the frequent

passage of small recent animals.

There is greater difficulty in accounting for the occurrence of keen-edged

flint implements and flakes at and near the external mouth of the North

Common Shrew are occasionally observed near the door and in the adjacent thictet. On

December 8th, 1869, one of the Superintendents found the workmen in a state of excite-

ment, caused, no doubt, by an unwelcome visit of some infra-human marauder. They had

that morning taken to the cavern a pound of candles, of sixteen to the pound, and hun"

them in the accustomed place. On going to cut one of them, at 3 o'clock, it was found

that twelve of the pound were missing, and tlie condition of the remnants of the wicks was

such as to indicate cutting rather than gnawing. Hence it would have been concluded

that the loss was due to a human thief, had it been possible for one to have entered the

cavern without the knowledge of the workmen. On examination, one of tlie missing can-

dles was found between some large loo.se stones beneath the nail on which they were hung,

but no trace of teeth-marks could be found on it. Before the men left work the remnant

of the pound had been taken, so that not a candle was left ; but by what agency, remains

posed that man placed them -where they were found under the foregohig con-

ditions ; for the bottom of the valley being then far above the low-level
entrance, the passages into which it immediately opens were probably inac-

cessible, and certainly not available for human resort. On the other hand,

the hypothesis that the flints were washed there from the upper chambers
appears to be entirely negatived by the fact that, though lodged in a deposit
largely charged with stones, they are entirely unrolled and retain their keen

edges. It may be added that very few, if any, of the bones found with them

show any marks of abrasion, that the implements are more numerous at and
near its external entrance than elsewhere in the Sally-port, and that no such
phenomenon presented itselt at or near the end of the other Sally-port, which
has no external moiith.

   May not the following be the solution of the problem ? The implements
and animal-remains found at the new entrance and in the passages connected

with it were deposited after it had been laid bare, and are chronologically
separated from those in the high-level chambers by an amount of time suffi-
cient to deepen the valley to the extent of 20 feet, but not sufficient to make
any change in the fauna of the district, or in the character of the implements

which its human dwellers employed.

    Mr. Ayshford Sanford has continued his identification of the fossils during
the past twelve months, and has examined a large number of them. Tlie
present state of his health has unfortunately prevented his sending in a

Third Report of the Cmnmittee for the purpose of investigating the rate
   of Increase of Underground Temperature downwards in various

   Localities of Dry Land and under Water. Drawn up by Professor
   Everett, at the request of the Committee, consisting of ^\v William
   Thomson, F.ii.S^., Sir Charles Lyell, F.R.S., J. Clerk Maxwell,
   F.R.S., Prof. Phillips, F.R.S., G. J. Symons, F.M.S., Dr. Balfour
   Stewart, F.R.S., Prof. Ramsay, F.R.S., A. Gteikie, F.R.S, James

   Glaisher, F.R.S. , Rev. Dr. Graham, E. W, Binney, F.R.S.

   and Professor Everett, D.C.L. (Secretary).

Me. G. J. Stmons, whose observations, extending to a depth of 1100 feet
in a weU at Kentish Town, were reported at last Meeting, has since repeated

his observations at several depths.

   The first 210 feet of the well (which is 8 feet in diameter to the depth of
540 feet) are occupied by air ; and in this portion of the well the second series

of observations give temperatures exceeding those observed in the first series

by from 2° to 5° F., the excess diminishing as the depth increases. The second
series were taken in July and August, whereas the first series were taken in

January. It is evident that in this portion of the well, in spite of the pre-

cautions taken to exclude atmospheric influences, by boarding over the well
and erecting a hut over it, the temperature varies with the seasons, the
variations being in the same direction as in the external air, but smaller, and
diminishing as the depth increases, but still amounting to 2°-2 at the depth
of 200 feet.
30 REPORT-- 1870.

   "We can feel no certainty that even the mean annual temperature in this
portion of the weU represents the temperature in the solid ground. On the

contrary, the mean temperature in the weU at any depth is probably inter-

mediate between the temperature of the solid ground at that depth and the

mean temperature of the external air.
   It is well that such observations should have been carefully made and re-

corded in this one instance, if only for the sake of warning ; and they show

that we cannot expect to attain the object for which the Committee has been

appointed by observations in large shafts filled with air.
   Mr. Symons has also repeated the observations at 250 feet (which is 40 feet

under water), and at the depths of 600 feet, 750 feet, and every 50th foot
from this to 1100 feet, the lowest point attainable, on account of the mud,

--which extends 200 feet lower. The differences from the results obtained last

year are +-2, --3, ---4, ---2, ---2,0, -·!, -1, 0; which upon the whole

strongly coufia-m the correctness of the observations.

The temperature at 1100 feet is 69°-8, which, if we assume the mean tem-

perature of the surface of the ground to be  f 50°      gives  a  mean  increase

The curve in which temperature is the ordinate and depth the abscissa, ex-

hibits considerable irregularities tUl we reach the depth of 650 feet, beyond

which it is nearly a straight line, and represents an increase of -0187 of a de-

gree per foot.

   The strata penetrated by the weU to the depth to which our observations

extend consist of clay, sand, chalk, and marl, besides flints. (See tabular

list appended.)

   Mr. Symons in his Eeport calls attention to the anomalous position of a
column of water increasing in temperature and consequently diminishing in

specific gravity downwards, and suggests the inquiry why the warmer and

lighter portions do not ascend to the top. The proper reply seems to be that
the diminution of specific gravity, amounting to less than 1 part in 50,000
per vertical foot, does not furnish sufiicient force to overcome liquid adhesion,
and the water is thus able to remain in unstable equilibrium.

   Mr. Symons intends, during the remainder of the present year, verifying
those of his observations which have not yet been repeated, and concludes
his Report by remarking that it appears desirable to ascertain, by observa-
tions from year to year, whether the temperature at a given depth (say,
1000 feet) remains constant or is subject to minute changes periodical or

--otherwise a suggestion which appears fully worthy of being carried out.

   Mr. Wm. Bryham, Manager of Eose Bridge Colliery, Ince, near Wigan,

has taken very valuable observations during the sinking of that CoUiery,

which is now the deepest excavation in Great Britain. The pricipal results
have already been given, in a paper to the Royal Society, by Mr. Edward Hull,
Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland, who had previously published

some important contributions to our knowledge of underground temperature,

and has now consented to become a member of this Committee. Some of

the depths, however, have been remeasured since Mr. Hull's paper was read,

and I am now enabled, through the kindness of Mr. Bryham, to furnish a

rather more accurate report.

    The temperatures observed and the depths at which they were taken are

as follows :
                 ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE.  31

Depth in yards.
32 REPORT--1870.

" 3. Between 309 and 419 yards, the increase was at the rate of 1° for

60 feet.
   " 4. Between 419 and 613 yards, the increase was at the rate of 1° for

86-91 feet.

   " 5. Between 613 and 685 yards, the increase was at the rate of 1° for

65-6 feet

" . . . . The result of the whole series of observations gives an increase

of 1° for every 8:'.-2 feet  "
--Mr. Fairbairn's own summary is as follows : " The amount of increase

indicated in these experiments is from 51° to 57|° as the depth increases

from 5| yards to 231 yards, or an increase of 1° in 99 feet. But if we take

the results which are more rehable, namely those between the depths of 231

and 685 yards, we have an increase of temperature from 57|° to 75 j°, or 17|°

--Fahrenheit that is, a mean increase of 1" in 76-8 feet."

Mr. Fairbaii-n here by implication throws doubt on the alleged invariable

temperature of 51° at the depth of 17 feet, a determination which iu itself

appears highly improbable, seeing that, at Greenwich, the thermometer whose

bulb is buried at a depth of 25-6 feet, exhibits an annual range' of 3°"2,

while that at the depth of 12-8 feet exhibits a range of 9°. But even if we

assume the mean surface-temperatui'e to be 49°, we have still upou the whole

depth an increase at the rate of 1° in 80 feet, as against 1° in 54*3 feet at

Eose Bridge.

Mr. Fairbairn's paper gives also the results obtained at a second pit at

Dukenfield, which agree with those in the first in showing an exceptionally

slow rate of increase downwards. The temperatures at the depths of 167^

yards and 467 yards were respectively 58° and 66^°, showing a difference of

81° in 2991 yards, which is at the rate of 1° in 106 feet. The increase from

the surface down to 167^ yards, assuming the surface-temperature as 49°,
would be 9°, or 1° in 56 feet ; and the mean rate of increase from the surface

to the bottom would be 1° iu 80 feet, the same as iu the first pit.

  A Atabular list of the strata at Eose Bridge is appended to this Report.

full account of the strata at Dukenfield is given in Mr. Fairbairn's paper

(British Association Report, 1861).

   With strata so nearly similar, and in two neighbouring counties, we should

scarcely have expected so much difference in the mean rates of increase

downwards. In this respect Rose Bridge agrees well -svith the average of

results obtained elsewhere. Dukenfield far surpasses all other deep mines or

--wells, so far as our present records extend, in slowness of increase.
   This implies one of two things either that the strata at Dukenfield afford

unusual facilities for the transmission of heat, or that the isothermal surfaces

at still greater depths dip down iu the vicinity of Dukenfield.

   Mr. HuU has called attention to a circumstance which favours the first of

--these explanations the steepness of inclination of the Dukenfield strata. He

argues, with much appearance of probability, that beds of very various cha-

racter (sandstones, shales, clays, and coal), alternating with each other, must

offer more resistance to the transmission of heat across than parallel to their

plaues of bedding, as Mr. Hopkins has shown that every sudden change of

material is equivalent to au increase of resistance ; and it is obvious that

highly inchued strata furnish a path by which heat can travel obhquely up-

wards without being interrupted by these breaches of continuity.

To this suggestion of Mr. HuU's it may be added that inclined strata

furnish great facilities for the convection of heat by the flow of water along

the planes of junction. It appears likely that surface-water, by soaking
       ON UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE.                                          33

 downwards in this direction, may exercise an important influence in assimi-

lating the temperature at great depths to that which prevails near the surface.

Mr. Hull's own statement of his views is given in the footnote below*.

    Mr. M'Farlane has been prevented from continuing his observations near
Glasgow during the past year by the press of business incident to the removal

from the old to the new College.

    Mr. F. Amery, Druid House, Asliburton, Devon, has taken some observa-
tions with one of the Committee's thermometers in the shaft of a mine which
had been unused for a year and was nearly full of water. The shaft is 12 feet

 X 7 feet, and descends vertically for 350 feet, after which it slopes to the

south at an angle of 50°, continuing to the depth of 620 feet. The water stood
at 50 feet from the surface. Mr. Amery observed the temperature at every
50th foot of depth in the vertical portion, and found it to be 53° at all depths,

Aexcept at 250 feet and 200 feet, where it was 53-4 and 53*2 respectively.

copper lode crosses the shaft at the depth of 250 feet ; and it appears to be
generally the case, in the Cornwall and Devonshire mines, that copper lodes

--exhibit high temperature a circumstance which Prof. Phillips explains by

the conformation of the strata, which is such as to cause water from greater

depths to make its way obliquely ujjwards by following the course of the

copper lodes.

   The nearly constant temperature observed from the surface to the bottom
of the shaft seems to indicate a large amount of convective circulation. In

this respect small bores have a decided advantage.
    Mr. Gr. A. Lebour has taken observations with our thermometers in seve-

ral shafts and bores near Eidsdale, Northumberland, made for working coal
and ironstone. Mr. Lebour does not report the temperatures observed, which
he characterizes as discrepant and utterly valueless, owing, he believes, to the
numerous water-bearing beds which they cut through, and the very varying
temperature of these waters. Having now, however, found a dry bore, he
hopes to make a useful series of observations next winter.

   One of the Committee's thermometers has recently been sent to Mr. John
Donaldson, C.E., Calcutta, who has expressed his desire to aid in scientific
observation, and, being now engaged in examining for coal and iron under

Government, is likely to render us effective service.

   Shortly after the last Meeting of the Association, the Secretary of this Com-

* " Rose-Bridge Colliery oceupies a position in the centre of a gently sloping trough,

where the beds are nearly horizontal ; they are terminated both on the west and east by

large parallel faults which throw up the strata on either side. The Colliery is placed in

what is known as ' the deep belt.'

" Dukenfield Colliery, on the other hand, is planted upon strata which are highly in-

clined. The beds of sandstone, shale, and coal rise and crop out to the eastward at

angles varying from 30^ to 33°. Now I think we may assume that strata consisting of

sandstones, shales, clays, and coal alternating with each other are capable of conducting

heat more rapidly along the planes of bedding tlian across them, different kinds of rock

having, as Mr. Hopkins's experiments show, different eonducting-powers. If this be so,

we have an evident reason for the dissimilar results in the two cases before us. Assuming

a constant supply of heat from the interior of the earth, it could only escape, in the case of

Rose Bridge, across the planes of bedding, meeting in its progress upwards the resistance

offered by strata of, in each case, varying eonducting-powers. On the other hand, in the

case of Dukenfield, the internal heat could travel along the steeply inclined strata them-

selves, and ultimately escape along the outcrop of the beds.

" I merely offer this as a suggestion explanatory of the results before us, and may be

allowed to add tliat the strata at Monkwearmouth Colliery, the thermometrical observa-

tions at which correspond so closely with those obtained at Rose Bridge, are also in a

position not much removed from the horizontal, which is some evidence in corroboration

of the views here oflPered." Proc. Boy. Soc. 1870, vol. xviii. p. 175.

mittee addressed a letter to Professor Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian

Institution, United States, requesting his cooperation in furthering the ob-

ject which the Committee have in view, at the same time forwarding one of

our protected thermometers.

In June of the present year, an answer was received from Professor Baird,

Assistant Secretary in charge, to the effect that Professor Henry's iU health

during the present season had prevented his communicating to us the result

of his labours in response to this request.

   The letter addi'essed to Prof. Henry made special reference to an artesian

well of extraordinary depth, which was understood to be in course of sinking

at St. Louis ; and at the same time a letter was addressed and a special ther-

mometer sent to Mr. C. W. Atkeson, the Superintendent of the work of boring
at St. Louis. 'No reply has been received from Mr. Atkeson, who appears to

have left St. Louis before the letter arrived ; but letters have been received,

through the Smithsonian Institution, from Dr. Chas. W. Stevens, Superin-

tendent of the County Insane Asylum at St. Louis, this being the institution
for whose uses the weU was sunk, together with a very interesting news-

paper cutting, consisting of Mr. Atkeson's report on the works. The boring

of the well was commenced (at the bottom of a dug well 71 1 feet deep) on
the 31st of March, 1866, and was continued till the 9th of August, 1869,

when the work was stopped at the enormous depth of 3843| feet, exceeding

by more than one half the depth of Dukenfield Collier}'. The strata pene-

trated consisted in the aggregate of 63 feet of clay, 6 feet of coal, 360 feet of

shales, 2725 feet of limestone, and 680 feet of sandstone.

  A cast-iron tube of 11 j inches bore was first put down, reaching from the

top and secured on the limestone at the bottom. This tube was then lined

Ainside with a wooden tube, reducing the bore to 4| inches.  4|-inch drill

was put down through this tube on the above-mentioned date. The bore was

afterwards enlarged to 6 inches, and subsequently to 11| inches to a depth

Aof 131 1 feet. sheet-iron tube was then put down, extending from the top

to this depth, and the bore below was enlarged, first to 6 and afterwards to 10

Ainches diameter, to the depth of 953 feet.  sheet-iron tube 79 feet long

Avas then put down, which rests on the offset at the bottom of the 10-inch

bore. The 4|-inch bore was then enlarged to 6 inches to the depth of 1022

feet, and a wrought-iron tube of 5 inches bore, weighing more than 6 tons,

was put down, reaching from the top to and resting on the offset at the

bottom of the 6-inch bore, thus securing the work to this depth, and reducing

the bore to a convenient size to work in. The 4|-inch bore has been con-

tinued to the depth of 3843 feet 6 inches without further tubing.

At the depth of 3029 feet the first observation of temperature was taken,

and the reading of the thermometer was 107° Fahr. This first observation

is stated by Dr. Stevens to be specially worthy of confidence, as having been

confirmed by several repetitions, or, rather, to use Dr. Stevens's own words,
" this was the maximum of several trials." It was taken, as well as those

that followed it, by means of a registering thermometer (kind not mentioned)

but in answer to our inquiries Dr. Stevens states, upon the authority of the

carpenter who attached the thermometer to the pole by which it was lowered,

" that no means were taken to defend the bulb from pressure," In the ab-

sence of further information (and Mr. Atkeson himself has not yet spoken),

we can place no reliance upon the temperature recorded, as the thermometer

had to bear a pressure of three-fifths of a mile of water.

The temperatures registered at lower depths, the deepest being 800 feet

lower, were aU (strange to say) somewhat lower than this, a circumstance
ON tJNDERGROTTND TEMPERATURE.  35

 ·which is all the more remarkable because the pressure (which tends to make
 the reading higher) must have increased with the depth. At the bottom, or
 rather at 3837 feet, being 6i feet from the bottom, the temperature indicated
 was 105°. Either of these results, taken apart from the other and compared
 with the surface-temperature, would give a result not improbable in itself.
 The mean temperature of the air at St. Louis appears to be about 53°. But

 it seems desirable to avoid publishing calculations till the data are better

 established.

    Unfortunately the apparatus which was emploj-ed in boring has all been
removed, after the insertion of two wooden plugs, with an iron screw at the
upper end of each, one at the offset at a depth of 1022 feet, and the other at

the offset at the depth of 953 feet, for the purpose of separating the fresh
from the salt waters. These plugs were driven in with great force, and can
onlj' be withdrawn with the aid of a series of poles and other appliances,
such as were used in the boring, w^hich will be rather costly. The poles alono
are estimated to cost ^1152, or about ^200. If the plugs were withdrawn
(and according to Dr. Stevens there is nothing but the expense to prevent
it), the whole well would be available for observation. The Committee will

make every effort to prevent so rare an opportunity from being lost.
    The Secretary has also been in correspondence with Messrs. Mather and

Piatt of Salford Iron-works, respecting a boring at Moscow, for which they
have furnished machinery, and which is to be carried to the depth of 3000
feet. They refer to General Helmersen, of the Mining College, St. Peters-

burg, as the best authority to whom application can be made for particulars of

the Moscow boring as to temperature &e. The Secretary has accordingly

written to General Helmersen, endeavouring to interest him in the objects

of the Committee, and offering to forward thermometers. No reply has yet

been received.

   An element which it is necessary to know with a view to the correct re-
duction of our obseiTations, but which in many instances it is difficult to

obtain by direct observation, is the mean annual temperature of the ground
at or near the surface. Instances frequently occur in which the temperature
at the depth of 200, 300, or it may be 500 feet is accurately known, while

the temperature in the superincumbent strata can only be guessed at. This
is the case at the Kentish-Town Well, and partially at Eose Bridge and
Dukenfield Collieries.

    It is very desirable that, in connexion with temperatures at great depths,
there should in each locality be an accurate observation at a depth of from
50 to 100 feet. At such depths in the solid groimd, before it has been dis-
turbed by mining-operations, one observation suffices to give a good approxi-

mation to the mean temperature of many years. At depths of 2 or 3 feet it is

necessary to observe once a week or so throughout a year in order to get the

mean temperature at that depth for that year ; and this may differ by a con-
siderable amount from the mean of a series of years.

    In the Eeport of the Scottish Meteorological Society for the quarter end-

ing December 1862, there is a comparison of the mean temperature of the
air with that of the soil at the depths of 3, 12, and 22 inches at four stations,
from observations extending over five years ; and in the Journal of the same
Society for the quai-ter ending December 1865, there is a comparison of the

temperature of drained and undrained land from one year's observations un-
dertaken for this purpose at two stations, and including also a comparison
with the temperature of the air. The mean temperature of the air for each
day is in these comparisons assumed to be the simple arithmetical mean of

                                                                       d2
--36 REPORT 1870.

the maximum and minimum, as indicated by self-registering thermometers
4 feet from the ground. From these observations it appears that the mean

annual temperature of the soil was in every case rather above that of the air,
and that the excess was greater for sand than for undrained clay, and was
greater for drained land than for the same land undrained.

    The greatest excess occurred in the case of the 22-inch thermometer at
Nookton (Vale of Leven), where both surface and suhsoU are sandy and dry.
The five-yearly means at this station were :

    Air 46-1 ; soil at 3 inches 46-3, at 12 inches 47-3, at 22 inches 48-0,
giving an excess of 1-9 for the temperature at the depth of 22 inches as

compared with air.
    The smallest excess, in the case of the 22-inch thermometers observed for

five years, was at Linton (East Lothian), where it amounted to 0-7 ; but the
observations on the effect of drainage gave for the j'^ear of observation an
excess of only 0-2 at the depth of 30 inches in light sandy but undrained
soil, under a rye-grass crop, at Otter House, near Loch Fyne the corre-
 sponding excess for drained land of the same kind and in the immediate

 vicinity being 0-9.

    The mean temperature, at the depth of 3 feet, at Professor Forbes's three

 stations at Edinburgh, from five years' observations, gave an excess of 0-5.5

 above the mean temperature of the air at Edinburgh as determined by

 Mr. Adie's observations.

    Observations on soil temperature in England are much needed ; but the

 Greenwich observations give an excess of soil above air temperature falling
 within the limits above quoted, the excess at 3 French feet being 1"7, while
 at 24 French feet it is reduced to 1°. The soil of which the Observatory
 Hill is composed, and in which the thermometers are sunk, is dry gravel,
 and the unusual circumstance of decrease of temperature downward observed
 in the comparison of the 3-feet and 24-feet thermometers, seems to indicate
 that the surface of the hill is warmer than the surrounding land.

    In the present state of our knowledge, then, it appears that when the
 temperature of the earth has been observed at a depth of some hundreds of

 feet in any locality in Great Britain, and has not been accurately determined

 at a less deptli, some knowledge of the rate of increase downwards may be
 obtained by assuming provisionally that the mean temperature of the surface
 is about a degree higher than the mean temperature of the air, supposing the

 latter to be known.
     It is to be wished that the "Meteorological Society would, from the ample

 materials in their possession, publish a map of annual isothermals for Great
 Britain ; and the objects of this Committee would be greatly furthered by

 an extensive scries of soil-temperature observations at the depth of about
 3 feet.

     The Committee are anxious to carry into effect Mr, Hull's proposal (quoted
 in their last Report) to bore down from the bottom of a deep mine ; and as
 Hose-Bridge Colliery appears to be an eminently suitable locality for such an
 operation, the Secretary has consulted Mr. Bryham respecting its practicability
 and probable cost. Mr. Brj'ham's reply is that there would be no difficulty
 in carrying out the proposal at Rose Bridge, that to make preparations and
 bore 300 feet would, on a rough estimate, cost £150, and that the second
 300 feet would probably cost about the same sum.

     The Committee would earnestly appeal to the liberality of the Association
 to enable them to put this design in execution ; and they would remark that
 the sooner it is carried out, the more valuable the results obtained will be, as

Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime, in their paper on the Corals from the

Mountain Limestone, published in the Transactions of the Palaeontographi-

cal Society for 1852, state that this period is one of the richest in true Polyps,

and that 76 species up to that date have been found ; of these, they record

43 as found in British strata. In the progress of our investigations we so
greatly add to this number that, from Scottish strata alone, we have obtained

64 species belonging to the following families :

Although some of these forms have been determined from somewhat im-

perfect data, we have no doubt that the continued investigation of these

remains wUl yet greatly increase their number, and cause considerable alter-

ations in their classification ; we consequently feel the necessity of being

more severe in our labours, not only with the view of adding to the knowledge

of species, but of getting rid of the numerous synonyms whicli encumber

the study of this interesting group of animal remains,

CamjMphylliim. Fig. 1 represents Amplexus coralloides (Sow.) ; fig. 7, A.

Menslowii (Edwards & Haime). This genus is characterized by broad tabula

and sparsely developed endotheca. These species are much restricted in

their vertical range : we are not aware of their being found in any other

position than in the lower members of the series, A. coralloides has been

found at Beith, Ayrshire, aud at Brockley, near Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire ; A,

Campojjhyllum -with Cijathophyllum and Zephrentls cylindr'ica, we cannot
see any good grounds for these forms being placed in separate genera. Tho

tabula and endotheca are very similar in all the three forms.

Plate II. presents important structural confirmations. Fig. 1, Cijatho^

&XyhijUum Wrirjhtl. Eigs. 3, 10,  13 are closely allied to Cijathophyllum,

and probably may form a subgenus. They are all restricted to the 'lower

beds, and are found at Brockley, Lesmahagow, and at Howret, Ayrshire

&Figs. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15,  16 have close affinities to tho

genus Clisiophyllum (Dana), but there is a distinctly marked difference in

AUthe structural characteristics from those of any known species.      are

restricted to the lower members of the period, and are found at Brockley       '

Lesmahagow.

Plate III. contains seven varieties of the genus (JlislophiiUum (Dana). This
genus is characterized by the conical boss in the centre of the calice, and by
the central line which passes down from the apex of the cone to the inferior

&extremity. Pigs. 1, 3,  4 have close affinities to fig. 6, which represents

C. hpartitum (M'Coy), while there is a distinctly marked difference in

structural characteristics. Figs. 2, 5, & 7 differ very materially from tho

others, and cannot be referred to any named species. They are all found in

the lower members of the period at Beith, Ayrshire.

    Plate IV. contains five varieties. Fig. 5, CUsiophyllum coniseptum (Key-

serling). This is the only named species represented on this Plate. Figs.

1, 2, 3, & 4 differ very materially from any existing genus ; they are not

only restricted to tho lower members of the period, but also to a very

limited area of the period. They have only been found at Treahorn, near

Beith, Ayrshire.

    Plate V. fig. 4 has close affinities to ClisiophyUum coniseptum. Fig. 1
has a clear generic distinction from all the others found that have passed

through our hands. This coral we have found 10 inches in height, and fi-e-
quently 2 inches in diameter. It is the largest form of this class we have

& &yet seen. Figs, 4 5 are closely allied to figs. 1 4 of Plate IV. These,

like the former, are aU restricted both in vertical range and in area. Thev

have only been found at Treahorn, near Beith, Ayrshire.

Plate VI. &figs. 1, 2, 5 are three varieties of the genus ClisiophyUum

(Dana), but they cannot be referred to any existing species with which we
met. They are restricted both in vertical range and area. They are only
found at the base of the rocks of this period, and are met with at thirdpart

near Beith, Ayrshire. Figs. 3 & 4 show a distinctly marked difference in
the essential characteristics from any known genus. They are found in the
lower beds at Brockley, near Lesmahagow, and at Treahorn, Beith Ayr-
                                                                   ·'

tain to what genus it could be referred. The history of this specimen is

perhaps one of the best iUustrations on record showing the necessity of

generic or specific names. It was named fum/itus by Ure in 1793 Turbi-

viz. Milne-Edwards and Haime. Ttis great diversity of nomenclature we can

only attribute to the fact that non-essential and external characteristics

have been too implicitly trusted in drawing generic distinctions ; when we
examine their internal structures, genera named exhibit essential dif-

ferences of conformation. This genus is found all over Scotland, but is
restricted to the base of the Mountain Limestone.

typical specimen, the only one, so far as we are aware, that has been dis-

covered in British strata. These forms are aU restricted to the lower members
of the period ; they are found at Bathgate, Brockley, and Beith, Ayrshire.

   F.R.S., F. Galton, F.R.S., Prof. Rankine, F.R.S., and W. Froude,

     appointed to report on the state of existing knoivledge on the Sta-

    bility, Propulsion, and Sea-going Qualities of Ships, and as to the
    application which it may be desirable to make to Her Majesty's
     Govei'nment on these subjects. Prepared for the Committee by

   C. W. Merrifield, F.R.S.

 We have to report that we have availed ourselves of your permission to

  apply to the Admiralty to carry out the experiments recommended in our
  first Eeport, presented to the British Association at Exeter last year, and
  that the Admiralty have declined to carry out these experiments, but they
  have sanctioned certain experiments upon models to be conducted by Mr.
 Froude, one of our number.

     The following is a copy of the correspondence on the subject.

                                                                                           Institution of Naval Arcbit^cts,

                                                                                                    28th September, 1869.

                                   To the Secretary of the Admiralty.

   --Sir, At a Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of

  Science, held at Norwich in 1868, the attention of the Association was
 drawn to the deficiency of existing knowledge on the stability, propulsion,
STABILITY, PROPULSION, AND SEA-GOING QUALITIES OP SHIPS. 45

and sea-going qualities of ships, and to the need of further experiments on

those subjects as a basis for the extension of theoretical investigation.

  A Committee, consisting of Mr. Bidder, Capt. Galtoit, Mr. F. Gaston,

Prof. E.ANKINE, Mr. Frotjde, and myself, was appointed for the purpose of
reporting on the state of existing knowledge on these subjects. At the re-
cent Meeting at Exeter this Committee presented a first Report, in which
they recommended certain experiments involving trials on too large a scale
to be undertaken by private individuals ; and the Association thereupon re-
appointed the Committee, and instructed them to apply to the Admiralty to

carry out the experiments suggested.

   I enclose six copies of the Report, and also an extract showing the expe-
riments actually recommended.

    "With regard to the general question, it is submitted that there is a great

want of exact experiments on vessels of which every particular is duly
known and recorded. The experiments will undoubtedly require that a
certain outlay should be incurred, and provided for in the estimates ; but it
is believed that even a considerable sum invested in this way would probably
economize much larger amounts, which would otherwise have to be spent in
the tentative design of ships and propellers.

   The Committee have indicated in their Report the class of experiments
which they consider to be immediately required. They have purposely ab-
stained from giving detailed proposals, both because they desire to avail
themselves of the immense experience of the naval advisers of the Admiralty
and of the unrivalled technical knowledge of the constructor's department,
and because the details must after all be settled with reference to the vessels
selected for, and the staff entrusted with, the experiments decided upon.

  MyIf Lords should be pleased to give a general assent to the proposal, it

appears to the Committee that the simplest plan would be for their Lordships
to appoint some of their officers to confer with the Committee of the Asso-
ciation, both as to the detail of the experiments and the best means of
carrying them out, and with regard to the pro\-ision which wiU be needed
for them in the estimates.

   The Committee wish it to be understood that they do not by any means
discourage experiments made by means of models, which can evidently bo
had in greater number and in larger variety at much less expense than on full
scale ; but they have (with the exception of Mr. Froude, whose reasons for
dissent are appended to the Report), on the whole, come to the conclusion
that the experiments which they have recommended tqion full-sized vessels
are those which at the present moment are most itrgently needed for the
advancement of the theory of the design of ships and the possibility of pre-

dicating their sea-going qualities,

                                                                                           I have, &c.,

                                  APPENDIX.

Communication received from the Institution of Engineers in Scotland, with
            which is incorporated the Scottish Shipbuilders' Association.

Report of the Committee on a Communication received from the British

                           Association respecting the Qualities of Ships.

Your Committee having considered the printed Report of a Committee of

the British Association which has been submitted to them by the Council

and other information on the same subject, beg leave to report as follows :

   1. Your Committee approve of the said Report generally, and especially of
the parts headed "Proposed Experiments," pages 29 to 81 , and " Recom^

mendatioii of Experiments on Rolling," pages 59 to 63 ; for they consider

that such experiments as those therein proposed are required for the practical

advancement of the arts of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, as

well as for scientific purposes.

2. Tour Committee agree with the Committee of the British Association

that the experiments required are beyond the means either of individuals or

of firms, or of Scientific Societies ; and that it is therefore desirable that they

should be undertaken by the Government.

3. Tour Committee therefore recommend that the Council of the Institu-

tion of Engineers in Scotland should appoint a deputation, for the purpose of

cooperating with the deputation of the Council of the British Association in

the application to the Admiralty proposed in the last paragraph of page 31,

and in the last paragraph but one of page 62, of the printed Report before

--"Wementioned, which paragraphs are as follows :
Page 31.                  therefore recommend that the Council of the British As-

sociation should authorize a deputation to apply to the Admiralty to provide

for such a set of experiments in the course of the Summer of 1870 ; also,

that the Council should appoint a Committee, consisting of three members of

the Association, to confer with officers of the Admiralty respecting the detail

of the experiments, and that the Admiralty should be requested to give an

opportunity to the members of that Committee of taking a share in the ob-
servations, in order that they may be enabled to make an independent Re-

-- Weport upon results."  therefore recommend that the deputation previously
Page 62. "

mentioned with reference to the experiments on Resistance, be also instructed
STABILITY, PKOPULSION, AND SEA-GOING QUALITIES OF SHIPS. 47

to urge upon the Admiralty the importance, both practical and theoretical,

of instituting such a set of experiments, of providing suitable instruments

Wefor recording exact observations, and of publishing the results.  also

recommend the appointment by the Council of the Association of a Com-

mittee of three members to confer with the officers of the Admiralty as to

the drawing up of detailed instructions for conducting these experiments

and that the Lords of the Admiralty, in the event of their assenting to the

proposals, be requested to nominate a committee to confer with the Committee

named by the Association."

4. As regards the proposal in the printed Report, that the Council of the

British Association should appoint a committee of three members of the

Association to confer with the officers of the Admiralty, your Committee re-

commend that the Council of the Institution of Engineers in Scotland should

also appoint a Committee of three members of this Institution for the same

purpose ; and that, in appointing that Committee, in order to avoid making

the combined committees inconveniently numerous, they should endeavour,

by communication with the Councils of the British Association and of the

other Scientific Societies concurring in the application to Government, to fix

upon members of committee who maj'^ represent two or more societies

jointly.

5. Your Committee recommend to the consideration of those who may

arrange the experiments a method of experimenting on the resistance of the

water to the motion of ships lately practised by the French Government,

viz. to set a ship in motion at a considerable speed, and then allow her to

be gradually retarded and brought to rest by the resistance of the water,

making observations of the rates at which the retardation goes on, and de?»

ducing the resistance from the results of those observations.

Your Committee recommend this method not as a substitute for, but as au

addition to, the methods mentioned in the printed Report ; for they consider

that important conclusions may be deduced from a comparison of the values

of the resistance of a ship as ascertained by towing and by retardation

respectively.

Report of the Committee on Earthquakes in Scotland. The Committee

   consists of Sir W. Thomson, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., D. Milne-

   Home, F.R.S.E., P. Macfarlane, and J. Bryce, M.A., LL.D.,

    F.G.S. (Reporter).

The instruments belonging to the Association, set up at Comrie, are in a

satisfactory condition, and the records are duly kept. It has, however, been
of late forced upon the attention of the Committee that most probably the
Seismometer is not sufficiently delicate to indicate the very slight shocks

which are now of frequent occurrence, while the concave disk, on which the

pencil-point traces the direction of the shock, is inconveniently high for fre-

quent observation. Under these circumstances some simpler contrivance, and
one which shall give less trouble to the observer, is much to be desired.

The Committee is jiow considering how this can be best accomplished, with

special reference to the registration of slight shocks by some method of
magnifying the effect. Care will be taken that the instrument be thoroughly
tested before being set up at Comrie, and that the cost be as small as pos-
sible. In the autumn of last year there were several slight shocks, and,
apparently in connexion with them (though it would be rash to speak posi-
tively on this point), a remarkable movement of the waters of Loch Earn,
though the shocks were not felt at that distance from Comrie. The matter
being reported to me, I went into the district soon after, and collected the
most satisfactory evidence of the movement in question. It occurred on
several occasions in the months of August and September last ; but the most
remarkable and most completely attested case was that of the 15th day of
September, between the hours of 10 a.m. and noon. The day was calm and
misty, with a slight air up the lake from the east, and the water conse-
quently quite unruffled. At the east end chiefly the movement was observed.
 The water rose slowly, in successive low, broad undulations, to the height of
 from 2 to 6 feet, along the shelving beach, and as slowly subsided, the undu-
 lations continuing through the two hours of the forenoon above mentioned.
 There was nothing sudden or disturbed in the movement ; in so far it was
 unlike the effect of earth-waves passing into water ; it resembled more the

 movements which are at rare intervals noted in the lakes of Switzerland, and

 may be the effect of subterranean movements at great distances. Instruction

--had been given for the careful observation of any such occurrences in future.

 On the 29th of April last, about 11 p.m., a pretty smart shock of earthquake
 was felt over the district, to the extent of 10 miles along the valley of the

 Earn, and about half that distance in a transverse direction. There were
       ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.   49

two shocks, with an interval of about half a minute. The direction whence
the undulation seemed to all the observers to proceed in different parts
agreed pretty closely with that indicated by the Seismometer, There was
nothing unusual, or in any way remarkable, in the indications of the instru-
ments by which the atmospheric phenomena are recorded. The movements,
indeed, are more probably connected with the geological relations of the

district, and may have no dependence on its meteorology. It is, however,

premature to enter on this question in the present state of the inquiry.
The Committee is most desirous to be enabled to put up two or three Seis-
mometers in other adjacent localities, if any instrument of manageable size
can be constructed, and thoroughly capable and trustworthy observers secured.

                          [Plates I., II., III.]

Before describing its operations during the past year, your Committee desires

to recall the attention of the Association to the circumstances which led to

its reappointment at Exeter last year.

   Your Committee was first constituted at N'orwich in 1868, with a grant of
^10 " to report on the treatment and utilization of Sewage." The resiilts of

its inquiries were detailed in the Eeport made to the Exeter Meeting in

1869, and the Committee was reappointed with a grant of .£50, being then

constituted as follows :

Mr. Grantham, Mr. Denton, Mr. Harrison, Mr. Hope, Dr. Paul, and Pro-

fessor Wanklyn.

The Committee as soon as possible made arrangements to proceed with the

inquiry entrusted to it ; and one of the first steps taken upon resuming its

operations was, in virtue of the power vested in all Committees, to add to

its number several gentlemen whose assistance was considered desirable,

namely, Mr. Cooke, Professors Corfield, Marshall, and "Williamson, and Sir

John Lubbock as Treasurer with respect to the Fund raised by the Committee

as hereafter described.

The Committee proceeded to collect existing information upon the subject

of sewage &c. with a view to summarizing it.

It soon became evident to the Committee that the grant of .£50 from tho

British Association would be whoUy insufficient for carrying on the investi-

Agations in a broad and comprehensive manner.     circular was thereupon

prepared and addressed to the authorities of the towns principally inter-

ested in the solution of the difficulties in connexion with the disposal of

sewage, who it was thought would, if requested, subscribe towards a fund

for carrying on the investigations. The draft of this circular was submitted

1870.                                             E

to the Council of the Association. The circular was then issued, at various
times, to upwards of 700 towns in the United Kingdom. The result of these
applications has been that the authorities of about 150 towns and districts,
in addition to other public bodies and some private individuals, have sub-
scribed the sum of ^1530. There was a general expression of satisfaction

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  _

from the towns at the appointment of the Committee, who received nu-

merous offers of assistance in the prosecution of its inquiries.
    The various applications to the towns occupied some time, during which

the Committee was unable to take active steps in the prosecution of the in-
quiry, the scope and character of which would necessarily be governed by
the amount of support rendered by the towns ; and it was not until the end
 of February that the Committee found itself in a position to proceed with
the full inquiry proposed by its circular. The Committee then considered
that the funds received justified the commencement of systematic work,
 and a circular was at once addressed to the authorities of all the towns re-
 questing them to state the nature of their difficulties with respect to the
 sewage question, and the points upon which they would specially desire in-
 formation. In reply to this many communications were received detailing
 the particular circumstances of the various towns, and the difficulties com-

 plained of. The information required may be briefly summarized as follows :
    The towns complaining of difficulties may be classed under two heads

 those having efficient arrangements for the removal of their sewage, and
 those where, for want of systematic sewerage, the refuse is a source of
 nuisance and injury to health. The latter class of towns seems to require
 information upon all points, and some of the municipal authorities, against

 whom injunctions had been obtained or threatened, even wished for advice

 in their particular cases. "Where irrigation was considered from local cir-
 cumstances impracticable, inquiry was particularly made as to whether the
 Committee could safely recommend any simple and efficient method of deo-
 dorization. Several towns which had adopted methods of filtration com-
 plained of their failure. Some towns had no present trouble to complain of,
 but wished to know how far the systems adopted by them would meet the
 requirements of a more stringent legislation on the question. Only one town
 (Carlisle) where irrigation is being practised had no difficulty, present or

 prospective, and required no information.
     The Committee being desirous of restricting its labours to the proper sub-

 ject of the inquiry entrusted to it, viz. the " treatment and utilization of
 sewage," and assuming as proved the deleterious effects upon the health of
 towns of substances which escape from stagnant sewage into the surround-
 ing soil, water, and atmosphere, resolved " that it was unnecessary to enter
 upon any special medical or other hygienic investigation for the purpose of
  establishing that general conclusion, but that it would direct its special at-
 tention to the extent to which the soil, water, and atmosphere are polluted by
 the several systems adopted for removing sewage from towns." It decided

  also to take into consideration the probable sanitary advantages or disadvan-
 tages of different methods of treating sewage after removal, and the effects

  upon the public health of the various methods proposed for its utilization.
     The Committee considered it desirable that all persons having processes for

  the purification or utilization of sewage should be applied to, to submit them
  for examination, and to furnish details of the principle and working of their]

  respective plans ; advertisements were accordingly issued. Descriptions of1
  several methods and some suggestions have been received ; these, howeverj

  have not yet been examined.
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  51

    The Committee continued its investigation of last year into the modes of
treatment and utilization now practised, and a form was prepared and sent
to the principal towns for the purpose of obtaining further information on
the subject. The replies received from 200 of these towns have been tabu-
lated. The Table and a statement describing the results of this part of the
inquiry wiU be found further on in this Eeport.

   The Committee decided upon making local investigations in towns typi-
cally representing various methods for the disposal of refuse matters, and for
this purpose appointed two engineers to make the inquiries. Cambridge and
Bury were first selected for examination, as being good examples of water-
closet and privy and ashpit towns respectively.

   The Committee considered it desirable that the existing information bear-
ing upon the subject of the present inquiry should be collected in the form
of a " Digest," which Professor Corfield undertook to prepare ; he has
done so, and it will be distributed with this Eeport to the towns which have

subscribed to the Committee's fund.

   The Committee availing itself of the proximity to London of the town of
Romford, a lease of the sewage of which for irrigation iipon " Breton's Farm"
happened to have been taken by one of its members, appointed a person to
reside on the farm to make observations as the cropping progressed, to take
gaugings, and to coUect samples for analysis, both of the sewage and of the

effluent water. He has proceeded with the work, and the observations &c.
have been tabulated and a plan has been made of the farm as laid out for

sewage irrigation, with the engines, tank, distributing-troughs, carriers, beds,
and underdrains, all of which are explained in the special description of this
farm, which will be found in an appendix to this Report.

   The Committee appointed Dr. Russell, of St. Mary's Hospital, London, to
make such analyses as they might requii'e, and those referred to and given
in the description of Breton's Farm and other portions of this Report have

been furnished by him.
   As some apprehensions have arisen to the effect that the distribution of

sewage over the land might possibly favour the spread of entozoic diseases in

various ways, and might even propagate some that have not yet been known

to spread in our country, the Committee has thought it desirable to insti-
tute a series of experiments with a view to deciding this point, or at any rate
throwing some light upon it. To this end three families of guinea-pigs have

been purchased, each family consisting of four members : one member of each
family has been examined by Professor Corfield, who reports that no sign of
entozoic disease of any description was to be found with the help of a powerful

pocket-lens, either in the viscera or muscles of either specimen examined.

   The three surviving members of one family are now being fed on sewaged

produce only, and those of the other two families on unsewaged produce
only : it is proj>osed to feed the members of one of these last-mentioned

families with an occasional meal containing entozoic larvae or ova, found
either upon the sewaged vegetables (it having been stated that some have
been so found on the Craigentinny meadows), or, failing that, in the sewage

itself.

    Thus there will be three families of three members each ; of which one
family will have been fed upon sewaged produce alone, one on unsewaged
produce alone, and one on unsewaged produce known to contain entozoic

larvae or ova.

    The animals will then be killed and carefully examined ; and it is hoped

that some result may be obtained even from this preliminary experiment,

                                                                         e2
--53 REPOET 1870.

although, conducted on so small a scale. The Committee, however, fully in-
tends to prosecute the inquiry further, and to institute experiments of this

nature on a larger scale.

   It may be added here that some specimens of sewage-grown rye-grass,

carrots, turnips, onions, beet, and lettuce, from Breton's farm, were sent to

Mr. M. C. Cooke, M.A., for examination, with a view to the possible disco-

very of entozoic eggs or larvte. He states that " the rye-grass was mouldy,

but only from such moulds as are the result of decay from the damp grass

having been kept several days enclosed ;" and he siimmarizes the results of

--his examination of the vegetables as follows : " I find nothing whatever to

report against any of them. They all seem to me in excellent order and

free from parasitic insects, or from fungi of any kind."
   The foregoing Eeport is a brief account of the work done by the Committee

since the last Meeting of the Association at Exeter. Further details wiU be
found in the appendices ; but in the present immature stage of so important
and difficult an inquiry the Committee can only report progress, reserving
for a future, and it is hoped early Eeport, the practical conclusions and sug-
gestions resulting from its labours.

                            APPENDIX.

        A. Abstract of Returns from 200 Towns.

Returns have been received from a large number of towns, recording

the existing arrangements of water-supply, sewerage, scavenging, and dis-

posal of refuse ; and the returns from 200 of these have been tabulated by

the Committee with a view to the selection therefrom of tyincal towns

for examination. They are arranged consecutively, from 1 to 200, under
the headings " Registration Divisions," " Counties," and " Watersheds."

Under the first heading all the Registration Divisions recognized by the

Registrar- General in England and Wales arc included, with the exception

of that of London. Under the second heading all the counties of England

appear, except Rutland, Huntingdon, and Westmoreland, while Wales is repre-

sented by seven towns. Scotland and Ireland contribute eight and four towns

respectively. Out of the 220 watersheds into which England and Wales are

divided, 39 appear in the schedule, and these comprise the principal rivers.

The 200 towns and districts enumerated contain a population of 7,159,240.

The whole of the towns in Great Britain and Ireland may be divided into

the three classes stated below, and the number of the tabulated towns in

each class is duly stated.

                                                                                                     No.  Population.

* In this class there are some towns with as few as six water-closets only.
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  53

      Considerable difficulty has been experienced in classifying the tabulated
 towns, owing to the fact that sanitary arrangements have not, except in

 a few instances, reached the point where complete systems may be said

 to exist. This will be apparent on an analysis of the following details of

--returns.
     Water. In the supply of water, the greatest irregularity prevails. There
 are few towns in which the whole of the inhabitants derive their supply
 from public sources, these being largely supplemented by water from wells
 and roofs. The quantity of water, too, supplied for public or general uses
 and for special trades and purposes, varies very considerably, while the waste

 is much greater in some towns than in others. In the 200 scheduled towns
 there are 90 whoUy dependent on a public or general supply, 22 on private

 sources only, and 88 partly on private sources, in addition to a public
 supply. The returns show that there are in the 200 scheduled towns and
 districts 7 towns with a public daily supply of water amounting to or ex-
 ceeding 50 gallons per head, 6 between 40 and 50, 18 between 30 and 40,
 46 between 20 and 30, 38 between 10 and 20, and 4 under 10 gallons.
 The remainder, consisting of 81 towns, have made no return as to the

 quantities supplied.

  --Beceptaeles of Exxretal Matter, With respect to this subject, there is

 quite as much diversity of treatment and want of precise knowledge as with
 respect to water-supply. In the 200 scheduled towns there are 44 in which
 water-closets are general, 75 in which water-closets exist in considerable'
 number, though privies are still much used, and 70 where privies very
 greatly exceed water-closets in number. Only 446 earth-closets are re-

--turned as existing in the whole of the 200 scheduled towns.
     Removal of Refuse. It appears that only in 11 cases is there a total ab-
 sence of sewers to discharge liquid refuse. In those 11 cases the slops
 of the houses, the refuse of slaughter-houses &c., and the overflow from

 cesspools find their way into surface-streams, or are absorbed by the subsoil.
 At Paisley slops are thrown on the ashes to be removed by the public
 scavenger, and at Frome they appear, by the returns, to be purchased largely

 by cloth manufacturers. In these two instances only does there appear
 to be any profitable use made of the slops before they are finally discharged.

 AU the remainder appear to have sewers for the removal of liquid refuse into

 which the excreta! matter of 44 water-closeted towns is whoUy discharged,

 while from 119 towns in which privies exist the excretal matter is partly
 discharged by the same means and partly by scavenging. In 3 cases the
 excretal matter is wholly removed by public scavenging, in 8 by private
 scavenging, and in 1 by both ; and in 2 cases it is partly thrown into the
 surface-drains or ditches. In 25 toAvns the returns do not give any in-
 formation as to the removal of excretal matter. The ashes are nearly
 universally removed by the public scavenger, though in a few towns the

--work is left to private action.
    Storm and Surface-waters. In the case of 149 towns out of the 200
 these waters are admitted into the sewers ; in nine instances, where new sys-
 tems of sewerage have been adopted, the old sewers are entirely devoted to

 the discharge of surface-waters ; in one instance special sewers are appro-
 priated to the same purpose, while in 11 other instances the old surface-

 channels are used. In 25 cases more than one of the above systems are
 practised, and in the remaining 5 instances no return has been made. It
 will be seen, by a close examination of the tabular statement, that in
, many instances the sewers have to receive an immense body of water in
--54 KEPORT 1870.

times of heavy rainfall. It occasionally happens that an inch of rain falls

in twenty-four hours, and in certain seasons and under certain conditions half

that quantity makes its way to the sewers in the same period. Two in-

stances recorded in the schedule will serve to show the extent to which a

sewerage system may be tried by such influx. In the Nottingham district,

where it appears from the return there is a surface of 1870 acres tributary
to the sewers, and where the annual rainfall is 25 inches, there fell on the
18th of September last (since the Committee has been sitting) 2-14 inches of
rain. If at this time half the quantity reached the sewers, about 45 millions
of gallons of surface-water would have had to be discharged by the sewers or
storm overflows ; and this would be more than eleven times the ordinary flow of
the sewage, and thirteen times the water-supply. At Dundee, where the surface
contributing to the sewered area appears to be 2120 acres, and the average

annual rainfall the same as at Nottingham, viz. 25 inches, there fell in the

same month (on the 12th of September, 1869) 1-70 inch of rain. If half

of this quantity reached the sewers they had to discharge iqiwards of
40 millions of gallons from this source alone, equal to more than thirteen
times the water-supply of the town. It is more than probable, however,

that, although the returns show the contribiiting surfaces to be as much as

stated, the actual quantity is less ; but the figures serve to illustrate the dif-
ficulty to be contended with by the sudden admission into the sewers of such

large bodies of water, and which only serve a good purpose when the sewers

--require flushing.
   Subsoil Waters. ^The removal of subsoil water from beneath and about
dwellings having been shown by Dr. Buchanan in the 9th Eeport of the

Medical Ofiicer of the Privy Council to be of the highest sanitary importance,      I

it has been deemed desirable to trace as far as possible the means by which
local authorities have effected this object. The returns, which are very im-
perfect upon this point, show, as far as they go, that about 100 out of the
200 towns drain the subsoil by the sewers, which carry away the liquid

refuse of their districts. The importance of this branch of the inquiry wiU
appear when it is remembered that, having become mixed with the sewage,
the subsoil water must be treated in the same way as the sewage itself.
This consideration becomes greater in those cases where the discharged

quantity has to be lifted by mechanical power at a never-ceasing cost.

One or two instances given in the schedule will illustrate this. Torquay,

a seaboard town with (according to the returns) about 20,000 inhabitants
and a water-supply of 30 gallons per head, amounting on the whole to

610,000 gallons per diem, discharges 1,600,000 gallons of sewage a day,

the addition of subsoil water being apparently in the proportion of 1*62 to 1,
and the sewage discharged being equal to 80 gallons per head of the con-

tributing population. In this instance, therefore, if the Local Board of Tor-

quay should determine to raise and utilize their sewage instead of dis-

charging it into the sea, they will have to pay .£1 12s. 5d. for the raising of

subsoil water for every £1 expended in raising the sewage. The river-side

town of Leamington affords another example. This town has, according to

the returns, a population the same as Torquay (20,000), and a water-supply
of 400,000 gallons a day. The quantity of sewage discharged into the river

is 1,000,000 gallons, the difference between the water supplied and th(

sewage discharged being 600,000 gallons, or 150 per cent. In the casfe oi
Hertford, where the water-supply is returned at 61| gallons per head daily,
amounting to 184,500 gallons per diem, the discharge from the sewers if

returned at 1,750,000 gallons. This quantity is conducted, after lim«

treatment, into the river Lee, above the intake of the East-London "Water-
works Company, In this case the discharge from the sewers is, according

to these figures, 9^ times the quantity of water delivered to the houses of
the town.

  --Ventilation. The information afforded by the returns upon this point is

very deficient, owing to the fact that very few instances exist in which any

--thing has been systematically done.
   Disposal of Sewage. The largest quantity of water discharged per head

is that of Hertford, just mentioned, which amounts to 257 gallons. In
many other cases a very much larger quantity is discharged from the sewers
than can be accounted for by the water-supply, as will be seen from the fol-

lowing collected instances :

their sewage without any treatment whatever; in 17 instances the sewage
is simply filtered before discharge, in 7 instances it is chemically treated,
and in 17 cases recourse is had to irrigation, whilst in 5 instances the

--system of disposal includes more than one of these methods.
   Scaven(fing. Much interesting information has been given in the returns

with regard to the cost of scavenging and the returns obtained from the

sale of ashes and excretal and other solid refuse. In only two cases among
the returns from English towns is any profit realized, and these are Fare-
ham and Stockton-on-Tees. At Stockton-on-Tees, with a population of
23,000, the retiu-n gives a profit of £100 a year. At Fareham, where

there is a population of 6200, the refuse is sold to a contractor, who agrees

to collect both house and street refuse, and to remove the sewage from the

privy and closet cesspools when necessary, paying the Board £7 a year

only. In Scotland, one instance only is recorded in which a profit is ob-
tained, viz. Dundee, where <£630 a year is made. In all other recorded
cases the scavenger receives a payment in money as well as the refuse for
doing the required duties. The greatest losses are experienced at Liverpool,
where the scavenging costs £41,866 a year, or 19-7d. per head, and at
Scarborough, where it costs =£2050, or 22-4fZ. per head. At Malvern the
cost amounts to 18-Oc?. per head ; at Oldham, 13-ld. ; at Bradford, 19-3d.

at Rochdale, ll-2d. ; at Bridgenorth, 10-2(Z. ; at Torquay, 10-2d. ; at New-

castle 11-5d. ; at Cardiff, ll-3d. · at Llanelly, 15-3f?. ; at Aberdeen, ll-2d.
and at Edinburgh, ll-7d. per head per annum.

   The schedule is stiU very incomplete. If perfected iu all its details, much
valuable information would be collected, which would be found useful to the

sewer authorities of towns throughout the kingdom.
--56 REPORT 1870.

                                                                B.                I

   The district of Bury, with the township of Elton, in the county of Lan-
caster, is governed by a local Act, dated 27 July, 1846, 9 and 10 Victoria,
Cap. CCXCIII., and embraces an area of 2692 acres, the number of inhabi-
tants being about 40,000, and the annual rateable value of the district

£123,467.
   The town has a general system of scavenging for the removal of solid

excreta, solid house-refuse, and street-sweepings, and a system of under-
ground sewerage for the removal of liquid house-refuse and surface-water.
There are 6500 houses in the district, 3859 privies, 1922 ash-pits, and only

153 water-closets.
   The provisions for the collection and disposal of the solid excreta and

house-refuse are evidently deficient. In the better class of houses each
house has at least one privy ; but the lower classes are very badly provided
with them, and in one instance no more than 2 privies had been provided
for the use of 20 cottages, a state of things worthy of the attention of the

local Inspector of Nuisances.

   No special treatment is practised previous to the removal of the contents

of the privies, beyond the addition of ashes. This accession of ashes,
together with the necessity of conducting its removal at night, materially
reduces the value of such mixture as a manure, and the whole quantity only
yields an annual return to the Commissioners of £100.

    From the' inconvenient positions of many of the ash-pits, together with

their defective construction, the removal of the night-soil is rendered some-

what difficult and expensive. The ashes when not used for privies are
generally sifted and employed in filling and levelling in the formation of new

streets and footpaths ; and it is even alleged that they are also so used in

many cases after mixture with night-soil, which, no doubt, from a contrac-

tor's point of view, is good binding stufi".

    The street-sweepings are also removed by scavenging, and cost the Com-
missioners not less than £629 lis. Scl, while, from the want of some yard
or other storage ground, they have to be disposed of to farmers at their own
price, and only yield the insignificant return of £25 to £30 per annum.

    The sewers are all of ample capacity to provide both for the usual daily
flow of sewage and for surface-water due to the average rate of rainfall,

which is 40 inches ; and further, for the exceptional contingencies of storms,

which produce as much as 1 inch per hour.
    The sewers are built in hydraulic hme, and the pipe-drains laid with

 puddled joints, so as to prevent percolation of subsoil-watr into the sewage,

or leakage of sewage into the soil. No instance of deposit has taken place

 in any of the sewers, and flushing for the removal of deposit is consequently

 unnecessary.

    The water-supply is constant, and is derived from catch-water reservoirs
 of the Bury and B.adcUfi'e Waterworks Company, situated at Holden Wood,
 about eight miles above Bury. The Water Company supplies by meter to the
 Railway Company and to general^trade consumers about a quarter of a million
 gallons per diem, and the same quantity to the town for domestic consump-

 tion. It is in both cases supplied unfiltered, and is at times perceptibly dis-

 coloured and disagreeable to the palate.

population annually. Of course it is not fair to judge of a general system
from a particular instance, and the subject should be further investigated.

   The fact that the ashes of Cambridge, with a population of 27,000 as
against 40,000 at Bury, seU, together with the street-sweepings, but without
any faecal matter, for J200 annually, while the ashes of Bury mixed with
almost the entire faecal matter of the town produce annually only £100, and
the street-sweepings only another £25, is worthy of remark.

   The subjoined analyses of Bury sewage show that although the sewage
from a town managed on the Bury system is weaker and therefore less valu-
able and proportionately more difficult to deal with than the sewage from a

water-closeted town, yet that its purification is just as imperatively necessary.

company from springs at Cherry Hinton into a covered reservoir of a storage

capacity of 1,000,000 gallons, situated about three miles from Cambridge.

The average daily supply to Cambridge by the company is 427,000 gallons,

that is to say, 280,000 gallons for the domestic consumption of 21,500 persons,

or 13 gallons per head, and 147,000 gallons for trade consumption, of which

the railway company takes 68,500, general trade 60,500, and watering streets

18,000 gallons.

   There is also a supply from private sources, including Artesian wells sunk
to the Gault, estimated at 50,000 gallons per day ; and " Hobson's Brook "

supplies during the dry weather season about 789,000 gallons per day to the

town. It rises at a spot called Nine Wells, about three miles from Cambridge,

and terminates in a head near the Botanic Gardens, from which point it is

--distributed^to different parts of the town, namely, first to the public conduit

or drinking-fountain in the market-place ; secondly, by two open channels or
" runs," one on each side of Trumpington Street; thirdly, by pipes and open

course to the Hospital andjPembroke College ; and, fourthly, along Lensfield

Road to Hyde Park Corner, thence in two open street-channels along St.
Andrew's Street, and also to Emanuel and Christ Colleges. The water from

the two channels is discharged constantly into the sewers at Trumpington
Street and St. Andrew's Street, and can, when desired, be diverted into the

sewers at a higher level for the purposes of flushing. These open channels

are each provided with a silt-pit just previously to their entering the sewers.

There is also an ingenious arrangement for flushing by means of the water

supplied to the public drinking-fountain in the market-place. It consists of

a large octagonal chamber surmounted by a central fountain, from which the

water overflows by eight drinking- spouts into a basin that discharges itself
into the chamber beneath ; and the arrangement permits of the periodical dis-
charge of the contents of this chamber to flush the sewers leading from the
market-place. The sewers of ninety streets and lanes are flushed quarterly

from the water company's works. The street-guUeys are also periodically

flushed or washed by means of water-carts in dry weather ; and provisions of

Aminor importance are also made to carry on the flushing.  tank in Trinity

Place fiUed from an Artesian well, another tank in St. Andrew's Court,

opposite Emanuel College, and a smaller cast-iron tank in King's Arms Court,

King Street, are all used for flushing once a week. The contents of these

sinks are discharged into the sewers by penstocks.

All houses are provided with water-closets without any system of venti-

lation, the pipes being trapped by earthenware or lead D-traps. It was
stated that some closets were ventilated by means of the water-pipes, and
these, which were supposed to act, were found to be totally inefiicient ; but an
attempt is being made to improve the system in new biiildings. The only
instance in which earth-closets have been adopted is at Queen's College, where

there are two.

   Most, if not all, of the colleges on the banks of the river preserve arrange-
ments of the most primitive possible description overhanging the classic
waters of the Cam, identical in construction with those that were in existence

when the great author of the ' Principia' discovered the laws of gravity. Those

of the privies which do not overhang the river are provided with cesspools

which overflow directly into the river ; and many of these are in a most offen-

sive condition. Pinally, the accommodation of this nature, such as it is,
which is provided in this great University exists only in the proportion of
7-4 per cent, of the residents, or less than one for every thirteen persons.

    Nearly the whole area is provided with a general system of underground

sewerage for the removal of water-closet and liquicl house-slops, of rain-water
from roofs of houses, yards, and streets, there being about twenty-one miles
of sewers, which are calculated to meet the demands of the average annual
rainfall, but not of storms nor of periods of exceptionally heavy rains.

   The greater portion of the ashes is collected by the Commissioners daily,
and, together with the street-sweepings, is sold for the sum of <£200 annually.

A small portion only is collected by private individuals. The cost of collec-

tion coTild not be ascertained.

   The area contributing surface-water is approximately the area of the district,
3470 acres, and the average annual rainfall is 22 inches. The roadways of
the streets are macadamized ; they incline from the centre* to the curbs at a
rate of about 1 in 100, and are provided with guUeys connected with the

sewers.

   The subsoil is mostly gravel from 3 to 10 feet deep, overlying a bed
of gault from 120 to 135 feet thick. It was formerly saturated, but the
sewerage has di-ained the upper subsoil and dried many of the weUs that pre-
viously existed. Inquiries were made into the state of some of the wells be-
longing to private houses, and it was found that they were all contaminated
by sewage, owing to their proximity to the sewers in the streets and to the
drains on the premises, so much so, that the water cannot be used for drink-

ing but only for washing.

   The old sewers are of irregular forms, but the recent sewers are egg-shaped
or circiilar. They discharge at twelve separate outlets into the river Cam.
The inclination of these sewers varies from 1 in 120 to 1 in 2000. Deposit
has taken place to a considerable extent in the HiUs Eoad sewer, with an in-

clination of 1 in 2000, the deposit being, at the date of the examination, 7i

inches thick, and the sewage running over it 6 inches deep. The outlets of
the public and private sewers are all under the level of the surface of the
water in the Cam, consequently the sewage is backed up in the sewers for a
considerable distance, and the subsoil is constantly saturated with both water
and sewage in the lowest parts of the town. The authorities obligingly

offered to draw off the water of the Cam to enable the engineers to gauge and

collect samples of the sewage flowing from the sewers ; but as the bed of the
river could only be kept dry for a short time, the results would have been
unsatisfactory. Moreover, as the water which is backed up in the soil
would be discharged by degrees through the sewers, no correct result could
have been attained.

    There are two gaols (county and borough), a workhouse, a hospital, and
an asylum, aU of which are connected with the sewers. There are no fac-
tories nor special trades, but the slaughter-houses send their liquid refuse
into the sewers, and this on killing days is highly charged with blood ; the
solids from this source are mixed with ashes and carted away,

BemarJcs hy a Sub-Committee, consisting of Messrs. Gkantham (CJiairman),
                               CoEFiELD, Hope, and Williamson.

It is not the province of the Committee to prepare schemes for the sewerage,

or for the drainage of particular towns, and as the inquiries of the Committee

are stiU far from complete, it would be premature to make any suggestions

either in this or any other case as to the best means of utilizing the sewage

when collected                                                       but it is manifest from the foregoing Report that the sanitary

improvement both difficult and expensive. The chief general importance of
the inquiry into the conditions of Cambridge is the proof thus obtained of
the pollution of weUs, and therefore of subsoil, by the agency of pervious
street- or house-sewers constructed in their vicinity ; and the Sub-Committee
desires to give expression to the conviction forced upon it in the course of

its inquiries, that all sewers properly so called (that is to say, drains into

which refuse from human habitations is admitted) ought to be constructed of

materials which are altogether impervious, and that a separate system of
pervious drains, similar to agricultural drains, should be constructed where
necessary to dry the subsoil. The Sub-Committee is of opinion that the
further construction of pervious sewers should be prohibited by Parliamen-
tary enactment.

                             C. Breton's Farm near Romford.

    The town of Eomford, in the county of Essex, is about twelve miles
east of London, and is situated on the so-caUed " Eiver " Eom, which is

now, however, only a brook. The Rom rises in the high grounds of

Hainault Forest and Havering-atte-Bower, and, after passing through the
town, flows into the River Thames to the east of Dagenham.

    The soil upon which the town rests is chiefly light loam, in places ap-
proaching brick-earth in character, and underlain by flint-gravel, which

yields water freely.
    The population is about 8000, but the refuse of only about 7000 is dis-

charged entirely into the sewers, although the whole population is within the
area provided with underground sewers. The refuse of the remainder is dis-
charged partly into cesspools, the contents of which are removed by farmers.

    The ordinary dry weather sewage discharge from all sources is 247,000

gallons daily.

    The number of houses within the district is about 1200, and the rateable
value is assessed at ^23,341, the present annual rate being £840.

    The workhouse, which is separated from the town by the railway, and

lies to the south; has from 300 to 400 inmates, the solid refuse from whom

is treated in privies with lime and ashes, the liquid passing to the sewers.

   The town is supplied with water by the South-Essex Water Company
but there are many weUs in it, and the great " Romford Brewery " is supplied
by its own wells.

   The surface-water is, for the most part, conveyed into the town sewers,

but a part of it is discharged into the River Rom by the old drains.

Through defective work, it is probable that a large amount of subsoil water
finds its way, at times, into the sewers, and in dry weather a converse leak-
age of sewage into the subsoil is also probable. The sewers having little

fall, are flushed by the Rom occasionally, but they are blocked at times by

the sewage-deposit in some particularly flat places, which are flushed and

cleansed by hand twice a year at a cost of £12 annually. There is a storm
overflow which discharges into the Rom. The sewers are ordinary egg-

shaped brick and glazed stoneware pipes. There are ventilators in the
streets and roads.

   The " sewer authority " is the Romford Local Board of Health, consti-
tuted under the Public-Health Act of 1848.

  The discharge of the sewage into the Rom immediately below the town

polluted it to such an extent, and it became so great a nuisance, that the
Court of Chancery granted an injunction restraining the further discharge of
the sewage in that manner.
63 REPORT 1870.

   The following is an analysis of an average sample of the sewage as flow-
ing from the town :
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  63

   The accompanying plan and sections show the manner in which the

farm is laid out and the sewage distributed.
   The entire farm was fallow all the winter, and was only gradually brought

under cultivation in spring and summer.

  AOf Plot (Plate I.), the beds from 1 to 10, both inclusive, were sown with

Italian rye-grass on March 19th, and beds 11 to 20, both inclusive, were sown
a week later. From these together, equal to 6"68 acres, five crops have already
been cut, and the sixth is now growing. The average weight of the crops has
been, however, small, not exceeding 6| tons each per acre, owing to the dense
growth of weeds (especially " chickweed "), which abnost smothered the grass,
the farm having been long neglected, and the ground being full of the seeds
of weeds. Bed 21, containing '39 of an acre, was sown on April 27th with
"Savoy" cabbages for planting out. Beds 22 to 28, with the lower half of
29, which were chiefly old meadow-land broken up, and included two lines
of old hedge-row, could only be imperfectly cultivated; they were, how-

ever, sown on the 27th of April with seedii of a small kind of cabbage,
known as bunching-greens, or rosette cabbage, more properly coleworts.
These beds comprised 3-5 acres, and besides furnishing plants enough for
7-25 acres in plots C, E, N, and P, produced 470,000 plants for sale, which
realized £35 5s., and further supplied 3240 full-grown plants for market,

which realized an additional sum of £4 10s.

  AThe whole of Plot wiU shortly be filled with winter crops.

   In Plot B, beds 1 and 2, equal to 0-972 of an acre, were sown with early
" horn " carrots, which were sold for £19 10s. in the ground. The carrots
were sown on March 25th, and were taken out of the ground in the first
week in August ; these beds are now sown with Italian rye-grass for cutting
next year. Bed No. 3, 0*486 of an acre, was planted with potatoes on

--April 2nd ; the potatoes were of three kinds the Bovinia, a large cattle po-

tato, the early llose, a new American variety, and the ordinary Dalmahoy,
The potatoes are not yet all off the ground, but they appear particularly
fine. Bed No. 4, equal to 0'486 of an acre, was sown on the 2nd of April
with " broad Windsor " beans, which were sold for £4 10s., the buyer pick-
ing them and leaving the straw.

   Beds No. 5 to 8 inclusive, equal to 1'96 acre, were sown in the first week in
April with " Champion " peas for eating green, which were sold in July for
£30, the buyer picking them and leaving the straw.

   Beds 4 to 8 inclusive are now sown with Italian rye-grass, Beds 9 to

17 inclusive were sown on April 19th with Italian rye-grass, and the fifth
crop is now being cut. It should here be mentioned that the rye-grass not
required for the horses on the farm has obtained a ready sale at £1 per ton

on the ground, partly to the neighbouring farmers for their horses, and
partly to London cowkeepers.

   In Plot C, beds 1 to 8 inclusive, 2-75 acres were planted on July 2nd

with greens transplanted from Plot A, which are now being sold at about
£25 per acre. Beds 9 to 23 inclusive, about 4 acres, were sown with
white turnips on May 6th ; but Plot C, being exceedingly stony, little better

than a bed of shingle, the slope below the contour line exceedingly rapid
and steep, and comparatively few of the seeds surviving the excessive

drought and frosty nights, the result was that only £25 could be obtained

for this crop in the ground.

   The major part of Plot D, equal to 10-7 acres, was drilled with mangold

wurzel as late as May the 14th, and the crop nevertheless promises to yield

Dfrom 40 to 45 tons per acre. The lower part of plot (2 acres) was
--64 REPOKT 1870.

planted with drumhead cabbages, interspersed with bunching-greens, in the

first week in August.

   Plot E was a difficult piece of ground to lay out, involving much labour,

and was worked at only from time to time, as the labour and horses were
available, Beds 1 to 10 inclusive (2-961 acres) have just been sown with
winter onions. Beds 11 to 14 inclusive (1-026 acre) were sown on August

19th with early York cabbage-seed for planting out. Beds 15 to 21 in-
clusive (1-712 acre), on July 16th were planted with greens from Plot A,

and bed 22 (0-165 acre) is still vacant.

   Plot F is not yet properly laid out, and a great part of it is not yet under

cultivation ; the remainder, about 2| acres, was sown with onions on March
19th, and some have been sold at the rate of £36 per measui-ed acre in the

ground.

In Plot G, bed No. 1 (0-2385 of an acre) was sown with parsley on June

24th ;  beds  2 and 3 (0-477 of  an acre) with  sugar beet-root  on  June  4th
                                                                                          ;

beds 4 and 5 (0-477 of an acre) with crimson beet-root for table in June

bed 6 (0-2385 of an acre) -with white brocoh-seed for planting out ; bed 7

(0-2385 of an acre) was sown with " Savoy " cabbage-seed on July 16th ;

bed 8 (0-2385 of an acre), on April 23rd, with four kinds of carrot-seed

beds 9 and 10 (0-477 of an acre) were sown on April 25th with four kinds

of mangold-wurzel seed. These last three beds promise to yield some mag-

nificent specimen roots for exhibition. Beds 11 to 15 inclusive (1-1925

acre) were sown with parsnips on April 28th, and, the seed being bad,
failed in many places ; there are, nevertheless, many fine roots. Bed 1

(0-2385 of an acre) was sown on May 7th with spinach. It was cut on the
5th of June, and realized at the rate of £22 per acre. It was broken up

and again sown with spinach on the 16th of June ; the price having fallen,
this crop was given to cattle. The bed was then ploughed and sown on
the 23rd of August with Tripoli onions for planting out in spring. Bed 17
(0-2385 of an acre) was sovra on the 17th of June with spinach, some of

which was sold, and the rest given to cattle. The bed was then ploughed and
sown on the 9th of July with maize for cutting green as fodder. Bed 18

(0-2385 of an acre) was planted on the 26th of May with East Ham cabbage

and cauliflowers. They have been sold at the rate of £27 and £25 per acre
respectively. Bed 19 (0-2385 of an acre) was planted on the 21st of May with

·white cos lettuces,' which were, for a particular purpose, kept in the ground

rather too long, but still produced at the rate of £24 per acre, after which
the bulk of them were given to cattle. This bed was ploughed and sown
on 23rd of August with Tripoli onions. Bed 20 (0-2385 of an acre) was

planted with brown cos lettuces on the 21st of May, which, being too late,

were given to cattle. It was then ploughed and sown on the 23rd of July,

when the rye harvest of the district was entirely over, one half with oats

and the other half with barley, with a view to ascertain whether it would

be possible to ripen two crops of cereals on the same ground in one season.

They were expected not to ripen before October, therefore the result is as

yet unascertained. Bed 21 (0-2385 of an acre), also brown lettuces given to

cattle, followed by white cos lettuces, which realized at the rate of upwards

of £30 per acre, followed again by winter spinach. Bed 22 (0-2385 of an
acre) contains some patches of red clover, Jersey cabbages, yams (Dioscorea

batata), and turnips, aU of which are vigorous and healthy.

In Plot H, beds 1 to 5 inclusive (1-3162 acre) were planted on July

20th with sprouting winter brocoli. Beds 6 to 9 inclusive (1-458 acre)

were planted on July 20th with Brussels sprouts. Beds 10 to 17 inclusive
       ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.     65

(3-G acres) were sown on August 24th with East Ham cabbage-seed for

planting out. Bed 18 (0*55 of an acre) was planted with celery in the first
fortnight in August, and beds 19-2.5 inclusive (3-332 acres) were filled gra-

dually with mangold wurzel transplanted from D and C, commencing on June

13th, and continuing for more than a month.

   Only the upper part of Plot I (1-166 acre) has been as yet laid out ; this

was sown on May 6th with broccoli and Savoy cabbage-seed for planting out.
Upwards of ,£30 worth have been sold from these beds, and they are now

thick on the ground. The rest of Plot I (5-184 acres) was sown with onions

on the same day as Plot F, namely, March 19th. These two plots of onions
comprise the greater part of one of the old fields which was surrounded

with a huge ditch and hedge, full of great trees ; it had been roughly but
heavily sewaged in winter, and it was the intention not to apply any more

sewage to it until the onions were off the ground ; but the drought was so
severe and the ground became so dry, that it was necessary to give them

moisture to save them, and they received one dressing of sewage in May and

another in July. Part of Plot I has also been sold at the same rate of .£36

per acre in the ground as obtained for F.

   In Plot K, beds 1 to 5 inclusive (2-397 acres) were sown on May 28th

with white runner beans, which have borne well, and are not yet over.

Beds 6 to 10 (2-047 acres) were planted on July 14th with Walchercn

cauliflower.

   Plot L was an old meadow, which was heavily sewaged last summer, and

was broken up in winter and sown with white Poland oats on April 9th.
In many places the seed never came up, owing to the severe drought, but

the crop nevertheless gave a return over all of five quarters one bushel

to the acre.

   In Plot M, bed 1 (0-387 of an acre) was partially planted with drumhead

cabbages on June 2nd, and filled up with kohl rabi ; bed 2 (0-387 of an

Macre) was planted with "Walcheren broccoli ; the rest of Plot (2-935 acres)

was planted on June 25th with Savoy cabbages from bed 21, Plot A.
   In Plot N, bed 1 (0-252 of an acre) was sown on April 27th with a new

kind of American oats, which were cut on August 22nd, and yielded twenty-

eight bushels, equal to fourteen quarters, per acre. At the beginning of

June this crop was seriously damaged and in danger of being destroyed by

the ravages of the Oscinis vastator, one of the smallest but most destructive
of those " grubs " and " wireworms " which at times cause such injury to

cereal crops in this country. The remedial effects of sewage inigation

under similar circumstances having been previously observed elsewhere, two

heavy dressings of sewage were applied to this bed during two successive

days, the result being that the grubs were entirely destroyed and the greater

part of the crop was saved. It is proposed to conduct some experiments to

ascertain whether this result could be accomplished by the use of pure

water, or whether with the physical effects of immersion sewage applied in

this way, combines the action of some agent or agents which act as a

specific poison to organisms of that type. Beds 2 to 4 inclusive (0-756 of
an acre) were sown on June 1st and 2nd with six kinds of maize specially

imported from the United States, as likely to suit the climate of England
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the maize is now from 5 to 9 feet high, appears to be ripening, and pro-

mises a very heavy yield. Bed 5 (0-252 of an acre) was sown on June 4th
with a new kind of Brome-grass, introduced from Australia by Messrs.

Sutton and Sons, and named by them Bromvs odoratus. It has already been

cut three times, and has yielded at the rate of seven to eight tons per acre.

This grass being a perennial, it will be interesting to observe for how long
it wiU retain its present extraordinary rapidity of growth, and whether,

under such forcing treatment as sewage irrigation, it will not cease to be
perennial. Bed 6 (0-252 of an acre) was first sown with tobacco ; but for
some unascertained reason the seed failed, and it was broken up and resown
on July 9th with maize for cutting green. Beds 7 and 8 (0-504 of an
acre) were sown with sea-kale on June 10th, and broccoli plants were put in
between the rows of sea-kale in. August. Beds 9 and 10 (0-522 of an acre)

were planted with East Ham cabbages on June 16th from seed raised in

the garden ; these two beds have been sold at the rate of .£25 per acre in
the ground. Beds 11 to 16 inclusive (1-566 acre) were planted on June

A20th with bunching-greens from Plot ; these have been sold at ^21 per

acre in the ground.

    In Plot 0, beds 1 to 11 inclusive (4-12 acres) were sown on April 4th
with " intermediate " carrots, part of which have been sold for .£20 and £21
per acre in the ground, and part (washed and bunched and sent to market)
realized .£41 per acre. Beds 12 to 17 inclusive (2-223 acres) were sown
on April the 5th with onions, which were bunched and sent to market,
where they realized .£46 per acre.

    Plot P, which is a gravel-pit, not yet wholly obliterated, has been par-
tially planted with greens from Plot A,

    Plot Q, has as yet had nothing in it.
    Plot E, an old meadow heavily sewaged last summer, and broken up last
winter, was planted with Dalmahoy potatoes on March 25th ; the crop was
very fine for the season, and realized £25 per acre.

   Plots S and T are still waste and uncultivated.

   Plot U is an old meadow, which has been irrigated by means of moveable

troughs ; it contains 6-14 acres, and has akeady yielded two crops of hay,

and a third is now ready to cut.

   VPlot is also an old meadow of 3-5 acres, and is used as a playground

for the horses.
    Agricultural experiments necessarily require a very long time to be carried

out, and a period of twelve consecutive months is the shortest possible space
of time in which any thing Uke a fair result can be looked for. It is not
possible, therefore, to compile from the past observations of the Committee,
during so short a period, auy thing that would not be very misleading in
the shape of a debtor and creditor account, whether as to the pecuniary ex-
penditure and returns of the farm, or as to the expenditure of manure dis-
tributed by means of the sewage and the returns in the crops estimated
chemically. Nevertheless, from the foregoing figures, it will be seen that
sewage in its liquid state can be practically applied to apparently every kind
of crop. This was no doubt pretty well ascertained by previous experiments
elsewhere ; but in no case have these experiments been so systematically and
carefuUy observed, and so little liable to be affected by disturbing causes.
 It is therefore already one step gained towards the solution of the sewage
 question that these experiments have been conducted under the eyes of the
 agent of the Committee, as well as under the occasional observation of some
of the members of the Committee.

    The Committee hope to obtain data of greater value and importance from
the accurate record of the experiments and practice on the farm during a
future complete year, and some appliances have recently been, or will
 shortly be, brought into use on the farm which will very greatly facilitate
such observations. The soil of by far the major part of the farm (Plots A,
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  67

B, C, D, E, G, H, K, M, N, 0, P, and Q) is composed of a very loose open

sand and gravel overlying coarser sand and gravel in every case ; and in

many places it has been impossible, in the laying out of the land, to prevent
the yellow subsoil from being exposed. The accompanying analyses of the
soil taken from a part which had not been sewaged will show its extra-

ordinary poverty in organic matter ; and if this is taken into account, and if
it is also recollected that aU the crops were got into the ground during
the late almost unprecedented drought, and that from repeated workings and
shiftings the soil was in an abnormally dry condition, it will be seen at

once that it was necessary in every case to apply a much larger quantity per
acre of moisture and manure in the form of sewage for starting the first crops
than would ever be necessary under ordinary conditions of farming. More-
over, the tenant, while bound so to utilize the whole of the sewage of the
town of Eomford as to prevent the pollution of the river, has only a limited

area of land on which to apply it, and therefore he cannot avoid putting on

in many cases more sewage (that is, manure) than would otherwise be ne-

cessary ; but as such unusual conveniences exist on the farm for measuring,
not merely the sewage going on to the farm, but also the effluent water es-
caping, it wiU be quite possible to ascertain during the ensuing twelve months

exactly how much manure is placed upon the land, and very nearly with the
same exactness, how much is utilized, and how much wasted. However, as

absolute accuracy cannot be attained on so large a scale, and as the tenant
is bound, as before explained, to apply a certain quantity of sewage over the
whole area of the farm, whether his crops actually require it or not, he has
constructed some large wooden boxes of 2|-inch deal carefull}^ tongued and
grooved at the joints and strongly bolted together with iron bolts. These
boxes are 6 feet deep ; they are filled with earth carefully taken so as to
represent an average section of the farm, and the superficies of the earth in
each box (in other words, the inside measurement of each box) is equal to
·001 of an acre. The boxes are sunk in a huge ditch on the farm, which has
not yet been obliterated ; and they are so packed round as to reduce to a
minimum, quite inappreciable, the difference between their evaporation and
internal temperature and those on or below the natural surface of the ground.
The bottoms of the boxes have also been so constructed as to give a slight
drainage towards the centre, and also towards one end. In the centre of
each a small drain-pipe has been laid, and at the end of it a hole has been
bored in the end of the boxes so as to admit of the free exit of the effluent
water. These boxes, then, aff'ord the means of carrying out experiments with

accuracy, whUe they are yet upon a scale and under conditions which
make them accord strictly with actual practice. Such experiments have

never yet been conducted, and their value cannot be overrated, more espe-

cially as explanatory of the observations conducted as to the actual practice
on the farm itself ; for instance, it will be found that of the total amount of
the manurial constituents of the sewage applied to the farm a certain quan-

tity is wasted and escapes in the effluent water. The experiments in these
boxes wiU at once prove whether such escape is due to the application of a
quantity of manure in excess of the requirements of the plants and their
power of assimilating it, or whether the waste of a certain percentage of
maniire applied when in a state of solution by irrigation is a necessary defect
of the system ; that is to say, whether, when quantities of manure are applied
only sufficient for the chemical wants of the plants, it is nevertheless not in
the power of the plants and the soil and the other agents at work to isolate
that manure from the water in which it is dissolved, and to retain the whole

                                                                          r2

of it for profitable consumption. These box-experiments will, it is hoped,
also aiford data for ascertaining the amount of water evaporated from the
surface of the ground under different conditions. They will, it is hoped,

show whether or not sewage can be applied to fallow land, and so stored up

in the winter for use in the growing season as to enable the farmer to pur-

chase at all seasons.

It is hoped that they will further test the efficiency of intermittent down-

ward filtration in purifying sewage.
   The tenant entered into the occupation of Breton's Farm on the 29th of

September of last year, but there were no appliances for distributing the
sewage. There existed merely the main sewer from the town to the farm,

the pumping-engines, and a small but quite insufficient underground iron pipe
from the engine to a point in plot G, from which point there was further,

running along the top of plot G, an earthenware pipe raised up on the top
of an earthen bank some 3 or 4 feet in height. These appliances were,

however, ludicrously insufficient, whether as to level or capacity, for distri-

buting the sewage ; and during the greater part of the time, from September

29 to May 18, the sewage was either not put upon the farm at all, being

applied to other ground elsewhere, or it was simply allowed to stand in pools

anyhow on plot F, I, and U, with the occasional formation of similar pud-

dles in G and E.

   Since the 18th day of May, however, the whole of the sewage has been

applied to the farm ; and during a great part of that time the whole of the
effluent water escaping from the land above the contour-Une of drainage has

also been pumped back over the farm, while during the preceding thirty
days, namely, from the ISth April to the 17th Ma)% both inclusive, the
night-sewage only was pumped on to the farm during the day, and, though

very much weaker, was j^et valuable as moisture.

   But it is not possible to apportion this quantity with absolute exactness to

the difi'erent crops grown. There are always four men superintending the

distribution of the sewage, and it would not be possible to check the quanti-

ties distributed by them with absolute exactness unless by the emplojinent

of an assistant  engineer  to  supervise  each  man                        and  this was  an  expense
                                                                        ;

which the Committee did not feel warranted in incurring. However, several

very accurate experiments were conducted to ascertain the capacity of earth

laid out in beds of 30 feet wide for the absorption of liquid ; and on the 19th

March, a period when the land was in what may be considered an average

state of moisture, the quantities of sewage which land broken up and stirred
on the previous day to a depth of 9 inches, and also land consolidated by

rolling, could respectively absorb.

   The experiments were conducted in three different ways, so that the cal-
culations may be relied on as being correct. The methods adopted were
first, the ordinary weir or notched board ; secondly, a box wdth a sluice at
each end which held an ascertained quanrity, by which means the sewage

flowing upon the land was subjected to actual measurement ; thirdly, a weir
was placed in one of the main carriers resembling in form an ordinary notch-

board, but the square notch or opening in the centre was grooved, and a

series of little sluices was fitted in, so that the opening could be filled up

from the bottom and the water behind maintained at any required depth so

as to give any desired head a pressure behind it. Then in one of the lateral
openings in the carrier behind the weir was placed a smaller, but similar

weir, also with a rectangular opening in the centre, the edges of which open-

ing were likewise grooved ; and into this groove fitted iron slides having
ON THE TREATMENT AND UTILIZATION OF SEWAGE.  69

 square holes cut out in their centre of different sizes. It will thus be seen
 that the methods in which the experiments were conducted gave three di-
 stinct and separate sets of data on which to base calculations ; and it resulted

 that land in the state of moisture which existed on the 19th March and laid
 out in beds of 30 feet wide wovdd only absorb, when consolidated, on the
 surface about 40 tons of liquid per acre, and when stirred to a depth of 9
inches on the previous day, about 90 to 110 tons per acre. By the word
 absorb is meant that no more than the above quantities could be applied
without the formation of puddles at the sides of the beds. Of course, to lay
down dogmatically that land under any given condition wiU absorb any exact
number of gallons, or even tons, to the acre would be mere pedantry, and
therefore it was sought in these experiments to ascertain what might be con-
sidered, after several different trials, to be the average figures. The ques-

tions what are the minimum and maximum quantities that can be absorbed
by land abnormally saturated by heavy rains in winter when there is little

evaporation, or abnormally dried by repeated agricultural operations per-

formed in a period of drought, when there is a maximum of evaporation, have
not been yet ascertained; but the state of the land on the 19th March may

fairly be taken as an average condition : and this, after aU, is more important
than the observation of occasional extremes ; and the box-experiments about
to be conducted wiU afford an opportunity of making these further observa-
tions with far greater accuracy than could be attained on a larger scale.

   If we divide the average daily quantity of sewage and effluent water (namely,
about 1400 tons) pumped on to the farm during the period observed, and

during which period the land was, as a rule, well stii'red, by the figure of

100 tons, arrived at by the experiments conducted on the 19th March, we

get 14 acres as the quantity irrigated every day; but this would not be cor-

rect, because there were at work the disturbing causes of the excessive
drought and the artificial amount of evaporation induced by the great number
of manipulations which the larger part of the farm had received in the process

of laying out the ground ; and, as a matter of fact, the average area irrigated

daily from the 18th May to the Ist September has been a little over 5^

acres. Then 0-34 being the point of saturation of those samples of the soil
chemically examined and analyzed, it would foUow that if we assume that
the liquid would not penetrate during the few minutes employed ia dressing
the surface at any one part of the bed to a depth of more than 10 inches

(although the land was cultivated to a depth of 20 inches), the maximum

quantity of sewage that could be applied, supposing the soil to be not only
abnormally, but even chemically dxy, would be 384 tons per acre. In all

probability, therefore, 400 tons per acre is the largest quantity that has ever

been applied in any one dressing ; and if we assume that the first dressing
all over was at the rate of 400 tons per acre, that the second dressing was at

the rate of 200, and that the subsequent dressings were at the rate of 100,

we shall not be far from the truth.
   Although, as has been explained, nothing in the way of a complete result,

whether financial or chemical, can be obtained from the incomplete observa-
tions on the farm, it is not without interest to compare the results of some
of the crops with others of the same kind grown in precisely the same soU.,
on the same tableland, and within a few hundred yards.

  A small field of between 3 and 4 acres in the adjoining farm was sown with

peas for picking green. These the farmer tried to sell on the ground for ^8

an acre ; but he was unable to sell them at aU, and at last left them to ripen.
They still remain unsold, and are estimated to be worth from ^£5 to £6 an

acre, while the straw was so stunted that there were not two loads from the

whole area.

   In the next field heyond the peas (farmed by one of the best agrienltu-

rists in the county, a man of superior education and agricultural knowledge,
who has farmed the same land for years past with immense care, having

planted small hedges here and there to give shelter and break the wind, and

ha\ang grubbed iip the old hedges, and having further collected the stones off

the surface of the land, and who applies fannyard manure, guano, bones, ifec.
with both liberality and judgment) were sown onions, and these onions the

farmer said that he would gladly seU for one-fifth of their cost.

   Again, upon the small meadow at Breton's marked U, comprising altoge-
ther, after deducting ponds &c., only 5| acres that can actually be mowed,

the two crops of hay already got in amount to 9 loads (3| and 5| respectively)

and a third is growing, which, with care and energy and the assistance of

a large barn may easily be got in in the present month, is estimated as equal
to the first, making a total of 12| loads in one season from 5| acres. The

tenant of Breton's has a large meadow, about three miles nearer London,
sloping down to a brook shaded by trees, and which ought to suffer less than
most from drought yet off an available area for mowing of 27 acres, he was

                                                                                                ;

only able to get 4 loads of hay, and there is scarcely any aftermath at all.
In potatoes and carrots the figures run in about the same proportion between
the sewaged and the unsewaged ground, while of green crops without sewage
there were simply none. The following preliminary analyses of the sewage

of Romford as it enters on the farm, and of the same when diluted with a

certain portion of efiiuent water as it goes over the land, and of the effluent
water as it runs out of the drains, have been made for the Committee by

Dr. Eussell. From these it wiU be seen that the percentage of ammonia in

the sewage is low, and that it is poor as compared with that of most other

towns ; that is to say, the sewage is highly diluted, a condition which many

people beheve to be the most difficult to deal with by irrigation. Neverthe-
less the analyses of the effluent water show in every case that the ammonia

almost entirely disappears ; and if we take into account the difference in vo-
lume between the effluent water and the sewage, we may regard the ammonia
as practically non-existent in the former. On the other hand, it will bo

seen that there is a rather high percentage of nitrogen in the form of nitrates

and nitrites. The origin of the bulk of this, it is only reasonable to presume,

is ammonia in the sewage ; but it is so far very satisfactory to find that the
effect of irrigation, or, in other words, of " intermittent downward filtration,"
should be such a complete transformation of the ammonia. But still, even

taking into account the greatly diminished volume of the effluent water as

compared with the original sewage (see Table, p. 72), there is no doubt a con-

Howsiderable waste of fertilizing matter escaping in the effluent water.  far

this is to be attributed to the newly formed drains not being yet consolidated,

time alone can show.

Aing of the bellows drawing in about 50 cubic inches of air.          quantity of

this air was passed through plugs of clean cotton-wool which had been heated

from 110° to 120° C, and these were sent to Mr. Cooke for examination. One

specimen of the wool, through which about 5000 cubic inches of the sewer air

had been transmitted, was put into distilled water with a little white sugar

to see if any germs similar to those lately described by Professor Heisch

would become visible. The liquid was examined in a week's time, but none

of the germs found. The experiments were made about 11 o'clock a.m.

The next experiment was made on the same day, about 2 hours later, on

the air in the Ranelagh sewer, the largest in the Paddington district. The air

was taken from an opening in Gloucester Terrace, and was drawn out by

means of an air-pump. Some of the air was passed through cotton-wool, and

some collected for analysis gave the following results :

   The air was also allowed to pass over acetat«-of-Iead paper for 5 minutes
but no blackening took place.

Another experiment was made at the drain in the back kitchen of 34

Upper Hamilton Terrace, St. John's Wood. The beU-trap was taken up and

a glass tube was put down the drain. The air was blowing up the drain at

Athe time, and had a disagreeable smell.  specimen of this air gave the fol-

lowing results ; it will be seen that it was quite free from any combustible

gases :

   The following experiments were made on the air in a drain from a sink
in a room iu St. Mary's Hospital. This drain was selected as being the
nearest to the main drain passing from the hospital into the Cambrid"'e
Place sewer. The bell-trap of this drain was taken up ; a glass tube passing
about a foot down it was firmly corked into it, and by means of the air-pump
the air drawn out of it. First, a specimen of the air was passed throuo-h

cotton-wool, one specimen sent to Mr. Cooke, another treated with distilled

water and sugar ; the result of this experiment, as in the former case, was

Anegative.  specimen of the air from this drain was also analyzed, and gave

the following results:

            Volume of air taken    cub. centims.

                                   100-00

  A large quantity of this air was now drawn through water, and the water

tested for ammonia and albumenoid ammonia. The experiment was made as

--follows : a measured quantity of water (in this case four gallons) was allowed

to run out of a gas-holder ; the air thus drawn out of the drain first passed over

acetate-of-lead paper, then through three small flasks, each containing 80 cub.

centims. of pure distilled water ; the tubes passing into the water were sur-

rounded with platinum gauze, so as to break up the bubbles in the water.
The experiment lasted 3^ hours. The 240 cub. centims. of water in the flasks
was put into a retort and distilled with a little carbonate of soda ; it gave a
trace of ammonia, about yos ^^ ^ milligramme.

   These experiments must be looked upon as simply tentative, but certainly

indicate a purer air in these sewers than might have been anticipated.

                  Eejjort hy Mr. M. C. Cooke, M.A., Aug. 27, 1870,

   I have examined microscopically the contents of the tubes sent to me,

viz.

   No. 1. Air from Cambridge Place sewer, about 5000 cubic inches of which
passed through the cotton-wool.

   No. 2. Air from the same sewer, of which about 7000 cubic inches passed
through the cotton-wool.

   No. 4. Air from large sewer in Gloucester Place, about 2950 cubic inches
of which passed through the wool.

   No. 5. Air from sink-drain in Hospital, about 2950 cubic inches of which
passed through the wool.

    These were all examined separately and without any contact. All utensils,
slips of glass, ttc. were quite clean.

   The method adopted in all instances was uniform.
   The plug of cotton-wool was immersed in distilled water (freshly distilled)
and well shaken in the water in a clean tube. The water with the organisms
in suspension was then examined, drop by drop, till nearly exhausted.

Whether this was the best method to adopt I am not certain, but the process

was the same for the four samples.
    The results generally indicate comparative freedom from organic bodies; in

Nos. 4 and 5 perhaps an insufficient quantity of air was passed through the
wool, as compared with Nos. 1 and 2.

    No. 5 contained a very few starch-granules (PL III. fig. 17), a little granular
matter, and two or three brownish spores, almost identical with fungi-spores

of the genus Macrosporivm. They are club-shaped, -0015 x -0005 inch in

size, with three or four septa ; the upper portion coloured, the lower or nar-

rower portion (the base) colourless. Species of this genus are common on

decaying leaves of cabbages and other plants (fig. 16), often accompanied by

other moulds, especially Gladosporium.

    No. 4. I could detect nothing but one or two starch-granules, a few
minute inorganic particles like very fine sand, and a little granular matter.

    No. 2. This was richest in organisms of all the samples, contaiaing quite
a variety of subjects. The starch-granules were variable in form and size
(fig. 5) ; in most the hilum was quite distinct, in some the parallel lines : for
better security against error in observation they were tested with iodine.
Fragments of cellular tissue were also present (fig. 6), and granular matter
slightly discoloured, which resembled vegetable tissue in a state of decay and
disintegration (fig. 4) . Several fragments of delicate branched filaments were
also present (fig. 7), greatly like the mycelium of some minute fungus ; also
the branched upper portion of a thread very similar to those of Penicillium
(fig. 8). Minute ovate spores were also present (fig. 9), reminding one very
much of the spores of one of the white moulds, such as Aspergillus or Peni-
cillium, Larger spores were also present, of an elliptical form, variable in
size and proportions from -00035 in. to "0005 in. in length by "00025 in.
in width, of a yellowish tint, and rather granular within (fig. 12), In size
and character these resembled the spores of Claclosporium in the early
stage, before the septa are formed. StiU larger spores were found, but
rarely, that were coloured brownish, -00075 in. in length, and -0005 in.
in breadth, divided transversely by three or four septa slightly constricted at
each septum ; and again with each cell divided in the opposite direction, so
that the spores were multilocular, or fenestrate (fig. 13). Fragments of
woody fibre (fig. 11) were also present, and a vegetable hair, rather bulbous

at the base, consisting of but a single cell (fig. 10).

   The animal kingdom was represented by portions of the fibrils of feathers
(fig. 15) and the scale of a Lepidopterous insect (fig. 14). Fragments of
inorganic matter were also present in very minute rather angular pieces of
what might have been glass or sand ; but tJiis is only a guess.

   No. 1 was largely charged with minute cubic and rhombic crystals, which
polarized well (fig. 2), some starch-granules (fig. 1), and the scale of a Lepi-
dopterous insect (fig. 3). Besides these was a quantity of vegetable granular
matter, broken up cells, and a small quantity of minute quartz-like frag-

ments.

   As No. 1 and No. 2 were derived from the same locality, differing only in

the quantity of air passed through the wool, and, it is presumed, in the pre-

cise time at which it was passed, one cannot help thinking that the same
sewer would at different periods of the same day give a diff'erent result in the
organisms with which the air is charged. No fungi-spores were detected in
No. 1, and none of the curious little crystals so plentiful in No. 1 were visi-

ble in No. 2.

  A more extended series of examinations, which would of course occupy

considerable time and attention, would be of value in furnishing data for
determining problems which are sure to suggest themselves during inefficient

or iiicomplete examinations.

76 REPORT--1870.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1869-70. By a Com-

   mittee, consisting o/ James Glaisher, F.R.S., of the Royal Observa-
   tory, Greenwich, Robert P. Greg, F.G.S., F.R.A.S., Alexander
   S. HerscheLj F.R.A.S., and Charles Brooke, F.R.S., Secretary

    to the Meteorological Society.

In resuming the subject of their Eeport to the British Association for the
past year, the Committee have to regret the loss which they have sustained,
since the preparation of the last Eeport, by the death, on the 1st of February

last, of a late member of this Committee, Prof. E. W. Brayley, to whose ap-

pointment by the British Association, in the year 1862, to assist in their
especial objects, the Committee have been indebted for constant and invalu-

able aid.

    In reviewing for the past year the progress of inquiry, and the results of
observations relating to meteors, continued attention towards the establish-
ment of star-shower dates, and their radiant-points, has rewarded Prof.
Schiaparelli with the determination of a considerable number of radiant-
points, indicating, on certain nights of the year, the earth's passage through
weU-defined streams of meteoric matter, of which the visual directions of
motion, and the concluded parabolic orbits round the sun, are described by
Prof. Schiaparelli in a recent memoir, as derived from the observations of
Mr. Zezioli at Bergamo, the Table of which is reproduced in the third Ap-
pendix of this Report. The meteor-currents thus already indicated will
shortly be supplemented or confirmed by the observations recorded at six-
teen of the principal Italian observatories*, of which Mr. F. Denza has
obtained the cooperation since April last. More than 2000 shooting-stars
having been observed during the months of April, May, and June 1870; and
the observations, as they continue to accumulate, being communicated for
this purpose to Prof. Schiaparelli, the number and distinctive characters of
other meteoric showers, besides those of the principal meteor dates in August
and November, will thus be ascertained, to which the attention of observers
has hitherto been only partially directed.

    The Committee are indebted to observers during the past year for the
contribution of a large number of observations of bright meteors, and of
shooting-stars, recorded during the two chief displays of November 1869
and August 1870, statements regarding the principal results of which are

contained in the following Appendices of this Report.
    In the catalogue t of the past year the observations of luminous meteors

include, as in previous years, aU those descriptions of large meteors which
have come to the knowledge of the Committee, with the exception of a large
number of foreign observations of the great fireball seen in the south-west
parts of Europe, on the 8th of September, 1869, of which it is expected that
 a condensed account will be published before the preparation of another

Report, embodying aU the principal features of its course. An extraordinary

length of path and area of visibility has been assigned to this large meteor,
as will hereafter be described.

    * Alessandria, Aosta, Bergamo, Florence, Genoa, Girgenti (Sicily), Milan, Moncalieri
 (Turin), Naples, Padua, Palermo (Sicily), Perugia, Piacenza, Thiene (Vicenza), Urbino,

    t The Catalogue, in accordance with a resolution of the General Committee, will not
be printed in future Keports ; it will be preserved for reference, and the Committee hope
 to exhibit its principal results in a connected form.
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  77

  A large number of observations of shooting-stars during the August

period (in 1870) are also collected in the Catalogue, while the general
appearances of the meteors, and observations of their heights, are described
in this Report. It will be seen that while only six fireballs were so well
observed in England and Scotland during the past year as to enable their
heights to be determiued (on the 1st and 11th of October, 6th and 14th of
November, and 12th of December, 1869, and on the 20th of August, 1870),
the heights of sixteen shooting-stars were obtained during the meteoric
shower of the 5th to 11th of August, 1870 ; and twenty shooting-stars
recorded at Greenwich, during the same meteoric shower, were so well
recorded at other places that their real heights are at present undergoing

calculation.

   During the meteoric shower of the 14th of November, 1869, the sky, at
places in the south of England, was generally overcast ; but at the lloyal
Observatory, Greenwich, at Stonyhurst in Yorkshire, and at Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and Culloden (Inverness-shire) in Scotland, a clear view of the sky
was obtained during a portion of the time in which the shower appeared
to be at its height ; and a large fireball was doubly recorded by the ob-
servers at the last two stations, of which the height, obtained by calcu-
lation, is recorded with other double meteor-observations in the Appendix.
The advantage of maintaining a watch for the phenomenon at such widely
distant stations was the more apparent at the last return of the November star-
shower, since in America, on the morning of the 14th of November, 1869,
the sky was, throughout the United States, so overcast by a fall of snow
that no other announcement of the meteoric shower having been seen west
of the European continent, with the exception of the brilliant phenomena
observed in Florida and California, has hitherto been received by the Com-
mittee. The observations of the same shower in Italy, at Port Said in
Egypt, and at the Mauritius are described in the last Appendix of the
Report. Although the state of the sky was both favourable for its observa-
tion in Italy, and partially so at the other stations, it does not appear that a

distinct maximum of the shower was observed at any of those points of view;

but the number of the shooting-stars observed during the progress of the shower
rose and feU, sometimes very rapidly, through a great range of frequency and
of the average apparent brightness of the meteors. It maj' be inferred from
these results that the phenomenon of the November star-showeis is now
rapidly declining in its intensity, and that the stream of the Leonids, if it
should be crossed by the earth on the morning of the 14th of November in
the present year, will be found to have grown difiiise, and to have scattered

itself into groups of less frequent falling stars, with intervening " lulls " or
barren intervals, in which observers will be rewarded by the sight of very

few meteors, or in which it may happen that, for the space of many minutes,

no shooting-stars will be observed.
    Following the example set by Prof. Schiaparelli at MUan, and by the

Italian astronomers at Turin, Urbino, Rome, Palermo, and at other observa-
 tories in Italy, whose collective catalogue of shooting- stars recorded since the
 beginning of this year now numbers many thousands of observations, to con-

 duct observations of shooting-stars as far as possible on stated nights, at such
 widely separated stations as to increase the visibility of any meteoric shower
which might be traced, the Committee have decided, with a view to contri-
bute to the objects of the same well-devised scheme of observations, to confine
 their immediate attention for the present to those nights of the year on
 which long-known and well-established meteoric showers are annually
78 REPOET--1870.

expected to occur; and for this purpose they have provided star-charts,
suitable forms of registry, and directions to observers of the meteors
which annually make their appearance, with more or less regularity, ou
the 1st and 2nd of January, the 19th to the 21st of April, the 5th to the 12th
(especially the 10th) of August, the 18th to the 21st of October, the 12th

to the 15th of November, and the 11th to the 13th of December. On each

of these meteoric dates in the coming year (as their endeavours during the
August shower of this year were rewarded with very valuable results) the
Committee appeal to observers in distant parts of England to use their ability
in mapping aud counting the numbers of the meteors seen on the predicted
nights, and thus aid in making our hitherto imperfect knowledge of their
appearances wider and more certain.

                                       APPENDIX.

                                 I. Meteoks Doubly Observed.

   1869, October 1st, 8" 12"' 30' p.m., G. M. T., Kent and Brussels. The
meteor was weU observed by Mr. J. B. Keade at Bishopsbourne, near Canter-
bury, in England, and at Brussels. The prolongation of the lines of sight at
the moment of the meteor's disappearance intersected each other at about
ten miles over the neighbourhood of Mons, near the confines of Belgium and
Prance ; and the meteor passed almost vertically, at a height of thii-ty-five

miles, over Brussels. If the observed point of disappearance at Bishoj^sbourne
(60° east from south, altitude about 5°) is moved 10° southwards, without
any other alterations being substituted for the original observations, the

place of the meteor's disappearance is about fifteen mUes above the earth,
between Valenciennes aud Douay, near Lille in the north of Erance, where
M. Le Verrier reports that the meteor was very generally observed). The
meteor's height over Brussels was in this case fifty miles ; aud a more southerly
point of disappearance at Bishopsbourne would make the meteor's height
greater, and its point of disappearance further south over the provinces of
France. The meteor, however, approached very near to the earth, without,
as it would appear from the descriptions, producing any audible report. The
point of first appearance, " near a Persei," at Bishopsbourne, appears to be
situated too far back upon its apparent course to be reconciled with the de-
scription of the meteor's course by the stars, as it was observed at Brussels.
As the two apparent paths among the constellations intersect each other,
when prolonged backwards between Perseus and Aries, on the actual line of
flight described at Bishopsbourne, about the constellation Musea (R. A. 40°,
N. Decl. 30°), this large meteor's path was probably directed from the
radiant-point R^ (R. A. 41°, N. Decl. 24°) in the latter constellation, which

is a conspicuous region of divergence of shooting-stars about the middle of
 October.

    1869, October 11th, 5^ 4" 40' p.m., G. M. T., York and Lancashire.
The appearance of this fireball in twilight prevented its course from being
noted by the stars ; and the uncertainties of estimated altitudes must be ex-

pected to introduce corresponding uncertainties in the real path derived from
such general observations. The best average height and course which can
be elicited from the combined observations at York, Heighiugton, near
Darlington, and Llandudno, nearest to the meteor's flight, is from eighty-four
miles over a jjoint between Ashton aud Peniston (N. lat. 53° 30', W.loug. 1°50')
to twenty-eight miles over the neighbourhood of Skipton in Lancashire (N.
                                                                           ;

                 OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                     79

W.lat. 53° 57',  long. 2° 6').  The point of disappearance agrees within two

or three degrees with the place of disappearance observed by Miss Reade,

and measured by Mr. J. B. Reade, at Bishopsboiirne in Kent ; and the entire

course equally, exactly represents the apparent elevation (at altitude 30°, due

north) as seen at Calne, in Wilts. At these latter places its motion would

appear almost vertically downwards, as it was observed at Llandudno and in

London. The radiant-point of its approximate course is at E. A. 300°, N.

Decl. 14°, near a Aquilas, where no well-established radiant-point of ordinary

shooting-stars has hitherto been detected at that season of the year.

The writer of an extremely interesting article in the ' Daily News,' on the

probable real path of the fireball, cites the description of its course by an

observer at Sheffield as " apparently from north to south, radiating from the

zenith." The place of first appearance was found to be (very nearly as above

described) at a height of seventy-six miles over the neighbom-hood of

Sheffield. At the latter place, very near to the meteor's real course, the

observer describes the meteor as having an irregular contour, and compares

the apparent size of its surface to one-sixth of that of the moon. As both of

the observations at York and Heighington differ from the Sheffield description

in showing that the meteor moved towards the west and north, while the

real course, concluded from the above observations, would appear at Sheffield

radiating from the zenith towards the north-north-west, it is not impossible

that the Sheffield observer, by a not uncommon inversion of the points of the

compass, misrepresented the actual direction of the meteor's flight, which

should have been described as apparently from south to north.

The meteor seen at Leeds, in twilight on some evening about the 25th of

October last, was probably identical with this one, as it was so extremely

brUhant as to attract the observer's attention while it was stiU overhead

and it " shot across the zenith towards the sun's place at the time," dis-

appearing, "when a Kttlepast the zenith, in sparks and tails." This note of

its appearance agrees perfectly well with the description of its apparent

shape and magnitude at Sheffield, and it corroborates the observations at

York and Heighington, that the meteor moved towards the west. The

altitude of 52° in the west-north-west from Leeds, at which the point of

extinction, as above determined, probably occurred, might very aptly be de-

scribed by an observer, who first caught sight of the meteor when it was

nearly overhead, as " going out when a httle past the zenith."

1869, November 6th, about 6" SO"" p.m., G. M. T., CornwaU, England,

Wales, and Scotland. The great brightness of the fireball and of its

persistent streak, which is described by Mr. Pengelly, of Torquay, as having

remained in sight fuUy fifty minutes, rendered it a conspicuous object even

beyond the vicinity of places where its luminous course was nearly through

Athe zenith.     comparison of several pubhshed descriptions of the meteor,

communicated to the British Meteorological Society by Mr. A. S. Herschel,

places the point of first appearance of the nucleus ninety miles over Erome,

in Somersetshire, the first point of the luminous streak at a height of forty-

seven miles over Launceston, and its termination, at the extinction of the

meteor, twenty-seven miles over the sea very near St. Ives in Cornwall. The

whole length of its luminous course was 170 miles, performed in about five

seconds, with a velocity of about thirty-four miles per second. The length

of the bright streak, which gradually diffused itself in width and assumed a

serpentine form, was fifty-four miles, and its greatest width, when it was

first seen by Mr. Pengelly at Torquay, was about four miles (Proceedings

of the Brit. Meteor. Soc. for June 1870, p. 144). In that paper the meteor's
80 REPORT 1870.

course is stated to have descended at Broadstairs from 2° north of the
zenith ; the real direction of its line of flight was from about 2° south of

jut of ten, observed on the night of the 4th of November, also appeared to
radiate from the same point. The large fireball was accordingly an individual

from the sea at Lossiemouth, and crossing over Inverness towards Kintail.
The length of the part of the path observed at Glasgow was seventy-four
miles, performed in four seconds of time, with a velocity of eighteen and a
half miles per second. The direction of the meteor was from R. A. 12°, N.
Decl. 14° in Pisces, very near the position (R. A. 12°, S. Decl. 2°) of a

radiant- point T * of shooting-stars observed on the 27th of September, 1864 1.

Another meteor of the same group was doubly observed on the 24th of
September, 1866 ; and its velocity was found to be, like that of the present
fireball, less than the average velocity of shooting-stars, or about twenty-three

miles per second. (Report for 1866, p. 124.)

    1869, December 12th, e"" IS"" 30' p.m., G. M. T., Glasgow, Hawick, and
Oundle (Northamptonshire). Although the description of the meteor's course
at the northern stations of Glasgow and Hawick are incomplete, yet on
account of their great distance, about 270 miles from Oundle, near Peter-
borough, where the meteor's path was well recorded by the stars, a good
approximation of the meteor's real path is obtained by assuming the well-
known position (about R. A. 100°, N. Decl. 35°) of the radiant-point in
Gemini of the December meteors to be represented very nearly by the ob-
servations of the present meteor intersecting each other, when prolonged
backwards at a point about R. A. 125°, N. Decl. 35°. The lowest stars of
Ursa Major being less than 20° above the horizon at Oundle, the height of
18° or 20° at which the meteor there was estimated to have passed "below
Ursa Major," is evidently overrated ; and an altitude of 12° wUl, with the

usual interpretation of estimated altitudes near the horizon, fairly represent

the apparent altitude of the meteor's course. After making these preliminary
assumptions with respect to the apparent directions of the meteor's flight, it
appears, from their comparison together, that the fireball commenced its visible
path at a height of 100 mUes above Bergen in Norway, and shot with a
straight course of about 400 miles, to about fifty miles over Edinburgh, where

it disappeared. An observer of its luminous progress at Dundee states that
it proceeded with a slow shooting motion, apparently as if forcing its way

through the air for about thirty seconds ; and the statement indicates the un-
usually long time occupied by the meteor in its transit across the North Sea.
The description of its time of flight at Oundle, by Mr. William Rickett, was
that the meteor continued its motion, with an apparent speed by no means
rapid, for 15 or 20 seconds. Adopting Mr. Rickett's account as probably the
most accurate, and employing his approximate value, or seventeen and a half
seconds, for the meteor's time of flight, it follows that the course of about
400 mUes was described with a velocity of twenty-three miles per second.

   1869, December 29th, 10'^ 58°' p.m., G. M. T., London and Sandhurst (Kent).
The vertical descent of the meteor in the west at Sandhurst, near Hawkhurst
in Kent, and its motion from north-north-west to south-south-east, a few

degrees below Jupiter, at Notting Hill, London, indicate the direction of its
motion as apparently from the radiant Aj^, near S Cassiopeiae, for the end of
December and beginning of January. Adopting this radiant-point for the
real direction of its path, the place where the meteor passed near Jupiter, at

London, was about forty-five mUes high over Winchester ; and the meteor
passed in the direction of a line from Bath to Chichester, from seventy miles

ended near Jupiter at Netting Hill, this is probably not far from a correct
estimate of its real course. The length of the path is forty-seven miles,

south-east by east.

   1870, August 5th-llth, shooting-stars doubly observed in England. Ob-
servations of the August meteors were begun on the 5th, and continued

until the 12th of August, 1870, at the request of the Committee, at several
stations in England and Scotland, with a view to determine, if possible, the

real heights and velocities of the August meteors. Independently of the ob-
servations made at Greenwich for this purpose, the heights of sixteen shooting-
stars were ascertained, the description of whose appearance, and apparent
paths, by the several observers are contained at length in the Catalogue.

  In the Table of the results, the times of the observations are those
  stated by the observers from the best approximations to Greenwich time
  within their reach, differing from each other occasionally by one or two

  minutes. The number of the meteors visible, chiefly of the brighter class, in
  the fuU-moonlight of the 10th of August last having been small, and regard

  being paid to the condition that the parallax (fig. 4) of the observed meteor-
 tracks should be as nearly as possible in the same direction as the base-line

 joining two corresponding stations upon the map (fig. 3 represents the relative

 situations of the observers), the errors of time from true Greenwich time at
 the different stations were very easily detected, and were found to be nearly

for shortness, in figs. 3 and 4, by their initials ; and in the latter figure the
observations have been so far adjusted to each other as to satisfy, by very

slight changes in the majority of the observations, the condition of a parallel
displacement of the meteor-tracks in the direction of a base-line joining the

observers' stations.

    The_ observed length of the path being, in general, most affected by this
preliminary adjustment, a corresponding alteration of the observed duration
of the meteor's flight was cakulated, and entered in a Table as the " adopted
duration," from the average of which, at the two stations, the velocities of
twelve of the shooting-stars have been obtained. The time of visibility of

smaU stars of reference near the meteor's course, necessitating distant align-

ments of the apparent paths with the larger stars, prevented the average
length of path of the observed meteor-tracks from being at the same time

much diminished. Both the length of path and the velocity * are on this
account rather larger than those of twenty shooting-stars which were
similarly observed in August 1863 (forty-seven miles, and thirty-four mUes
per second. See Report for 1863, pp. 327-330). Among the meteors in-

cluded in the Hst, Nos. 3 and 13 belong to different meteoric showers (N,^, ^^,
and Tj) from that of the regular Perseids ; and the latter meteor presents a
velocity considerably below the average of all the remaining velocities of the
list. Although the disturbing influence of the moon's hght appears to have
exaggerated and to have rendered somewhat uncertain the velocities obtained
on this occasion, the velocities of these two meteors are omitted from the
average velocity of the Perseids or meteors of the August shower, of which

the average position of the radiant-point was found to be very near the star d
Persei. The heights of the first and last points of the meteors' tracks
and the average of those heights are shown in fig. 5, by a graphic projection
readily exhibiting to the eye the height in the atmosphere at which the
shooting-stars of the August meteoric shower became ignited, and were
extinguished, during the appearance of the phenomenon in the present year.

   The additional correspondences of the Greenwich observations with those
meteor-tracks whose heights have already been determined, and with other
shooting-stars recorded at the diiferent stations (of which a summary will be
given in the next Report), are at present undergoing calculation ; and they

may be expected, on concluding the results of their investigation, to afford

interesting materials for comparison with the observed paths of the shooting-
stars recorded in the present list.

    1870, August 15th, 9" p.m., G. M. T., Scotland and Ireland. The position
of the very luminous streak which this meteor left was over the southern
part of the Hebrides, and the Atlantic Ocean north of Ireland ; but at what
distance from the land, and at what height in the atmosphere, it would
require a comparison of other descriptions of its course to ascertain. As the
sun was fully 12° or 13° below the north-west horizon of the region indicated,
it would stni be half that depth, or about 6°, below the horizon of the meteor-
streak, if its elevation was only as great as the height at which the largest
August meteors commonly develoj)e a very long enduring, phosphorescent

streak, about fifty-five miles above the level of the sea.

    1870, August 20th, 9" 24"" p.m., G. M. T., London, Cambridge, and Oxford.
The apparent courses of the meteor, as described at Clapham Park, London,
and at Linton, Cambridge, are almost identical, so as to afford no definite
conclusion of the meteor's height. At Wandsworth, near Clapham, Mr. H.

W. Jackson saw the meteor commence about the trapezium (/3, y) of the

Little Bear, and disappear halfway between Capella and Algol, while at
Linton it disappeared almost over a Cassiopeiae. With the distance of forty-
five mUes between the latter places, and a parallax of 32° for the last point

of its visible course, these observations give the place of disappearance at a

point about twenty-one mUes over Bury St. Edmunds. As this place is within a
few degrees of the altitude and direction at which its disappearance was

observed at Combe, near Woodstock, in Oxfordshire, it may be accepted,

probably, as very near to the true position of the point at which the meteor

disappeared.

   The exact place of the meteor's first appearance cannot be absolutely
ascertained. But supposing its apparent course at Linton to have passed
about 20° north of tho zenith, and to have descended " almost perpen-
dicularly " (with an inclination of about 20° from the north of vertical), as
it was perceived to fall towards the eastern horizon at Woodstock by Mr. J.
Abrahall, its real course, preserving tho apparent path which it appeared to
have at Wandsworth, began from the direction of a radiant-point between the
head of Bootes and Corona BoreaUs, at about R. A. 230°, N. Decl. 35°. At
its passage due north of London the height of the meteor, on this assumption
of its initial direction, was about fifty-three miles above a point between
Huntingdon and Cambridge, descending towards its point of extinction from

Aan inclination of 45° above the due west horizon. more complete knowledge

of this extremely brilliant meteor's real course can only be obtained, to

coiToborate, or correct, the present provisional determation, if notices of its

appearance were obtained by observers at other places, who would com-

                                          II. Large Meteors.

    1822, October 16tli, evening, London. The following extract of a note in
 Sir John Herschel's MS. Journal refers apparently to a large fireball of which

--no mention is found in Mr. Greg's and other Catalogues of the appearances

of unusually brilliant meteors. " 1822, October 16th, Wednesday. This
evening, walking home from the Haymarket to Downing-street, being at the

Horse Guards at 8^ 37"" p.m., saw a great light, Uke the moon breaking out
among the clouds, and a fiery appearance like the bursting of a rocket, not

globiilar, but in ill-defined masses. Direction exactly before me, as I walked
towards Westminster from Charing Cross. Altitude about 15° or 1G°; sky

overcast ; a mizzling rain and fog. No explosion heard ; ? its nature, if
meteoric?--(J- F. W. H.)"

    1860, July 20th, 9" 34'° 33' to 9" SG" 24' p.m. (Washington mean time),

United States, America. An exhaustive investigation of the path of this

large meteor, from a comparison of observations at more than 200 places in
the United States and the adjacent parts of Canada, by Dr. J. H. Coffin, is
contained in the ' Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,' vol. xvi. for 1870.
The meteor was first reported to have been seen moving eastward from a
point nearly over the western shore of Lake Michigan, westward from which
it might perhaps have been observed had not a cloudy state of the sky
prevailed at the time throughout that region. Along the entire remaining
portion of its visible track of nearly, or quite, 1300 miles, it was watched by
numerous observers until it disappeared quite out at sea in a south-easterly
direction from the island of Nantucket. It was first well observed at Flint,
Michigan, between the great Lake of that State and Lake Huron, pursuing
from that place and from the remaining points of view along its line of flight
an apparently undulating or ricochet motion until it faded from sight, with-
out breaking into fragments, towards the eastern horizon. It was accompanied
throughout the greater portion of its path by a brilliant train, and followed
at a distance of about 1° or 2° by a smaller fireball of the same dazzling
white colour as the head ; while near the end of its course sparks or flakes
of red and pink colour were cast off by the nucleus in considerable numbers.
The length of time that it was visible at one station, depending upon the
length of the arc which was observed, varied from half (or rather less than
half) a minute to about two minutes ; and the whole time occupied by the

                                                                  Fig. 6.

meteor in its visible track was about three minutes. At the points B, C
(see fig. 6), in long, west from Greenwich about 77° and 74°, and espe-

cially at the latter point, distinct ruptures of the meteor were observed,
corresponding to which the real height and direction of its coiirse underwent

a sensible alteration. The actual height of the meteor when it was first

well observed in long. 85i° west from Greenwich (at a, fig. 6), at Flint,
88 REPORT-- 1870.

Michigan, was ninety-eight miles above the earth, and the first inflection of its

conrse, nearly over Dansville, New York, took place at a height of fifty-six
miles, and the second, nearly over New York, at thirty-nine miles above the

sea. The last place where the meteor was well observed was at Germanstown,
Pennsylvania, and the meteor was then fifty-three miles above the level of the

sea, in long, about G8|° west from Greenwich (at b, fig. 6). Finally, at
Harrisburgh, Pennsylvania, it was still visible in the east, in longitude about
00° west from Greenwich ; and its height was then rapidly increasing, and
was again upwards of sixty miles above the sea-level.

    The meteor pursued its course with a velocity, relative to the earth, of about
nine and three-quarter miles per second, experiencing throughout its aerial
track a small but scarcely appreciable resistance from the atmosphere. With
a relative velocity somewhat less than this it entered the sphere of the
earth's dominant attraction from the direction of a point in E. A. 147° 41',
N. Decl. 3° 8', and it was deflected before escaping from the disturbing
influence of gravity towards the earth fully 35° from its original direction.
The circumstance of its slow velocity relatively to the earth introduces com-
plexities in determining the real orbit of the meteor round the sun, which it
would yet be interesting, from the elaborate calculations to which the ob-
servations were submitted, and from the unusual accuracy with which the
elements of this great meteor's path have accordingly become known, to ascer-
tain with every possible degree of approximation to the most probable result.

    The long course and duration of the flight of the large meteor doubly
observed on the 12th of December, 1869 (see the First Appendix), furnishes
a good example during the past year of a shooting-star belonging to a
periodical meteor-stream grazing for a long distance, without being consumed,
the summit of the earth's atmosphere, and suggests as a favourable means of
ascertaining their velocity, the propriety of observing their parallax when the
radiant-point of a meteoric shower is scarcely risen, or presents itself, as in
the case of the great meteor of July 1860, at only a few degrees of altitude

above the observer's visible horizon.

   1869, May 20th, a few minutes after 11" p.m. (local time), United States.
The meteor, which appeared brighter than the full moon, was seen at many

places in the United States (vide Amer. Journal of Science, July 1869) re-
maining visible for about five seconds, drawing behind it a very brilliant tail
of sparks, and finally exploding and bursting into fragments, apparently with

a loud report. From observations at New York, Poughkeepsie, Newhaven,

and Hartford, U.S., of its apparent path. Prof. E. Loomis has determined with
considerable precision the length of the meteor's real path and its real eleva-
tion. The meteor moved nearly horizontally at a height of fifty miles above
the earth's surface, disappearing, after a visible course of about 200 miles,
vertically over a point on the Atlantic Ocean somewhat north and east of
Eoston. The real velocity of its motion, assuming its time of flight to have
been five seconds, was about forty miles per second. About three minutes
after the passage of the meteor a terrific noise was heard in the neighbour-

hood of New York, which shook windows and the doors of houses like an

earthquake. As Prof. Loomis shows that the meteor was at the time of its
explosion 170 miles distant from places where the unusual sounds were heard
so soon after its disappearance, it is supposed that they must accordingly be
ascribed to some other cause than this large meteor, the sound of whose re-
port, would occupy ten minutes in reaching them, with the ordinary velocity
of sound in common air.

   1869, August 7th and 24th, evening. United States. The following de-

scription of bright meteors seen in the United States on the 7th and 24th of
August, 1869, was communicated by Mr. B. V. Marsh to the Secretary of the

Committee, Mr. Herschel, soon after the time of their appearance. The

occurrence in the present year of a very brilliant meteor-streak observed in

Scotland at sunset on the 6th of August, 1870, appears to corroborate the

opinion of Mr. Marsh, that a meteor-shower from some western radiant-point

has prevailed on the 6th and 7th of August of the two last years, of which the

Ameteors were chiefly visible soon after sunset.  second brilliant meteor-

streak was observed in Scotland soon after sunset of the evening of the 15th

of August last (see Appendix I. ; 1869, August 15th), which appeared to one

observer to be self-luminous, and to others to be illuminated by the sun's rays

in the manner in which Mr. Marsh observes that the streak seen in America

on the 24th of August, 1869, was evidently rendered more than ordinarily

brilliant.

   "On the 7th of August, a little while after sunset, several were seen descend-

ing almost vertically in the west and north-west, being very conspicuous even

in the strong light of the western twilight.

   " One which I saw at 7'' 49TM started about 18° high and disappeared at

about 6° ; fell almost vertically, but inclined a little to the right.
   " ' The Press ' noticed one at 7^ 55", the cloud from which remained visible

ten minutes.

   " August 24th, Mr. J. S. Hilles, of the Reading Eailroad, saw one in the

north-west, just as the upper limb of the sun disappeared : a very brilliant

fireball inclining considerably to the right [see the figure] as it descended, and

leaving behind it a perfectly straight streak of brilliant white light slightly

enlarged at its lower end, and having at that part a nebulous undefined
appearance ; whole length say 15° or 20°. This assumed successively the

following forms :

During this time it had floated westward until it was nearly over the setting
sun, and was beautifully lighted ' with the rose hues of sunset, while its upper
part assumed a strikingly silvery appearance.'

   " Mr. Hilles did not look at his watch, but his impression at the time was
that it remained visible half an hour ; but he thinks that this may be an over-

estimate.

   " At 7** 20" the same evening (August 24th) another appeared which

attracted very general attention.

   " One of my neighbours, after watching it about five minutes, called me out.

The luminous cloud was then very conspicuous, its base about 15° north of
west, altitude about 13°. The meteor had fallen almost vertically, and at
that point had appeared to explode. It vanished so quickly that most persons
saw only the flash, but several say they saw the meteor itself before the

exijlosion.

    " Its path was marked by a brilliant line of light, which soon widened so as
to appear as a narrow strip of cloud, say 3° or 4° long and |° wide, having
at its lower extremity a much brighter part resembling the nucleus of a
 90 REPORT--1870.

 comet. This luminous cloud was visible fully ten minutes ; the changes it
 underwent are roughly sketched below. Both the top and bottom of the

column seemed to remain almost stationary, whilst a considerable portion of
the upper half drifted westward, as if carried by an east wind.

    " From the ' nucleus ' there was also a bright line extending horizontally
to the right, 2° or 3° long, as indicated by the red line. This seems to have
been almost as bright as the principal column, but much narrower, and there-

fore not so generally noticed.

   " My friend Jos. Walton watched it some minutes with an opera-glass,

and says it was as distinct as the other,
    " This must have been thrown off instantaneously by the explosion.
    " The luminous cloud, and especially the ' nucleus,' was so bright that at

Atlantic City, sixty miles east of this place, it was by some mistaken at first

for a ' fire balloon.'

    " The explosion was more than 200 mUes west of Philadelphia, at a height

of forty-five or fifty miles.

    " The meteor and cloud (or more generally a flash of light and the cloud

only) were observed at Yonkers and Harlem, near New York ; at Atlantic
City, and Trenton, in New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware ; and at Phila-

delphia, Lancaster, Columbia, in Pennsylvania.

    " At Clarion, 250 miles west of Philadelphia (or north of west, rather), it
appeared in the south-east, and disappeared in the north-west ; and it was
followed by a sound resembling thunder, or the rolling of a heavy body
over a floor, I do not find that it was seen at all at any point further west.
Here it appeared at forty minutes after sunset. At Clarion the sun had set
only about twenty-five minutes before ; the general twilight was therefore
much stronger. This circumstance, coupled with the fact that the meteor
itself lasted only a second or two, not long enough for persons to look over-
head and see it, probably explains the fact that it does not seem to have been
seen generally in the region where it was vertical.

   " At places in Ohio bo far west that the meteor would appear in the east
so low as to be within the view of persons walking with the head in its
ordinary position it might be expected to be seen, but in this case the interval
from sunset is further reduced to about ten minutes, which is probably
more than sufficient to counterbalance the eff'ect of the darker background

in looking towards the east.
    " But a stiU stronger reason probably is that the light from this cloud was

principally sunlight, and that therefore the cloud would, like any other cloud,

be more brilliant when in the west than in the east, the effects of refraction

exceeding those of reflection.
    " This circumstance probably has something to do with the fact that all of

the above-mentioned meteors were seen in the western sky, and no corre-
sponding ones in the east.

   " As none have been observed later in the evening, when twilight was

gone, it would seem as if these meteors belonged to a group that were

essentially daylight meteors.

" When this meteor appeared, the sun was just setting 10° west of our

longitude, and an object only fifteen miles high over Clarion County would

be in the sunshine. This meteoric cloud was not less than forty miles high,

and must therefore have been illuminated in this way ; as no other instance
has come to my notice I was much interested in it, but when I commenced

this letter I had no idea of troubling you with so long a story.

1869, September 8th, 7" p.m. (local time), Germany, France, Switzerland,

Aand Italy.  magnificent fireball was seen in the south-west of Europe,

over an extent of fully 20° in latitude and longitude, on the evening of the

8th of September. The descriptions of its appearance at Strasbourg, Pisa,

Arezzo, and Genoa are contained in the ' Meteorological Bulletin ' of the

Urbino Observatory for August 1869 ; and at the Piedmontese stations, and

at Milan, where it was seen by Prof. SchiapareUi, at Ancona, Bologna,

Civita Vecchia, and numerous other places in Italy, in the ' Meteorological

Bulletins ' of the Moncalieri, and Eoyal CoUege of Kome Observatories for

September, 1869. According to Mr. C. A. Kesselmeyer the meteor approached

the southern part of Europe from Prussia, and after crossing the Ehenish

provinces between Bohemia, Bavaria, and France, it crossed the Alps of

Switzerland and Savoy, being seen near the Lake of Constance, at Lucerne

and Geneva, and thence pursued its course to Italy, where it was seen at

Marseilles, Civita Vecchia, and Naples, proceeding from north-east towards

south-west across the Mediterranean sea. The numerous observations of its

course obtained in different countries of Europe will afibrd ample materials for

a very rigorous calculation of its path, not less instructive than the passage

of the great meteor over America on the 20th of July, 1860, and may at some

future time be expected, like the path of that meteor, to furnish tolerably

exact elements of a meteoric orbit round the sun. In the length of its path,

the date and hour, and the brilliancy of its appearance it closely resembles

the large fireball seen in Italy, Switzerland, and France on the evening of the

5th of September 1868 (Report for 1869, p. 272).

1870, August 6th and 15th, about 10" 6" and 9'' p.m., Scotland and

AIreland.  description and drawing of the streaks of these large meteors

were received from Mr, T. W. Backhouse ; and others are contained in the

'Astronomical Register,' and in 'Nature' of September 1st, 1869. The

relative abundance of shooting-stars on the night of the 6th of August, 1870,

described in the next Appendix, and the occurrence of similar meteors in

America last year on the evenings of the 7th and 24th of August, appear to

indicate that each of these large meteors was connected with a periodical

shower of shooting-stars in August, differing to some extent in the time of

maximum from the annual epoch of the 10th, and of which the position of

the radiant-point, perhaps more westerly, has not yet been exactly ascer-

tained.

sometimes found imbedded in small portions in the darker mass of othe
aerolites. It it so found in the meteorites of St. Mesmin, of the Asturiat
and of Assam ; while its analogue, Montrejite, is found similarly distribute
in the meteorites of Canellas, Guttersloh, and Baflfe. The recognition of sue

a structure materially assists the classification of meteorites under commo

types, and suggests considerations regarding the process and sources fror

which they are derived. (" On the Meteorite of Motta dei Comti," b

   From a collection of thirteen examples of the oolitic class of aerolites i

the Mineralogical Museum at Paris, M. Meunier obtains the foUowin

numbers of aerolitic falls of this peculiar class in the several months of th
year, showing that meteorites of the same tj^o are not confined to singl
orbits or to single rings of meteoric materials encompassing the sun, but ar
found in the same regions of space with meteorites of other types. (Lette

--meteoric kind is reported by the ' Madras Athenaeum ' as follows : ' An

aerolite weighing about ten pounds fell in the neighbourhood of Parvatypore

particulars regarding this occurrence. The substance of which this aerolite

consists is apparently iron in a very pure state, without any mixture of

other mineral substances or impurities. The mass is shaped and marked,

and even on one side (that evidently which came in contact with the earth)

polished in a manner naturally to be expected under the circumstances,

that the noise caused by the aerolite in passing through the air in its faU was

very startling, and to the people in the immediate neighbourhood alarming.

Its luminous splendour is described as equal to that of the moon, and it is

said to have culminated with an explosion of great brilliancy. It was seen

and heard for many miles, as it fell in a direction from north to south.'

                   Mourzouk, Fczzan, 1869, December 25th, evening.

  A large globe of fire fell to the earth with an explosive sound, in sight of

a group of Arabs, near the capital of Fezzan, and imbedded itself in the
ground. The meteorite, which weighs 6000 lbs., is destined to be preserved

in the public Museum of Constantinople. M. von Haidinger, of Vienna, and

Mr. R. H. Scott, in London, have presented to the geological societies of their
respective countries a description of the circumstances which attended its fall.

 --Periodicity of Detonating and Non-detonating Fireballs, arul of Aerolites.

From a collection of the most recent Catalogues of large meteors and aerolites,

Mr. Greg has revised the Tables appended to his first Catalogue of such ap-
pearances printed in the volume of these Reports for 1860. The following
more complete and carefully reconstructed Tables exhibit at a glance the
particular days of the year on which large meteors have thus appeared in
greatest numbers, the months or seasons of the year in which aerolites are
most common, and in which they have been especially observed in each year
for the last period of more than half a century. The question of the
periodicity or non-periodicity of those rare occurrences cannot fail to arrive
at an ultimate solution by systematic arrangement and classification, of

which the Tables now reproduced, and brought up to the latest dates of his
extended Catalogue by Mr. Greg, are a valuable and well-timed contribution.

               OBSEllVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.       99

 --4. The November Meteoric Shoiver in 1869. In addition to the observations

of the November meteors in 1869, which were received by the Committee, the
following are some of the results obtained at the Italian Observatories, where
the sky was in general in a more favourable state for .observation than the
condition of the atmosphere '\\hich prevailed in England on the morning of

the 14th of November.
   The number of meteors seen at the Moncalieri and Perugia Observatories,

on the momiQg of the 14th of November, 1869, were in the half hours (in
Perugia in the hours) ending at November 14, 1869, a.m. ;

   Four maxima of frequency were observed at Moncalieri during the quarters
of an hour ending at 1" 4-5", 3" lo"", 4" 15", and 4" 45'" a.m. At Perugia
the sky was overcast untQ 1'' a.m., and frequent cumuli crossed the sky during
the remainder of the night. The principal maximum frequency of the meteors
appeared to occur between 3'' and 4'' a.m. ; and the agreement of these ob-
servations with the time of maximum at Port Said, Alexandria, where the
November shower was observed by Captain Tupman, U.M.A., will be gathered
from the following Table, which is extracted from the ' Monthly Notices of

the Eoyal Astronomical Society ' for December 1869.

            1869, November 13th, Alexandria Mean Time.

Davidson aud Mrs. E. Davidson in 2^ 25'", between I'' 15'" and 3'' 40'" a.m.,
was 556 meteors, the rate of frequency gradually increasing until 2'' 20"" a.m.,

when it was five or six meteors in a minute, and again decreasing with
frequent minor maxima of abiindancc until the close of the observations,

when the rate of their appearance returned to nearly the same average, of

about three per miuute, as at the beginning of the observations.

Although the star-shower returned in diminished brilliancy on the morning

of the 14th of November, 1869, it is evident, from the examples of these ob-

servations, that no well-marked moment of greatest abundance (like those

which were observed in 1866 and 1867) was again perceived in the last

November star-shower. The meteors seen on the mornings of the 13th and

15th of November were comparatively insignificant in their numbers at all

the points of observation.

 --5. The Aiigiist Meteors in 1870. The cooperation of observers in England

and Scotland having been solicited by the Committee, between the 5th and

the 12th of August, 1870, a considerable number of observations were made

at the stations, of which the following list furnishes the duration of the

watch and the number of the meteors seen by each observer.

  A considerable abmidance of meteors was observed at Hawkhurst on the

night of the 6th, and the second maximum of frequency took place on the
night of the 10th of August. On account of full moonlight aud occasional
clouds on the 10th, with a hazy sky, the hour of maximum was not definitely

fixed ; but six meteors were mapped in six mimites at Hawkhurst between

12" 12"" and 12" 18'" a.m. on the night of the lOth-llth. An almost total

absence of meteors was observed at Birmingham, the Eoyal Observatory,

Greenwich, East Tisted (Hants), and at Hawkhurst during the half-hour

between 11" 15'" and 11" 45"' p.m. on the night of the 10th ; a similar lull
in the meteoric shower was observed at Hawkhurst between 11" 10"" and
11" 40" p.m. on the following night. The hourly number of meteors seen

by two observers at Hawkhurst, between 10" 30'" p.m. and 12" SO*" a.m., was

eleven on the night of the 10th, aud nine on the night of the 11th, the sky

being equally favourable on both nights.

   The following is Mr. Wood's report on the meteoric shower observed at
Birmingham :

102 REPORT--lSrO.

   " There was a marked paucity of meteors on and about the 10th ; and the
August meteoric shower appears to be approaching its minimum, which, as
observed in these Reports for 1867 and 1869, might be expected [dating an
eight-year period, observed in previous minima, from the minimum of 1862]
to take place about the present year. On the present occasion the greatest
number occurred on and after midnight of the 6th, preceded by a fii-eball at
gh gym p_-j[._ observed at the Isle of Skye, and a more than ordinarily bright
meteor at 11"* 16TM p.m., at Birmingham. There was no change of position of
the radiant-points on successive nights, but a continuation of the Perseids,
and other centres, with a simple variation in activity."

    The radiant-point on the night of the 10th appeared at London (Mr. T.
Crumplen) to be near -q Persei, at East Tisted (Mr. F. Howlett) near
er Persei, and at Hawkhurst (Mr. A. S. Herschel) near a, y Persei ; on the
night of the 11th it appeared to be, at London nearer to ^ Persei, and at
Hawkhurst between tj Persei and e Cassiopeiae. At Manchester the radiant
region on the nights of the 6th-9th of August appeared to Mr. Greg to
occupy an elongated space between I- Persei and e Cassiopeiae.

         Part III.

--Section 1. In this division I propose to consider modular equations, and

some subjects connected with elHptic functions, omitted in the Second Part.
The higher portions of the theory of modular cqiiations, which are inti-
mately connected with the theory of numbers, have been already treated by

Professor Smith in his valuable report on that branch of mathematics. On

the other hand. Professor Sohnke's important paper on modular equations

was very slightly noticed by Mr. E. L. Ellis, and therefore, although much

earlier in date than the other papers which form the subject of this Report,

may well be considered here as an assistance to the reader who is disposed

to enter on the researches of Messrs. Kronecker, Hcrmite, and Joubert, which
are closely connected with these investigations of Sohnke.

    I shall employ in the following pages fi and v instead of u and v, as used
in the ' Fundamenta Nova,' to prevent (m) occurring in two different senses
in the same investigation.

    Jacobi has given the following theorem for the transformation of the 5th

order :

This last equation is called the modular equation of the 5th order.

  Putting >'= Wx, /i=* VX-, the general problem of modular equations, which

wo have to solve, is the following :

a, being any of the n roots of unity.
   The proof, although long, presents no particular difficulty, and depends on

transforming the factors in the continued products by means of the theorem

that 2nr+4:in'p (when n is a prime number, wi' one of the numbers 1, 2, 3

        -- pn 1, r all numbers from zero to infinity, all numbers from to

    Section 3. It appears from this investigation :
   A. That the modular equation is of the (n+l)th degree.
   B. That the coefficients of the equation, when arranged in powers of v,

are rational and entire functions of fx.

   C. That the last term of the modular equation is of the form +^"+' if

+ -- +(n) is of the form Sr l, /x"+i if n is of the form 8r 3.

    This is deduced by Sohnke from the observation that it is a consequence

of the multiplication of elliptic fimctions that all the roots should have the

same sign as the quantity

   D. The modular equation is unchanged when Ic and \ are interchanged,

therefore the highest power of (/i) cannot exceed (n+1).

  E. We have already seen that n is of the form \/2^qf{q). One value

of {y) must therefore be of the form \/2'{/q^'f(q"). If we substitute this in
the modular equation, the irrationality must disappear. Hence in any term

^ =of the modular equation aj.i'")'^, we must have ^q'"' . qTM 2' \/(l*> where

t is constant for every term. Hence m+rnz=Ss+t, and therefore the mo-

dular equation must be made up of terms of the form

     + +j''-(a/xP /3/xP+8 y;uP+lH                                ).
       ON ELLIPTIC AND HYPERELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS.                  105

   F. Since /i^+i is of the form ^yq"+^'R^{q), aud /xr of the form \/q^^'R,(q),

we see the irrationality to be the same in each case. Hence, as the equation

necessarily admits of a term c^"+^, it must also admit of a term of the form

c'/x»'.

   G. Since the modular equation remains unaltered when k and I are inter-

+changed, it follows that it must also remain unaltered when ^t and v arc

interchanged. The modular equation is of the form

                       =v"+i+ . . . +anv+i.i"+^

if n is of the form 8rHhl. Here we must manifestly interchange fi and v,

--as the equation cannot be rei^roduced if fi is placed instead of r, and v in-

stead of fi. On the other hand, the modular equation is of the form

                       -- =y^+l-H . . . +OJUJ/ ^"+1

+ --if (n) is of the form 8r 3. Here we must place jj. instead of >', i- instead

of /y, as the equation cannot be reproduced if we interchange fx and r.
   H. Hence Sohnke shows that the coefficients of fx'"yP and v^fiP are equal

+ ^always in magnitude, although differing in sign when n=8r '3, and is

even. Also that the coefficients of it'^t'P and m"+i-'»v"+^-1' are always equal

+in magnitude, although differing in sign, when n=8r 3.

   J. Lastly, Sohnke proves that when ^=1, the equation necessarily takes

+ + --the form (»/ l)«(>'-- 1)=0 when n is of the form 8r 3, and (v l)"+i
+when (n) is of the form 8)' l.

 --Section 4. The method of ascertaining the form of the modular equation

now becomes manifest.
   "We determine the indices of fx and v by E. Then H, J give us relations

between the coefficients, which greatly diminish their number considered as
independent quantities. Finally, we determine the remaining coefficients by

substituting the values of p. and v expanded in terms of q in the equation,

and then equating the coefficients of the powers of q thus obtained to zero.

   This method is fully illustrated by Sohnke by an example. He has also

--added a modification of the process, which will bo found useful in practice.
    Section 5. The discriminant of the modular equation is of the form

       TC(l-K^)'''(Ao + A^nHAjt'°+          +kpu'p).

For a proof of this the reader is referred to the concluding section of Pro-

fessor Betti's Mouografia on Elliptic Functions, contained in the third and

fourth volumes of the ' Annali di Matematica,' which I am now going to

bring under the notice of the reader. Professor Betti has founded his

theory on the geometrical basis adopted by Riemann and his followers, and

which  myit is not  object to consider  in  the present Report.  I shall there-

fore explain at once the connexion between the notation in the Monografia

with that we have already employed, and so lead the way to some new

aspects of elliptic functions.

Professor Betti's notation,

 --Section 6. Having thus explained the notation, we come to the following

theorem given by Professor Betti (A. D. M. 3. 123) :

       ....Po.o(z) + (-irPoa(^) + Pi.o(--) + (-irPM(^),                                        (1)

   The roots of the entire functions Q^^^{z+tv) e^>.(;:-- ty) are respectively
of the form

explain to the reader when I treat of the hyperelliptic functions. The pro-

   From these expressions it is easUy seen that the ordinary formulae rela-
tive to the transformation of elliptic functions may be deduced. This has

course, as must be the case in a systematic treatise, among those exceedingly

--well known.

 --Section 12. In the papers contributed by Jacobi to the earlier numbers

of CrcUc's Journal, several propositions may be found which are not con-
tained in the ' Fundamenta Nova.' One of the most celebrated of those

has been the subject of a special memoir by Professor Cayley*. It is this.

also a=Jc+j^, then the denominator of this expression will satisfy the dif-
ferential equation

  A demonstration of this proposition has also been given by Betti (A. D. M.

4. 32), and another proposition given by Jacobi will be found at p. 13 of the
same volume.

 --Section 13. Since the publication of the ' Fundamenta Nova ' the third

elliptic integral has been discussed by Jacobi in his memoir " Sur la Eotation
d'un Corps," in the 39th volume of Crellc's Journal, by Betti, ' Annali di
Matematica,' iii. 309, and by Schellbach, ' Lehre von den Elliptischcn Inte-

gralen,' p. 217.

    There ii^alao a paper on the third elliptic integral by Professor Somoff in
the 47th volume of Crelle's Journal, written to facilitate the numerical cal-

culation of its value. There are a few papers on elliptic functions, connected
with Abel's theorem, and the multiplication of functions 9, which I hope

to consider hereafter, when treating on hyperelliptic functions, with which

they are closely related.

  --Section 14. 1 have long wished to see a treatise on elliptic functions

--written on the following plan. First, I have wished the subject to be con-

sidered as if consisting of three parts evolution, division, and transforma-

tion. This, indeed, has been in great part effected in Abel's great memoir
on the subject ; but this memoir, it wiU be observed, contains no indication
of the existence of the functions 0*. The evolution of elliptic functions

--should be effected in the following way: They should be expressed by

doubly infinite products, and this should be done by a method closely re-
sembling that employed by Abel. These doubly infinite products should
then be transformed into the singly infinite products used by Jacobi ; and
lastly, these singly infinite products should be multiplied together, so as to
form the functions d. The division and transformation should be effected
separately, and the evolution deduced as effected by Abel, and not in an
elementary treatise, derived from transformation, as we see in the ' Funda-
menta jS'ova.'

   An excellent treatise on elliptic functions, which forms a part of Ber-
trand's ' Traite de Calcul Differentiel et de Calcul Integral,' now publishing

in France, keeps these objects steadily in view, and 1 have great pleasure in
recommending it to the reader. If I do not dwell longer on this work, it

is not assuredly because I am insensible to its merit, but because it is not

only written in the highest style of mathematical elegance, but is also so

perspicuous that any commentary from me would be superfluous.

tions to mechanics wiU be found in the 39th volume of CreUe's Journal. In

that volume is published Jacobi's memoir on the motion of a rigid body,

which has been already mentioned in Part II. of this Report in relation to

the many important discoveries it contains in pure mathematical science.

I now enter upon the consideration of this paper regarded as a physical

memoir, Jacobi makes use of the following notation. Instead of

                                     2K^· 2Kx 2K / 7r\ 2K/ ,r\

The object of the paper is to calculate the motion of a rigid body, acted on
by no forces, round a fixed point.

   Let X, y, z be the fixed axes passing through the fixed point to which the
motion of the body is referred, the plane of x y being the invariable j)lane.

These functions can, of course, be expanded in scries by the formulae given

in section 10, Part II. of this Iteport. Jacobi in his memoir enters into a

--discussion of the ambiguities occasioned by the use of the symbol t= V 1,

mywhich I omit here,     object being to give a clear insight into the principle

of the method by which the problem of the motion of a rigid body round

a fixed point is solved.

 --Section 3. In the 50th volume of Crelle's Journal there is a memoir by

Lottner on the motion of a rigid soHd of revolution round a fixed point

which is not its centre of gravity, but which is situated in the axis of revo-

lution. This memoir is very similar in its character to Jacobi's. I shall

content myself therefore with giving results.

There is also, in the 50th volume of Crelle's Journal, an elaborate memoir

on the application of the functions Q to the solution of the problem of ascer-

taining the motion of the spherical pendulum, by Dumas.

 --Section 4. It will be interesting, in writing on elliptic functions in a

country so dependent for its greatness, under Providence, upon its manu-

facturing skill as this, to show that these integrals are capable of a direct

Aapplication to machinery.  remarkable example of this is given by Canon

Moseley in his ' Mechanics.'

   The quantity of work done by a pressure P acting through a space S,
where P and S are constant, is taken to be equal to PS. Hence if P is

variable, the work done is equal to 1 Pf?S, or half the vis viva accumulated

while the work is being done. Canon Moseley then shows that in any
machine, if Uj is the work done at its moving point through the space S,
Uj the work yielded at the working points, Uj and U^ are connected together

by an equation of the form Uj=AU2 4-BS, where A and B are constants

--dependent for their value upon the construction of the machine, -that is to

say, upon the dimensions and combination of its parts, theii* weights, and
the coefficients of friction at the various rubbing-sm-faces. Upon this prin-
ciple Canon Moseley works out his theory, and the above equation is applied
to the wheel and axle, to pulleys combined in different ways, to toothed

wheels, and to aU the component parts of machinery, affording in many cases,

and especially with regard to toothed wheels, results of great interest and

beauty.
   In the case of the capstan, the above equation leads to an elliptic function.
    Let a^ be the length of the lever turning the capstan measured from the

axis;

   a^ the length of the perpendicular upon the rope supposed to act in a con-

stant direction

  T the tension of the rope

   Uj the work done by the pressure applied to the extremity of the lever

always perpendicular to its direction
                        ;

120  ·  REPORT-- 1870.

   Uj the work actually performed by the capstan
   p the radius of the axle, and (p the limiting angle of resistance. For a
full explanation of this latter quantity I must refer the reader to the original

treatise.

   Then if T be supposed constant,

        Uj=U,+-^-^^ I do V a^^+2a^a.^ COS +d a^'.

EThis integral is, of course, the elliptic function ; and the result is strongly

suggestive of the importance of the higher integrals in a calculation of work
done in machines, when the point of application of the motive power is vari-

able. It is hardly necessary to observe that the radical in the above integral
gives the distance between the points of application of the forces.

   42, From the Meeting of the British Association at Norwich (Aug. 18GS)
up to the present time the harmonic reduction of observations recorded by

self-registering tide-gauges in several diflcrent localities, namely Eamsgnte,
Bombay, Liverpool, and Fort Point, California, has been continued. The

TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.                                          121

work has been performed by Mr. E. Eoberts and assistant calculators in the
Nautical Almanac Office, vrorking under his immediate direction, according
to the plans described in the Eeport presented by the Committee of 1867-68
to the Association at Norwich a year ago, with modifications suggested by
experience, and extensions to include parts of the investigation not reached
ia the first year's work. The results obtained up to January 1869 are de-
scribed in a supplement to that.'report, which has been printed, and is pub-
lished in the yearly volume of the Association.

   43. The long-period tides, shown in §§ 28, 29 of this supplement, that
is to say, the lunar monthly (elliptic), the lunar fortnightly (declinational),
the solar annual, and the solar semiannual, were calculated in consequence

of the astronomical anticipation of the existence of such tides indicated in
the general schedule of § 2 of the first Keport. There is a mistake in the

argument printed for the lunar monthly, which has been pointed out to me

by Mr. Eoberts. It ought to be (ff--or) t, instead of a t. The error produces
scarcely a sensible influence on the calculations which have been made, and

it is easily allowed for.

   44. The " luni-solar fortnightly shaUow-water (synodic) tide " is a tide
the existence of which was suggested by Helmholtz's theory |of compound
sounds (§§ 24, 25 of first Report). The harmonic analysis consequently
applied to discover it has proved it to be very sensible both at Eamsgate
and Liverpool ; and has shown that in each station it gives highest average
level at the times of neap-tides, and lowest average at the times of spring-
tides. Its amount for Eamsgate (§ 28) is a tenth of a foot above and below
the mean level. Its amount at Liverpool is rather less, being only seven-
hundi'edths of a foot above and below mean level, as will be seen later.

    45. It will be seen that the lunar declinational fortnightly and the solar

(declinational or meteorological) semiannual present no agreement with
astronomical theory. The solar is of more than twice the amount of the

lunar. The lunar is so small that it may be merely a result of errors of the
tide-gauge. The solar semiannual (seven-hundredths of a foot above and
below mean level) giving highest average level Feb. 14 and Aug. 15, seems

too large to be not genuine ; but it cannot be astronomical, or there would
be a corresponding lunar tide.

    46. The solar annual (referred to in § 10), as shown by the calculations,
(Eamsgate, year 1864, being '13 of a foot above and below mean), is cer-
tainly much too large to be attributable to the eccentricity of the earth's

orbit, and the time of its maximum (Sept. 21) does not at all siiit the astro-

nomical theory. Its origin (as well as that of the semiannual?) is in all
probability meteorological. The Liverpool observations for 1857-58 show a

greater difference (-36 of a foot above and below mean level) ; and time of
maximum average height, Oct. 20.

Progress after date of Mr. Roberts's Svjjplementary Report.

47. The deduction of the hinar and solar semidiurnal and diurnal tides

from the Fiji observations (§§ 26, 38), which is no doubt practicable, is a

Amathematical problem of considerable interest.  good deal of work towards

. it has been performed by Mr. Eoberts since the date of the conclusion of his

Supplementary Eeport. The plan followed has been simply a direct applica-

tion of the method of least squares, as in § 28, and it has been carried out

so far as the formation of eleven simple equations for the determination of

eleven unknown quantities, viz. :
133 REPORT--1870.

1 height of mean level.

4 coefficients for lunar diurnal tides.

2,,  ,, solar diurnal tides, corresponding to the time of year

when the observations were made.

2 coefficients for lunar semidiurnal tides,

2 ,, ,, solar semidiurnal tides.

  11
    48. The labour of solving these equations by directly calculating the de-

terminants would be very great ; and the obvious method of successive ap-
proximations which renders the solution of the equations of § 28 very easy

is not obviously applicable in this case, because iu this case the equations

have not the characteristic property* exhibited in the equations of § 28, that

the coefficient of one of the unknown quantities is comparatively large, and

the coefficients of all the others small in each equation, so that each of the

unknown quantities is approximately determined by one alone of the equa-
tions. It is probable that some algebraic artifice wiU be found to reduce

within moderate compass the labour of solving the Fiji and other similar
sets of equations, and so give a useful practical character to the harmonic

analysis for short series of tidal observations, continued through broken

periods. But the most for the N atiu-al History of the Pacific tides that could

be expected from the results of so limited a series of observations as that

which we have from the Fiji islands is much less than can be had with ease
by the method already worked out for Eamsgato, Liverpool, and Bombay,
when observations made continuously through long periods are available.

Accordingly, on learning from volumes of the United States' Coast Survey,
which I received last November, that self-registering tide-gauges had been
established by the Government of the United States at various stations both
on their East and on their West coasts, I immediately applied, on the part
of the Committee, by letter, of date Nov. 19, 1868, to Professor Pierce,
Superintendent of the Survey, for a series of trustworthy observations of Pa-

cific Tides. Through his kind compliance with my request a year's tide-

heights, taken from the diagrams, executed by a tide-gauge at Fort Point,

California, reached mo last April, and were immediately put into Mr. lioberts's
hands to be reduced on the same plan as that which we have followed for the

other stations.

   49. Besides the work on these observations, we have had on hand the

calculation of additional terms from the Ramsgate 1864, the Bombay, and
the Liverpool 1857-58 observations, and the complete harmonic reduction

--ah initio of Liverpool observations for the two foUowiug years all of which

is now nearly finished. The ability, industry, and intelligence A\ath which
Mr. Eoberts has performed the work, and directed assistants, when practi-

cable, have been highly satisfactory ; and I trust that the large amount of
results obtained in consequence will justify amply the expenditure of labour
which it has cost. As some of the most important results have only reached

me from Mr. Roberts within the last few days, I have not found it prac-

ticable to attempt to put them into a form in which the details could be fully
explained to this Meeting. The resultsf themselves are given complete in
the file of letters and tables which accompanies this Report.

   * Depending on the condition that the time through which the obserrations are con-

    _

tinued either is approximately one complete period or an integral number of complete
periods, or is very great in comparison with the period of each constituent tide,

                       TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.      123

   The Exeter Report coueludes with remarks on :
      I. Eetardation of times of spring-tides after new or full moon, and

                 deductions as to retardation of earth's rotation.
      II. Diurnal tides (or constituents having approximately 24:^ for period).

            I. Times of Spring-tides after Full Moon ami New Moon.
   50. Dr. Thomas Young gave earlier than Airy, and probably first of all,

the dynamical theory that retardation of times of spring-tides after the times

of full and change implies friction. The results now presented by the Com-
mittee verify the anticipation that there is much retardation in every sea.

A few more years of patient work at harmonic rediiction, and some sets of

good observations from places in the China seas, Antarctic sea, and Pacific,
will afford means of directly estimating the loss of energy from the earth's
rotation, and will confirm the evidence which Professor Huxley and the

geologists, for whom ho speaks, find so hard to accept, that energy is being

dissipated too rapidly to leave credible any thing approaching to so great
drafts on time as they have been accustomed to make.

                                              II. Diurnal Tides.

  A51. not hitherto explained characteristic of North-Atlantic stations is

absence of diurnal tides large enough to be discovered except by scientific

analysis. The diurnal components are very conspicuous in the Bombay and

Fort-Point tides, especially the Fort Point. That one of the components of
lunar and solar diurnal tides whose argument is yt, is very large for Fort

Point. Hence, considering that that component, being partly due to moon
and partly to sun, gives a thoroiujlily true theoretical method for comparing the
sun's and moon's masses, by using a series of nine years' observations, it wiU
in all probability give a somewhat accurate practical result. As to the mag-

nitudes of the diurnal tides in different localities, it is to be remarked that
their smallness on the North-Atlantic coasts is irregular, and has not yet been
explained dynamically. Their largeness in the Indian Ocean, the China

seas, and the Pacific is regular, but makes the tidal phenomena much more
complicated than those we know best. The tides in those seas are commonly

designated as " irregular." That designation results from a confusion of
terms, " irregular" being used as if synonymous with complicated. The
truth is that the tides on the European coasts of the Atlantic are irregularly
simple ; those in aU other seas are comparatively complicated, but regular
and explicable.

directed towards a full scientific analysis of the tides of Liverpool ; but it has

included also as much as could be reached in the way of analyzing observa-

tions on the tides of Kurrachee supplied by Mr. Parkes, and on the tides of

" observations at Port Point, by hourly ordinates, is in progress, in pursuance

" of your request under date of May 27, and will be sent in a few weeks.

" For our own purposes we have as yet only read off from the traces the

" high and low waters, and prefer to use for the general discussion the results

" of nineteen years.

" Prof. Thomson at first asked for only one year ; the first year proving

*' fragmentary, we read and sent an additional year. The observations now

" in preparation wiU bo pretty complete.

" I shall bo much surprised if you can get reliable constants out of even

We" two complete years.  will endeavour to pro\'ido for the reading of the

" hourly ordinates for the whole scries, and will furnish you copies, if you

" find it necessary to have more than the additional year, which we shall

" send you soon.

    " I have received the enclosed [preceding] letter from the U. S. Coast
" Survey. I have completed the computation of the hourly heights for
" fourteen days for Fort Point, and have compared them with the actual

" observations. The agreement is remarkably good, the maximum discre-
" pancy not being more than three inches, if the actual mean level for each
" day is used, instead of the mean level of the year. The larger differences
" shown sometimes, when the annual mean level is reckoned from, are clearly

" owing to the abnormal state of the atmosphere at those times. Some of the
" elliptic diurnal tides are probably sensible for Fort Point and Kurrachce.

--" In the computation of the heights for Fort Point the following tides were

" omitted, the whole of the long-period tides, and also the semidiurnal X

M" [cvection] and y. [variation] and quarter-diurnal S [Hclmholtz luni-solar

" quarter-diurnal]. The maximum effect of the latter three does not exceed

" 0-06 ft. I consider the agreement very satisfactory. I expect to have the
" heights for Kurrachee for 29 days completed by Monday, and which I
" think wiU be satisfactory to Mr. Parkes. I have completed those series of

M" Ramsgate not included in our first Report ; the S (Hclmholtz quarter-

" diurnal luni-solar) tide is 0-33 ft., which is a Httle larger than what I
" should have expected from the corresponding Liverpool component. At
" Fort Point and Kurrachee it is scarcely, if at aU, sensible, the analyzed
" values for each place not exceeding 0-02 ft. I have made no comparison
" for Ramsgate, as the differences will in aU probability resemble those of

*' Liverpool already compared, although not differing to quite so great an
" extent.

for Fort Point out of " even two complete years " observations, and the un-
doubtedly approximate attainment of that result by Mr. Roberts, from one
year only, which his letter indicates.

   53. The funds at the disposal of the Committee have not sufficed to
emploj' calculators to push forward the work as energetically as the Report

to the Exeter Meeting recommended. What has been actually done has been

done entirely by Mr. Roberts, with only some slight assistance of a compa-
ratively mechanical kind in the way of preparing tables and forms for

calculation.

  --The following is his own statement of the work done for the Committee ;

§§ 54-70. Statement hj Mr. E. Roberts of work performed by him for the
       Tides Committee, from the Exeter Meeting till August 6, 1870 (including
      also the results of the analysis of the second yearns obsei'vatioTis at Kur-

        rachee, obtained since tJie Liverpool Meeting).

54. The diagram sheets of the Liverpool tide-gauge promising to give as

good results as can most probably be obtained from any system of self-

registration at present in use, were selected for further reduction and ana-

lysis. Two years' observations following the year whose results arc con-

tained in the Report for 1868, §§ 31-34, have been reduced and analyzed in
a similar manner. The results agree very satisfactorily with those of the

preceding year. The mean height of the water for the last two years is

slightly in excess of that found for the first year. In addition to the six

Kscries, S, M, L, N, & 0, already defined, three others, representing the

solar diurual (declinational) tide, whose argument is (y-- 2»/), called hereafter

for brevity P, and the two components of the solar elliptic semidiurnal

--tides (R and T), whose arguments are 2 (y--^ii) and 2 (y |jj)» were also

included. The solar elliptic semidiurnal tides require a period of two years

for their evaluation, by the method we have hitherto followed. The hour-

angle for the commencement of the second year was taken as twelve hours

in advance of the hour-angle assumed for the first year. As the two years

commenced on the same day of the year, the error involved in this assump-

tion is only 0°'25, a quantity which may be reasonably neglected in the

Aanalysis of these tides.  Table extending through one year has therefore

been used in the composition of the series, and the years 1857-58 and

1858-59 combined for the determination of one value, and 1858-59 and

1859-60 for another determination.

55. Referring the fictitious stars to their true positions at the commence-

ment of each year, by correcting the assumed hour-angles (the same table of

hour-angles having been used for the three years) by the difference between

the true and assumed places, and neglecting all terms which are very small

and not theoretical tides, we have the following sets of values :

nents. Meteorological indications were also forwarded by J. Hartnup, Esq.,

P.R.A.S., of the Observatory, Birkenhead, for the same period.

57. Tables of the foregoing nine series of analyzed tide-components were

made, giving the heights due to each, and ·were computed for every few

degrees of hour-angle. On account of the magnitude and quick variation of
Mits tide-components, the
                               series was computed for every degree of hour-

angle, which allowed the interpolation for the fraction of the degree of hour-

angle to be done with very little labour. All terms involving multiples of

Mthe same hour-angle were included in each Table ; thus the Table con-

tained the heights due to R,, K^, Eg, R^, R^, and R^, and the S Table those

Kdue to Rj, R^, and R^. The Table contained the heights due to Rj and R^.

The tide-components affected by the variation of the inclination of the moon's

orbit were corrected according to the equilibrium theory. The tide-com-

Mponents so affected are the lunar semidiurnal (R^ of  series), the lunar

diurnal declinational (R, of series), and the lunar and solar diurnal and

Ksemidiurnal (Rj and R^ of series). The first was thus presumed to vary

as the square of the cosine of the inclination of the moon's orbit to the earth's

equator, and the other three as the square of the sine, assuming in the case

of the combined lunar and solar tides (K) that the ratio of the tide-generating

forces of the moon and sun were as 2 to 1. It was supposed that these as-

sumptions would represent these tides very fairly. The zero of reckoning of

the lunar diurnal (declinational) tide was also corrected for, on account of

the retrogression of the moon's node causing an oscUlation on the earth's

equator, of the intersection of this plane with the plane of the moon's orbit.

KThe zero of the tides is similarly affected ; but as these are combined tides,

the zero was assumed to be nearer the intersection of the lunar orbit than

that of the solar in the ratio of the analyzed semidiurnal lunar and solar tides

(3 to 1). This inequality can be included in the regular analysis by intro-

ducing terms involving the period of the revolution of the moon's nodes, and

requiring a series of observations extending through a period (about eighteen

years) of their revolution for the evaluation of the tide-components,

58. Tn order to eliminate signs in the Tables (which greatly facilitates the

summation of the different tide-values in the computation of the tide-height

at any moment), the amplitude of each tide has been added, throughout each

Table, to the calculated heights for the stated hour-angles. An example of

each kind of Table is here given, from which wUl be more readily understood

what has been done. The following represent the values of the height (h)

of the tide, being the smaller component (L) of the elliptic semidiurnal tide,

due to the revolution of the moon's perigee. The heights are computed for

every ten degrees of hour-angle (H.A.). The first Table gives the height as

computed from the formula 7i=R2 cos (2Mi--e2)=0-56ft.x cos (2n<--14S°-85).

In the second the value of R^ has been added to each value of h. The limits

--of the first Table are H-R^ and R^, and in the second 2R2 and 0.

128 REPORT--1870.

In the first Table the values of h represent the height of the tide due to

this component, referred to mean sea-level (A^, of analyzed series) ; in the

second Table they are referred to a fictitious level, R^ feet (0-56), below the

mean level. Supposing the value of aU the amplitudes of the tide-factors to

be so added throughout the whole of the Tables, the resulting correction to

--the summation of tide-heights found for any time will be A^ SE,. This

method gets rid of all signs and renders the work of the calculator much

lighter.

   59. The true hour-angle of each of the fictitious stars was then found for the
commencement of the series of tide-heights proposed to be computed (1869,
April 24** O"" Greenwich mean time). Lcven-ier's places of the sun and
Hansen's places of the moon have been used throughout these reductions.
Each hour-angle was then found in its proper column in the Table of hour-

angles formed at the commencement of these reductions, and which can be

found within a small fraction of a degree in a Table extending through 369
days. The consecutive hour-angles in the Table will be the correct argu-

ments for the heights for 1869, April 24^ 1^, 2^, &c. The height (/i) was

then taken from each Table in succession, using the true hour-augle as found

above for argument. The sum of the nine values of h thus found, together

with the correction A^-- SE., will represent the height of the water above the

datum-line at first chosen, neglecting the long-period tides, wliich for Liver-

Apool (§ 63) were found to be very small.  series of heights for every hour

of the day for 13 days was thus formed and compared with the heights taken

from the diagram-sheet (§ 56), and the difi'erences taken. The average dis-

crepancy was about -j^ foot and the maximum 2 feet. The difi'erences

showed considerable regularity of disagreement ; and it appeared probable

that the tide-components, varying with the inclination of the moon's orbit,

did not vary strictly according to the law of the equilibrium theory. It was

thought advisable to reduce another year for the determination of the law of
change, and a period of 369'' S^, commencing 1866, January 23<* 0'', was

chosen for this purpose. This period gave very nearly a minimum inclination

of moon's orbit to earth's equator, whilst the first year (1857-58) gave nearly

a maximum value. The results of the dcclinatioual tide-factors obtained from

the analysis of this year were not very diff'erent from what would have been

obtained from the values for the previous years according to the equilibrium

theory, but nevertheless indicated that these tides varied to a less extent than
what that theory gave.

    TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.  129

     This year's results were incorporated with the previous three years and

 new tables, using average values, formed, and the heights recomputed and
 again compared with a similar although somewhat improved result to what

 had before been obtained.

    61. It appearing probable that a closer approximation to the movement of
the moon than what is given by a moan motion, including the motion of her
perigee, would give a closer agreement between the actual and the calculated
heights, it was thought advisable to extend the schedule of arguments (§ 2).
Accordingly the terms depending on the two next largest perturbations of the
moon (the evectlon and variation corrections) have been included. The argu-

--ments of the components for the evection semidiurnal tide are2(y g<r-t- 4nr-- jj)

-- +and 2(y fi-- |ra- ;j), and for the variation semidiurnal tides 2(y-- ry) and

+2(y--2ir r]). One of the components of the variation tide, having the

same period as the solar semidiurnal, is necessarily included in the results of

the analysis which we have performed for the latter. Our new terms are

therefore reduced to three. Series of hour-angles of these arguments (named
for brevity \, y, and n) have been formed and added to our Table. The
period chosen for the \ and f series was 349"* 22'', and for the /j. series
369'^ S"", each period eliminating in the summation of each the effect of the
lunar semidiurnal tide. The results of the four years' analyses of these tides

are :

of each being nearly of the same value. This eomponcnt has been included

in the calculations of the actual heights.

63. The above four years' observations have been analyzed for the long-

period tides, but tlie resulting amplitudes were very small ; and there was so

little agreement between the epochs as deduced from the several years, that

they were deemed not satisfactorily evaluated. The solar annual tide, how-

ever, gave a moderate agreement, the mean value for the four years being
0*36 foot, and the epoch 238°*5, which places its maximum about Novem-

ber 19                           but this is i)robably due in the main to meteorological causes.  The
                              ;

differences between the calculated and actual heights, after being corrected

for the quarter-diurnal luni-solar tide, also showed that the synodic fort-

niglitly tide of i)eriod 2(0* tj) is of sensible value; and the present non-

agreement between the analyzed values of the four years may be owing to

the influence of wind, barometric disturbance, and also of instrumental errors

extending over considerable periods, and seriously affecting the daily means

which are the basis of reduction for the long-period tides. If the pimfied

daily means had been corrected for barometer «&c., as in the discussion of the

Port-Leopold tide observations by Capt. Sir J. C. Ross (Phil. Trans. 1854), it

is very probable that more satisfactory results would have been obtained.

November 1, of the recorded heights as registered by the Manora self-regis-

tering tide-gauge, with the heights calculated from the tide-components de-
termined from the analysis of the first year's observations (§ 67). In the

calculation of the heights the mean level of the water as determined by the
observations of the whole year was used. The difference between this mean

level and the mean of the twenty-four houi-ly heights (corrected for all sen-

sible lunar influence) for each day is also given. The effect of this is to

--greatly improve the differences (C R). The following tide-components were

--omitted in the calculations : the whole of the long-period tides, and the

MSHelmholtz shallow- water quarter-diurnal tide        ; likewdse the solar semi-

diurnal elliptic (R and T) and the lunar diurnal elliptic tides (J and Q), tlie
values of which have been obtained since the heights were computed. The

computations are for load time.

TIDAL OBSERVATIONS,  149

    72. The fact noticed, that one of the variation-tides has the same period
as the solar semidiurnal tide, would be of great importance for tidal theory
were it not that its magnitude must be so small as to be scarcely sensible.
According to the values of the perturbations in longitude and radius vector,
due to variation shown in Hansen's Tables, the equilibrium value of the solar
semidiurnal variation-tide would be only about -^ of the equihbrium value

+of the 2(y--2a r]) variation-tide. The dynamical value of the latter tide,

shown in § 61 above, is only about a quarter of a foot above and below the
mean level. Hence it cannot be expected that the smaller component should
sensibly influence the observed results obtained by the analysis which had
been undertaken for the solar semidiurnal tide. The close agreement between
the results, both for amplitude and for epoch, of the chief component varia-

--tion-tide, 2(y 2(7 -f- J?), for the four years, is so satisfactory that the evalua-

tion is undoubtedly genuine in this case.

   73. The same may be said also of the Helmholtz luni-solar tide. The

effect of this tide is of great practical importance, especially in respect to

navigation. It is well known that, generally in harbours, estuaries, and
channels, the tide rises faster than it falls. The harmonic analysis of this
phenomenon was given first, I believe, by Airy: see for example, his formula

for Deptford in his article " Tides and Waves," Encyclopaedia Metropolitan a,
Helmholtz's admii-able explanation of the grave and acute notes heard ac-

companying two loud musical notes sounding simultaneously, referred to in
§ 24 of the Committee's First Eeport, contains a perfectly general statement
of an extremely simple character, which, mutatis ynutandis, is applicable to
the tides in every case in which the range of rise and fall is sensible in com-
parison with the mean depth through any considerable area of sea or channel
influencing them. The application of this theory, for example, to a tide of
10 feet whole range from mean level, considered as the resultant of two
simultaneous tides of 5-feet range, suggests immediately the harmonic terms
(such as those calculated by Aiiy for Deptford) which express the phenomenon
of the rise being more rapid than the fall. The same theory applied to the
spring-tides (which are the resultant of the lunar and solar semidiurnal tides

M'hen they agree in phase) and to the neap-tides (which are the resultant of

the same components when they are opposite in phase), shows that the terms
expressing deviation from the simple sum of the two chief harmonic terms must
be greater than the sum of the deviations about the time of spring-tides, and
less than the algebraic sum of the contrary deviations about the time of the

neap-tides. Helmholtz's general statement again suggests instantly the
harmonic terms proper to express the anticipated result. In this case it is

the second of the two " shaUow-water tides " indicated in § 24. The deter-
mination of this term from observation, promised at Norwich, 1868, as an
early undertaking of the Committee, has now been accomplished, both for
Liverpool and Eamsgate, by Mr. Roberts, in consequence of his having for
some time been baifled by discrepancies in his investigation of the Liverpool
tides showing an approximately quarter-diurnal period when all the com-
ponents previoiisly evaluated were properly put together to express the tides
on the days selected for the comparison between theory and observation
described above. The period of this new component is a quarter of the har-
monic mean of the mean solar and mean lunar days. Its amplitude (that is,
half the range from lowest to highest) is about f of a foot at Liverpool and
g of a foot at Eamsgate. Both it and the previously found shallow-water
components are greater in proportion to the chief tides at Eamsgate than at

Liverpool ; this no doubt is due to the great extent and shallowness of the

British Channel and German Sea, as compared with channels tkrough which

the ocean affects Liverpool.

   74. The search for astronomical long-period tides has up to this time given
only negative results. In each case a genuine annual tide seems to be indi-

cated, but the negative results as to the lunar fortnightly (declinational) tide
and monthly (elliptic) tide forbid us to regard either the semiannual or the
annual as a truly astronomical tide. Both are probably due to meteorological

causes. The cause which I have previously suggested (§ 1 0), that is, " water
received into the sea by drainage and the melting of ice, and from the di-
rect fall of rain into it," would tend to raise or lower the mean level almost
simultaneously over the whole sea. There are two other meteorological

--causes which probably have very sensible effects, difference in distribution

of atmospheric pressure over the earth, and difference of temperature in dif-

ferent oceans. These three causes may be sufScieut to explain the results of

observation collected in the following Table :

and those coasts placed generally in the same position with regard to know-
ledge of the tides as those of England. The same may be said of the ports of

Australia, China, &c., as well as of western America.
    78. But while admitting the practical sufficiency of Mr. Parkes's analysis

for the purpose of establishing processes for the computation of tide-tables, the
Committee believe the further application of the harmonic system to be very
desirable, from its more searching character and the facility with which it

exhibits the smaller variations of level independently of theory.

    79. Whether it will, for practical purposes, supersede existing methods of
prediction, wiU probably depend upon the relative amoimt of labour re-
quired for the calculations ; but there is little doubt that it will at any rate

facilitate the correction of existing formulae.

    SO. For more strictly scientific purposes its superiority to any existing
method of analysis is indisputable, and, considering the relation of tidal

variations to many physical questions at present unsolved, its importance

from this point of view is great.

   81. It may fairly be expected that the Admiralty will cooperate in carry-

ing on a work which, whether in its scientific or practical bearings, is of

such fundamental importance for navigation.

  On a new Steam-power Meier. By Messrs. Ashton a7id Storey.

             [A communication ordered to be printed in extenso in the Transactions.]

Tee extent to which the employment of steam-power in our varied in-
dustries, and as furnishing means of locomotion, has become a necessity,

and the desirability of attaining the utmost economy in the consumption
of fuel, render it a matter of the first importance to be able readUy to ascer-
tain the exact amount of power developed by steam machinery in a given
time. Hitherto approximate estimates, founded upon the results of iso-
lated tests and experiments, or calculations based upon the diagrams pro-
duced by ordinary indicators, have furnished the sole means for the ascer-
tainment of the duty of (or, in other words, the power developed by) steam-
engines in all cases where the said power has been subject to variations.

   These indications have been taken at intervals of at least one day, and
in most cases of a much longer period, and have simply been registrations
of the amount of power developed during the one stroke or the two or
three strokes performed by the engine during the time of indication, the
great variations in the load upon or the speed of the engine, and in the
pressure of the steam, occurring in the intervals between the indications
being practically disregarded ; and even when a correct diagram has been
obtained, the power developed during the indication has and can only be
ascertained with any degree of exactness by a tedious process of mea-
surement and calculation. The patent power-meter and continuous indi-
cator, on the contrary, not only measures the power developed during a
single stroke of the engine with as great a degree of exactness as the best
indicator hitherto in use, but also registers the result of the said measure-
ment with as great a degree of exactness as it is measured, thus avoiding
the errors arising in the operation of measuring and calculating the area
of the ordinary diagram ; and, what is of more consequence, this measure-
--153 . REPORT 1870.

ment and registration are effected with reference to each and every stroke

of the engine, and furnish a means whereby a correct judgment may be

formed as to whether there has at any time been a want of due observance

of economy in the use of fuel, or whereby the comparative merits of dif-

ferent kinds of fuel or of lubricants may be tested. In cases where power is

supplied to tenants, this instrument furnishes the only means whereby the

power so sujjplied may be accurately measured. And in the case of marine

engines, in a rough sea it is the only instrument that can give any reliable

information as to the power exerted by the steam-engines, inasmuch as it is

frequently impossible to obtain consistent diagrams by the ordinary indicator

during a whole voyage across the Atlantic. The steam-power meter and

continuous indicator, as its name implies, shows at all times the measure

of the power developed by the steam-engine to which it is applied, and

registers the aggregate of that power during any required period of time.
The instrument consists of a small double-acting indicator-cylinder l^in.

in diameter, each end of which is connected by means of a pij^e with the

corresponding end of the steam-engine cylinder. These connexions are

made as short and direct as possible. The piston-rod of the indicator

carries a long toothed pinion, c, which revolves loosely on the rod, but is

held endwise between two screw-collars. This gears into a toothed wheel,

d, which is connected with and drives the indices. At the lower end of

the long pinion, and fixed to it, is a hght wheel, b, called the integrating

wheel, having a smooth rim with a rounded face. To the upper end of

the piston-rod is attached a spiral spring, which offers a resistance to

the free movement of the piston in its course from the middle to either

end of the indicator-cylinder; on a short horizontal shaft is mounted a

circular disk, e, whose face is constantly, but not forcibly, pressed against

the rim of the integrating wheel. This is effected by means of a light flat

spring bearing against the end of the shaft on which the disk-wheel is

Amounted.  small cog-wheel,/, is keyed on the disk-shaft, and is con-

nected by a rack, or any other suitable means, to the cross-head or other

convenient reciprocating part of the steam-engine, or a small pulley, /, may
be keyed on the disk-shaft, round which is wound a cord, whose two ends

are attached to the cross-head or other convenient reciprocating part of the

steam-engine, being carried thence round loose pulleys above and below.

By either of these means the reciprocating motion of the steam-engine is

converted into a rotary motion of the disk acting in alternately opposite

directions. When there is no pressure on the piston of the steam-engine,

and accordingly none on the piston of the indicator, the integrating wheel

is so adjusted that the point of contact of its rim with the disk shall be at

the centre of the disk, that being the zero-point of the instrument. When

the pressure of the steam is admitted, so as to act on the piston of the in-

dicator, the integi-ating wheel traverses in consequence from, the centre

towards the circumference of the disk, the distance traversed being pro-

portionate to the pressure of the steam on the piston. tSuppose, now, the

cross-head of the steam-engine, and with it the disk of the instrum'ent, is

moving, such motion will be communicated by the disk to the integrating

wheel, and through it to the indices. The motion so given to the indices

during this stroke of the steam-engine is proportionate to the pressure of

the steam on the indicator-piston during that stroke. Let it now be sup-

posed that the stroke is finished and a return movement is commenced,
the disk will now rotate in the opposite direction ; and if the steam acting
upon the piston were pressing in the same direction as before, the inte-
153
--154 REPORT 1870.

grating wheel and indices would necessarily go backward. If, however,

the steam, as is usual, acts on the opposite side of the piston when the
piston's motion is reversed, the integrating wheel will be moved to the

opposite side of the centre of the disk, so that the integrating wheel and
indices wiU be moved in the same direction as before, and the quantity
of motion through the receding stroke of the engine will again be propor-
tionate to the pressure of the steam on the piston during that return
stroke. Here, therefore, is provided a means of moving the indices during

each stroke of the engine through a space proportionate to the sum of tlie
moments of pressure exerted during that stroke, or, in other words, a
means of indicating the amount of jiower developed during that stroke.
The relative proportions adopted for the several working parts in the pre-

sent instrument are such that each division on the dial represents one
thousand foot-pounds of duty for each circular inch of the piston of the

steam-engine. These proportions may be varied. Thus the parts of the
indicator may be so arranged that the readings on the dial shall represent
the number of horse-powers given out during any required period of time.
By closing the tap connecting one end of the indicator-cylinder with the

corresponding end of the steam-engine cylinder and opening the small
drij)-tap to admit air freely to the disconnected end of the indicator-cylin-
der, the indicator is rendered single-acting, and will show the manner
of working and the amount of work done by one end of the steam-engine

cylinder alone. By opening the closed taps and closing the open ones the
indicator is reversed, and the manner of M'orking and the amount of work

done by the other end of the steam-engine cylinder ascertained. In the
case of a non-condensing engine, the integrating wheel would not return to
the centre of the rotating disk during the back or return stroke of the en-
gine, by a distance proportionate to the back pressure opposing the motion
of the steam-engine piston, the effect being that, during the return stroke,

the integrating wheel and indices would be wound back by an amount of
motion proportionate to the loss of power by back pressure. Also, if the

valves of the engine are opened or closed too early or too late, the integrating
wheel will be seen to move backward at the beginning or end of each stroke,
thereby showing work undone by an amount of motion proportionate to the
loss of power by such " cushioning " or too late admission of the steam or
too late exhausting of it. The instrument can be so constructed that paper

diagrams may be taken indicating the action of the steam in each end of the

steam-engine cylinder, or in both ends conjointly.

           Report on the Action of the Methyl and Allied Series.

             By Benjamin W. Richardson, M.D., F.R.S.

In my last Report to the Associatiou I classified uuder five heads the vari-

ous substances the action of which I had studied in a phj^siological point of
view, viz. the Hydrides, Nitrites, vUcohols, Chlorides, and Iodides of Methyl,

Ethyl, Butyl, and Amyl. In my present report I have retained the same

order of classification of organic substances, so as to ensure a systematic and
156 REPORT--1870.

steady progression, adding in due place what has been attempted in research
with other organic bodies.

   The matter I have to communicate in the present Report I shall place
under three heads, which shall indicate the lines of inquiry I have aimed to
carry out. I propose, first, to bring under review some of the work of tlie
past, with such improvements upon it as have been since elicited by experience
and experiment; secondly, to narrate the results of new researches with
certain substances which have not before been tried by the physiologist, in
respect to their action on the body ; and, thirdly, to submit some conclusions
deduced from experiments relative to the general physiological action of

certain of the more active agents that have come before me for study.

                                                                                    PART L--REYIEW.

Out of the list of compounds reported upon in previous years, I select for

review nitrite of amyl, bichloride of methylene, methylic ether, and

hydrate of chloral.

This selection is made because all the substances named have been found

--to have, in their application, a practical not less than a scientific value.
   Nitrate of Amyl. In 1863 I first reported to the Association on this che-

mical substance, the nitrite of amyl, treating then purely on its physiolo-

gical properties, and venturing nothing in respect to its employment for the

relief or cure of disease. In the following year, however, I made a further

advance, and at the Meeting in Bath in 1864 I was able to state to the As-

sociation the true place of this nitrite as a physiological agent and as a remedy

for disease. Ishowed then that its great virtue lay in its power of removing

muscular spasm                                                                      for I had detected that beneath the action which it promi-
                                                                                 ;

nently calls forth, the excessive action of the heart and apparent excitement,

there is another and more permanent condition produced, viz. a temporary

paralysis of muscle and a suspension of all the outward manifestations of life

which, in Batrachians, could be sustained without actually destroying life.

These observations led me to point out the importance of employing the

nitiite in order to control spasms, and especially to meet the spasmodic disease

tetanus, commonly called locked jaw, over which I inferred it would have

a direct controlling power.

In course of time this suggestion for the application of the nitrite for

the relief of acute spasm came into practice, Dr. Brunton, of Edinburgh,

leading the way by administering the remedy, with marked success, for the

reUcf of what is called atlgina pectoris. Further experience has fully

supported the introduction of the remedy, and in the past year there has

been signal advance. In December last Dr. Anstie had recourse to the

nitrite for the relief of angina, with the result that the sufi'crer passed (I use

the author's own words) " from agony into a state of perfect repose." Dr.

Earquhar has also reported that in an instance of terrible pain from spasm

of the bowels, where the nitrite was administered, the patient expressed that
he " was transformed from agony to heaven in a moment." Dr. Leischman,

Dr. Hadden, and Dr. H. Thompson have borne similar testimony to the value

of the agent. But the most striking example of the action of this potent
remedy has been recorded in the ' Lancet,' in April of the present )'oar, by

a most experienced and learned practitioner, Mr. Foster, of Huntington.

Mr. Foster had the opportunity of applying the nitrite in the disease

tetanus, for which I recommended it in 1864, to a man who suffered from
ON THE ACTION OF THE METHYL AND ALLIED SERIES.  157

 this extreme maladj, following upon the infliction of a wound. The spasms

 were so severe that the man is described as having " been rolled up hke a

 rigid ball." Five drops of the nitrite were put on a pocket handkerchief

 and inhaled, with the immediate effect of lessening the spasms. On each

 return of the spasms the agent was assiduously administered, and by this
 means the spasms were held in check until the ninth day, when the patient
 had inhaled an ounce of the fluid. In this example there was complete
 recovery ; and Mr. Foster reports that of seven similar cases of tetanus which

 he had previously treated in thirty-four years' practice all had died. Ho

 had met with no success until he had recourse to the nitrite of amyl.

    You will excuse me of any charge of pride when I express the gratification

 I feel at these singular results, and you will allow me, 1 hope, to explain

 how obliged I am to this Association for the sup])ort it afibrded me when I

 was first engaged on this subject of research. The satisfaction rests, first,
 on the practical facts I have named ; but a second satisfaction is that the facts
 have shown the worth of scientific experimental inquii'y, as preliminary to
practical application, for the certain and systematic relief and cure of human

 sufi^eiing.

    Nitrite of amyl was not introduced into use as a remedy against spasmodic

 diseases, including tetanus, by any mere accident. It was introduced on
 method of pure scientific investigation ; its properties as a remedy were
 discerned and estimated, stated before it was applied for the cure of disease,
and the results obtained were the simple expositions of the predictions made

concerning its value.

    In the course of the year I have studied the best means of keeping and
administering this active nitrite. At the Meeting at Norwich I proposed
that it should be kept in absolute alcohol, but I find that when it is exposed

long in this way it undergoes change, by which its efiiciency is to some

 extent impaired. I find also that diluted with alcohol the vapour of the
nitrite does not pass off with sufficient rapidity to secure good action. At
the same it is not well to use it undiluted, as that implies the measurement
of it by drops or minims, a plan which is neither safe nor convenient.

To meet these difficulties I have made for inhalation an etherial solution, or
tincture, in which five grains of the nitrite of amyl are contained in one
drachm of absolute ether.

    I have seen no occasion to modify the view expressed at the Meeting at
Bath, and again at the Meeting at Exeter last year, that the nitrite of amyl
produces its effect by its paralyzing-action upon the nerves which govern
the contraction of the blood-vessels ; and I take it that this explanation of
its action explains, by the reverse, the mode of action of those agents which
it neutralizes, such as strychnia, and of the influence which excites the disease

known as tetanus. It seems to me that these agencies either excite extreme

action of the nerves which keep up the contraction, or paralyze the counter
nervous supply which causes dilatation of vessels, and that the conviiLsive
movements induced by siich agents as strychnine are due to removal of
blood by contraction of vessels in a manner analogous to that convulsion

--which follows free abstraction of blood.
    Bichloride of Methylene. Bichloride of methylene during the past year

has grown much in favour, and in some of our large medical institutions has

replaced chloroform altogether. I regret, nevertheless, to have to report
that two deaths have been recorded as following upon its use. Both cases
wei-e pecidiar. In one the subject was, in truth, so near to death at the
time of administration that he was apprised by the surgeons and the able
158 REPORT-- 1870.

administrator of the bichloride, Mr. Marshall, of the risk he incurred. In

the other case the fatal event did not happen at the time of administration,

but five minutes afterwards, and even after return of consciousness, a

result entirely new, as far as I know, in the history of anaBsthetic practice.

I am unable altogether to account for this result ; and the less able because

the patient was never brought fairly under the influence of the narcotic, and

received less of it than I have often inhaled in experiment.

    On the whole, the rate of death, taking these two cases as hondfide examples

of death, has been, relatively, very small, certainly not more than one in

ten thousand                           administrations                                                                   and  I  am  assured    by those  who administer
                                                                                                                      ;

the bichloride most frequently that continued practice only increases their

confidence in it.

    Dr. Junker, who has now administered bichloride of methylene over two

hundred times for the most formidable operation in surgery (ovariotomy),

expresses to me his belief that the agent is ijractically free of danger when it
is obtained pure, and when ordinary care is taken in administering it ; and
other administrators have sent me reports equally favourable. Tor my own

part I have simply allowed it to be adjudged upon by independent observers,

retaining the opinion I first advanced in respect to it, that it is safer than

chloroform, but not absolutely safe ; that, like chloroform, it belongs to a

dangerous family of chemical bodies, and that it is still the business of the

experimentalist to search for an anaesthetic which shall be equally practical

--in application and, at the same, better in action.
   Methi/Uc ether. In two previous Eeports I have noticed methylic ether,

and have explained that as a safe anaesthetic agent it has no superior. I have

endeavoured consequently to utilize it during the past months, and have ad-

ministered it twenty-seven times with success, in cases of surgical operation,

in the human subject. Mr. Coles, Mr. Spencer Watson, Mr. Gregson, and

others have also administered the anaesthetic with successful results. The

object of these applications of methylic ether has been to supply a perfectly

safe anaesthetic that would narcotize very rapidly, but with sufficient effect to

allow the surgeon to perform short and painful operations. For this purpose

the ether acted remarkably well ; in seventeen instances sufficient insensibility
was induced to enable the operation of tooth extraction to be performed with-

out pain, and in all these instances recovery to perfect consciousness occurred

within a minnte. There was also observed another fact, of which more

anon, that while the persons who were subjected to the narcotic expressed

and felt no suffering from the operation they underwent, they retained so

much consciousness as to respond to requests made of them, and to converse

during the whole period they were under the anaesthetic influence.

    I have not pressed forward this method of annulling pain, because methylic

ether cannot be rendered sufficiently stable for practical daily use. Being a

gas, it is necessary either to condense it by pressure, or to saturate ethylic

ether with it under the influence of cold. The first of these methods is

distrusted as unpleasant to the operator, and the second is uncertain, because

with elevation of temperature the light methylic vapour is diffused and lost,

so that common ether alone remains.

    The physiological action of methyHc ether deserves nevertheless to be kept

in  mind                               first, becaiise  of  the                                                          power   it  possesses  of  destroying  sensibility
                                    :

before it destroys the consciousness ; and, secondly, because of its safety. So

safe is it that an animal made to sleep with it into unconsciousness may

remain breathing it for twelve minutes without dying; and if allowed,

apparently, to die, may be recovered by artificial respii-ation so long as seven

  minutes after tlie cessation of the respiration, i, e. after what appears to be

   actual death.

     Chloral Hydrate.--It will be remembered by many that at Exeter
  last year the substance called hydrate of chloral was first discussed in
  this country. The news had recently arrived that the distinguished Lieb-

  reich, of Berlin, had cUscovered in this hydrate a powerful narcotic ; and
  our associate, Mr. Daniel Hanbury, F.E.S., having fortunately brought
  a specimen of it to Exeter, the Physiological Department of the Biological

 Section deputed me to test the substance (with which Mr. Hanbury kindly

 supplied me) by direct experiment, and to report upon it during the
 sittings of the Section. Eesponding to the wishes of the Section, and ably
 aided by Dr. Kilburne King, of Hull, Dr. and Mr. Shapter, of Exeter, and
 other friends, I was enabled to draw up a report that has been published in
 the ' Transactions,' and which gave a fair and impartial estimate of the values
 of the new remedy. The notice of this Beport, and of the discussion upon
 it in the general and scientific papers, created the intensest interest in the

 medical world. After my return to town, 1 had frequently from fifteen to

 twenty communications a day respecting chloral hydrate. At the request of
 members of the medical profession, I visited Birmingham, Bradford, York,
 Norwich, and other large towns in the kingdom, to demonstrate the action
 and application of the remedy, while in London I gave series of similar
 demonstrations. These efforts made the hydrate widely known in this
 country ; but the inherent good qualities of the compound itself were its
 best and surest recommendation. Hence it settled in favour as it increased
in popularity, and it has now become an instrument for the cure of disease
scarcely second to any in the hands of the physician. If I were to say that
a million of persons' in sleepless pain had been made to rest quietly and
painlessly under its benign influence, I should certainly not overrate the

extent of its usefulness.

   It is satisfactory to feel that the conclusions we arrived at last year have

been, on the -whole, thoroughly sustained by the practice that has ensued.
I deduced, from the experiments which we performed, that the hydrate was

not an anaesthetic in the common sense of the term, but that it sometimes
induced a stage of hyperassthesia ; this has been confirmed by many who

have foUowed in the same method of inquiry. I inferred that the hydrate
could not be expected (as had been expected of it) to supersede the volatile
ansesthetics as a means of relieving the pain of surgical operations ; and this
view has been fuUy confirmed by the results of several attempts to make it
replace the ordinary anajsthetics. I inferred that the compound reduced the
animal temperature in a signal degree ; and this view, fully confirmed by the
after experiments of Demarquay, has met with the general acceptance of
observers. I was led to conjecture, from what I had seen of the influence of
the hydrate in controlling strychnine tetanus, that it would probably not be
a cure for acute tetanic spasm ; and this view has been supported by the
results of practice in many cases of tetanic disease. Lastly, I was led to
maintain that the hydrate, if it took position, would do so as the rival only
of the old and time-honoured organic compound, opium ; and this view has
been once more fully confirmed.

   It may be accepted, I think, on the whole, that chloral hydrate, which to
us thirteen months ago was an absolute novelty, is now a fixed and proved

instrument for the cure of disease. It is readily and cheaply manufac-
tured, and its administration is easy. That it wiU not be found to possess
all the virtues which have been attributed to it in its early days is certain

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

that, when calmly and impartially compared with opium and the deri-

vatives of opium, it will rank as subordinate to its ancient and trusted
rival is probable ; and that it will be found less potent in relieving acute
physical pain than in calming the senses and in producing deep, but not

insensible sleep, is also probable. -But whatever modification of thought may

occur in regard to it, it is an established messenger between science and
disease, and must henceforth find a place in the pharmacopoeias of all civilized

peoples.

PART II.--RESEAECH WITH NEW AGENTS.

Passing from the review of the past I come to the work of the present,

myadding it to the classified list of  last Report in the order in which its

parts naturally come.

                       Hydrides.

Two additional hydrides have been studied, viz. the hydride of caproyl or

--hexyl, and the hydride of oenanthyl or heptyl.
   Hydride of Caproyl or Ile.vyl. Of this hydride, known commonly as light
petroleum spirit, C,, H,3 H, a pure specimen is before us ; it has a fluid

density of -669, a vapour-density of 43, taking hydrogen as unity, and a

boiling-point of 154° F. It is insoluble in water. It is not an unpleasant

vapour to inhale, and it produces sleep when it is inhaled very much as

chloroform does. The second degree or stage of narcotism, stage of excite-
ment, is prolonged, and vomiting is not uncommon during this stage ; when
the third degree of narcotism is reached there is perfect insensibility. The

fourth degree is attended with great muscular prostration, but recovery

from the narcotism begins in from three to four minutes, and is usually

rapid, no injurious effects being left behind. The temperature of animals

(pigeons and rabbits) during the full influence of this ana3sthetic falls from

two and a half to three degrees Fahrenheit. When a warm-blooded animal,

narcotized with the hydride of hexyl, is allowed to sleep to death in the

vapour, the death, as from chloroform, is almost imperceptible, it is so

gentle ; the respiration ceases first, but the heart soon follows in cessation

of action. After death the lungs are found to be slightly blanched, but the

heart contains blood on both sides. The vapour in no way modifies the

coagulation of blood, but the colour of the venous blood is rendered darker

than is natural, and the arterial blood is also darkened. The corpuscles are

not visibly changed.

I should consider the hydride of caprojd in the light of a narcotic which

acts by reducing the respiratory process of change of blood rather than by
direct influence of its own on the nervous centres. In the absence of chloro-

form it might be used as a substitute for it ; and had it been tried pUre in the

early days of anaesthetic research, it would possibly have obtained position

Weover ether.  ncfcd not, however, consider it at the present time any

--further, as we have better agents at our command.
   Hydride of (Enanthyl or Hepiyl. This hydride, which may be obtained

in a pure form by careful fractional distillation from some petroleum oils, is

composed of C^ H^, H. It has a specific gravity of -709 at 60° E., a vapour-

density of 50°, and a boUing-point of 201° E. It has a rather agreeable

odour, and is easily inhaled. Administered by inlialation, it produces a stupor

with some insensibility, much muscular tremor, and a reduction of tempera-

tiire, which in birds may be brought down to not less than five degrees. It also

reduces the action of the heart, while it quickens the respiration. It darkens

arterial blood, but does not interfere with the process of coagulation of blood.
                                          ON THE ACTION OF THE METHYL AND ALLIED SERIES.                       161

It is distinctly negative in its narcotic effects, and, from what we now know

of it, is not a practical narcotic.

    In order to render more complete the research with the hydrides, they
were administered by subcutaneous injection in several experiments. Intro-
duced into the body in this manner, they were found to be practically negative
in their action, a dose, amply sufficient to produce stupor and death by

inhalation, being inactive when the agent was carried into the organism
by the hypodermic method. Moreover the local effects were so exceedingly
slight, that they are unworthy of mention. The insolubility of the fluids in

the blood and their negative chemical action can only account for these results.

                                             Alcohol Series.

    In previous Reports I have dealt with the physiological action of the
alcohol series from mcthylic alcohol up to amylic alcohol. In the present

Ecport I bave dealt with certain alcohols in which a new element is in-

troduced, viz. sodium alcohol, or sodium ethylato, potassium alcohol, or po-
tassium ethylate, and sulphur alcohol, mercaptan. Regarding these sub-
stances, the sodium and potassium alcohols, are instances in which the
metals sodium or potassium replace one atom of the hydrogen of the
radical of the alcohol, while, in respect to the sulphur alcohol, the sulphur
replaces the oxygen of the alcohol.

                                          Alcohol.      Sodium alcohol.  Potassium alcohol. Sulphur alcohol.

   The object of this research was to ascertain what would be the effect of
introducing a new element, by substitution, into a substance, alcohol, the phy-
siological action of which was understood.

 --Sodium Alcohol, or Ethylate Sodium. This ethylate is prepared by

treating absolute alcohol with pure metallic sodium. So soon as the
sodium comes in contact with the alcohol there is free escape of hydrogen,
and the addition of sodium has to be continued until action ceases. I find

it good to increase the temperature gradually as the action declines. At
last there is obtained a thick, nearly white product, which is a saturated
solution of sodium alcohol. From the solution ethylate of sodium crystallizes

out in beautiful crystals.

^The composition of sodium ethylate is ^-nt                              0. When it is brought

into contact with water it is decomposed, the sodium becoming oxidized by

the oxygen of the water to form sodium hydrate, and the hydrogen of the

water going to reconstitute the common or ethylie alcohol.

The change of ethylie alcohol into sodium alcohol transforms it from an

irritant to a caustic. Laid on dry parts of the body the sodium ethylate

is comparatively inert, creating no more change than the redness and tingling
caused by common alcohol ; but so soon as the part to which the substance

is api^lied gives up a little -\^'ater, the transformation I have described above

occurs                                    caustic soda  is produced  in contact with the skin  in  proportion  as
                                       ;

water is eliminated by the skin, and there proceeds a gradual destruction

of tissue, which may be so moderated as hardly to be perceptible, or may be

so intensified as to act almost Uke a cutting instrument.

 --Potassium Alcohol, or Potassium Etliylate. Potassium ethylate is made

in a similar manner as sodium ethylate, viz. by bringing pure potassium

into contact with absolute alcohol. The action of the potassium is much

1870.                                                                                              M

more energetic than sodium. I prefer to immerse the potassium under the
alcohol in a small glass bell, from which there is a tube to allow of the escape

of the liberated hydrogen. When saturation is complete, a thick and almost
colourless fluid is formed, from which the ethylate may be obtained in solid

crystalline state. Exposed to water the potassium ethylate is transformed,
as is the sodium ethylate, into ethylic alcohol and bydi-ate of potassium.

The composition of the potassium alcohol is - ^^ \ 0-

The action of this compound on animal tissues, living and dead, is the

same as that of the sodium compound, but is more energetic.

  --Practical Uses of Sodium and Potassium Alcohols. -I do not as yet see the

means of applying readily these two active alcohols for internal administra-

tion, but I can predict for them a very extensive application for external

purposes. They are most potent caustics. In some cases they may be

employed to destroy, rapidly, such morbid growths as are not favoui'able for

excision by the knife. In many cases of cancer they will prove invaluable,

and will, I believe, exert a direct local curative influence. Injected subcuta-

neously into morbid growths, they would so quickly destroy them that the

action might have to be conducted while the body was under the influence of

an ansDsthetic.

In being applied direct to the sensitive unbroken skin, I find that their

destructive action is less painful than would be expected. I have made with

both compounds a superficial eschar on my arm, with no more pain than a
slight tingling warmth. What is more, when pain is felt, it may be checked

quickly by dropping npon the part a little chloroform, which decomposes the

alcohol, converting it into a chloride salt, and an ether of which I have yet

to speak.

    Again, I find that these alcohols dissolve some of the vegetable alkaloids.

Thus opium may be dissolved in them, and a solution of opium in caustic
alcohol is made directly by mere addition of the narcotic to the caustic spirit.
Practical men will see the advantages of combinations of these alcohols with
narcotics. The practice opens the way to one of the greatest needs in medi-

cine, a sure, rapid, and painless caustic.

The caustic alcoliols may be used in combination Avith local anaesthesia

Afrom cold.      part rendered quite dead to pain, by freezing witli ether

spray, could be directly destroyed by the subcutaneous injection of caustic

alcohol, a practice very important in the treatment of poisoned wounds,

siich as the wound from the bite of a snnke or a rabid dog. It is by no
means improbable that some cystic tumours may be cured by the simple

subcutaneous injection of a little of these fluids, after destruction of sensi-

bility by cold.

   Potassium and sodium alcohol, added to the volatile hydride of amyl,

dissolve in the hj'dride and produce a caustic solution. When this solu-

tion is applied to the skin, the evaporation of the hydride takes place,

and a layer of the caustic substance is left behind. This application would

prove very useful to the surgeon in many cases of disease.

The action of the cthylates on the blood is extremely rapid and marked.

The red corpuscles are brought into solution, and there forms (quickly in

some cases) an almost instant crystallization of blood ; the crj-stals are
acicular, and spread out in arborescent filaments. The arborescent appearance

is identical with the crystallization of the cthylates themselves in a thick fluid,

but the smaller radiant crystals are due, I believe, to the crj'stallization of

the crystaUoidal matter of the blood-cells. They are singularly like the
ON THE ACTION OF THE METHYL AND ALLIED SERIES.  163

  crystalline forms whicli have been described, since the time of Dr. Pdchard
 Mead, as occurring in the blood after infection by the poison of the viper.
 One other peculiarity in the action of the ethylates on blood is worthy of
 notice : while they seem to attack and dissolve the red corpuscles vigorously,

 they act with comparative slowness on tlio white corj)usclos, so that wo may

 often see a white corpuscle iloating uninjured in a sea of red colouring-
 fluid previous to crystallization, and even adhering to the crystalline points

 after crystallization.

     The ethylates jwssess also powerful antiseptic properties, so that even
 nervous matter, which of all animal substance is most jjrone to decomposition,
 can be long kept in good preservation in the presence of them. I have by
 me, in bottles, specimens of the brain of sheep which illustrate this point.
 Specimen 1 is inclosed in common air, and is a decomposed fluid mass.
 Specimen 2 is inclosed in the same volume of air, with twenty grains of
 absolute alcohol : this specimen is decomiioscd. Specimen 3 is inclosed in
 the same volume of air, with twenty grains of the ethylate of sodium ; it
remains firm, of perfectly natural colour, and free of decomposition. The

--specimens have been now under observation for fifteen weeks.
    Sulphur Alcohol, Mevcaptan. The sulph-hydrate of ethyl, sulphur alcohol,
or, as it was originally called by its discoverer, Zeise, " mercaptan,"' is made
 by saturating an alcoholic solution of potassa with sulphuretted hydrogen,
 and then treating the solution with iodide of ethyl. In its jjure state it is a
whitish fluid, and of so ofli'ensive and penetrating an odour that it cannot,
until it is diluted with common alcohol or ether, in both of which it is freely
soluble, be comfortably employed in experiment. It is insoluble in water.
Its specific gravity is -832 at 70° F. ; its boiling-point is 135° F., and its
vapour-density, by side of hydrogen, is 31. It is nearly insoluble in water,
but imparts to water its peculiar odour, and can be distributed freely through
it if combined with alcohol.

    In order to experiment with mercaptan, it is necessary to dilute it either
with absolute ether or alcohol ; a solution containing one per cent, is sufli-

 ciently active.

   When blood is acted upon by mercaptan no change of colour is produced,

neither is the action of peroxide hydrogen on blood influenced by its pre-
sence. The corpuscles are made slirunken by it, but are not destroyed, their
form changing into ovoid, with the same production of truncated cor-

puscles which I described in my last Eepoit as belonging to the action of

ordinary alcohol.

   When mercaptan is cautiously inhaled the physiological eff'ects are most

peculiar. I found, by a direct experiment made on myself, that the vapour is
nowise irritating, but that systemic eftects are very speedily pronounced. There
is desire for sleep, and a strange unhappy dreamy sensation, as if from some
actual or impending trouble. This is succeeded by an easy but extreme
sensation of muscular fatigue ; the limbs feel too heavy to be lifted, and rest
is absolutely demanded. There is at the same time no anaesthesia and no
sign of intoxication. The pulse is rendered feeble and slow, and remains in
that condition for one or two hours. In time all the effects pass off", and no
unpleasant symptom remains. Active motion in the air very quickly gives
entire liberation from the efl^ects of the agent.

   The same effects are produced on the inferior animals. Frogs exposed to
the vapour pass slowly into sleep, and if the inhalation be sustained, there
is complete arrest of the acts of respiration and circulation, followed by
arrest of movements of the limbs. In this condition the animals lie to all.

                                                                   m2

intents dead, except that there is no contraction of the pupil ; indeed the
pvipil is dilated, and the lens stands out perfectly clear and bright. They

may be left in tliis apparently lifeless state for half an hour in the vapour

without danger. Taken out, gently washed with water, and left in the oi^en
air at 60° to G5° F., they invariably show signs of muscular movement in an
hour and a half or two hours ; then they recommence to breathe, next the
heart begins to beat, and in a short time they recover perfectly, precisely as
if they were awakening from the torpor of cold.

   Respecting this recovery there is observed a phenomenon which to me is

entirely new. It is the case with all narcotic and paralyzing agents which
I have tested, that they produce paralysis of the voluntary muscles before
they cause paralysis of the muscles of respiration and the heart. Also in
rccoverj' from the narcotic state, the heart first lights up, then the respira-
tion, and finally the muscles of voluntary power. But under mercaptan
the reverse obtains, the voluntary muscles lose their irritability last and
regain it first during recovery.

   The pai-alyzing action of mercaptan on muscle suggested to me that it

might be useful for the arrest of tetanic convulsion, but experiment gave a
negative to this hypothesis. It is true that the action of strychnine can be
modified by this agent, but nothing more can be done with it. The passive
muscles, so soon as the respiration is paralyzed, pass into slow but firm

 cadaveric rigidity.

   A point of great physiological interest attaches to the mode of elimination

of siilphur alcohol from tlie living body. Insoluble in the blood, and at the

same time volatile, it makes its way out of the economy mainly by respira-

tion, conveying an odour which is identical with the odour of the breath in

some forms of disease. It would be out of place for me to enter on the ques-

tion of disease here at any length; but I must not refrain from suggesting to
physicians that a new field of inquiry is open to them in investigating the
(]uestion of the presence of sulphur compounds in the air expired by their pa-
tients. In disease the breaking up of the albuminoid textures is attended
within the body by the formation of volatile sulphuretted organic compounds,
and the circumstance of the detection of such compounds in expired air

would, I think, prove a most useful stiidy in the art of diagnosis. When we
know how minute a proportion of sulphur alcohol will produce muscular de-
pression and feebleness of the heart, we may fairly infer that the forma-

tion of sulphur compounds spontaneously within the body would account for

many examples of excessive temporary prostration, for the cause of which
we have as yet no satisfactory explanation.

   The mode of action of sulphur alcohol appeared to me at first to be

through direct interference with the oxidation of the blood. I believed it to
be an agent which arrested the natural oxidation of the blood by contact,

but I am now not decided on this point. The substauce inflicts no im-

portant structural lesion on the blood or tissues so long as it can find exit
 from the body ; but Avhile it is present it sustains a peculiar action on the
nervous organism, not leading, I think, to any modification of structure,
but causing exhaustion or arrest of motor power and disordered cerebral

 manifestation.

    I have spoken thus far only of the action of sulphur alcohol, but it has

some practical value to which, in a line or two, I may refer. It is an anti-

septic, but gives to the matter it preserves an objectionable odour, wliich is

be applied externally, a useful agent. If it be true that sulphur compounds
are of service in the treatment of so-called zymotic diseases, this alcohol
would be a ready remedy of the sulphur class.

                        New Eeseaech on the Exhtls.

Prom studying the action of sulphur alcohol, I thought it well to pass to

the ether of the sulphur series, p'^ -rr^ \ S, sulphide of ethyl. This ether,

which is the analogue of the common rectified ether of the oxygen series, is

made by bringing sulphide of potassium into contact with chloride of ethyl.

It is a whitish fluid of offensive odour. It boils at 19-1:° P., and its vapour-

density is 45. It is slightly soluble in water and in blood. Although

disagreeable to breathe, it can be administered by inhalation like common

ether, and it produces, in like manner, sleep ; the action of it is slow in com-

parison with that of common ether, but the recovery from its effects is

Aquick, much quicker than from mercaptan.  very minute dose is sufficient

to narcotize ; a quarter of a grain, diffused in fifty cubic inches of air at 60°,

will narcotize frogs ; and when these animals are thus rendered insensible

they may be left in the narcotic vapour, with all evidences of life lost, for

periods of twenty-five minutes to half an hour without risk. Placed in the

open au', the animals begin to move again in one or two minutes, the muscles

of the Hmbs regaining their irritability sooner than the heart and the muscles

of respiration.

   On rabbits, guineapigs, and pigeons sulphide of ethyl acts directly as a

narcotic and anaesthetic. In pigeons it reduces the animal temperature four
degrees at the fourth stage of narcotism, and the muscular prostration is
intense; at the same time the danger of death, if due care be taken, is

slight.

    If four-fifths of a grain of the sulphide of ethyl be ejected subcutaneously
into the rabbit, the odour of the substance is detectable within a few seconds
in the expired breath, but no general effect is produced. Narcotism can
nevertheless be caused by the subcutaneous method.

  A number of experiments were carried out in order to determine whether

the sidphide of ethyl could be successfully employed to counteract the action
of strychnia, but the results were not of a character to lead to the idea that
the sidphide is an antidote for strychnia.

   The vapour of sulphide of ethyl inhaled from a solution of one part in
twenty of alcohol is less diagreeable than might be assumed. It causes, if
the inhalation be cautiously carried out, but little irritation, and the influence
of it as a narcotic is very much like that of sulphuric ether. It induces
much less muscular exhaustion than mercaptan, and it gives to the breath an
odour which lasts some hom-s after the inhalation has ceased.

                                            Bromide of Ethyl.

   Bromide of ethyl, or hydrobromic ether, C^ K. B^, was introduced as an
anaesthetic by the late Mr. Nunneley of Leeds in 1849. The ether is made by
distilling four parts of powdered potassium bromide with five parts of a
mixture containing an alcoholic solution of strong sulphuric acid, one part of
the acid in 96 of alcohol. The ether is a rather pleasant fluid to inhale. It
boils at 104° P. ; it has a specific gravity of 1-400 ; its vapour-density is 54.

   Mr. Nunneley up to the time of his death held this fluid to be the best
and safest of anaesthetics ; and in an interview I had with him shortly before
166 REPORT--1870.

his death, he begged me to study it and notice it in this Report.

   I therefore undertook the task, and with a very excellent specimen of the
ether prepared by Messrs. Eobbins, chemists, I subjected it to a fair test by
the side of other anaesthetic vapours, and found it to be a rapidly acting
and safe agent. In doses of fifteen minims, diffused in 300 cubic inches of
atmospheric air, at a temperature of G0° to 66° F., it induced profound
narcotism in one minute and thirty seconds, both in pigeons and rabbits ; and

in the human subject one fluid drachm administered by Junker's inhaler was

effective in entirely removing consciousness of pain after two minutes' in-
itiation. The effect of the ether is singular in that, under its use, very little

muscular or nervous excitement precedes the narcotism ; indeed there may

be said to be no second degree of auassthesia from the bromide, but a direct
transition from the first to the third degree. The third degree is, moreover,
free of spasmodic effort, and quickly passes, if the inhalation be continued,
into the fourth degree of general muscular prostration. The temperature
of the body is reduced in the fourth stage full .3° F. Eecoverj' from the
deepest narcotism produced by it is perfect in from four to five minutes,
and in no experiment did I observe any symptom of danger.

   I am thus able to state that Mr. Nunncley's opinion respecting hydrobromic

ether was sound ; and could the ether be obtained as reachly as chloroform,
and were it as stable a body, I should say that it would be a real improve-
ment on chloroform. Its physical qualities, its low boiling-point especiallj', are
good recommendations ; and the facts that it causes no convulsion, and that
recovery from its influence is very rapid, are equally in its favour. The
objections to it, irrespective of cost of its production, which is great, are that
its vapour provokes during its inhalation a local dryness and irritation of
throat, easily bearable but not pleasant, and that on being kept for a
time and exposed to air it undergoes change, so that its vapour becomes
actually irritating to the mucous membrane. These faults, minor though
they' be, would, I think, prevent hydrobromic ether from coming into
general use as an anaesthetic ; its good qualities deserve nevertheless to be
remembered, and the scientific world is much indebted to our late Associate
for the labour he introduced into his research and the results he obtained.

                                                   Triethtltc and Teimethtlic Ethers.

"When chloroform is made to act on sodium or potassium ethj-late, or on

sodium or potassium methylate, a chloride of the metals, whichever be

used, is formed and an ether. If an etbjdate be acted upon an ethyl ether is

obtained                                       if  a methylate  be  acted  upon a methyl ether.  The first of these

ethers is supposed to be homologous with an ether of a triatomic alcohol

caUed triethylic, C, 11,^ O3, and I have therefore called it triethylic ether ; the

second is homologous with trimethylic ether, C^ H^^ O3 : specimens of both

these ethers are on the table.

   Triethylic ether is a heavy aromatic fluid, boiling at 174° F., and having a
vapour-density of 71. It passes into vapour very slowlj', unless the tempera-

ture of the air be considerably raised, and hence at ordinary temperatures

the action of the ether is very faint when it is administered by inhalation.
But in making the ether I observed that the first distillation yielded as a pro-

duct a volatile cMoride, of very delicate aromatic odour, and without excep-
tion the most perfect general aua;sthctic I have ever employed or seen. This
compound, of which there is a specimen on the table, is so quick in action that

it may be dUutcd with half its volume of absolute ether, and still yield a vapour

of sufficient narcotic power to be available for long or short operations. Exposed

to the vapour, pigeons aud rabbits glide into the deepest sleep of unconscious-
ness without a movement, and in a state more strikingly resembling natural

sleep than any other condition ; the insensibility may be sustained for two

hours without the least apparent danger. Within the last ten da3'S, after

first inhaling the vapour myself, I administered it to the human subject,

while Mr. Brudenell Carter performed an operation on the eyeball for the cure

of strabismus. The action in this instance was simply perfect ; the patient
subsided into what seemed a natural sleep, without a convulsive or disturbed
movement; the operation was performed without the faintest manifestation
of sensation, and recovery was perfect in one minute after the vapour was
withdi-awn*. The experience of the action of the narcotic I have here

described is so good that I could not let it pass silently ; but I am not yet sure

whether the application can be brought into general use. The production of
the fluid is troublesome and costly, and after a time, if exposed to the air,
it loses its efficacy. Tn brief, it is not a homogeneous substance, and is

therefore open to the objections against compound fluids mentioned in my

Report at the Norwich Meeting. The part played by the heavy ether is
excellent, in that it equalizes diff'usion and prevents pungency of vapour
aud I may be able, by further research, to improve the method, or to be guided
by what I know of it to some new and better advance ; but this I must leave

for future research.

   The tnmeilijjUc ether of which I have spoken is a much lighter fluid than

the triethyhc ; it boils at 140° F., and has a vapour-density of 53 ; but the

odour of its vapour is not agreeable, and although it produces safe auajsthesia,

it is not perfect in its action.

PAET III.--PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.

   In conducting a lengthened series of experiments such as I have been

engaged in carrying out during the past year, many observations, incidental
to the work in hand, naturally come before the mind, and to one or two

observations of this character I would, for a moment, direct attention in

--closing the Report.
    Consciousness and common sensation. The metaphysicians, in treating of
conscious and unconscious states of mind, have long taught that there may

be periods of consciousness with an absence of common sensibility. The

truth of this inference is sustained by physical inquiries. In a previous

Report on Amylene I pointed out that the vapour of amylene, while it

destroys sensation, does not destroy all conscious acts; and in my later obser-

vations on the action of methylic ether the same fact has been more perfectly

elicited. In several cases where I administered the ether for removing pain

in surgical operations, the patients, when quite insensible to pain, were so

conscious that they were able to  obey every request asked  of  them                      and in some
                                                                                       ;

instances were even anxious to reason, stating that they knew what was going

on, and arguing that they were not ready for the operation because they were

sure they should feel pain. Nevertheless in this state of mental activity they

were operated on, and afterwards, while remembering every incident, were

firm in their assertion that they felt no pain whatever during the operation.

One patient who sat for the extraction of two teeth selected the tooth to be

168 REPORT--18/0.

first extracted, putting her finger to it, and afterwards rearranging her
position for the second removal. To the looker on it seemed in fact as
though no change in her life had occurred, yet she affirmed that she was

sensible of no pain whatever ; and several other less striking hut hardly less

Wesingular examples came before me.  may then, I think, faiiiy assume

that in course of time wo shall discover manageable and certain auffisthetic

substances which will paralyze sensation only, leaving the muscular power

unaltered and the mental httle disturbed ; and we gather from this either that

in the cerebral hemisphere there is some distinct and simple centre of

common sensation which may be acted upon by certain agents without

involving all the cerebral mass, or that the peripheral nervous matter may be

influenced without involving the other portions of the nervous system.

On the whole, I incline to the view that the action of those agents which

destroy pain before they remove consciousness is primarily on the peripheral

system ; for we know, from the process of local anajsthesia, that it is easy

to destroy sensation at the extremities without destroying or even interfering

with consciousness, while those who have inhaled the vapours which destroy
common sensation before interfering with the mental condition, invariably

describe the experience of a numbness and insensibility in the extreme parts,

of the body.

   That which we medical men most require is an agent that shall ho easily

applied, and shall admit of being so applied generally as to induce

insensibility to pain with or without destruction of consciousness, as the case

before us may demand. There are many minor surgical operations for which

consciousness need not be destroyed, although pain ought to be ; there are
other operations in which the consciousness of the person operated upon is of

great service to the operator ; and there is a third class of cases in which it is

essential to suspend both sensation and consciousness.

   Now those agents which first destroy common sensation can always be

pushed to the extent of destroying consciousness, so that if we could get a
perfect agent of the kind we should have the full requii-emeuts in our hand.
Up to the present moment wo have been content with two classes of agents,

one which destroys consciousness and sensation at the same time, the other

which locally destroys sensation, and has no influence on the consciousness.

I look hopefully for a method in which, by means of a single agent, we
shall be able at will to suspend common sensation alone, or to exalt the
process into suspension of consciousness. When this object is attained,
with safety and facUity, the science of ansesthesia may be considered as

perfected.

 --Modification of action from physical constitution and construction. The

present series of researches have been sijccially interesting as showing more

clearly in detail the influeuce of physical constitution and construction of

Wedifferent substances in relation to physiological action.  take, for example,

the base ethyl, C., H., and trace out physiological action through its many modi-

Wefications of compounds.  begin with the hydride of etkyl, C^ H^ H, and

find it an insoluble gas which will produce insensibility if it be made to

exclude air from the lungs, but which is, in other respects, negative in action.

We pass to the hydrated oxide of etliyl, C., H,. (alcohol), and find a fluid

very soluble in blood, readily ditfusible through the body, and producing, when

given, in sufficient quantity, a prolonged narcotism,, with suspension first of

Wecommon sensation and afterwards of consciousness. .  turn to ethjd-ether,

C, H,,, 0, and discover a volatile fluid, soluble to a certain extent in the blood,

capable of being absorbed by the lungs, and having the power of producing
ON THE ACTION OF THE METHYL AND ALLIED SERIES.                     1G9

quick suspeasion both of sensation and consciousness. "We move to the

chloride of ethyl, C^ H^ CI, and learn that we have in it still a narcotic

capable of producing suspension of sensation and consciousness, like ether,

but with this diiference, owing to the introduction of the new element

Wechlorine, that active convulsive movements are superinduced.     turn

to the iodide of ethyl, C.^ H. I, to observe again a narcotic action, as with

ether, together with irritation and overaction of secreting glands, owing in

this instance to the introduction of the element iodine. "We take up the

bromide of ethyl, C^ H. Er, to discover an excellent narcotic, but one which,

owing to the introduction of bromine, causes dryness of mucous membrane.

Lastly, we turn to nitrite of ethyl, C^ H, jS'O^, and experimenting with it

learn that with the introduction of the element nitrogen we lose much of

narcotic action and gain an agent which, being introduced into the body, re-

duces the sympathetic nervous power, lets loose the heart so that it can deliver

its blood into enfeebled vessels, allows excreting organs, such as the kidneys,

to pour forth an abundant secretion, and which, carried far enough, paralyzes

muscular action so efiectually as to overcome even tetanic spasm.

I point out these simple truths in order to indicate once again the correct

line of research in reference to all substances used as medicines. To commence

with a base and to follow the modifications of its action through the varied

compounds formed upon it, that, as it seems to me, is the only method by

which the physiologist can arrive at positive truth in his classification and

selection of remedies for the diseases that afflict mankind.

 --Direct action of wjents on nervous centres. The teachings of the last half

century have led us to the theory, now generally accepted, that all chemical

agents, in order to produce an effect on the body, must enter the blood and

be carried by it through the organism. It is ti ue that Dr. Wilson Philip

demurred to this, and showed that alcohol would infiuencc the heart imme-
diately when brought into contact witli the cerebrum ; and it is also true that

Dr. John Jones observed, in his experiments on young alligators, that the act

of respiration could be instantly suspended by applying hydrocyanic acid

directly to the medulla oblongata. Still the theory remained in force, the

argument being that the substances applied to the nervous matter were

Myra2udly absorbed into the circulation.  own observations on nitrite of

amyl have, however, assured me that one agent, at all events, may act directly

on nervous matter. To prove this, an animal was allowed to sleep into death

in the vapour of bicMoride of methylene, and all the blood-vessels leading to
and from the heart were firmly tied, so as to cut off every possibility of

circulation of blood into or out of the heart ; then with a subcutaneous

injecting syringe, through the o])tic foramen, five grains of nitrite of amyl were

introduced into the cavity of the skull, so as to bring the agent in contact with

the cerebral mass. Instantly the heart, which had continued pulsating,

ceased for a moment, and then recommenced action with the same ex-

treme rapidity as is observed in the living animal subjected to the influence

of the vapour of the nitrite. I repeated the experiment twice with the same

result, the rapid cardiac action continuing from two to three minutes in

each case. These experiments lead me to suggest that we have accepted

too readily the idea of the necessity of absorption of all chemical substances

for the production of physiological effects, and that we ought to go back to an old

subject of inquiry, the direct action of chemical and physical agents upon

nervous matter. When we irritate the extremities of a nerve, as, for instance,

when we inhale strong ammonia or particles of snuff, and excite muscular
action, or when we call forth sensation, as when we take in the odour of
170 REPOKT--isro.

flowers or musk, we never consider the question of absorption bj the blood,

but attribute the phenomena that follow to a superficial influence exerted upon
the periphery of nerve. The question is, whether with certain other agents

a more extended influence may not be exerted through the nervous struc-
tures so that the nervous centres themselves may be impressed and systematic

derangements be excited by the disturbance. If this be proved to be

the fact in respect to known organic bodies, such as nitrite of amyl, it may

be worth while to carry out the same line of inquiry in the investigation of

those obscure diseases which we attribute to minute particles of organic
poisons, and which are invariably heralded by symptoms indicating changes,

of function, at least, in the nervous centres that govern those organs by the
action of which the natural life of the body is sustained.

    In concluding this Report, I have once more to claim your indulgence for
all its shortcomings. I claim to be, as it were, a mere gardener in the field
of physiological medicine. The physicist and the chemist give seeds which
I and a few others plant in our domain. "We take the offering, try its value,

and then there follow accompHshed scholars and practitiouei's who join with

us in proving and establishing the practical results and benefits that are to
succeed upon the primary research. The labourers in the primary research
are not uufrequently forgotten for a time, as their followers gather their
produce and weave it into forms that attract and please the world. But our

satisfaction is none the less complete as we witness the develojjment of our

efforts, since the solid satisfaction lies, not in the promise of the sowing, but

in the proof of the reaping. I have thanked this Association many times for

having recognized the imjjortance of the primary exertion to which I refer, and

in thanking it once more I hold myself at myits disposition to continue at

tasks under its sympathetic and powerful influence. It is true that by what
is called private industry one may do much to advance any profession, if to
the advancement the mind be simply and sincerely devoted ; but when one
expends industry, as I have been allowed to expend it, by the direction of
this convocation of men of all sciences, the effect is tenfold in weight and
measure. The effort is accepted away from these meetings because it has
been accepted in them, and the science of medicine is strengthened because
she marches with the other sciences in mutual understanding and for mutual

progress.

    and G. J. Symons, Secretary.

In our last Report we reprinted the rules which had been issiied for the
guidance of observers, and we also exjiressed the opinion that a considerable

addition to the staff in several districts was desirable. This proposal was
approved by the General Committee at Exeter, and a small sum granted
towards the expenses which would be incurred.

    One of the districts very destitute of observers was Dartmoor, and thither

accordingly our Secretary proceeded, in order to obtain such further observers

as seemed requisite. In this he was on the whole very successful, as the
accompanying diagram shows more clearly than any explanation.

   Wliile upon this subject, your Committee may point out that if a corps of

amateur observers, sufficient for rainfall purposes, say, 1500 to 2000 in

number, is to be kept together, a regular and considerable number of new

ones must annually be obtained, to supplj^ vacancies produced by death aud
removals. Your Committee, being fully convinced of the great and increas-
ing importance of accurate registration of the fall of rain, will at all times
be glad to receive, through their Secretarj- (G. J. Symons, Esq., 02 Camden
Square, London), offers of as.sistance from residents in the less densely

peopled parts of the British Isles. The instrument now used is extremely

simple and inexpensive.
   Your Committee have always regarded the examination of the gauges in

use, of their positions, and the personal communication between their
Secretary and the various observers as a matter of the highest importance.

They have, therefore, much pleasure in announcing that upwards of one
hundred stations have been visited during the past year. The various sug-
gestions offered by the Secretary have been most cheerfullj' adopted by the
observers, who ofteu warmly express their approval of this inspection, both
for its own sake aud as tending to secure uniformity of practice, and to in-
creased esprit de corps among the observers.

    Pull details of the results of the examinations in 18(59-70 are given in

was as follows :

wards the collection of old observations. It is a most desirable object, and
without it our other work will not be complete ; but our Secretary has not

time for it, and we have not funds to provide a regular copyist.
   In our last Report^ we gave an analysis of the results of the experimental

gauges employed at Calne to determine the relative indications of gauges of

various sizes.

  We now give a similar discussion of the series erected to test the influence

of elevation above the ground on the amount collected. It had long been known

that gauges on buUdinr/s collected considerably less than those on the ground,

this branch of the inquiry having many years ago been examined with great
care by Prof. Phillips. As his experiments and results are printed in the

3rd, 4th, and 5th Reports of this Association, it is unnecessary here to give
more than a brief resume of the whole. Prof. Phillips had three similar
gauges, one placed in the gardens of the York Museum, one on its roof, and
one on a pole 9 feet above the battlements of the great tower of York
Minster. The heights of these gauges, the total amounts collected, and their

ratios are given in the following Table :

  Wc need hardly remark that, owing to the labour of ascending to the

top of the Minster, the observations were not taken daily, but about once a
month. The result of a series of calculations was to indicate that the nor-
mal rate of decrease was not very far from 3 \/ h, but that both the actual
amount and the ratios were dependent on temperature.

   The Calne experiments, of which we are now going to give a brief account,

differed from those of Prof. Phillips, both in their object and their details.
At York the object seems to have been to determine the causes of the dif-
ferent amounts collected ; at Calne it has been to ascertain the precise dif-
ferences, and the possibility, or otherwise, of deducing corrections whereby

observations made at various small heights above the ground may be reduced
to one common standard. Hence the gauges were mounted on posts, not on

roofs ; the greatest height was 20 feet instead of 210 feet, and the readings
were taken daily instead of monthlj^. It may be expedient, before proceed-
ing further, to illustrate by an example the necessity for this correction
(1) on account of its extent, (2) on -account of the very various heights at
which gauges are placed. Taking haphazard a single page of British Hain-
fall, which contains returns from 44 stations, we find just 22 different

heights, viz. :

they were purposely read only once a month, in order to ascertain if any

material difference would be detected.
   Gauges -whose mouths are level with, or near to, the surface of the ground

are always found to collect more or less of the soil surrounding them, which
is splashed up by heavy rain and coUeetcd in the gauge. Rain-gauges
are usually so constructed that very little, if any, rain which falls within
their receiving area shall splash out and escape. Hence it seems probable
that gauges nearly level with the surrounding soil will always collect the
true rainfall, jj?«s insplashing. As a means of eliminating this source

of error, another gauge, of the same pat-

tern as the others, was added to the series
in April 1865; it was sunk in a pit, the " '

depth of which was equal to the height of

the gauge, and with sloping sides, as in fig. 3.

By this means the receiving surface was

exactly level with the ground, and insplashing was impossible. This gauge

will be called the pit-gauge.

These, then, are the instruments wherewith, and the conditions under

Wewhich, the observations at Calne were taken.    may now introduce some

of the results, some only, for the observations are so voluminous and com-

plete as to be almost inexhaustible.

Table I. contains the total amount collected in each gauge in each month,

from August 1863 to December 1867, both inclusive.

Table II. contains those monthly totals converted into ratios, the amount

measured in the gauge wjiose receiving surface is one foot above the surface

being taken as unity.
    Table III. is exactly similar, except that the " pit-gauge" (fig. 3) is taken

as unity.

Table IV. contains the total fall in each year and in the whole period

also these values reduced to the ratios of the 1-foot gauge.

Table V. contains the 1-foot ratios, grouped according to months.

Table YI. contains the mean monthly values deduced from Table V.

Table VII. contains the mean monthly values deduced from Table III.

Table VIII. contains the monthly (1-foot) ratios for 1864 and 1865,

grouped according to the mean temperature of the days in each month on

which rain fell.

Table IX. is similar, but grouped according to the Jiygrometric condition

of the atmosphere on those days.
   Table X. is similar, but grouped according to the mean velocity of the

ivind*.

It is hoped that this series of Tables is so complete as to render lengthened

remarks unnecessary.

   "We have already referred to the pit-gauge, we may now point out its
result, viz. that in the winter it catches very much less than the one sur-
rounded by grass ; and that though in summer both catch alike, on the

average of the year the pit-gauge is 3 per cent, less than the " level," and

agrees almost exactly with the one whose orifice is 2 inches abo^e the

ground. This agreement of the "pit-gauge" and the "2-inch" seems

to show that the amount collected by gauges thus placed is correct. The
accompanying diagrams (Plate V.) show the mean monthly and annual

deficiencies therefrom of gauges at various heights above the ground.

   * In the formation of the last three Tables some calculations by Dr. Barter of Bath
have been very useful.
176 REPORT-- 1870.

   In order that tlie proportion which the altitudinal deficiency bears to the

total rainfall may be readily seen, the annual diagram represents, by light

shading, the actual fall at various heights above the ground ; the amount col-
lected by the "pit-gauge" is shown by the horizontal line of 1-000, and the

deficiency in the iipper gauges by the breadth of darker shading.

In the monthly diagrams, the variable breadth of this darker shading shows

the variation of this altitude correction with the seasons.

 --Probably the most I'emarkable features in the annual curve are : (1) its

rapid curvature, ?'. e. rapid increase in the amount of rain collected within

1 foot of the surface of the ground                                                                                                                         (2) the very shght alteration from about
                                                                                                                                                         ;

7 feet to 20 feet.

This would seem to show that the rainfall actually reaching the ground is

greater than what has hitherto been supposed, inasmuch as the majority of

gauges hitherto erected have their orifice about 1 foot above the ground, and

therefore collect, according to the results now before lis, about 5 per cent.

Zsss than the real rainfall reaching the ground. This result ajjpears so start-

ling that further experiments will be conducted on the subject.

   The difference between the curves of decrease in the various months is
very considerable, and sufficiently proves that the annual mean values are

not at all applicable to single months.

Tables A'lII., IX., and X. seem to show that the variation is in no way

dependent on the humidity of the air, but either on temperature or wind-

force, or possibly on radiation ; the present investigation does not reveal

which, inasmuch as the cold days, with rain, are usually windy ones.

Our duty in connexion with this subject is discharged by Tables VI. and

VII., which give (for 8-inch gauges) the means of deducing the fall, either

at the surface of the ground or at 1 foot above it, from observations of

gauges on pedestals or i)illars at any height less than 20 feet.

Perhaps it may be well to give an example. At Cockcrmouth there arc

two gauges, one G inches and the other 6 feet G inches above the ground ; in
the year 1SG9 they collected 4G-31 and 44-48 respectively: the corrections

from Table VII. are -9 GO and -920 ; then we have :

=Gauge inches above ground=4G-31-^-9G9 47-79=ground fall.

  ,, 6 feet inches ,, =44-48 -=--920 =48-34 =

Or if we require the 1-foot fall, then the corrections from Table VI. arc
1014 and -900 ; then we have :

=Gauge 6 inches above ground 4G-31-^l-014=45-07=faU at 1 foot.

,, 6 feet 6 inches ,, =44-48-r- -900 = 40-33=                                                                                                                                    ,,

This example was taken quite by chance, and the agreement being in both

cases within 1 h per cent., seems to sliow that the corrections are generally

applicable. But on this point we have at present no evidence.

The inquiry we have just been pursuing naturally leads to the considera-

tion of the best height ibr rain-gauges ; and, althougli a novel plan, we are

inclined to consider that, theoretically, the " pit-gango" is the best. Eut

there are several strong grounds of objection to it and to all gauges whose

Weorifices are nearly level with the soil.                                                                                                                  may mention a few :

1. They become more or less filled with leaves during the autumn months,

and their accuracy is thereljy vitiated.

2. They become buried under snow, and the melting snow runs unfairly

into them.

    3. la cases of exiremehj heavy rain they collect water running along
the surface of the ground, and sometimes become filled, at others float away

on the water.
   4. They are more liable to accidental injury, and to collect all kinds of

rubbish than if slightly elevated.
    5. It is evident, from the Tables, that an error of 1 inch in the heiglit of

a gauge near the surface is of as much importance as an error of 1 foot at a

slight distance above it.

   Moreover, it must be remembered that up to the present time not half
a dozen pit-gauges liavc been used, and that therefore their adoption would
involve the correction of all observations hitherto made.

   And that though it appears probable that the rainfall actually reaching the

ground is nearly 5 per cent, greater than what has hitherto been supposed, it
would be precipitate to accept it without further examination.

   As nearly half the gauges in the country are now fixed, with their receiv-

ing surfaces, 1 foot above the ground, it would appear desirable that this

height sliould be generally adopted.

   In several previous Reports we have given the results of elaborate inves-

tigations of the percentage of rain falling in the various months in diff'erent
parts of the Eritish Isles ; these Tables uniformly referred to decennial periods,

such as 1810-19, 1820-29, 1830-39, 1840-49, 1850-59. We ha%-e there-

fore recently completed another decade, and one of which the returns are

much more complete than for any of its preciirsors. The computations of the
mean montlily and annual rainfall during this period are in progress, but
they are so heavy that they cannot be ready for this Report, and may per-

haps not be completed for the next.
    \Ve give in the Appendix the usual detailed Tables of monthly fall at

about 300 stations during the two years 1808-69, but we defer any remarks
iipon them until the averages are ready next year.

   Your Committee cannot close their Report without drawing attention to

the remarkable illustration of widespread interest in scientific pursuits

afforded by the fact that there are now nearly 2000 persons in the British

Isles regularly recording the fall of raiii, and carefully watching any depar-
ture from its normal distribution. Of the utility of this work, in a populous

and manufacturing country like ours, it is needless to speak ; but we may
mention that other nations and our own colonies are copying our system,

and that for water- works, canal, mill, and agricultural purposes rainfall
information is yearly more and more required.

   The services rendered by the observers are (with but a very few excep-
tions) entirely gratuitous, nay more, the observers themselves have to defray

the cost of printing the results of their labours.

    Considering that it is demonstrablj- a matter of national interest that this

organization should be made as permanent as possible, we cannot help thinking
tliat it would be a graceful and economical act were Government to ofter to

relieve the observers from the cost of reducing and printing their returns.

A few hundreds annually would probably suffice to hold together a body of

practised observers which Jias no equal in the world, and which, once broken
lip, could not be replaced ; since, irrespective of tlie difileulty of training

new observers, the continuity of the old observations would be destroyed.

watery vapour and carbonic acid in the lungs. The second, or direct method,
which consists iu agitating venous blood removed from the body vnih oxygen
or atmospheric air, and ascertaining the changes in temperature which would
then come into requisition.

    Claude Bernard (Comptes Eendus, 1856) ascertained the temperature of
the two sides of the heart by opening the internal jugular vein and the
carotid artery in dogs, and thinisting very delicate sell-registering thermo-

meters into the right and left cavities. He arrived at the conclusion that the

arterialized blood of the left side is invariably cooler than the venous blood

of the right side. Mr. Savory, in a paper entitled " On the relative Tempe-

rature of Arterial and Venous Blood," jwinted out that Claude Bernard's
method of experimenting was not free from fallacy, as by interfering with
the due action of the cardiac valves the thermometers would necessarily

induce some disturbance in the pulmonarj^ circulation. In his own experi-

ments Mr. Savory, having exposed the heat of dogs under the influence of
chloroform, punctured the right and left ventricles by means of a trocar, and

then introduced into the cavities delicate thermometers. By this method of

experimenting, he arrived at the conclusion that the blood of the left side of

the heart is invariably warmer than that of the right side.
   Very lately, in his work entitled " Lemons sur la Physiologic Comparee de

la Respiration," M. Paul Bert has published the results of his own experi-

ments, in which he introduced thermo-electric needles into the right and left

sides of the heart in the same manner as M. Claude Bernard had done. He

has confirmed the observations of Bernard ; his experiments are, however,
open to the same objections which were adduced by Savory against those of
the earlier observer.

   The second or direct method of research, to which I previously alluded,
consists in experimenting with venous blood removed from the body, and
ascertaining whether heat is evolved when it is agitated -^ith air or pure
oxygen. Although many authorities liave been quoted as maintaining the
opinion that when agitated with air venous blood is raised in temperature,
the only authors whose experiments are recorded are Dr. John Davy and
Mr. Savory. In his ' Eesearches, Physiological and Anatomical ' (vol. i.

p. 168), Davy attemijted to answer the question, " When oxygen is absorbed
by the blood, is there any production of heat ? " He agitated a mixture of

venous blood and metallic mercury in a glass phial with oxygen, and ob-
served that a rise in temperature always occurred. Curiously, Dr. Davy
does not appear to have considered that the rise in temperature must to a cer-
tain degree have been due to the agitation of the blood and mercury. Mr.
Savory, in the Monograph previously quoted, indeed found that by Dr. Davy's
method of experimenting no useful results could be obtained, as " in all
cases the increase of temperature seemed to be the result of the agitation."

   By shaking water in a similar manner with air, a small quantity of mer-

cury being present, I have often raised its temperature, though to a less

extent.

   Before commencing independent experimental researches, with a view to
determine, either by the direct or indirect method, the heat of artcrialization,

it appeared to me to be essential to undertake a set of experiments, with the

object of determining with accuracy the specific heat of blood; and it is to a

notice of these experiments that I confine my present Report, reserving the

account of the experiments now in progress on the fui'ther question of the

heat of artcrialization to a future Report.

   I believe I am quite accurate in stating that the specific heat of blood has
              --

been deteiinincd by Dr. John Davy alone, his experiments being recorded in
his previously quoted work (vol. p. 141), in a chapter entitled " On the Capa-
cities of Venous and Arterial Blood for Heat." In his experiments he made
use of defibriiiated blood, and employed for the determination of specific heat

the methods of mixture and rate of cooling. According to Da-vy, the specific

heat of lambs' and sheeps' blood varied from 0-812 to 0-934 (water beini?

1-0).

   The great discrepancy of these results made it most desirable that the
determination should now be made in an accurate manner.

   I employed invariably the method of mixture.

  A flask furnished with a tubulaturc near its base was fixed in the centre

of a water-bath, and from the flask a tube, also surrounded by hot water,
proceeded, which communicated with the exterior by means of a stopcock.
This flask was filled with mercury. The blood to be experimented upon was
placed in a light and highly poUshed iron vessel, which was surrounded by
cotton-wool, and placed in a glass beaker. The temperature of the blood
and mercury was ascertained before and after mixture by means of a very
delicate standard thermometer, made by Fastre of Paris, belonging to the

Museum of Natural Philosophy of the University of Edinburgh. This ther-

mometer admitted of being read very accurately to fiftieths of a degree

Centigrade.

  In my experiment, heated mercury was added to blood at a lower tem-

perature.

   The specific heat was determined by the usual formula.

ALTnoTJon war has for a time unfortunately interrupted the progress of
economic reforms on the Continent of Europe and may yet retard the realiza-
tion of the desired uniformity in the weights, measiires, and coins of aU
countries, your Committee have much pleasure in reporting that the prospects
of the early attainment of such an object were never more satisfactory.
Believing that in the interest of Science, and with a view to the progress of
education, the universal adoption of the Metric System is by far the most
preferable method for arriving at such uniformity, your Committee are glad

to find that the lloyal Standard Commissioners have repoited that the time

has now arrived when the law shoidd provide, and facilities be afforded by

the Government for the introduction and use of Metric Weights and Measures
in the United Kingdom. For that purpose the Warden of the Standard has
obtained a complete set of official standards of such weights and measures pro-
perly verified, and arrangements are in progress for laying down public stan-
 dards of the imperial and Metric measure of length. The Metric Act of 1864
has not yet been amended, but the Board of Trade is only waiting the final
report of the Commissioners, in order to introduce a complete measure on
 the subject of Weights and Measures early next Session. In accordance
with the desire expressed by your Committee, the Board of Trade has pub-
lished the first statistical paper showing the British Customs Tariff, and the
 Statistics of the Customs revenue and foreign Commerce of the United King-
 dom, from 1S4U to 18G9, in the terms of the Imperial and Metric System,
 and also in pounds sterling and in francs. Your Committee have communi-
cated with Her Majesty's Postmaster General with reference to the Postal
 Treaty concluded with France, and urged that the opportunity should be seized
 for introducing into this country a ten-gram weight. It is, however, with

 much regi'et and disappointment that they have learnt that, disregarding even
       UNIFORMITY OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.                     233

the recommendation of the Standard Commissioners, the Postal Authorities

have decided to adopt the j- of an ounce as an equivalent for the 10 grams ; for

not only are the two Aveights not identical, but we miss a rare opportunity

for introducing into practical use, part at least of a system, which there is

every reason to believe will, sooner or later, become national. Apart from

the action of the Government, there is ample evidence that the early intro-

duction of the Metric System is desired by the people. In May last, an im-

portant conference was held in the rooms of the Society of Arts, when the

--following resolutions were unanimously carried :

1. That tlie great inconvenience to Agriculture, Manufactures, and Com-

merce, as well as to Science, resulting from the numerous complicated and

anomalous Weights and Measures now in use, whether by law or custom, in

the British Empire, demands the attention of the Legislature at the earliest

practicable time, with a view to the establishment of some convenient uniform

Decimal system throughout the United Kingdom.

2. That the Standard Commissioners having recommended the abolition of

Troy Weiglits, this Conference is of opinion that all those who now use

the same should substitute for them, not the lb. Avoirdupois, but the Kilo-

gram, with its divisions and multiples, by which another practical step will

be made towards the complete adoption of the Metric System throughout

the British Empire, which, in the opinion of this Meeting, is an object of

the highest importance.

3. That in order to facilitate the speedy introduction of Metric Weights

and Measures and an International Coinage, this Conference deems it highly

desirable that Decimal Arithmetic, with the specialities of the Metric Sj'stem,

should be taught in all the Schools in the United Kingdom.

Your Committee have also much pleasure in reporting, that during the

year, in consequence of general complaints of the numerous descriptions of

weights and measures by which grain is sold in different markets of the

kingdom, a Joint Committee of the Central Chamber of Agriculture and the

International Decimal Association have produced a report to the following

eifect. From the report of that joint Committee, it appears that the ex-

treme difference of practice in the weights and measures used in different

markets of the United Kingdom, for the sale of grain and other agricultural

products and manures, is the cause of considerable inconvenience and loss.

The Banbury, Devonshire, Essex, Howdenshire, Kincardineshire, Leicester-

shire, Malton, Monmouthshire, Norfolk, North of England, North Biding of

Yorkshire, Scottish, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire Chambers of Agri-

culture were unanimous in their opinion that steps should be taken for ob-

taining a uniform system as speedily as possible ; and from long experience

that Committee was convinced that no voluntary or permissive legislation,

and that no local arrangement or understanding will enable us to realize the

object in view. In the language used by more than one of such Chambers,

" Whatever standard be decided upon, the same should be made compulsory

throughout the country." Besides, however, a general testimony in favour

of uniformity of Weights and Measures in the United Kingdom, the Com-

mittee found that a movement has been gaining groimd for extending such

uniformity among all countries. And the Committee were strongly impressed

with the conviction that, dependent as we are upon foreign countries for

the supply of grain, other agricultural products and manures, great advan-

tage would be derived if, in making the necessary change, we could contri-

bute to the realization of this larger object. It would save time, it would

prevent errors, it would greatly facilitate commercial transactions, if grain

were quoted in the same manner in every market of the Tvorld, and if our
merchants and corn-growers could understand the ordinary quotations
from Stettin and Odessa as readily as those from their own home markets.
Nor is the object far from practical attainment. The Committee learn that
considerable progress has already been made in the great work ; that a
large number of coiintries, having an aggregate population of more than
200,000,000 (two hundred millions), both on the Baltic and the Mediterranean
seas, and on the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, have agreed in adopting and
are akeady using the Metric system ; that this system has just been estab-
lished throughout our Indian empire ; and that in this kingdom, and in the
United States of America, the use of the same Aveights and measures has been
made legal and permissive. Under such circumstances, and believing that,
if a change is to be made, it is best to endeavour to secure a system as per-
fect as possible, one not likely to be again altered, and one equally suitable
to the general wants of all classes of the community, that Committee came
to the conclusion that the best mode of obtaining a real and permanent uni-
formity in weights and measures apphcablo to the sale of grain and other
agricultural products and manures, is by adapting our present practice to the
metric system. With a view to this object, the Committee made the following
recommendations :

    " (1.) That, in the opinion of this Committee, it is desirable that the Go-
vernment should be requested to act upon the recommendations of the
Standards Commissioners in their Second and Third Reports, by legislating,
with the least practicable delay, in reference to the introduction of the Metric
Weights and Measures in this country, and facilitating their use by making
proper arrangements for the legal verification and stamping of such weights
and measures.

    " (2.) That the Chambers of Agriculture and the Cambers of Commerce be
recommended to petition the Legislature to pass, with the least practicable
delay, such enactments as wiU establish the kilogram with its decimal mul-
tiples and divisions as the standard unit of weight in lieu of the present
pound avoirdupois and other imperial and customary weights.

    " (3.) That, in the opinion of your Committee, the use of such standard

weights should be made compulsory within a definite time ; and, thenceforth,
contracts made by any other weights should be invalid.

    " (4.) That although the Central Chamber of Agricultm-e has recom-
mended that grain should be sold by the ' cental ' of 100 lb. (one hundred
pounds), which is in use at Liverpool, yet, as your Committee find the general

average weight of a sack of the diff'erent kinds of grain to be about 2241b.
(two hundred and twenty-four pounds), or the tenth part of a ton, they
are of opinion that it would be desirable to substitute for the ' cental,' a
weight of 100 (one hundred) kilogrammes (or, in other words, a ' quintal

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                '),

which only differs by a fraction from 2201b. (two hundred and twenty
pounds).

    " (5.) That this report be printed and copies transmitted to all the Cham-
bers of Agriculture and Chambers of Commerce, to Agricultural Societies,
Farmers' Clubs, and Municipal Councils, with the request that they will
circulate the same and consider the recommendations of this Committee at

their earliest convenience."

   From these and other circumstances of a like character, your Committee

have reason to conclude that the Metric System is gaining in pubHc favour, and

they earnestly hope that Her Majesty's Government may not delay in adopt-
ing a bold course on the subject. No time certainly should be lost mean-

while in teaching the Metric System in all the schools ; and it would be well
if a knowledge of the same should be required at least in all the normal schools
in the United Kingdom. Your Committee have deemed it advantageous to
present a copy of the Mural Standard of the Metro and Yard procured from
Mr. Casella, to the Mayor of Newcastle for public exhibition, Newcastle being
the seat of extensive mechanical and chemical works, where the decimal
measures of the metre and the gram are preferred to the corresponding mea-
sures and weight in the imperial system. Another copy of the same Mural
Standard your Committee have presented to the Museiim of Science and Art

in Edinburgh, an institution very largely frequented by the people. And

they have also purchased a complete set of all the weights and measures of
the Metric System, with accompanying tables and diagrams, for the purpose
of illustrating Lectui'es and offering information on the subject.

   Your Committee have seen with much satisfaction the successful introduc-
tion of the Metric System into the Indian Empire. From a parliamentary
paper recently published, it appears that the representations made by your

Committee to Sir Stafford Northcote, the Secretary of State for India, has

had much influence in inducing the Government of India to adopt the Metric
in preference to any other system. Your Committee have taken much in-

terest in the enlightened steps taken by Colonel Strachey in furtherance of
this important reform. In Canada a Select Committee of the Senate reported
in favour of a uniform International Decimal System of Weights, Measures,

and Coins. And an International Standard Commission has been appointed
to meet in Paris for the construction of new Primary Metric Standards.
But how soon will that Commission meet, it is extremely difficult to say,

since the breaking up of this unhappy war.
    With regard to coinage, your Committee are informed that a Commission on

the Monetary Standards held in Paris, after careful consideration, reported in
favour of a single gold standard. But no practical step has hitherto been
taken with regard to it, either here or elsewhere. Your Committee have

done much to diffuse information on the general subject, but they feel that
they have yet much to accomplish, especially in inducing the various learned

bodies in different countries to adopt the same standard of money, weights,

and measures as a common language. They therefore suggest the reappoint-
ment of the Metric Committee, and that another grant, of at least .£'25, be
asked from the Committee of Eecommendations, whereby further copies of
the Mural Standard may be sent to towns and places where they may be seen
and studied by large masses of the people, and for the general object of

extending the knowledge of a question eminently calculated to further the

progress of science and civilization.

MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECTIONS.

       MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

Address hy J. Clekk Maxweli,, LL.D., F.R.S., President of the Section.

At several of the recent Meetings of the British Association the varied and im-

portant business of the Mathematical and Physical Section has been introduced by
an Address, the subject of which has been left to the selection of the President for
the time being. The perplexing duty of choosing a subject has not, however, fallen

to me.

  AProfessor Sylvester, the President of Section at the Exeter Meeting, gave us a

noble vindication of pure mathematics by laying bare, as it were, the very working

of the mathematical mind, and setting before us, not the aiTay of symbols and
brackets which form the armouiy of the mathematician, or the dry results whicli
are only the monuments of his conquests, but the mathematician himself, with all

his human faculties directed by his professional sagacity to the pursuit, apprehen-

sion, and exhibition of that ideal harmony which he feels to be the root of all
knowledge, the fountain of all pleasure, and the condition of all action. The
mathematician has, above all things, an eye for symmetry ; and Professor Sylvester
has not only recognized the symmetry formed by the combination of his own sub-

ject with those of the foi-mer Presidents, but has pointed out the duties of his

successor in the following characteristic note :

   " Mr. Spottiswoode favoured the Section, in his opening Address, with a com-

bined history of the progress of Mathematics and Physics ; Dr. Tj-ndall's address

was virtually on the limits of Physical Philosophy ; the one here in print," says

Prof, Sylvester, " is an attempted faint adumbration of the natm-e of Mathematical

Science in the abstract. What is wanting (like a fourth sphere resting on three

others in contact) to build up the Ideal Pyramid is a discourse on the Relation of

the two branches (Mathematics and Physics) to, their action and reaction upon,

one another, a magnificent theme, with which it is to be hoped that some future

APresident of Section will crown the edifice and make the Tetralogy (symbolizable

by A+A', A, A', AA') complete."

The theme thus distinctly laid down for his successor by our late President is

indeed a magnificent one, far too magnificent for any efforts of mine to realize. I

have endeavoured to follow Mr. Spottiswoode, as with far-reaching vision he dis-

tinguishes the systems of science into which phenomena, om* Imowledge of which

is still in the nebulous stage, are growing. I have been carried by the penetrating

insight and forcible expression of Dr. Tyndall into that sanctuary of minuteness and

of power where molecules obey the laws of their existence, clash together in fierce

collision, or grapple in yet more fierce embrace, building up in secret the forms of
visible things. I have been guided by Prof. Sylvester to-wards those serene heights

                   " Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,
                     Nor ever falls the least white star of snow.
                     Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,
                     Nor sound of human sorrow mounts, to mar

                   Their sacred everlasting cahn."

But who will lead me into that still more hidden and dimmer region where

Thought weds Fact, where the mental operation of the mathematician and the

physical action of the molecules are seen in their true relation ? Does not the way

to it pass through the very den of the metaphysician, strewed with the remains of

former explorers, and abhorred by every man of science ? It would indeed be a
foolhardy adventure for me to take up the valuable time of the Section by leading

you into those speculations which require, as we know, thousands of years even to

shape themselves intelligibly.

   But we are met as ctdtivators of mathematics and physics. In our daily work
we are led up to questions the same in kind with those of metaphysics ; and wo
approach them, not trusting to the native penetrating power of our own minds, but

trained by a long-continued adjustment of om- modes of thought to the facts of

external natiu'e.

As mathematicians, we perform certain mental operations on the symbols of

nimiber or of quantity, and, by proceeding step by step from more simple to more
complex operations, we are enabled to express the same thing in many different

forms. The equivalence of these different forms, though a necessary consequence

of self-evident axioms, is not always, to our minds, self-evident ; but the mathema-

tician, who by long practice has acquired a familiarity with many of these forms,

and has become expert in the processes which lead fi-om one to another, can often

transform a perplexing expression into another which explains its meaning in more

intelligible language.

   As students of Physics we observe phenomena under varied circumstances, and

endeavour to deduce the laws of theii* relations. Every natural phenomenon is, to

cm" minds, the result of an infinitely complex system of conditions. What we set

ourselves to do is to unravel these conditions, and by viewing the phenomenon in
a way which is in itself partial and imperfect, to piece out its featiires one by one,

beginning with that which strikes us first, and thus gradually learning how to look

at the whole phenomenon so as to obtain a continually greater demee of clearness

and distinctness. In this process, the feature which presents itself most forcibly to

the untrained inquirer may not be that which is considered most fundamental by
the experienced man of science ; for the success of any physical investigation

depends on the judicious selection of what is to be observed as of primary im-

portance, combined with a voluntary abstraction of the mind from those features

which, however attractive they appear, we are not yet sufficiently advanced in

science to investigate with profit.

   Intellectual processes of this kind have been going on since the first formation of

language, and are going on still. No doubt the featm-o which strikes us first and

most forcibly in any phenomenon, is the pleasure or the pain which accompanies

Ait, and the agreeable or disagi'eeable results which follow after it.  theory of

nature from this point of view is embodied in many of our M'ords and phrases, and

is by no means extinct even in our deliberate opinions.
   It was a great step in science when men became convinced that, in order to un-

derstand the nature of things, the)' must begin by asking, not whether a thing is

good or bad, noxious or beneficial, but of what kind is it r and how much is there

of it ? Quality and Quantity were then first recognized as the primary features to

be observed in scientific inquiry.

   As science has been deAeloped, the domain of quantity has everywhere encroached

on that of quality, till the process of scientific inquiry seems to have become simply

the measurement and registration of quantities, combined with a mathematical

discussion of the numbers thiis obtained. It is this scientific method of directing

our attention to those features of phenomena which may be regarded as quantities

which brings physical research imder the influence of mathematical reasoning. In
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  3

the work of the Section we shall have abimdant examples of the successful appli-
cation of this method to the most recent conquests of science ; but I wish at present

to direct your attention to some of the reciprocal effects of the progress of science
on those elementary conceptions which are sometimes thoxight to bo beyond the

reach of change.

    If the skill of the mathematician has enabled the experimentalist to see that the
quantities which he has measured are connected by necessary relations, the disco-

veries of physics have revealed to the mathematician new forms of quantities

which he could never have imagined for himself.

   Of the methods by which the mathematician may make his labours most useful

to the student of nature, that which I think is at present most important is the

systematic classification of quantities.

   The quantities which we study in mathematics and physics may be classified in

two different ways.

   The student who wishes to master any particular science must make himself

familiar with the various kinds of quantities which belong to that science. When

he understands all the relations between these quantities, he regards them as form-
ing a connected system, and he classes the whole system of quantities together as

belonging to that particular science. This classification is the most natui-al from

a physical point of^view, .and it is generally the first in order of time.

   But when the student has become acquainted with several diflerent sciences, he

finds that the mathematical processes and trains of reasoning in one science resemble

those in another so much that his knowledge of the one science may be made a

most useful help in the study of the other.

   When he examines into the reason of this, he finds that in the two sciences he

has been dealing with systems of quantities, in which the mathematical forms of
the relations of the quantities are the same in both systems, though the physical

nature of the quantities may be utterly different.
  He is thus led to recognize a classification of quantities on a new principle,

according to which the physical nature of the quantity is subordinated to its
mathematical fonn. This is the point of view which is characteristic of the
mathematician; but it stands second to the physical aspect in order of time,

because the human mind, in order to conceive of different kinds of quantities, must
have them presented to it by nature.

   I do not here refer to the fact that all quantities, as such, are subject to the rules
of arithmetic and algebra, and are therefore capable of being submitted to those

dry calculations which represent, to so many minds, their only idea of mathematics.
   The human mind is seldom satisfied, and is certainly never exercising its highest

functions, when it is doing the work of a calculating machine. What the man of

science, whether he is a mathematician or a physical inquirer, aims at is, to acquire
and develope clear ideas of the things he deals with. For this purpose he is

willing to enter on long calculations, and to be for a season a calculating machine,

if he can only at last make his ideas clearer.
   But if he finds that clear ideas are not to be obtained by means of processes the

steps of which he is sure to forget before he has reached the conclusion, it is much
better that he should turn to another method, and try to understand the subject by
means of well-chosen illustrations derived from subjects with which he is more

familiar.

  We all know how much more popular the illustrative method of exposition is

found, than that in which bare processes of reasoning and calculation form the

principal subject of discourse.

  Now a truly scientific illustration is a method to enable the mind to grasp some

conception or law in one branch of science, by placing before it a conception or a
law in a different branch of science, and directing the mind to lay hold of that

mathematical form which is common to the cori'esponding ideas in the two

sciences, leaving out of account for the present the difference between the physical
nature of the real phenomena.

   The correctness of such an illustration depends on whether the two systems of

mathematical class. "When this condition is fulfilled, the illustration is not only
convenient for teaching science in a pleasant and easy manner, but the recognition
of the formal analogy between the two systems of ideas leads to a knowledge of
both, more profound than could be obtained by studying each system separately.

   There are men who, when any relation or law, however complex, is put before
til em in a symbolical foriii, can grasp its full meaning as a relation among abstract
quantities. Such men sometimes treat with iudiiference the further statement
that quantities actually exist in nature which fulfil this relation. The mental

image of the concrete; reality seems rather to disturb than to assist their contem-

plations.

   But the great majority of mankind are utterly unable, without long training, to
retain in their minds the unembodied symbols of the pure mathematician, so that,
if science is ever to become popular, and yet remain scientific, it must be by a pro-
found study and a copious application of those principles of the mathematical clas-
sification of quantities which, as we have seen, lie at the root of every truly scien-

tific illustration.

   There are, as I have said, some minds which can go on contemplating with
satisfaction pure quantities presented to the eye by symbols, and to the mind in a
form which none but mathematicians can conceive.

   There are others who feel more enjoyment in following geometrical forms, which

they draw on paper, or build up in the empty space before them.
    Others, again, are not content unless they can project their whole physical ener-

gies into the scene which they conjure up. TJiey learn at what a rate the planets
rush through space, and they experience a delightful feeling of exhilaration. They
calculate the forces with which the heavenly bodies pull at one another, and they
feel their o\vn muscles straining with the effort.

   To such men momentum, energy, mass are not mere abstract expressions of the
results of scientific inquiry. They are words of power, which stir their souls like

the memories of childhood.
    For the sake of persons of these different types, scientific truth should be pre-

sented in different forms, and should be regarded as equally scientific, whether it
appears in tlie robust form and the vivid colouring of a physical illustration, or in
the tenuity and paleness of a symbolical expression.

   Time would fail me if I were to attempt to illustrate by examples the scientific
value of the classification of quantities. 1 shall only mention the name of that im-

portant class of magnitudes having direction in space which Hamilton has called
Vectors, and which form the subject-matter of the Calculus of Qua'ternions, a
branch of mathematics which, Aviien it shall have been tlioroughly vuiderstood by

men of the illusti'ative type, and clothed by them with physical imagery, will become,
perhaps under some new name, a most powerful method of communicating truly

scientific knowledge to persons apparently devoid of the calculating spirit.

   The mutual action and reaction between the different departments of human

thought is so interesting to the student of scientific progress, that, at the risk of
 still further encroaching on the valuable time of the Section, I shall say a few words
 on a branch of physics which not very long ago would have been considered rather

a branch of metapliysics. I mean the atomic theory, or, as it is now called, the

 molecular theory of the constitution of bodies.

    Not many years ago if we had been asked in what regions of physical science the
 advance of discovery was least apparent, we should have ponited to the hope-

 lessly distant fixed stars on the one hand, and to the inscrutable delicacy of the
 texture of material bodies on tlie other.

    Indeed, if we are to regard Comte as in any degree representing the scientific
 opinion of his time, the research into what takes place beyond our own solar system

 seemed then to be exceedingly unpromising, if not altogether illusory.

    The opinion that the bodies which we see and handle, which we can set in
 motion or leave at rest, which we can break in pieces and destroy, are composed of
 smaller bodies which we cannot see or handle, which are always in motion, and
 which can neither be stopped nor broken in pieces, nor in any way destroj-ed or
 deprived of the least of their properties, was known by the name of the Atomic

 Theory. It was associated with the names of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius,

tind was commonly supposed to admit the existence only of atoms and void, to the

exclusion of any other basis of things from the universe.

In many physical reasonings and mathematical calculations we are accustomed

to argue as if such substances as air, water, or metal, which appear to our senses

uniform and continuous, were strictly and mathematically uniform and continuous.

  "We know that we can divide a pint of water into many millions of portions,

each of which is as fully endowed with all the properties of water as the whole

pint was ; and it seems only natural to conclude that we might go on subdividing

the water for ever, just as we can never come to a limit in subdividing the space

Wein which it is contained.  have heard how Faraday divided a gi-ain of gold into

an inconceivable number of separate particles, and we may see Dr. TjTidall produce

from a mere suspicion of nitrite of butyle an immense cloud, the minute visible

portion of which is still cloud, and therefore must contain many molecules of nitrite

of butyle.

   But evidence from different and independent sources is now crowding in upon us
which compels us to admit that if we could push the process of subdivision still
further we should come to a limit, because each portion would then contain only

one molecule, an individual body, one and indivisible, unalterable by any power in

nature.

  Even in our ordinary experiments on very finely diA'ided matter we find that the
substance is beginning to lose the properties which it exhibits when in a large mass,

and that effects depending on the individual action of molecules are beginning to

become prominent.

   The study of these phenomena is at present the path which leads to the develop-
ment of molecular science.

   That superficial tension of liquids which is called capillary attraction is one of
these phenomena. Another important class of phenomena are those which are due
to that motion of agitation by which the molecules of a liquid or gas are continu-

ally working their way from one place to another, and continually changing their

course, like people hustled in a crowd.

  On this depends the rate of diffusion of gases and liquids through each other,

to the study of which, as one of tlie keys of molecular science, that unwearied in-

quh-er into nature's secrets, the late Prof. Graham, devoted such arduous labour.
   The rate of electrolytic conduction is, according to Wiedemann's theory,

influenced by the same cause ; and the conduction of heat in fluids depends pro-
bably on the same kind of action. In the case of gases, a molecular theoiy has
been developed by Clausius and others, capable of mathematical treatment, and

eubjected to experimental investigation; and by this theory nearly every known

mechanical property of gases has been explained on dynamical principles ; so that

the properties of individual gaseous molecules are in a fair way to become objects

of scientific research.

  Now Mr. Stoney has pointed out * that the numerical results of experiments on

gases render it probable that the mean distance of their particles at the ordinary

temperature and pressure is a quantity of the same order of magnitude as a mil-

lionth of a millimetre, and Sir William Thomson has since t shown, by several
independent lines of argument, drawn from phenomena so different in themselves

as the electrification of metals by contact, the tension of soap-bubbles, and the
fidction of air, that in ordinary solids and liquids the average distance between

contiguous molecules is less than the hundred-milUouth, and greater than the two-

thousand-millionth of a centimetre.

   These, of course, are exceedingly rough estimates, for they are derived from
measurements some of which are still confessedly very rough ; but if, at the present

time, we can form even a rough plan for arriving at results of this kind, we may hope

that, as our means of experimental inquiry become more accurate and more varied,

our conception of a molecule will become more definite, so that we may be able

at no distant period to estimate its weight with a gi-eater degree of precision.

  A theory, which Sir W. Thomson has founded on Helmholtz's splendid hydro-

dynamical theorems, seeks for the properties of molecules in the ring-vortices of a

uniform, frictionless, incompressible fluid. Such whirling rings may be seen when

* PhU. Mag. Aug. 1868.               | Nature, March 31, 1870.
6 REPORT 1870.

an experienced smoker sends out a dexterous pufF of smoke into the still air, but a

more evanescent phenomenon it is diiEcult to conceive. This evanescence is owing

to the viscosity of the air ; but Helmholtz has shown that in a perfect fluid such

a whirling ring, if once generated, would go on whirling for ever, would always con-

sist of the very same portion of the fluid which was first set whirling, and could never

be cut in two by any natural cause. The generation of a ring-vortex is of course

equally beyond the power of natural causes, but once generated, it has the pro-

perties of individuality, permanence in quantity, and indestructibility. It is also

the recipient of impulse and of energy, which is all we can aflirm of matter ; and

these ring-vortices are capable of such varied connexions and knotted self-involu-

tions, that the properties of differently knotted vortices must be as different as those

of different kinds of molecules can be.

If a theory of this kind shoidd be found, after conquering the enormous mathe-

matical difficulties of the subject, to represent in any d gree the actual properties

of molecules, it will stand in a very different scientific position from those theories

of molecular action which are formed by investing the molecule with an arbitrary

system of central forces invented expressly to account for the observed phenomena.

In the vortex theory we have nothing arbitrary, no central forces or occult pro-

Weperties of any other kind.   have nothing but matter and motion, and when the

vortex is once started its properties are all determined from the original impetus,

and no fiu-ther assumptions are possible.

Even in the present undeveloped state of the theory, the contemplation of the

individuality and indestructibility of a ring-vortex in a perfect fluid cannot fail

to disturb the commonly received opinion that a molecule, in order to be permanent,

must be a very hard body.

In fact one of the first conditions which a molecule must fulfil is, apparently,

Weinconsistent with its being a single hard body.  know from those spectroscopic

researches which have thrown so much light on different branches of science, that

a molecule can be set into a state of internal vibration, in which it gives off to the

--smTouuding medium light of definite refrangibility light, that is, of definite wave-

length and definite period of vibration. The fact that all the molecules (say, of
hydrogen) which we can procure for om* experiments, when agitated by heat or by

the passage of an electric spark, vibrate precisely in the same periodic time, or, to

speak more accurately, that their vibrations are composed of a system of simple

vibrations having always the same periods, is a very remarkable fact.

I must leave it to others to describe the progress of that splendid series of

spectroscopic discoveries by which the chemistry of the heavenly bodies has been
brought ^vithiu the range of human inquiry. I wish rather to direct yom' attention

to the fact that, not only has every molecido of terrestrial hydrogen the same

system of periods of free vibration, but that the spectroscopic exammation of the

light of the sun and stars shows that, in regions the distance of which we can only

feebly imagine, there are molecules vibrating in as exact unison with the molecules

of terrestrial hydrogen as two tuning-forks tuned to concert pitch, or two watches

regulated to solar time.

  Now this absolute equality in the magnitude of quantities, occurring in all parts

of the universe, is worth our consideration.

The dimensions of individual natm-al bodies are either quite indetenninate, as in

the case of planets, stones, trees, &c., or they vary within moderate limits, as

in the case of seeds, eggs, &c. ; but even in these cases small quantitative differ-

ences are met with which do not interfere with the essential properties of the body.

Even crystals, which are so definite in geometrical form, are variable with respect

to their absolute dimensions.

Among the works of man we sometimes find a certain degree of uniformity.

There is a imiformity among the different bullets which are cast in the same

mould, and the different copies of a book printed from the same type.

  If we examine the coins, or the weights and measures, of a civilized country, we

find a uniformity, which is produced by careful adjustment to standards made and
provided by the state. The degree of uniformity of these national standards is a
measm-e of that spirit of justice in the nation which has enacted laws to regulate
them and appointed oflicera to test them.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  7

   This subject is one in whicli we, as a scientific body, take a warm interest; and

you are all aware of the vast amount of scientific work which has been expended,
and profitably expended, in providing weights and measures for commercial and

scientific purposes.

   The eai'th has been measured as a basis for a permanent standard of length, and
every property of metals has been investigated to guard against any alteration of
the material standai'ds when made. To weigh or measure any thing with modern
accuracy, requires a course of experiment and calculation in which almost every

branch of physics and mathematics is brought into requisition.
   Yet, after all, the dimensions of om- earth and its time of rotation, though, rela-

tively to our present means of comparison, very permanent, are not so by any phy-
sical necessity. The earth might contract by cooling, or it might be enlai-ged by
a layer of meteorites falling on it, or its rate of revolution might slowly slacken,
and yet it would continue to be as much a planet as before.

   But a molecule, say of hydrogen, if either its mass or its time of vibration were
to be altered in the least, would no longer be a molecule of hydrogen.

   If, then, we wish to obtain standards of length, time, and mass which shall be
absolutely permanent, we must seek them not in the dimensions, or the motion, or

the mass of our planet, but in the wave-lengih, the period of vibration, and the
absolute mass of these imperishable and unalterable and perfectly similar molecides.

   \Mien we find that here, and in the stan-y heavens, there are innumerable mul-

titudes of little bodies of exactly the same mass, so many, and no more, to the

grain, and vibrating in exactly the same time, so many times, and no more, in a
second, and when we reflect that no power in nature can now alter in the least
either the mass or the period of any one of them, we seem to have advanced along
the path of natural knowledge to one of those points at which we must accept the
guidance of that faith by which we understand that " that which is seen was not
made of things which do appear."

   One of the most remarkable results of the progress of molecular science is the

--light it has thro^vn on the nature of in-eversible processes processes, that is, which

always tend towards and never away from a certain limiting state. Thus, if two
gases be put into the same vessel, they become mixed, and the mixture tends con-
tinually to become more uniform. If two unequally heated portions of the same
gas are put into the vessel, something of the kind takes place, and the whole
tends to become of the same temperatui-e. If two unequally heated solid bodies be
placed in contact, a continual approximation of both to an intermediate temperature

takes place.

   In the case of the two gases, a separation may be effected by chemical means
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but in the other two cases the former state of things cannot be restored by any

natural process.

    In the case of the conduction or diff"usion of heat the process is not only u-rever-
sible, but it involves the in-eversible diminution of that part of the whole stock of

thermal energy which is capable of being converted into mechanical work.
    This is Thomson's theory of the irreversible dissipation of energy, and it is equi-

valent to the doctrine of Clausius concerning the gTOwth of what he calls Entropy.
    The iri'eversible character of this process is strikingly embodied in Fourier's

theory of the conduction of heat, where the formulae themselves indicate, for all
positive values of the time, a possible solution which continually tends to the form

 of a uniform diiRision of heat.

   But if we attempt to ascend the stream of time by giviug to its symbol conti-
nually diminishing values, we are led up to a state of things in which the formula
has what is called a critical value ; and if we inquire into the state of things the
instant before, we find that the formula becomes absiu'd.

   We thus anive at the conception of a state of things which cannot be conceived

 as the physical result of a previous state of things, and we find that this critical

 condition actually existed at an epoch not in the utmost depths of a past eternity,

 but separated from the present time by a finite interval.
    This idea of a beginning is one which the physical researches of recent times

 have brought home to us, more than any observer of the course of scientific thought

 in former times would have had reason to expect.
--8 REPORT 1870.

   But the mind of man is not, like Foiirier'a heated body, continually settling
down into an ultimate state of quiet uniformity, the character of which we can

already predict ; it is rather like a tree, shooting out branches which adapt them-

selves to the new aspects of the sky towards which they climb, and roots which
contort themselves among the strange strata of the earth into which they delve.
To us who breathe only the spirit of our own age, and know only the characteristics

of contemporary thought, it is as impossible to predict the general tone of the science
of the future as it is to anticipate the particular discoveries which it will make.

   Physical research is continually revealing to us new features of natural processes,
and we are thus compelled to search for new forms of thought appropriate to these
features. Hence the importance of a careful study of those relations between
Mathematics and Physics which determine the conditions under which the ideas
derived from one department of physics may be safely used in forming ideas to be
employed in a new department.

   The figure of speech or of thought by which we transfer the language and ideas
of a famfliar science to one with which we are less acquainted maybe called Scien-

tific Metaphor.

   Thus the words Velocity, Momentum, Force, &c. have acquired certain precise
meanings in Elementary Dynamics, They are also employed in the DjTiamics of
R Connected System in a sense which, though perfectly analogous to the elementary
sense, is wider and more general.

   These generalized forms of elementary ideas may be called metaphorical terms in
the sense in which every abstract temi is metaphorical. The characteristic of a

truly scientific system of metaphors is that each term in its metaphorical use retains

--all the formal relations to the other terms of the system which it had in its original

use. The method is then truly scientific that is, not only a legitimate product of

science, but capable of generating science in its turn.
    There are certain electrical phenomena, again, which are connected together by

relations of the same form as those wliich connect dynamical phenomena. To apply
to these the phrases of dynamics with proper distinctions and provisional reserva-
tions is an example of a metaphor of a bolder kind ; but it is a legitimate metaphor
if it conveys a true idea of the electrical relations to those who have been abeady

trained in dynamics.

   Suppose, then, that we have successfully introduced certain ideas belonging to an
elementary science by applying them metaphorically to some new cla^s of pheno-
mena. It becomes an impoi'tant philosophical question to determine in what degree
the applicability of the old ideas to the new subject may be taken as evidence that

the new phenomena are physically similar to the old.
    The best instances for the determination of this question are those in which two

ditterent explanations have been given of the same thing.

    The most celebrated case of this kind is that of the corpuscular and the undulatory

theories of light. Up to a certain point the phenomena of light are equally well

explained by Doth ; beyond this point, one of them fails.

   To understand the true relation of these theories in that part of the field where
they seem equally applicable we must look at them in the light which Hamilton

 has thrown upon them by his discovery that to every brachistochrone problem there

 corresponds a problem of free motion, involving different velocities and times, but

 resulting in the same geometrical path. Professor Tait has written a veiy interest-

 ing paper on this subject.
    According to a theory of electricity which is making great progress in Germany,

 two electrical particles act on one another directly at a distance, but with a force

 which, according to Weber, depends on their relative velocity, and according to a

 theory hinted at by Gauss, and developed by Riemann, Lorenz, and Neumann, acts
 not instantaneously, but after a time depending on the distance. The power with

 which this theory," in the hands of these eminent men, explains every kmd of elec-

 trical phenomena must be studied in order to be appreciated.

     Another theory of electricity, which I prefer, denies action at a distance and attri-

 butes electric action to tensions and pressures in an all-pervading medium, these

 stresses being the same in kind with those familiar to engineers, and the medium

 being identical with that in which light is supposed to be propagated.

   Both these theories are found to explain not only the phenomena by the aid of
which they were originally constructed, hut other phenomena, which were not
thought of or perhaps not known at the time ; and both have independently arrived

at the same numerical result, which gives the absolute velocity of light in terms of

electrical quantities.

   That theories apparently so fundamentally opposed should have so large a field of

truth common to both is a fact the philosophical importance of wliich we cannot
fully appreciate till we have reached a scientific altitude from wliich the true rela-

tion between hypotheses so difterent can be seen.

I shall only make one more remark on the relation between Mathematics and

Physics. In themselves, one is an operation of the mind, the other is a dance of

molecules. The molecules have laws of their own, some of which we select as most

intelligible to us and most amenable to our calculation. AVe form a theory from

these partial data, and we ascribe any deviation of the actual phenomena from this

theory to disturbing causes. At the same time we confess that wliat we call dis-

turbing causes are simply those parts of the true circumstances which we do not

Weknow or have neglected, and we endeavour in future to take account of them.

thus acknowledge that the so-called disturbance is a mere figment of the mind, not

a fact of nature, and that in natural action there is no disturbance.

But this is not the only way in which the harmony of the material with the

mental operation may be disturbed. The mind of the mathematician is subject to

many disturbing causes, such as fatigue, loss of memory, and hasty conclusions ; and
it is found that, from these and other causes, mathematicians make mistakes.

  1 am not prepared to deny that, to some mind of a higher order than ours, each

of these errors might be traced to the regular operation of the laws of actual think-

ing                  in  fact we  ourselves  often  do  detect, not only errors  of calculation, but  the
                  ;

causes of these errors. This, however, by no means alters our conviction that they

are errors, and that one process of thought is right and another process wrong.

One of the most profound mathematicians and thinkers of o\u time, the late

George Boole, when reflecting on the precise and almost mathematical character of

the laws of right thinking as compared with the exceedingly perplexing though

perhaps equally determinate laws of actual and fallible thinking, was led to another

of those points of view from which Science seems to look out into a region beyond

her own domain.

We" must admit," he says, " that there exist laws " (of thought) "which even

Wethe rigour of their mathematical forms does not preserve from violation.       must

ascribe to tliem an authority, the essence of which does not consist in power, a

supremacy which the analogy of the inviolable order of the natural world in no

way assists us to comprehend."

I have recently accomplished the solution of this problem, which I spoke of at

the Meeting in 1864. The problem is as follows : required the number of the tri-

angles the angles of which are situate in a given cuito or curves, and the sides of

which touch a given curve or curves. There are in aU 52 cases of the problem,

according as the curves which contain the angles and are touched by the sides are

distinct curves, or are any or all of them the some curve. The first and easiest

case is when the curves are all of them distinct ; the number of triangles is here

ence referred to in the heading, and which 1 would suggest as an interesting sub-

ject of investigation to geometers. Observe, that considering the whole system of

points in space, the corresponding lines are a triple system of lines, not the whole

system of lines in space. It is thus, not any line whatever, but only a line of the

triple system, which has on it a corresponding point. But as to this some explana-

tion is necessary; for starting with an arbitrary line, and taking upon it a point

P, it would seem that P might be so determined that the given line and the lines

--Pfrom to the eight points should form an ennead, that is, that the arbiti-ary line

would have upon it a corresponding point or points.

  The question of the foregoing species of correspondence was suggested to me by

the consideration of a S3-stem of 10 points, such that joining any one whatever

of them with the remaining nine points, the nine lines thus obtained form an
ennead ; or, say, that each of the 10 points is the " enneadic centre " of the remain-

ing nine. I have been led to such a system of 10 points by my researches upon

Quartic surfaces ; but I do not as yet understand the theory.

The small oscillations of a Particle and of a Rigid Body. By Egbert

                                                             I. Introductory.

   Laplace investigated the small oscillations of a particle on a sphere, Poisson
solved a special case of the same problem on the ellipsoid, Lagi'ange discovered
the general laws of small oscillations, and his methods have been improved by

Messrs. Thomson and Tait ; the results of which the fallowing is an abstract, have
been obtained by a imion of the method of Lagrange in its improved form with
                                                                                                                                                                '

some elegant theorems of kinematics discovered by M. Chasles. Demonstrations
of some of the theorems here enunciated will be found in two papers written by

the author.

   "On the small oscillations of a Particle on a Surface under the action of any

Forces," Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, No. 39, 1869.

   " On the small oscillations of a Rigid Body about a Fixed Point under the action
of finy Forces, and more particularly when gravity is the only force acting," Trans-

actions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxiv. Science, part xvi.

                                AII, Particle.

1. There are in general three lines called normal lines, such that whatever be the

small osciUatious of a particle, free in space, the movement is compounded of simple

harmonic vibrations along the normal lines.

  2. When the forces have a potential, a constant small quantity of energy would

di'aw the particle along any radius vector from its position of rest to the surface of

a certain ellipsoid                                                                                 the normal lines are  in the principal  directions of this  ellipsoid,
                                                                                                 ;

and the lengths of the isochronous simple pendulums are proportional to the squares

of its principal axes.

  3. When the particle is constrained to a surface, the motion is compounded of

vibrations in two directions on the surface, and when the forces have a potential,

the tangent lines to these directions are at right angles.

                                                                                                    AIII. Free Rigid Body,

A4. free rigid body may receive any displacement by being screwed along an

axis in space, the distance it travels along the axis when turned through the unit

of angle Ibeing termed the pitch of the screw.

5. The movement of a free rigid body, when making small oscillations, is com-

pounded of six normal movements, each consisting of a to-and-fro vibration about

a tiormid screw, the position, pitch, and period of which depend upon the forces.

6. Whatever be the initial motion of the body, supposed small, it may be dis-

tributed imiquely among the six nonnal screws, and thus the entire motion is de-

termined,

                                                                                                    ArV. Constrained liir/id Body.

   7. If a rigid body have h degrees of freedom, its small oscillations are compounded

of vibrations about k normal screws.

  A8. body capable of turning around a fixed axis and sliding along it, has two

degrees of freedom ; its motion is compounded of that about two normal screws

whose pitch is different, but both of which lie in the fixed axis.

  A9. body three points of which are limited to a plane, has three degi'ees of

freedom ; its motion is compounded of vibrations about three nonnal screws

whose pitch is zero, and whose directions are perpendicular to the plane.

  A10. body rotating about a fixed point has three degrees of freedom; its

motion is compounded of \'ibrations about three normal screws whose pitch is zero,

and whose directions pass through the point.

 --N.B. The screws in this case may be conveniently called the normal axes.

AV. Rigid Body rotating about a Point, the Forces having a Potential.

   11. The body may be moved from one position to any other position by rotation

about a certain axis, passing through the point through a certain angle; this

axis and angle are called the axis of displacement and the angle of displacement

respectively.

  12. On an axis through the point, take a radius vector proportional to the small

angular velocity, which a small quantity of energy would be able to communicate to
the body about the axis. The quantity of energy being constant, the locus of this
point on different axes is the momenta! ellipsoid.

   13. On an axis through the point, take a radius vector proportional to the small

angle through which a small quantity of energy would be able to rotate the body
about the axis from its position of equilibrium against the forces. The quantity of

energy being constant, the locus of this point on different axes may be called the

ellipsoid of equal energy.

   14. The three common conjugate diameters of the momental ellipsoid and the
12 REPORT 1870.

ellipsoid of equal energy are the normal axes ; the hody would vibrate about each
of tliese axes, as about a fixed axis, and its motion is always compounded of vibra-
tions about these axes.

   15. The length of the simple pendulum isochronous with the vibration about
each normal axis is proportional to the square of the ratio of the corresponding
diameter in the ellipsoid of equal energy to that of the momental ellipsoid.

   16. The body is slightly disturbed from its position of rest by rotation about an
axis of displacement through an angle of displacement, and also by receiving a
small angular velocitj^ about an initial instantaneous axis ; this displacement and
velocity may be uniquely resolved into corresponding displacements and angular
velocities about the normal axes, and thus the motion of the body is completely

determined.

AVI. Jiiffid Body rotating about ajixed Point, Gravity being the only Force acting.
  A17. plane drawn in the momental ellipsoid conjugate to the vertical through

the point of supension is called the conjugate plane.

   18. For small oscillations to be possible, the instantaneous axis must initially lie
in the conjugate plane, and it will continue there throughout the motion.

   19. There are two normal axes which are thus constructed. Draw an ellipsoid
whose axes are in the same directions as, and proportional to, the squares of those of
the momental ellipsoid, the common conjugate diameters of the sections of these
ellipsoids made by the conjugate plane are the normal axes.

   20. The normal axes are not at right angles, except when the centre of gravity

lies in one of the principal planes, about the point of suspension ; but a vertical
plane dra-s\Ti through one normal axis is always perpendicular to a vertical plane

drawn through the other normal axis.
   21. The body would vibrate about either of these normal axes as about a fixed

axis, and any small oscillation is compounded of simple vibrations about the normal

axes.

   Special attention is directed to the theorem of paragraph 19, which contains the
solution of the conical pendulum under its most general form.

On an Unex^lahied Contradiction in Geometry. By W. K. Cliffoed, M.A.

Observations on BooWs ' Laws of Thovr/7it.' By the late R. Leslie Ellis.

                 Communicated hy tlie Rev. IIobeet Hakley, F.E.S.

It appenrs to be assumed in Chapter HI. Section 8, that in deriving one concep-

tion from another the mind always moves, so to speak, along the line of predica-

mcntation, always passes from the genus to the species. No doubt everything stands

in relation to something else, as the species to its genus, and consequently the sym-

bolical language proposed is in extent perfectly general, that is, it may be applied

to all the objects in the universe. But I venture to doubt whether it can express

explicitly all the relations between ideas which really exist, all the threads of con-

nexion which lead the mind from one to the other. It seems to me that the mind

passes from idea to idea in accordance with various principles of suggestion, and

that, in correspondence with the difi'erent classes of such principles of suggestion, we

ought to recognize different branches of the general theory of inference. This

leads me to a further doubt whether logic and the science of quantity can in any

way be put in antithesis to one another. From the notion of an apple we may

proceed to that of two apples, and so on in a process of aggregation which is the

foundation of the science of discrete quantity. Or again, from the notion of an

apple we may proceed  to that  of  a  red  apple                              and this movement of the mind in
                                                                           ;

lined predicamentali is the foundation of ordinary logic. But it is plain a jJriori

that there are other principles of suggestion besides these two, and the following

considerations lead me to think that there are other exercises of the reasoning

faculty than those included in the two sciences here referred to. In the first place,

certain inferences not included in the ordinary processes of conversion and syllo-

gism were recognized as exceptional cases by the old logicians. Leibnitz has
             --                                  --

                                              :

                 TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.          13

mentioned some with the remark that they do not depend upon the dictum dc
omni et nullo, but on something of equivalent evidence. The only question ia

whether we should be right in considering these cases as exceptions, and if they
are so, to what they owe their existence. One instance is the inversio relationis,
e. y., Noah is Shem's father, therefore Shem is Noah's son. Here we pass from the
idea of Shem to that of his father, and vice versd. The movement of the mind is
along a track distinct from that which it follows, either in algebra or what we com-
monly call logic. The perception of the truth of the inference depends on a recog-

nition of the correlation of the two ideas, father and son. Again, take a similar

instance. Prince Albert sat at the Emperor's right hand, therefore the Emperor

Howeat at Prince Albert's left hand.  shall we express such inferences symboli-

Ncally ? Let S be Shem, Noah,/ father, s son

                 N=/S,

                 S/=l.

Eliminating/ between these two equations, we get
                                                 S=sN.

/Nothing can be simpler than this ; but the symbols s, are of a distinct nature
from those employed in the * Laws of Thought ; ' for /A does not denote a

species of A, but an idea standing in a different relation to it. The distinction

between these two kinds of symbols becomes more manifest when we reflect that

Now/^ is not identical with /, but denotes "father of father," or grandfather.  I

do not see how these cases of inversion of relation are to be dealt with symbolically

without the introduction of such symbols. In the following examples I confine

myself to the cases afforded by relationship, and the succession of generations.

   Let A, B, C denote three persons, s son, g gi-andson ; then if J3 is A's son and
C is B's, C is A's grandson, which we may express symbolically by the following

equations :

                                        'B=sA, C=sB, s^=ff.

Eliminating B and s, we get C=//A. It would be more accurate in these examples
Bto introduce a symbol x or y to indicate that is only one of the possible sons of

A, an individual ranged under the species sA. I shall do that in the next example,

in which the word son is replaced by the more general term descendant, denoted
by d. The equations will now be

                 B=.r(?A, C =yf/B, d^=zd,

Bviz. a descendant not of the first generation. The result of eliminating now is,

                                                  C=yd.vdA
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

but by a principle about to be noticed dx=x'd, therefore C -- px'zdA, or C is in-

cluded in the class of descendants of A.

The principle just used forms one of the recognized examples of an inference not

lying within the domain of Aristotelian logic. It was called " transitio ex recto in

ohliquum." Whately, though he says nothing of its nature, gives in his praxis of
Aexamples one which depends upon it.
                                      negro is a man, therefore he who kills a

negro kills a man. Let this derived notion killing be denoted by/, which may

Nserve to indicate a general functional dependence, then Mand denoting man and

negro respectively, we have the following equations :

                 N=:rM,/r = :r/;
                  .·./N = .r/M,

or the killing of a negro is a kind of homicide. The evidence of the truth of the

equation /rs=.r/ is the same as that in favour of the equation xy=yx, when .rand
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2/

both belong to the kind of symbols used in the ' Laws of Thought.' I sliall not stop
to inquire into the limitations which it may perhaps require.

   The general truth of the equations

                 x'^=x and xy=yx

appears to suffer another exception in the case relative terms, that is, of adjectives

of which the interpretation is functional of the object to which they are applied.

A small St. Bernard dog is not simpliciter a small dog; the word meaning that

which is less than the medium size of the class of objects to which it is applied.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    '

Here neither s'^=s nor sx=xs. If we say tliat in order to save whole these equa-
tions we may employ a different symhol for every application of the adjective small,
how can we express the meaning which is common to them all, and in virtue of
which the word small exists as an element of language ?

   Diffident as I am with respect to all these remarks on a method in which I find
so much to admire, I am yet more so with respect to the following. But it seems
to me that we cannot say that

                                                         a;(l-.r)=0

expresses proprio vie/ore, that is, in virtue of antecedent conventions, what is called

the principle of contradiction.

In ordinary language we have words which, independently of this principle,

express negation ;  we say red, not red, and the like                                                                                                                                                 hut in the ' Laws of Thought
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

there is no other means of expressing not red than by \--x,x denoting red.

  Now the interpretation of this sjTnhol 1-- .r seems to me to bo given by the

principle of contradiction, and therefore I should rather say that the equation

=.r(l--.r)  is interpreted by that principle than that it expresses it. In accord-

ance with this view, the equation x- = x would appear to be independent of the

principle of conti'adiction.

On Boole^s ' Laws of TJiour/Jit.' By tJie Ecv. Eobeet Haeley, F.R.S.

This paper was intended as a supplement to some " Remai-ks on Boole's Mathe-

matical Analysis of Logic," which the author submitted to the Section at the

Nottingham Meeting, an abstract of which was printed in the Eeport for 186G.

(See Transactions of the Sections, pp. 3-G.)

  From the logical equation a:-=.r, the equation a- ^.r-=0 is derived by subtracting

x"^ from both members, and the result is put under the form .r(l -- a-)=Obythelaw

of distribution. It is to be observed, however, that at every stfep of the process

the principle of identity .v=x is assumed, and in Boole's iuterpretation of the final

result the same principle is used, for it is implied that the .r without the brackets is

identical with the x within. Further, in the final interpretation not only is the

principle of contradiction (or non-contradiction) emploj'ed, as Leslie EUis points

out in the latter part of his ' Observations,' but the principle of excluded middle ia

also employed.      1--For in interpreting  ,r to mean not -.r, it is tacitly assumed

that every one of the things of which the universe, represented by xmi^, is made

up, is either x or not x. It would thus appear that these three principles, identity,

contradiction, and excluded middle, arc incapable of being reduced to more elemen-
tary truths. They are axiomatic, and Boole made use of them imconsciously

in ii-aming his laws of logical interpretation. ('Laws of Thought,' chap. iii.

prop, iv.)

   In chap. iii. § 6, Boole, by three different methods, one of which is partly logical,
and the other two are wholly algebraical, deduces the equation

                                 /(l)/(0)=0

from the equation for the expansion or development of any logical functiony(a:), viz.

                              /(,r)=/(l)^+/(0)(l-^),

where /(.r) may or may not involve other class symbols than x. The latter equa-

tion is established in chap. v. § 10, by means of the principle that it is lawftil to
treat ,r as a quantative symbol susceptible only of the values and 1. But it is

worthy of notice that the fonner equation may be directly established by means

of the same principle. For, treating /('.r)=0 as an algebraic equation, of which

the root .r has only the values 1 and 0, we have at once, by the theory of equations,

                                 /(l)/(0)=0.

The influence of Boole's ideas may be traced in works apparently so diverse as

W.Professor  Stanley Jevons's ' Substitution of Similars,' Professor P. G. Tait's

' Quaternions,' and Sir Benjnmin Brodie's ' Calculus of Chemical Operations.' The

system of logic proposed by Mr. Jevons is closely analogous to, and in some respects

identical with, that given by Boole ; but it is distingaiished from the latter by the

rejection of the calculus of 1 and 0. In a little work entitled " Pure Logic, or the
               TKANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               15

Logic of Quality apart from Quantity," Mr. Jevonshas urged various objections to

certain parts of Boole's system, more particularly to the numerical calculus. The

author of this paper has briefly considered those objections in the concluding por-
tion of an article on " Boole's Life and Writings," which he contributed to the July

Number of the BritishQuarterly Review for 1866 (pp. 141-181).
   Hamilton's theory of quaternions, as expounded by Prof. Tait, has its logical basis

in principles which were tirst brought clearly to light in the com-se of Boole's remark-

able inquiries. No one can read the earlier chapters of Prof. Tait's ' Quaternions,'
and compare them with the earlier chapters of Boole's ' Laws of Thought,' without

being struck with the similarity, not to say the identity, of many of the processes

employed in both works. Treating of the properties of the quaternion symbols

S, K, V, the expoimder of Hamilton's system remarks, "It is cm-iovis to compare

the properties of these quaternion symbols with the Elective Symbols of Logic,

as given in Boole's wonderful treatise on the 'Laws of Thought,' and to think

that the same grand science of mathematical analysis, by processes remarkably

similar to each other, reveals to us tru^ths in the science of position far beyond the

powers of the geometer, and truths of deductive reasoning to which xmaided thought

could never have led the logician." (Tait's Quaternions, p. 50, footnote.)
   Sir Benjamin Brodie has endeavoured to do for chemistiy what Boole has done

--for logic, to reduce it under the domain of mathematics, using the term " mathe-

matics " in the enlarged sense, explained in the .author's former communication.

Of the validity of Sir Benjamin's proposed " method for the investigation, bv means

of symbols, of the laws of the distribution of weight in chemical change," it is not

necessary to speak here. But that method is interesting, as being undoubtedly the
iirst attempt to " free the science of chemistry from the trammels imposed upon it
by accumulated hj'potheses, and to endow it with the most necessaiy of all the in-

struments of progTessive thought, an exact and rational language." Sir Benjamin's

system was evidently suggested by Boole's ' Laws of Thought.' Whether the soil

into which he has transplanted Boole's ideas be congenial or not, remains to be

seen.

   But the most remarkable amplification of Boole's conceptions which the author
has hitherto met with is contained in a recent paper by Mr. C. S. Peirce, on the
"Logic of Relatives" (Memoirs of the American Academj-, vol. ix.). Mr. Peirce
divides logical terms into three grand classes. " The first embraces those whose

logical form involves only the conception of quality, and which therefore re-

present a thing simply, as 'a  .' These discriminate objects in the most rudi-

mentary way, whicli does not involve any consciousness of discrimination. They

regard an object as it is in itself as stech (quale) ; for example, as horse, tree, or
man. These are absolute terms. The second class embraces terms whose logical

form involves the conception of relation, and which require the addition of another

term to complete the denotation. These discriminate objects with a distinct con-
sciousness of discrimination. They regard an object as o^er against another, that

is, as relative ; as father of, lover of, or servant of. These are simjile relative terms.
The third class embraces terms whose logical form involves the conception of

bringing things into relation, and which require the addition of more than one
term to complete the denotation. They discriminate, not only with consciousness

of discrimination, but with consciousness of its origin. They regard an object as

, or buyer of  for             from  . These may be termed conjugative

terms." " Boole's logical algebra," says Mr. Peirce, " has such singular beauty, so

far as it goes, that it is interesting to inquire whether it cannot be extended over

the whole realm of formal logic, instead of being restricted to that simplest and

least useful part of the subject, the logic of absolute terms, which, when he wi-ote,

was the only formal logic known." The object of Mr. Peirce's paper is to show that
this extension is possible. Some account was given of the notation and processes

employed.

      On Linear Differential Equations. By W. H. L. Ettssell, F.B.S.

   The object of this paper was to explain certain discoveries made by the author
in linear difl'erential equations, and chiefly to solve the general equation of the wth

order, whenever that solution isof the form y = P", P and a being rational and

entire functions of (or).

On a Numencal Theorem, with practical applications.

                    By W. H. Walenn.

This novel and practical theorem is, " That if t be the tens', and u the units'

digit of a two-figure number, and 5 be any integer less than 10, then

       (10-- 8)H «<

has the same remainder to 8 as 10<-l-««."

   For {\0--b)t-\-u, when expanded by multiplication, becomes \Ot--U-\-u, or

(lQt+u) -- U; this latter expression only differs from ¥it-\-u by an exact number

of times 8, and therefore has the same remainder to 8 as 10<+m.

  When this theorem is adapted to other than two-figure numbei-s, the expression

(10 -- S)<+2«, by expansion, becomes

(10-8)»-ia+(10-8)''-'6+(10-8)''-3c-|-     +(10-8)^s-f-(10-8)i!-f-«,

if n= the number of digits or figures in the given number; for each time 10

occirrs as a factor in any term, it must be treated in the way above indicated.

   The remainder to any digit may be determined by means of the expression

(10 -- 8)<+M without the knowledge of any multiple of that digit. When the

arithmetical operation indicated by the formula {\0--b)t-\-u is resorted to, however

large the number may be that is operated upon, the said operation is repeated until

only one digit remains, thus yieldmg the remainder to 8 without the performance

of any division. When 8=9 the operation consists merely of the addition of the

digits of the given number, reducing the result from time to time to a single figm*e

as may be requisite, also by addition ; for other values of 8 less than 0, multiplica-
tion as well as addition is necessary. The name imitation has been given to this

class of operations, the remainders being umtates, and the diAisor (8) the base.
   Operations upon remainders being analogous to operations (of the same kind)

upon dividends, an operation (unitation) in which the base has any value less than

10 (and certain values above 10) becomes available to verify arithmetical operations.

Also the unitate of an unkno'mi number may be calculated from a known number

with which it is connected by certain known operations.

The following remarks will facilitate the practical use of the operations com-

prised imder the above-mentioned formulre, and will illustrate and suggest applica-

tions of the theorem that might otherwise remain dormant :

The general form of the notation to indicate the unitate of a number (.r) to the

base 8, is \] x=y, in which y is necessaril}"^ equal to or less than 8. As IJj.r is the

simplest series of miitates that are useful, the suffix is left out, thus U.r.

=a:=28(25=-25) 16G0-4, IT.r=Ul(4-5)=U(13-5) = 8; also U16G04 = 8.
        UU,.r = 7(U,4--U,2')=U,7(9-4)=7; also U,16604=7.

   Formulas involving direct operations in decimals may be checked in the same
way as other formulaj.

   Example :

   .r=(2-8--54)(51-o-f--5=--7^)=11617982.

m-=U(10-9)(2+U5=-U73)=Ul(2+7-l)=8.

   Formula3 involving indirect operations, whether of decimals or otherwise, must
have the remainders of di\'ision or other terminations of the process taken fully into

account.

also

       U(2-00o88+^) =U  (5+I)  = U^=l.

Scries of unitates have remarkable properties which fit them for practical use in

the verification of tables &c. Recurrence is a general and most valuable rule vt'ith

all series of unitates, and singular sequences are common. The series (to the base

By9) for the squares is 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9 ; 1, 4, 9, &c.  means of the series

for negative powers the unitates that correspond to certain circulating decimals

=may be assigned; for instance, - ·142857, 14, &c. has its imitate (to the base 9)

--equal to 4, has its unitate equal to 1, and so on.

   The expression (10 -- b)t-\-u also furnishes the means of obtaining imitates to

bases greater than 10, such as 11, 12, 99, 999, &c. For instance, by operating with

=alternate digits, Ug36053 U33ll.3=14.

   If the unitates (to various bases) of a number be given, it is possible to find the
number ; if 8 be less than 10, the number of unitates required fur the purpose wiU
(at least) be equal to the number of digits in the desired number. For instance,
required the two-figure number whose imitate to the base 9 is 5 and to the base
10, 4 ; this is found, by comparing the imitates of two-figure numbers to the said

bases, to be 14.
   Checking calculations, verifying tables, and ascertaining remainders to divisors

are tlierefore accomplished with ease by means of unitation.

On Hills and Dales. By J. Clerk Maxweli, LL.D., F.R.SS. L. 4" E.

    After defining level surfaces and contour-lines on the earth's surface, the author
showed that the only measiu-e of the height of a mountain which is mathematically

consistent with itself is foimd by considering the work done in ascending the
mountain from a standard station.

   By considering a level surface, such as that of the sea, which is supposed

gi-adually to rise by the addition of water from the level of the deepest sea-

hottom to the tops of the highest mountains, he showed that at first there is but
one wet region round the deepest bottom. Afterwards other wet regions appear at

other bottom points of the surface and continually enlarge. For every new wet
region there is a bottom ; and when two wet regions coalesce into oue there is a
point where the surface is level, but neither a top nor a bottom, and this may be

called a Bar. When a wet region, as the water rises, throws out arms and em-

braces within it a di-y region, there is another level point which may be called a

Pass. The wet region then becomes cyclic. When the water covers the top of the

island thus formed the wet region loses its cyclosis again, and at last, when aU the
tops are covered, the wet region extends over the whole globe. Heuqe the number
of mountain-tops is equal to the number of passes plus one, and the number of
bottoms is equal to the number of bars plus one.

   The author then considered lines of slope which are normal to the contour-lines.

In general a line of slope is terminated by a top on the one side and by a bottom on

the other. At a pass or a bar, however, there is a singularity. Two lines of slope can

be drawn through this stationary point ; one of these is terminated by two tops and
is a line of watershed, the other is terminated by two bottoms and is a line of
watercourse. The watershed intersects the watercourse at right angles.

   If we consider aU the watersheds which meet at the same mountain-top, each of
these will reach a pass or a bar. The watercourses, which also pass through these
points, form a closed boundary', which is that of the region occupied by all the lines
of slope which meet at the mountain -top. This region round the mountain is called

a Hill.

   In the same way there is a system of watersheds forming the hoimdary of a region

called a Dale, within which all the lines of slope run to the same bottom.

   The whole sui-face of the earth may be divided into Hills, the number of these

being the same as that of their Tops.

   By an independent division, the whole siu-face may be divided into Dales, each

Dale having a different Bottom.

   Besides this, we may, by superposing these divisions, consider the earth aa

divided into Slopes, each slope being bounded by two watersheds and two water-
com'ses, and being named from the top and the bottom between which all its lines

of slope run.

   The number of Slopes is shown to be equal to the total number of Tops, Bottoms,
Passes, and Bars minus two.

     An Investigation of the MatJiematical TJieory of Combined Streams.

       By W. J. Macqtjorh Eaotone, C.E., LL.D., F.R.SS. L. Sf E*

 _ The object of the investigation, of which this is an abstract, is to extend to com-
binationsof any number of streams of fluid, whether liquid, vaporous, or gaseous,

the principles which have been applied to combinations of two streams by previous

authors, and especially by Professor Zeuner, in his treatise entitled " Das Locomo-
tivenblasrohr " (Ziirich, 1863). Several component streams of fluid, each coming

through its own supply-tube and nozzle, are led in directions pai-allel to each other

into one end of a cylindrical space called the jimction-chamber, in which they

mingle  so  as                        to  form  a  resultant  stream                                    and that resultant stream  escapes  from
                                                                                                     ;

the other end of the junction -chamber through an orifice called the throat. The

dynamical principle upon which the motion depends is that of the equality of

impulse and momentum. The aggregate momentum per second of the component

streams is found by midtiplying the mass of fluid which comes from each nozzle in

a second by its velocity, and" adding together the products. The momentum of the

resultant stream is the product of the mass of fluul discharged from the throat in a

second, into the velocity at the throat. The diflerence of these two momenta is

equal to the impulse per second exerted in the junction -chamber, which impulse is
found by multiplying the area of the throat by the difference between the inten-

sities of the pressure at the nozzle-end and at the throat-eud of the chamber respec-

tively. If there is a gain of momentum, the pressure at the thi-oat is less than at

the  nozzles                          if there is a loss  of momentum, tne                              pressure  at  the throat is greater
                                   ;

than at the nozzles.

   There is always a loss of energy, which is expended in producing eddies, imlesa                                                                1

the velocities of the component and resultant streams are equal to each other.
The amount of that loss can be calculated in any given case by the help of the

principle already stated ; and that principle being expressed in the fonn of an

equation, and taken together with another equation expressing the equality of the
mass discharged at the throat to the sum of the masses which come through the

nozzles, affords the means of solving various problems as to combined streams.

         On the Tliermodynamic Acceleration and Retardation of Streams.

         By "W. J. MAcaxjOEN Eankine, O.E., LL.D., F.R.SS. L. 6f E.f

   The object of this paper is to state in a more general and comprehensive form

than has hitherto been done to my knowledge, a thermodynamic and hydi'odyna-

mic principle of which many particular cases are well known and understood.
That principle may be stated as follows :

mumIn a steady stream of am/Jlia'd, the abstraction of heat at and near places of mint-

        2n-essure, and the addition of heat at ami near phtces of maxintiim pressure, tend
to produce acceleration ; the addition of heat at and near jilaces of minimum pressure,

and the abstraction of heat at and near places of maximum pressure, tend to produce

retardation : and in a circulating stream the quantity of etiergy ofjiow gained or lost in
each complete circuit is equal to the quantity/ of energy lost or gained in the form of
heat; and in the absence offriction, the ratios home hy that quantity to the heat added
and the heat abstracted (of which it is the difference) are regidated hy the ahsolute
temperatures at which heat is added and abstracted, agreeably to the second late of
thermodynamics.

   Amougst particular cases of the thermodynamic acceleration and retardation of
streams, the following may be specified.

   Acceleration by the addition of heat at and near a place of maximum pressm-e :

the di-aught of a furnace ; and the production of disturbances in the atmosphere in
regions where the ground is hotter than the air.

   Retardation by the abstraction of heat at and near a place of maximum pressure :

the dying away of atmospheric disturbances in regions where the gi-ound is colder

than the air.

   Acceleration by the abstraction of heat at and near a place of minimum pressure :
the injector for feeding boilers, in which a jet of steam, being liquefied by the
abstraction of heat, is enabled not only to force its way back into the boiler, but to

sweep a current of additional water along with it ; also, to a certain extent, the

ejector-condenser.

   The conduction of heat from the parts of a stream where the pressure and tem-
perature are highest to the parts of the same stream where the pressuj^e and tempera-
tm"e are lowest, produces, according to the foregoing principles, a gradual and per-
manent retardation of the stream, independently of the agency of friction ; and this
is accompanied by the production of heat to an amount equivalent to the lost

energy of flow.

      Report of the Liverpool Compass Committee. By John T. Towson.

   The last Report read to the British Association was in 1859, at Aberdeen, The
most important result that had occm'red since that time was the cessation of the
difference of opinion that liad previouslj' existed between those connected with the
royal navy and with the mercantile marine, the former advocating the use of a
table of errors, the latter mechanical compensation on the principle introduced by
the Astronomer Royal. In 1854:, Mr. Towson said his advocacy of compensation
was scarcely tolerated by some Members of the Association; but in 1869, Mr.
Archibald Smith, one of the Authors of the 'Admiralty Manual on Compass
Matters,' stated before the Royal Society that the question of mechanical compen-
sation of the compass had materially changed in its aspect of late years, and he
advocates its use in most cases. The next matter was of minor importance, but
proves that neither a table of errors nor mechanical compensation can be relied on
within the limit of three degi'ees. If the ship be swimg to the north or south,
from left to right, the needle wiU be drawn three degi-ees more to the right than it
would be if the ship were swung in the contrary direction. The most valuable
result which has been brought about within the last year is the establishment of a
voluntary examination of masters of iron ships in the theory and practice of com-

pass-deviation.

         On Non-tidal Variations of the Sea-level on the Coast of India.
                                      By W. Paekes.

   This paper gave some results based on tidal observations taken at Kurrachee,
near the mouth of the Indus. It described a graphical process for eliminating the
changes of sea-level due to semidiurnal and diumal xmdulations, thus exhibiting
only those which are due to tides of long period or other causes. Referring to the
diagram for the month of November 1868, which is appended to the Report of the
Tidal Committee in this volume, it will be seen that the black dots representing the
successive heights of high and low water range themselves in four waving lines
along the paper. The line which represents " half-tide level " was so drawn as to
be the locus of a series of ordinates, each of which is a mean of the corresponding

ordinates of these four lines.

day, 365 values of half-tide level were obtained for the year, varj-iug from 25 inches

above the mean to 10 iuehes below, or to a total extent of 35 inches. These 365

values were tabulated and grouped successively as follows :
   1st. The averages for the calendar months respectively were obtained. These

do not indicate any sensible annual or semiannual tide.
   2nd. The same figures were next grouped according to the limations, so as to

obtain the mean height for every day of the moon's age. The figures showed that

there was no sensible tide following tliese periods.

   3rd. Next they were grouped according to the declination, so as to obtain the
mean height on the days when the moon was crossing the equator from north to

south, and on each successive day till she returned to the same position. From

this it appeared that the water was slightly higher when the moon was in north
than when she was in south declination; and a similar result was obtained by

treating the values for the year 1867 in the same manner, but the difference (1| to

2 inches) was too small to justify any conclusion.

4th. The^ were then grouped according to the moon's distance from the earth.

The means for 1868-69 showed a slight elevation when the moon was near apogee,

and a depression when near perigee                                                                                                                                                                   but this result was not confirmed for 1867.
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

From these trials it was concluded that there were no sensible tides of long period

due to solar or lunar influence, and that the causes of the variations must be sought

for elsewhere. So far, however, the result has been only negative. The range was

too great to be attributed to atmospheric pressure, and the want of any persistent

elevation during the south-west monsoon showed that they could not be attributed

(directly, at least) to local winds.

  An extraordinaiy rise took place in June 1869 to the extent, when at the maxi-
mum, of 25 inches. The sea-level was unusually high for about seven days, during

which there was gi-eat heat and an unsettled appearance in the weather, but no de-

Afinite atmospheric disturbance.  similar effect was observed at about the same

period in 1868, but not in 1870,

 On the Present State of the Question relative to 'Lunar Activity or Quieseenee.
                                By W. R. BiRT, F.B.A.S.

   From the time of Schrciter the question of change on the moon's surface has
been more or less agitated ; the ' Selenotopographische Fragmente ' contain nume-
rous instances of what he considered to be changes of a temporary character, and a
few of a more permanent nature, as the formation of new craters. It is, however,

notorious that he failed to establish the fact of a decided change in any one

instance ; nor is this to be wondered at when we consider the paucity of the mate-
rials he had at his command. Notwithstanding the comparative neglect into which
the observations recorded in the 'Fragments' have fallen and the judgment passed
upon them bv some of the best known selenographers, there can be no question
that they embody the results of zealous and persevering attention to the moon's

surface, and ought not to be parsed over in the examination of any gi^-en spot the

history of which we are desirous of becoming aquainted with during the earliest

pei'iod of descrijjiioe observational selettography.

   The labom-s of Schroter's successors, Lohrmann and Beer and Madler, have
added gi-eatly to the number of objects, either as delineated on their maps or
referred to in their letterpress. Lohrmann appears to have carefully studied
Schroter's results, as we find him quoting the measures obtained by Schroter in
several instances. On examining the results of the two greatest selenographical
works of the present century and comparing the one with the other, we find pre-
cisely the same kind of phenomena presenting themselves, which in a great measure
perplexed Schroter ; but as Lohrmann and Madler worked independently of each
other, and Madler evidently had a very low idea of the value of the preceding
labours of Schi-oter, these phenomena passed unnoticed at the time. Upon consult-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      21

ing the three works for elucidating the history of any given object, such results as

Anthese are frequently obtained.   object is found in Schrciter designated by a

Greek or other character, and its appearance described in his text. This object

may be altogether omitted by Lohrmann, but given on Beer and Madler's map ; and
objects are by no means rare which may be found on Lohrmann, but omitted by

Beer and Miidler, and vice versa.

Were the results of the laboui's of Julius Schmidt during a period of nearly

thirty years given to the public, there can be no doubt that our knowledge of seleno-

graphy would be greatly advanced. His chart must contain a large proportion of

the objects previously recorded by Schroter, Lohrmann, and Beer and Madler ; and,

judging from the instances already alluded to, of apparent omissions by one or other

of the above-named observers, it is highly probable that the number of such

instances would be much increased. The value of his measures (4000) of the alti-

tudes of lunar mountains for comparison with or addition to those of Schroter and

Madler cannot admit of a doubt. His published catalogue of rills is very valuable

in this respect. It is to Schmidt that we are indebted for one of the most import-

ant announcements bearing on the subject of lunar activity, that of a change in the

crater Linne, "which," says Madler (Report Brit. Assoc. 1868, p. 517), "has

hitherto offered the only authentic example of an admitted change." He had pre-

viously said (same Report), " what has lately been observed in the crater Linne

proves at all events that there real changes have taken place, and that too imder

circumstances even visible to us." Further on, however, the great selenographer

remarks that on the 10th of May, 1867, his eye having imdergone an operation for

cataract, he attempted an observation oi Linne in the heliometer of the observatoi-y

at Bonn, and found it shaped exactly, and with the same throw of shadow, as he
remembered to have seen it in 1831. The'·' event," he says, " of whatever nature

it might have been, must have passed away without leaving any trace observable

by me." The doubt still hanging over this object is well known, and it may be

regarded as furnishing at least one of the instances of the present state of the ques-

tion of activity. The uncertainty attaching to the question of change in this parti-

cular instance mainly arises from the diificidty of deciding upon the accuracy or

otherwise of the delineations of Lohrmann and Beer and Madler, although both

describe it as sho-s^ang a diameter of five or six English miles. Generally speak-

ing, the observations between October 1866 and July 1870 all agree in its present

appearance, differing greatly from that which it must have presented according to

the delineations and descriptions of the two selenographers just named ; also that

no change of a physical character has taken place in it during the 3| years it has

been under constant observation.

It has been supposed that photography would solve all such difficulties, and that

photograms of the lunar surface taken imder similar angles of illumination and

visual ray would agree with each other ; but here, again, precisely the same diffi-

culties present themselves which perplexed Schroter, and which have been met

with in comparing Lohrmann's and Beer and ^Madler's works. Objects figured by

the earlier selenogi-aphers occur on some photograms, but not on others of about

the same phase of illumination. There appears to be an agency capable of affecting

the visibility of objects, rendering them indistinct or innsible on some occasions,

while on others they are distinctly seen on the photograms. Whatever opera-

tions may have taken place in the crater Linne, producing phenomena the recur-

rence of which is rare, in all the examples above mentioned, from Schroter's time
to the present we have phenomena of a different character, exceedingly difficult of

explanation, and constituting an important element in the solution of the question

of present activity or quiescence ; for unless it be fully proved that all these instances
depend upon ch.anges of visual and illuminating angles, a strong suspicion will

exist of tneir being more immediately connected with the moon itself. To effect

such a proof, however, is a matter of no small difficulty. Madler alludes to the per-

formance of calculations of the most varied kind as necessary for the delineation

of lunar featiu-es ; and in the case before us the calculation of several elements for

each sepa7-ate observation (and they are very numerous) is absolutely essential for

the purpose of referring the phenomena observed to changes of illumination and

visual ray. Calculations of this kind have not yet been made to any great extent,
22 BEPORT--1870.

and the consequence is that the entire question remains involved in doubt. Duiing

the last seventeen months as many as 1227 observations of the spots on Plato alone
have been made ; and although the vaiying state of the earth's atmosphere affects
in no slight degree the visibility of such delicate objects, phenomena are presenting
themselves which call for a much more rigorous treatment than has yet been
accorded to them. The affirmation of change on, or quiescence of, the moon's sur-

face must depend, not upon the accumulation of desultory and undiscussed obser-
A^ations, but upon such as are undertaken on a weU-an-anged system and discussed
with reference to every known agency capable of affecting them. The present
state of the question is therefore one of doubt, one that calls for observation of the
most vigorous character and discussion of the most rigorous nature to settle it.
Observation of late has been tending towards a registration of minute detail detected
on the moon's smface, but discussion in various ways is behind the requirements
of selenography, and until it can keep pace with observation the doubt alluded to
above must remain.

         On the Distribution of Cometic Perihelia. By A. S. Davis, B.A.

    The hypothesis that those comets whose orbits are undistinguishable from para-
bolas are moving in hyperbolic, non-periodic orbits, leads to the following theore-
tical law for the distribution of their perihelia. The number of comets within any
 distance from the sun is proportional to that distance. This follows from an inves-

tigation contained in a paper on cometary orbits published in the Philosophical

Magazine for September 1870. The first object of the present paper was to show
 that the actual distribution of the perihelia of parabolic and hyperbolic comets is
 probably in accordance with this law. For this puii^ose the numbers of comets
 having perihelion distances lying respectively between 0-0 and 0-1, between 0-1
 and 0'2, and so on, were ascertained. It was found that, instead of these numbers
 being nearly equal, they were respectively 11, 10, 14, 17, 11, 33, 18, 23, 21, 24, 15,
 10, 8, 4, 5, 1, 1. It was then shown that this want of agreement with the theore-
 tical law of distribution might arise from the fact that the probability that a comet
 wiU be observed depends upon the magnitude of its perihelion distance, those
 comets being most likely to be observed which have perihelion distances rather less
 than the radius of the earth's orbit. That this cause does produce a considerable

--effect upon the apparent manner of distribution of perihelia was shown thus : The

 known comets were arranged in three groups containing respectively those which
 appeared before 1750, between 1750 and 1800, and between 1800 and 1865. The
 nmubers representing the distribution of perihelia for these three groups were re-

 spectively

                                 1, 3, 2, 8, 3, 16, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2, &c.,
                               4, 2, 6, 3, 7, 7, 7, 10, 6, 7, 5, 2, 1, &c.,

                                 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 10, 7, 6, 12, 11, 8, 8, 7, 4, &c.,

 showing that the distribution of the perihelia of a later gi-oup are much more nearly
 in accordance with the theoretical law than that of an earlier group, owing doubt-
 less to the fact that the probability that a comet would be detected was formerly
 more dependent upon the magnitude of its perihelion distance than it now is. It
 seems probable that if all the comets which visit the sun were obseiTed, the distri-

 bution of their perihelia would be nearly in accordance with the above-stated theo-
 retical law. Such an accordance the author thought would be an argiunent in
 favour of the theory that the parabolic comets are non-periodic.

    In the second part of the paper the author showed that a statement made by
 Prof Kirkwood regarding the distribution of cometic perihelia was incorrect. Prof.
 Kirkwood, on finding that the longitudes of the perihelia of a large proportion of

 those comets with \evy small perihelion distances do not differ greatly from the
 longitude of the solar apex, concluded that this fact was due to a crowding of the
 perihelia about the solar apex, produced, he thought, by the sim's motion in space.
 Prof. Kii'kwood had not shown that the latitudes of the perihelia were nearly the
 same as the latitude of the solar apex. The author found, by marking upon a celes-
 tial globe the positions of the perihelia of all parabolic and hyperbolic comets with

perihelion distances less than '5, that the perihelia of comets with very small peri-
helion distances exhibit no greater tendency to crowd about the solar apex than
comets with larger perihelion distances.

                 On Solar Spots observed during the past Eleven Years,

                     By the Rev. Fkedeeick Howlett, F.R.A.S.

    The paper was illiisti-ated by numerous veiy carefully executed drawings, enlarged
 from others which had been micrometrically observed and drawn at the telescope,
 chiefly by means of projecting the sim's image on a screen. It was well known

 how lich the years 1859 and 1860 were in solar spots ; and the eleven-year period

 was again being sti'ikingly corroborated by the nimiber and size of the groups and

 individual spots of the present year, and which may be expected to prevail until

 1871. Magnificent groups which appeared in the sun's northern hemisphere in
 March, April, and August, in almost precisely the same heliographic latitude and
 longitude, would apparently seem to evince that the disturbing causes, whatever

--they were, had localized themselves on the disk not, however, without long

 inteivals of comparative repose. The forms assimied by the faculte were described
by the author, who felt convinced that they were attached, for the time being, to
 the photosphere, and that they were not clouds floating above it ; otherwise they
 would frequently impinge on the penumbrse in ways very different from those in

 which, in point of fact, they are seen to occur. If they consist of simply photo-
 spheric matter, however, it would seem to be in some compressed or other^vise
 peculiar manner ; inasmuch as the coarser mottling, so plainly to be distingaiished
 on all other parts of the sun's suiface, can never be detected on the faculse, and
 especially on those masses enclosed more or less at times within the receding mar-

gins of the penumbra}. Dr. Huggins, however, has detected the finer or rice-grain
specks of light in some of the more diffused forms of the faculse. There is appa-
rently no dii-ect relationship between the amount of solar-spot disturbance and the

terrestrial magnetic storms. The author, however, has suggested the possibility of
there being some degree of coiTelation between groups of a peculiarly cyclonic
arrangement and unusual magnetic disturbances ; none, or next to none, of the spots

--had been found to possess any tendency to rotate as it were on an axis as has,

however, been occasionally witnessed by other observers. An instance was given
(illustrated by a drawing) how a diff"used penumbral speck was observed to draw

ill towards the neighbouring umbra of a solar spot at the rate of 12 seconds of arc
in four hom's, which is equivalent to about 660 yards per second (and closely
similar to observations of the same kind by Chacornac). As the speck drew in
towards the umbra it assumed a continually more narrow and wedge-shaped form
(the apex towards the du-ection of advance), and which, therefore, might well be
taken to indicate that down-rush into the umbra aforesaid insisted upon by Mr.
Norman Lockyer. Assuming, as the author does, that the spots are depressions in
the solar photosphere, filled up by the solar gaseous atmosphere, this is evinced, 1st,
by the oi-dinary testimony of the eye ; 2udly, by the stereoscopic effect obtained by
Mr. De La Rue's photogi-aphs of spots taken at intervals of about two days ; 3rdly,
by the foreshortening of the penumbra of a neat circvdar spot, alternately on the right

--and left side, as it first comes on, and then passes off" the disk a phenomenon first

noticed by Dr. Wilson in the last century ; and 4thly, by the elegant spectro-baro-
metric e\'idence (as the author termed it), whereby the progressive thickening of
the dark solar absorption-lines, as they pass successively over the spectrum of the
photosphere, penumbra, and imibra, seemed to prove an increasing density and
depth of an absorbing solar atmosphere. It is, however, urged by Kirchhoff", Donati,
and some others (and in a measm-e admitted by Browning) that like effects simi-
lar to those four above enimierated might be produced were the spots cloudy

condensations, and not depressions. The author called attention to a delicate way

(not readily to be noticed without projecting the sun's image on a screen) in which

a fine trailing serpentine arrangement of minute specks of penumbral matter may
be sometimes seen either following in the wake of a large spot, or meandering

amidst a group of spots, indicating the resolution of two or more forces, partly,

perhaps, cyclonic, and partly centrifugal, as connected with the sun's axial rotation.

       On Shooting-stars. By the Eev. E. Main, M.A., F.E.S., F.R.A.S.

   The author presented to the Ai=sociation the observations of meteors and shooting-
stars made almost exclusively by Mr. Lucas, at the Observatory, during the past
year. The whole number of meteors seen and observed during the year is about
300, of which, of course, a considerable number belong to the November and August
groups. Next to these, the month of October seems to be the most fruitful, while,
on the contrary, in January, February, and March scarcely any were seen. This,
however, may be due to the cloudy state of the sky which generally prevails at
Oxford in the early part of the year. Of those observed, more than fifty were as
bright or brighter than stars of the first magnitude six were as bright as Jupiter

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

one, observed on November 4, 1869, was estimated as equal to one-sixth of the full
moon ; and one, on December 29, as equal to one quarter, the sky being overspread

in the latter case by light clouds. Two remarkable meteors were seen on Novem-

ber 6, one of which was observed (by a person not connected with the Observatory)

to burst with noise near the north-west horizon. On July 8 one was seen to burst,

though the sky was so overcast with nimbus cloud that no star could be seen.

On Faure's Battery. By C. Becker.

Faure's element is a modification of that known as Bimsen's, the poles consisting

of carbon iu strong nitric acid and amalgamated zinc in dilute sulphuric acid. In

Bunsen's ordinary form of carbon element the carbon pole is immersed in a vessel

holding a considerable quantity of nitric acid, which, as it becomes deoxidized by

the electrolytic action of the current, liberates nitrous-acid gas, which rises into the

air, rendering it unwholesome to breathe and destructive to most metallic apparatus

in its neigliboiu-hood. The purjiose of Faure's battery is to obviate those draw-

backs. This is effected by confining the nitric acid inside the carbon pole, and al-

lowing only sufficient acid to percolate through it in order to keep up the necessary

electrolytic action of the element. The carbon pole is made in the form of an ordi-

nary bottle, and is provided with a carbon or platinum stopper to which the binding-

screw of the pole is attached. This bottle, which at once fulfils the functions of

pole and porous diaphragm, is placed concentrically in the interior of a cylinder of

amalgam.ated zinc; and the whole is contained in an earthenware jar. When set

up for action the bottle is nearly filled with nitric acid, and the space containing the

zinc between the bottle and the outer jar to the required height with sulphuric

acid. The slight liberation of gas within the bottle causes a sufiicient pressure to

be exerted upon the nitric acid to force it gi-adually through the carbon.

In this way the exterior of the carbon pole remains immersed in a very thin layer

of nitric acid immediately opposite the zmc, which is in course of dissolution of the

dilute sulphuric acid. In point of constancy the element is superior either to

Bunsen's or Grove's, because the body of nitric acid remaining protected within

the bottle does not become weakened as in the case with those forms of element in

which the fluids are exposed in larger quantities and separated by porous

diaphragms. It acts also entirely without any disengagement of gas into the air, so

Athat it may be used in any room without disagreeable consequences.         variety

of forms might no doubt be given to these elements, which would enable them to

fulfil the desired object. Those exhibited were designed and manufactured by

Messrs. Elliot Brothers, and are found to be convenient for experimental purposes

aa well as for use in telegraph ofiices.

     On an Induction-coil, spedcdly arranged for use in Spectrum Analysis,

                             By John Beowning, F.B.A.S.

  When an induction-coil is used for the purpose of burning metals, it is necessary

to interpose one or more I^eyden jars in the current. Such an arrangement though
efficient is inconvenient. The glass jars are liable to fracture, are bulky, and re-
quire to be dry to perform -well ; and the wires connecting them with the coil are

m the way and liable to derangement.

   To obviate these difficulties I constructed a form of apparatus which consists es-
sentially of a flat mahogany box filled with plates of ebonite, which are coated on
each side with tinfoil to within an inch of the edges. The contrivance generally

used for holding the metal or containing the gas under examination is packed inside

the lid of the box. When in use, this fits into a hollow screw on the top of the box.

To set this apparatus in motion, it is only necessary to carry a fine vnre. from each
of the terminals of the induction-coil and insert it in the connexions provided at
each end of the box, as these are connected with the tinfoil with which the ebonite

plates are coated.

   Mr. Spottiswoode suggested that there should be a contrivance added, by which

a greater or less number of the coated plates may be brought into action at -will.

This arrangement is very useful, as it enables the temperature of the spark to be

regulated.

   The simplest and best method of employing the coated ebonite plates, however,
is to place them in the base of the induction-coil, vmderneath the ordinary con-

denser, and connect them with the terminals. When thus arranged, the dense thick

spark may be obtained from any substance placed between the terminals of the coil,
or in any apparatus which may be attached to them, and a great economy of time

is eflected.

On the Maximum amount of Magnetic Power wMcli can he develojyed by a
                 given Galvanic Battery. By H. Hightoit.

The author's object was to show that by means of any galvanic battery whatever

electro-magnets might be made capable of sustaining any amount of weight without

limit. It was shown, both by mathematical formulae and experiment, that this was

the case, as also that a constant weight could be sustained, while the expenditure

of zinc in the battery could be at the same time continually diminished without

limit. In the discussion which followed, it was pointed out that this was a mere

power of sustaining weights, and not an energy such as could be applied to working

an electro-magnetic  engine                             for that if  the magnets were used  to work  an  engine,
                                                     ;

the currents produced by the reaction would cause an increased consumption of zinc.

               Letter from Dr. Joule, F.E.S., on a New Dip-Circle.

 My --ueab Sin, I communicated to the Exeter Meeting of the Association'a short

account of a new dip-circle, the peculiarity of wliich consisted in the suspension of
the axis of the needle by filaments of silk, of which the extremities were hung from
the arms of a delicate balance beam. I had hoped to exhibit the instrument to the

Section, but have found myself unable to attend the Meeting. It may, however,

be interesting to magnetic observers if I state that my experience during the year

has fuUy borne out the superiority of the new inclinometer over the ordinary fonn
of instrument. The facility of observation with it is such that six complete obser-

vations of the dip can be obtained in one hour, the average error of a single observa-

tion being a small fraction of a minute of arc. I am now giving still further deli-
cacy to the instrument by substituting spider-threads for silk, and am obviating the

danger of rust by using platina for the axis of the needle instead of steel, the softness

of the former metal being unobjectionable since the agate-plates are dispensed with.

for without altering the position of any part of the apparatus, and the metal still

continuing to burn, you simply have to uncover the opening, which gives you the

useful adjimct to the instrument, consisting of a small sh ding-tube, to one end of

which is fixed a piece of dark ground glass and to the other a lens ; these are so
adjusted that a perfect image of the carbon-points can be seen by the operator ou

the dark glass without openmg the lantern or admitting stray light into the room

and by having a line ruled in the ground glass central with the various optical

--arrangements and simply watching the image there produced, the lamp can be so

adjusted as to keep the light absolutely central a desideratum every one will admit

who has had to use a microscope or polariscope with the electric light. Within

the lantern is fixed a small gas jet to enable the operator readily to change tho

carbon-points, &c.

The shifting-motion of the flange is, for the pui-pose of adjusting the angle of the

openings, to suit the different distances of the lantern from the screen ; and as one

lantern is all that is required, there is very little obstruction to the view.

 On a new Field of Magnetic Besearch. By Tkedebick H. VAELEr, F.B.A.S.

  A permanent magnet was exhibited, which displayed the action of magnetism

upon the crystallization of iron. The author referred to this fact as affording a
means for the futui-e investigation of magnetic phenomena, and also showed that
diamagnetic substances could be crystallized in magnetic fields, and thus would

define permanently the action of magnetism on the crystallization of magnetic and

diamagnetic metals. He expressed his belief that, ii-om experiments commenced

in the year 1858 and others conducted in 1870, electricity and magnetism con-
joined would produce permanent magnetic structures, shovsong in a solid form the
lines and nature of magnetic force.

On a Constant Battery. By Fredeeick H. Vaelet, F.B.A.S.

The author exhibited a new form of batteiy, designed by Mr. Octavius Varley,

for the purpose of removing the defects of the otherwise constant battery of the

late Professor Dauiell. In this form of battery the porous chamber, which has been

the som-ce of all the trouble, is removed. The battery comprises a water-tight

compartment for the copper-salt, a connecting column of fluid, and a compartment

for tbe zinc-salt. These are so arranged that, whilst the electro-chemical con-

tinuity is completed at the top of the copper-chamber, no intermixture of the salts

can take place                                                         convection-cm-rents, which are   the      great  source  of   intermixtm'e,

another. Whilst economy of the copper-salt is effected, greater uniformity and

higher potential is maintained. The zinc plate is found to work out to the very
last, bemg kept free from the coating of copper to which aU batteries hitherto

constructed are liable.

          A Magnetic Paradox. By S. Alfred Vablet, Assoc. Inst. C.E.

The author stated that the instrument which had been called a magnetic paradox

(because the phenomenon it presented was the apparent repulsion of iron by a mag-

net) consisted of a compound magnet in a box, and when pieces of iron were placed

over the poles on the box they became magnetic by induction, and were attracted

by the magnet ; but if a bar of soft iron, not in itself magnetic, were approached

near to the pieces of iron, the pieces of iron leap away from the box and become

attached to the soft iron bar. The effect produced was stated to be due to the fact

that mametic force was transmitted by induction; when the soft iron bar was ap-

proached to the pieces of iron, the magnetic forces resident in them, which had been

separated and rendered active by the magnet on the box, developed the magnetic

forces resident in the soft iron bar, and consequently it followed (the resistance

which soft iron opposes to magnetic polarization being so small that it may be here

disregarded) that as the dual forces resident in iron are equal (and the one force

cannot be called into being without equally developing the other) when the bar is

approached nearer to the pieces of iron than the poles of the magnet, they are at-

tracted away from the box by the superior attraction exerted by the soft iron bar.

It was shown that when pieces of iron were placed direct upon the poles of the

magnet, they could be removed by the superior atti-action of the soft iron bar over

that of the magnet ; the explanation of this effect was stated to be the iron bar
collected the lines of magnetic force issuing from the magnets, and the magnetism

developed in the iron bar was more localized than in the magnetized bars compo-

sino;     the  mamet  in  the  box.

September 1864'the author was requested to construct a trigger for discharging a

time-ball to be erected at Port Elizabeth ; and as he considered the intervention of

any relay or secondary apparatus to be objectionable, he determined, if possible, to

construct the trigger sensitive enough to be discharged by the batteries in the Cape

Town Observatoiy ; and in its construction he adopted a modification of a principle

first introduced by Professor Hughes in his printing telegi-aph (described at the

a very small amoimt of polarization in the opposite direction was necessary to re-

Sir Thomas Maclear, it appears ttat the time elapsing between the time-current
leaving the Observatory at Cape Town and the receipt at Cape Town of the signal

announcing the falling of the ball is only -j'j- of a second. What is being daily done
in the Cape can, however, be best summed up by a short quotation from a letter

received from Sir Thomas Maclear, giving an account of the successful inaugura-
tion of this signal. After detailing the general arrangements, Sir Thomas goes on

to state :

  A" few tentative signals having proved satisfactory, the ' preface ' was issued

from the Observatory at ten minutes before one o'cIock, and at the instant of one
o'clock the Observatory time-ball clock closed the circuit, discharging the Obser-

 On the Mode of Action of Lightning on Telegraphs, and on a Neiv Method of

   constructing TeJegraph-coils. By S. Alfred Yaeley, Assoc. Inst. C.E.

   The author stated that in the early days of electric telegraphy lightning-protec-
tors were used to protect the coil-wires in telegraph offices ; the general type of the
protector adopted was an insulated pointed conductor connected to the line-wire,
and in close proximity to a metallic conductor leading to the earth. At a subse-
quent date the use of lightning-protectors in telegraph offices was practically aban-
doned, as they were fomid not to prevent the fusion of the coil-wires, or only
exceptionally ; for although the lightning would leap across the space of air sepa-
rating the insulated conductor from the earth-conductor, an electrical discharge
also passed through the coils and frequently fused them.

  When lightning-storms occur in the neighbourhood of telegraph-wires, although
the wires may not be actually struck, powerful currents are induced in the wires
these currents may in some cases be sufficiently strong to fuse the instrument coils,

but they more frequently simply demagnetize, and as often reverse the magnetism
of the magnetic needles which are situated in the coils of needle-telegraph instru-

ments.
    Needle telegi-aphs are largely used on railways for train signalling, and the de-

magnetization or the reversal of the magnetism in these instruments is very serious,
as the safety of the train depends in a great degree upon the correct working of the
signalling instruments. In 1866 the author introduced instruments which he con-
siders to fulfil in a great degree the conditions to be desired in needle telegraphs.
In these instruments the case, the bearings, and the blocks which limit the motion
of the handle are made of cast iron in one solid piece, so there are no parts to be
shaken loose by rough usage. The magnetic needles inside the coils, instead of
being made of tempered steel magnetized, are made of soft iron, and are rendered
magnetic by induction from permanent magnets in the neighbourhood of the coils

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and as they are magnetic only by virtue of the permanent magnets in their proxi-

mity, the influence of powerful currents induced by lightning can only be momen-

tary.

   The coils are protected from fusion by means of a novel protector termed a

"lightning-bridge," as it forms a bridge for high tension electricity to pass over.

It was well known that high tension electricity would leap across a small space of
air in preference to passing throughout the length of a coil of wire ; and it was

--stated this arose from the momentary resistance the wire opposes to polarization

or magnetization, a resistance probably approaching to infinite resistance during

an infinitely small interval of time ; and from this cause, even in a vacuum protec-
tor, where the pointed conductors are enclosed in an exhausted chamber, the
main discharge will leap across a space of air separating the insulated conductor
and the earth conductor outside the exhausted chamber. The author, when expe-

rimenting with electric currents of varjdng degrees of tension, observed the very
great resistance which a loose mass of powder of conducting matter opposed to
the passage of electricity of moderate tension ; he found with a tension of 50
Daniell cells electricity did not pass through a loose mass of finely divided black-

lead or wood charcoal. When the tension was increased to two or three hundred

cells, the particles aiTanged themselves by electrical attraction, making good elec-

trical contact, and formed a bridge by which the electricity freely passed. With
a tension of six or seven hundred cells the electricity was found to pass through a

considerable interval of the dust met with in rooms, which consists chiefly of silica

and alumina, with more or less organic and earthy matters.

Incandescent matter offers a very free passage to electricity ; masses of highly

heated blacklead-powder were found with six cells to give an average resistance of

four imits, and wood-charcoal powder an average resistance of five units, or about

f 3 of that opposed by an ordinary needle-telegraph coil, which may be taken at
300 units. These experiments went to show that an interval of dust separating

two conductors oppose practically a decreasing resistance to an increasing tension,
and led to the construction of the " lightning-bridge," which consists of two

pointed conductors enclosed in a chamber, and approached to within -['^ of an

inch from one another, and surrounded with finely divided matter consisting of

carbon and a non-conducting substance intimately mixed. The reason why a

powder consisting entirely of conducting matter cannot be safely employed is, that

although it opposes a practically infinite resistance to the passage of electricity of

the tension of ordinfiry working currents, when a high tension discharge occurs the

particles under the influence of the discharge generally arrange themselves so closely

as to make a conducting connexion between the two points of the lightning-bridge.

If the effect of lightning striking the wires be considered, it will be seen that the

electric discharge passing through the telegraph-coils is not momentary, but occu-

pies time.

  When an insulated telegraph-wire is struck, the effect of the electric discharge

is to polarize the wire throughout ; after the discharge the wire returns to its nor-

mal impolarized condition; but the cessation of magnetization, although rapid is

not instantaneous, and the eftect of the wire assuming its normal unmagnetic con-

dition will be to develope an electric current flowing in the same direction as the
electric discharge which magnetized the wire. The tension of the current developed

by the demagnetization will be very high at its first development, and wiU rapidly

afterwards fall to zero ; there is therefore, first, the main discharge of electricity
which passes by the shortest route, and does not wait to polarize the coil-wires,

but leaps across a space of air to the earth conductor as the easier course, followed

by a secondary current in the same direction but occupying time. The tension of

this secondary current, although at first very high, is not nearly so great as the

lightning discharge, and the greater portion, if not the whole, will pass through

the coils, which oppose, when time is given, a much lesser resistance than the
smallest possible space of air ; it would therefore seem, when telegraph circuits

protected by the ordinary protector are struck by lightning, it is to the secondary
current, and not to the main discharge the fusion must be attributed. The fact

that the coils of needle telegraphs are more often fused than other telegraphic ap-
paratus was considered to be a strong confirmation that the fusion was due to the

secondary current developed by the demagnetization.

The relay coils used in other telegraph systems have soft iron cores which are
Arendered magnetic when a ciu-rent is passing through the coils.
                                                                  greater amount

of magnetism is developed in the cores than in needle-telegraph coils ; but a very
sensible time is occupied by the iron passing fi'om the normal to a magnetized con-

dition. The momentary resistance these cores oppose to magnetization is very
great ; the demagnetization of the line-wire proceeds more slowly ; the electricity
generated by the demagnetization being of a definite amount, the tension of the

secondary cui-rent is reduced proportionately. The line-wire of a telegraph circuit

is only a continuation of the coil-wires, and is rendered magnetic by electric polar-

ization in the same way as the coils, the chief diflerence being that the magnetism

Whendeveloped in the coils is concentrated in a smaller space.  lightning strikes

the line-wire of a circuit in which electromagnets are used, and having an ordi-

nary protector, it magnetizes the^line-wire, leaps the space separating the points of

the protector, and does not magnetize the electromag-nets ; demagnetization of the
line-wire which always takes time, and which can be retarded, follows, and the re-

sistance whicli the soft iron cores oppose to the assumption of magnetization retards

the demagnetization of the line-wire, reducing the tension of the secondary cur-

rent. In needle-telegi'aph coUs, there being no large mass of iron to be magnetized,
30 KEPORT 1870,

demagnetization of tlie line-wire follows mucli more rapidly, the secondary cur-
rent is more intense, and consequently these coils more often suffer.

   When a circuit protected by the " lightning-bridge " is struck, the lightning

finds in its direct path not a space of air, but a bridge of conducting particles in
very close proximity to one another: it connects these imder the influence of the
discharge, and renders the pai-ticles highly incandescent. Incandescent matter, as
already demonstrated, oilers a very free passage to electricity, and the second«ary
current finds an easier passage across the heated matter than through the coils.
These lightning-bridges have been in use more than four years ; there are upwards
of 1000 doing duty in this coimtry alone, and not a single case has occurred of a

coil being fused when protected by them.
   Four years have elapsed since the introduction by the author of induced mag-

netic needles for needle telegi-aphs ; there are some thousands of them now doing
daily work. The coils of the old pattern are being converted into induced magnet

coils, and it is probable that induced magnet coils vrill entirely supersede the so-
called permanent magnets used in needle-telegraph instnmients.

                                         Meteoeology.

         --BainfaJl its Variation %vit7i Elevation of the Gauge,

                             By Charles Chambee.s, F.R.S.

   The fact is well known to meteorologists that the quantities of rain received in

gauges placed at difl'erent heights above the ground diminish as the elevation of
the gauge increases. Several attempts have been made to explain this phenome-
non, but none of them are so satisfactoiy as to discourage the search for other

causes that may contribute substantiallv or mainly to its production. Hence the

submission for the consideration of the liritish Association of this further attempt.

   One of the principal causes of rain is imdoubtedly the transfer, effected by winds,
of air charged vrith moisture in a wann damp district to a colder region, where the
vapour it contains is partially condensed. The temperature of the lower as well
as of the higher horizontal strata of the atmosphere oeiug reduced by this transfer,

it may fairly be inferred that condensation of vapour may also occur in the lower
as well as the higher strata. The rain caught by a gauge at any given elevation
will therefore be the sum of the condensations in all the strata above it, and thus

the lower a gauge be placed, the greater will be the quantity of rain received by it.
   Again, it is known by obsers'ation that there is at all times a greater or less dif-

ference of electrical tension between the atmosphere and the surface of the ground.
If, then (in accordance with the views of Prof. Andi'ews as to the continuity of the.
liquid and gaseous states of matter, from which it follows that the changes of

other physical properties must also be continuous), we regard the particles of vapour

 suspended in the air as electric bodies in relation to the dielectric principal con-
stituents of the atmosphere, they 'will be polarized b}^ induction from the electricity
 of the ground. This polarization will give rise to an attraction between every
 particle and the neighbouring particles above and below it ; and being stronger in the
 particles nearer the ground than in those more remote, the tendency of the particles
 to coalesce (which will increase, by their mutual induction, as two neighbours

 approach each other) will be greatest near the gi'ound. Thus it may be (each

 particle gathering to itself its neighbours successively till their united density
 exceeds that of the atmosphere generally) that some rain-drops are formed, and
 that in greatest abundance, near the ground. If this be the true cause of any sub-

 stantial part of the phenomenon in question, then as the variation of intensity of
 electrical polarization of the particles will vary with height most rapidly near the
 ground, so the variation in the rainfall near the ground should be more rapid than
 at a gi-eater elevation ; and such is, indeed, the fact. Also, if the idea be coiTect, it
 will probably serve to explain other phenomena which it was not specially conceived
 to meet ; and so it does. For, first, it requires that the rainfall over even ground,
 where the electrical tension is relatively weak, should be less than over similarly
                                                                                  ;

situated forest-land, where, at the tops of the trees, ends of branches, and edges of

loaves, the tension is high ; and this is in accordance with observation. And
secondly, the tension being relatively high at the tops of the elevations of a moun-

tainous district, the rainfall should be greater there than in the neighbouring

plains ; this, again, is borne out by obsei-vation. Further, at the commencement of
a passing thimder-storm, a sudden heavy shower of rain will often faU for a few

moments, and then suddenly cease. May not this arise from the approach, by the

agency of opposite wind-currents, of detached masses of oppositely charged clouds,
the process, just described, of formation of rain-drops going on rapidly in each mass
as the two come near each other, and stopping when, by a ilash of lightning between
them, the two masses are brought into the same electrical condition ?

  An experimental test of this idea would be to repeat Dalton's measures of the

pressure of vapoiu- in the vacuum space of a mercurial barometer-tube (filling that
space with air and a little water), and compare the values foimd when the mercury
was charged with electricity and when not so charged.! If in the former case a
less pressure was found, we might conclude that the particles of vapour are really
susceptible of electric induction, and the amount of difference existing would enable
us to estimate whether the attractions of the particles upon each other were strong
enough to cause the formation of rain-drops hypothetically attributed to them

above.

On a Scale for computing Humidity. By Professor J. D. Evekext, D.O.L.

The scale in question is the invention of Mr. H. C. Russell, of Sydney Obser-

vatory. It consists of a sheet of paper ruled with vertical lines, each corresponding

to a degree of the dry-bulb. These are traversed by a set of curved lines, each

AcoiTesponding to a degree of humidity.  detached strip of paper divided into

parts which correspond to every even tenth of a degree of difference between dry-

and wet-bulb is applied (with its zero on the saturation-line) to the line repre-

senting the given diy-bvdb temperature, and the curved line which cuts it at the

division corresponding to the given difference indicates the resulting humidity.

The scale is based on Glaisher's Tables ; and any other table of double entry

might be represented by a scale constructed on the same plan. Interpolation is

much easier with such a scale than with a table.

I Barometne Predictions of Weather. By Feakcis Galtojt, F.B.8.

         It is notorious that the movements of the barometric columin corrrespond in some
      sense to the changes of the weather, and especially to those of the wind's velocity

      but they certainly take no notice of the rapid and tumultuous changes of its velo-
     city which are recorded by the jagged lines of a pressiu-e -anemometer. They there-

     fore correspond to mean values of the weather ; but the way in which, and the

     period of time for which those means should be taken, has yet to be determined.
     Comparison was made between a curve formed on the principle that the ordinate of
     each point represented the mean velocity of the wind for half an hour pre-vious to,
     and half an hour subsequent to the moment indicated by the abscissa of that point,

     and it was di-awn on the same time-scale as the corresponding barogram; the
     velocity-scale was so adjusted as to allow about the same range in the diagram for
     the two curves, and the ordinates were measiu-ed from above downwards (were, in
      fact, negative ordinates), in order that the increase of wind should be indicated by a
     descending cm-ve, to correspond with the descending barogram, and vice versa. The
     curve so made was called a curve of l-hom* period av. wind vel., and similar
      cui'ves were drawn for .3-hom', 6-hour, 12-hour, 16-hour periods, and some others.

     It was manifest, on comparing these with the barogram, that a period of 1 hour
     was far too short, for its curve showed many large irregularities, of which the
     barogram took no cognisance ; a period of 3 hours was much better ; of 6 hours

     better still ; and the maximum of correspondence began at 12 hours, and ended at

      16, beyond which time the wind-velocity curve was less irregular than the bare-

gram. The correspondence was equally good at all periods, for which trial was

made, between 12 and 16 hours, some parts agreeing better at the shorter, and

others at the longer period. The former period is selected for discussion in this

memoir. The data are derived from those of the continuous weather-records lately

published by the Meteorological Committee for the first quarter of 1869, so far as

they refer to Falmouth. The correspondence of the 12-hour period av. wind vel.

curves for Falmouth, with the barogi-am, is fairly satisfactory. The flexures of the

two curves are, on the whole, simultaneous, since neither curve habitually antici-

pates the other ; but they are seldom absolutely simultaneous. They correspond

in extreme positions as closely as in near ones, proving that it is not the absolute

height of the barometer, but the variations in its height, which indicate changes of

weather. The dominant influence of the wind-velocity upon the barometer was

made manifest by underlining with difierent colours the epochs of polar and equa-

torial winds, and showing that the correspondence of the two curves was, on the

whole, much the same, whatever might be the quality of the wind.

The reason of this correspondence of the barogram with a 12-hour av. vel. curve

was then discussed, and was described as similar to that which causes a suitably

constructed barometer, when plunged intojtroubled water, to sympathize, not solely

with the height of wave exactly above its cistern, but also with that of every point

in a surface area whose diameter is a function of the depth of immersion. So the

barometer sympathizes with the condition of the air for some distance on all sides

of it ; and as there is a general easterly movement of the air over England, it

appears that the diameter of the circle of air which aflects the' barometer is such
Aas to require, on the average, 12 hours to pass over an observatory.
                                                                       barometer

would therefore be afiected by an atmospheric wave of exceptional magnitude

before it reached the observatory. According to this argument, the efiects of the

independent variables, temperature, and damp must be treated on the same system

of 12-hour period of average as the wind's velocity. Consequently the following

formula is easily deduced. Let A, k be two successive barometric heights, at an

interval of 6 hours, a the 6-hour interval that precedes h, b the 6-hour interval

between h and k, and c the 6-hour interval which succeeds k. Call Va, ta, da the

6-hourly average during the period a of wind-velocity, temperature, and vapour-

tension, and use a similar notation for h and c. The units adopted were himdredtha

of an inch for barometer and vapour-tension miles per hour for wind-velocity, and

degrees Fahr. for temperature. The general formula was

                                                                                                        abc

     the theoretical expectation of the value of «j^^ is, on the whole, doubled in the

prediction of Ve, because the difference between what was expected of rj^^, and

what was fulfilled in Wj, is heaped on to v,., which has, therefore, to bear the entire

error of expectation of i)j+^. It was concluded from this, and from other previous

deductions from some years of Dublin observations, to which reference was made,
that the fame of the barometer is due to its success in predicting a type of storm
very rarely met with in the British Isles, but frequently in liuvricane-latitudes,
when the fall of the mercury far outstrips the increasing severity of the weather.
In ordmary gales, and much more in ordinary weather, the author considered the
barometer to be useless as a guide when consulted without a knowledge of what is
occurring at adjacent stations--in short, without such information as is supplied bv
the 'Daily Weather Eeport.'

mtion was variable throughout the day, and variable different seasons of the year,
that at about sunset the temperature was nearly the same up to 2000 feet, and that at
night (from the only two night-ascents) the temperature of the air increased from
the earth upwards. From this it was evident that, instead of only a few ascents
being necessary, a much larger number were required than it was possible for me to

pomt were above those at 4 feet from the gi-ound ; but no particular value was
attached to tins fact, until, on the observations made in M. Giffard's captive balloon
being reduced, the results proved that the decrease of temperature with increase of

elevation had a diurnal ran^e, and was different at different hours of the day, tlie

changes being greatest at about midday, and least at or about sunset (see lieport

for 1809), whilst sensible changes occurred within 30 feet of the earth. In conse-

quence, the observations made at the height of 22 feet were reduced by takiu"- the

differences between the readings of the two thermometers, and affixing the'^sigu

plus (-I-) to that difference when the temperature was higher at the higher eleva-

tion, and the sign minus (-) when vice versa. All the observations made in the

years 1867-70 were treated in this way,

+_ By selecting the gi-eatest number with a sign, and the greatest with a - sign
in each month, it was found that in the winter months the temperature at 22 feet

height ranged from 2 to 4 degrees above, and from 1 to 2 degrees below, that at 4

feet, and in the summer months from 4 to 5 degrees above to 6 or                                                                                                                                                                deo°-rees below

  From the above Table it will be seen that the 7man temperature of the air at

22 feet height was higher than at 4 feet, at all hours of the day and night, during the
months of January, February, November, and December; in the earl)' afternoon,
and during the night, in the months of March, April, August, September, and
October; and in the evening hours, and during the night, in May, June, and July.

   The mean monthly temperatures of the air at 22 feet height, for all the years, were

then taken, and found to differ from those at 4 feet, as follows:

   Thus the plus sign preponderates, indicating greater -warmth above, during
the day and night, in January, February, October, November, and December, and
during the night throughout the year.

  A second thermometer, properly protected from radiation, was placed in the

middle of the year 1869 at the height of 50 feet; and since then its readings have

been regularly taken. The mean monthly temperatures of the air, at 50 feet height,
were found to differ from those at 4 feet, as follows :

 Thus  we   have the  unexpected  result  that  the  mean   monthly  temperature  of  the

_

air at 22 feet and at 50 feet height is higher during the evening and night-hours

throughout the year than at the height of 4 feet, and also higher, night and day,

during the winter months. By selecting those days with a sky covered by dense

clouds, it was found that there was on such days no difterence between the tem-

perature at 4 feet, 22 feet, and 50 feet height. At the height of 50 feet, in the
summer months, the temperature during the day was frequently 6 and 7 degrees

lower than that at 4 feet, and at night 5 or G degi-ees higher.

On a New EIecfro-3fagnetic Anemometer, and the mode of -using it in Regis-
      tering the Velocity and Pressure of the Wind. By Jomsr J. Hall,

After describing at some length the difficulties attending the use of the present

forms of anemometrical apparatus, arising from the fact that few houses are built
with any means of access to the roof, also from the interference of trees and undu-

latory surfaces of land, &c., and having showed the practical results that would be

derived from the use of electricity, the author proceeded to describe the apparatus

devised (and exhibited) by him. One of the main objects for which it is intended

is the determination of interval or hourly velocities. The following is a brief

risume of its principles and construction :

The anemometer consists of two parts, viz. Velocity apparatus and Registering

apparatus.

The first consists of a set of Robinson's hemispherical cups, which communicate

their motion downwards into a brass box, where it is reduced in angular velocity

and causes a contact-disk or commutator (in which two platinum contact-pins are

Anfixed equidistant from one another) to revolve in tenths of a mile.        insulated

metallic lever, having a platinum working face, stands on each side of the disk so

-^that, upon the completion of every      mile, one or other of the contact-pins comes

into contact with the two levers, thus imiting them and completing the circuit. The

levers, which are jointed at their opposite ends, are raised a few degrees (of circles,
whose radii they represent), and then fall back to their nonnal position, ready to
be taken up by the next pin, and so on.

The Recording apparatus consists of a train of wheels and pinions working in a

frame or between two brass plates, tlie arbors of which project through a

dial-plate (whereon the circles and figures are engraved), and carry the hands.

These wheels are di-iven by a weight attached to a line which is wound round a

ban-el ; and a locking pin-disk (the pinion of which works in the first wheel) is re-

leased at every contact of the cup apparatus by an electro-magnet, which unlocks

the pin-disk and allows the first hand to advance -g^ mile on the graduated dial
by n jump similar to the minute-hand in remontoire clocks.

   By turning "on" a "strike -silent" stop, a hammer lever is brought into

connexion with the escapement, and strikes a ball at every contact ; the observer

has therefore notliing to do in noting intei-val or hourly velocities but to notice the

seconds' hand of his watch or chronometer (a split-seconds or chronograph would

be preferred), while he counts the number of times the bell is struck, each
of which corresponds to the -j^g mile, and, by formulre arranged and explained by
Mr. Hall (who has also arranged a comprehensive series of tables for use with the

instrument) the houi'ly velocity may be readily deduced.
   The following formula has been arranged for deducing the hourly velocity of the

wind from observations during intervals of minutes and seconds.

   Let T be the interval of observation in minutes and seconds, expressed decimally,

=60 constant (min. l hour), and .r the quantity required, which will represent tlie

number of times T is contained in one hour, -05 unit of distance, b number of beats

   In noting velocities extending over long periods of time, the instrument is read
in the same manner as the ordinary cup-and-dial anemometer.

Queries respecting JEthcr. By Charles Brooke, M.A., F.Ii.S.

When light and caloric were supposed to consist of material molecules, the

hypothesis of tlio universal existence of a transmitting medium was unnecessary,

since particles of matter might with the utmost freedom be projected through vacu-

ous space                                       but as light and heat are now generally admitted to consist not of trans-
                                             ;

mitted matter, but of transmitted vibratory motion (and why may not electricity', so

freely interchangeable with the former, be admitted into the same category ?), the
necessity of the existence of a highly elastic and attenuated transmitting medium,
pervading infinite space, becomes at once apparent; and this medium, hitherto not
cognizable to our senses, has been termed " a3ther." But it has been further assumed

that (ether is alone capable of transmitting the extremely rapid vibrations of light

and heat, and that it must therefore necessarily pervade or permeate all kinds of

sensible matter. The questions proposed to be raised in this communication are

the necessity of this interstitial hypothesis, and the probable capability of ordinary

matter to transmit the vibrations of light and heat.

It is now generally admitted that when a body becomes heated, its own particles,

and not merely those of the supposed interstitial rether, are thrown into a state of

vibratorj' motion, the amount of heat corresponding probably to the amplitude of

the vibrations                                                                   hence a certain  amount of energy has been communicated to those  ,
                                                                              ;

particles, and (at all                                                           events,  in      the  case  of celestial  radiations)  the                                                                '

                                                                                                                                             molecules of

aether must previously have possessed the energy or vis viva which they have com-
                                        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  37

municated. Hence aether, being susceptible of vis viva, has recently been admitted

to be 2}onderable ; but tliis admission is not a necessaiy consequence ; for although

the idea of existing energy is associated witli that of iveight, in consequence of the

constant energy acquired by gravitation having been taken as the measure or unit

of energy however acquired, there is no necessary connexion between them. Sup-

pose, for example, that a flea were placed on an orbitating planet of the size of a

pumpkin                                 while its muscular energy would remain undiminished, its weight would
                                     ;

be infinitesimal, and the first leap woidd obviously plimge it into infinite space, to

perform subsequently perhaps <an independent orbit.

The only basis on which the interstitiul-ather hypothesis rests is the assumed

incapacity of ordinary matter, whether in the solid, liquid, or gaseous state, to
transmit the vibrations of light and heat, because the only vibrations hithei-to

recognized, namely those of sound, are almost immeasurably slower than those
of light and heat ; the one being numbered by at most a few thousands, the other
\)y hundreds of millions of millions in one second of time. ]3ut it must be borne in
mind that sonorous vibrations are always longitudinal, in the production of which

repulsive forces are alone concerned ; whilst, on the contrary, light- and heat-vibra-

tions are necessarily transverse, and tlie production of these is solely due to attrac-
Nowtive forces.
                                        these respective forces obey very different laws; for whilst

attractive forces obey generally, and probably universally, the law of the inverse

square of the distance, molecular repulsion must obviously, at all events in gaseous
matter, obey the law of the inverse cube of the distance ; therefore from the rate

of transmission of longitudinal vibrations nothing can be predicated respecting the

rate of transmission of transverse waves. It has been asserted that molecular re-

pidsion is a dynamical resultant eftect, and therefore incapable of expression by a
statical law ; but it is very doubtful whether molecular attraction is not equally
a dynamical sequence, and therefore not a whit more entitled to claim a statical
law than the former.

It has been shown from the investigations of jNIr. Norman Lockyer that incan-

descent_ gases existing in the -Nicinity of the sun are capable of initiutin;/ vibrations
of definite periods, which are moreover occasionally accelerated or retarded by tlio
proper motion of the emitting gas, just as sound-waves have been sliown by Savart

to be accelerated or retarded, and the sound consequently raised or lowered in
pitch, by the proper motion of the body producing the vibrations. "Wliat reason
can there then be for doubting that gaseous matter is capable of transmitting heat-

       waves, and, if so, of likewise transmitting the waves of light, since the two are so

I intimately connected by the identical phenomena of reflexion, refraction, and

      Eolarizatiou ? may not, in fact, in some instances the perceptions of light and heat

        e but different sensuous impressions produced by the same vibrations ?

        Now in the denser forms of matter, namely the solid and liquid, it appears that

the wave-lengths of excited transverse vibrations are indefinitely modified, pro-
bably by the more energetic action of repulsive forces ; for whilst any given kind

of matter in the solid or fluid state is found, when incandescent, to emit light- and

heat-waves of all lengths, and so to fonn a continuous spectrum, the same matter

in the form of incandescent gas will emit only a few sets of waves of definite and

invariable lengths, forming an interrupted spectrum of bright lines ; and moreover

some of these wave-lengths are frequently found to bear very simple numerical ratios

to each other. And even in gaseous matter it has been observed that the bright

lines in the spectrum become narrower and more sharply defined by rarefaction,

and, on the contrary, broader and less defined by condensation. Moreover, as
regards the density of the absorbing medium, the absorption-bands in the spectrum
appear to obey the same law as the bright lines. In other words, every kind of
matter appears to be capable of emitting or absorbing its own peculiar waves,

according to its tenuity, that is, as the results of molecular attraction are less and
less interfered with by those of repulsion. The well-known pecidiar incapacity of any

given transcalent substance to transmit the heat-rays emitted by a heated portion

of the same substance, or, in other words, the ability of the molecules to freely ap-

propriate the wave-motion that has been induced in some intervening medium by

similar molecules, seems further to argue that ordinaiy matter is capable of assu-
ming vibrations having the extreme rapidity of those of light and heat ; and that
                                                                                       --

--38 REPORT 1870.

there exists no valid ground for a distinction between light and heat in this respect

is further confirmed by the experiments of ]\Ir. B. Stewart, who has shown that

the emission of light by incandescent bodies closely corresponds with their absorp-

tive power (whether selective or otherwise) when not incandescent, and, further,

that even in the decomposition of light into two polarized beams by the tourmaline,

that substance emits when incandescent the ray that is otherwise absorbed. Can

there, then, be any valid reason for doubting the ability of ordinary matter to trans-

mit those transverse vibrations which it is obviously capable of either absorbing or

emitting ? and if so, what ground is there for the hji-pothesis that the transmission

of light- and heat-waves necessitates the presence of imperceptible tether in the

interstices of perceptible matter ?

If the existence of sether in infinite space, essential to the undulatory theory, be

admitted, it may be asked how is it possible to conceive its exclusion from any por-
Ation of space ?
                  very simple hypothesis, propounded by the writer in the Intro-

duction to the last edition of his ' Elements of Physics,' will meet tliis difliculty

namely, that asther (like its fluid namesake with water) is immiscible with known

gaseous matter. This, it must be admitted, is sheer hypothesis ; but if true, it must

ever remain so, sether being in that case beyond the reach of human ken : of this

we may, however, rest assured, that if it be not wanted in and around even our

corporeal frames, it is not there ; the contrary supposition would be inconsistent

with the infinite wisdom of the Creator of the universe.

                 On certain Objections to the Bynamie Theory of Heat.
                                 By H. Whiteside Cook.

   In this paper the author first endeavoured to show that heat must necessarily be
a force of a permanent nature, could not possibly be a mere affection of matter, and,
as is asserted by the believers in the " Djaiamic " hypothesis, that it must bo in
the nature of an " energj'," and not an " impulse."

   He then proceeded to analyze the nature of heat as described in the thermo-

dynamic theory, and brought forward arguments to show that the causes Avhich
produce heat would not produce the molecular motion presumed, and that, on the
other hand, allowing this molecular motion to exist, it would not produce the effects

which are produced by heat. He proceeded, in conclusion, to consider one or two

of the experiments on which the djTiamic h\'pothesis was based, and showed that
they were in no way incompatible with the old theory of a caloric or substantive

--heat. In short, the argument of the paper was : tliat though such forces as

electricity, magnetism, &c. were probably justly considered to be only affections
of matter, it was a mistake to conclude the same thing of heat ; that if the attracti-
vity of matter be apenuanent energetic force, then heat,tlie force which counteracts
that attractivity among molecules, must also be a permanent energetic force ; for a
force of impulse cannot cope -with a perpetual energetic force ; however great the
irapidse, it must soon be beaten ; and were heat a condition and not an entity,
then it would be but a passing phenomenon.

   In dealing with the experiments which are supposed to substantiate the dynamic
hypothesis, the author dwelt especially on Davy's celebrated experiment of liquefying
ice by friction, when he showed that the increment of heat added to the ice was
very small in comparison with the amoimt of heat contained by the ice when at the
temperature of 82 Fahr., and that the molecular agitation to which it was subjected
would cause it to absorb this heat from the atmosphere of caloric, which, on the

substantive theory, would ex hypothesi surround it. He next spoke of the fall of
temperature which takes place when compressed air is allowed to escape from

the confining vessel (an experiment which is put forward by the exponents of the
dynamic theory as instancing the conversion of heat into mechanical energy), and

pointed out that in the preparation of the experiment the compression of "the air

had forced out of it some of the heat that it contained. When, then, it was allowed

to escape, the air brought out less heat than it took in, the difference being the

amount which had been given out in cooling after the original compression. The

--author added that these experiments could not be said to substantiate the dynamic

theory and that if he did not mention more of them, it was because those present

would bo able to call them to mind themselves and apply to them reasoning precisely

similar.

   The author attached great importance to the question, because he thought that
in erroneously considering heat to be molecular vibration, we lost sight of the true
explanation of electricity, which he believed to be neither more nor less than that
very vibration or molecular' motion which the dynamic theor}' called heat.

       On the Wave Theory of Light, Heat, ^-c. By Dr. Hi^nry Hudsox.

   Huyghens (to explain double refraction) assumed a second vibrating medium as
consisting of "the molecules and ajther conjointly; " and Fresnel's grand theory
rests on the same foundation. As molecular vibrations in air (sound-waves) are

10,000 times longer and 809,000 times slower than etherial waves, the author
rejects this combination as inadequate to account for the very minute dift'erence in

the retardation of the doubly refracted rays in crystals. lie then adduces several
cases, especially in polarized light, une.vplamed on Fresnel's theory, and proceeds to

show that all the difficulties in Fresnel's theory can be removed by considering the
" sether " to consist oHwo media, each possessed of equal and enormous self-repulsion,
and both existing in equal quantities throughout space, being also mutually

indifferent (neither attracting nor repelling), and that their vibrations conse-
quently always take place in perpendicular iilanes. lie then suggests as an experi-
mental test of this view, " that the ordinary refracted ray, through Iceland spar,

cannot be made to show any phenomena of Interference with the apparently
similarly polarized ray obtained by total reflexion from glass," because, on this
^'icw, their vibrations are in different media. After discussing many curious and

interesting questions, he pointed out that the two Electricities fulfil the requirements
of the theory, being, as he asserts, mutualhj indifferent, and constitute the tether.
Electrical phenomena the author would explain by the existence of '' waves of

--translation as well as " waves of vibration " aftecting the molecules of bodies the

former being most prominent in " statical phenomena " (induction especially), and
the latter more generally observed in what is denominated " the electric current."

            On the Immersion Method of Illumination of the Microscope.
                                   By Dr. John Bakkee.

   After showing the defects of the present methods as exhibiting merely shadows
and caustics of reflection and refraction, and markings resulting very often from the
relative opacity and ti'ansparency of the parts of an object, the author was led to

believe, from the study of the way in which objects are best illuminated for unas-
sisted vision, that this was the method to which we should endeavour to ap-
proximate in the illumination of microscopic objects. The adaptation of the immer-
sion plan in condensers of various forms seemed to him to best fulfil these require-
ments. The object would be illuminated by very oblique light, the oblique rays
being most economized, undergoing less loss and less dispersion. The author brought
forward several forms of this mode of illumination, in which a flat-topped paraboloid
was used, which, he stated, gave very good results with a two-thirds used with
binocular microscopes another was a flat-topped paraboloid to be used above the

                                                                                                                         ;

object, and in the centre of which (the glass paraboloid) the power was placed so as
to light up the object under the highest powers with reflected light. The ordinary
achromatic condenser, too, he thought, might be greatly increased in value by
adapting it to the immersion plan.

                 On the New Binocular Microscope, By S. Holmes.

   The author showedthat the views of objects seen through a microscope, being
                 --

--40 REPORT 1870.

--pseudoscopic and superficial, gave no tnistwortliy information of structure and

 nence the disagreements of observers.
    Describing the binocular microscopes preceding his own, he contended that they

failed to give true appearances, because the second image was but a distorted reflex
 of the first, and could not thus give true stereoscopic relief.

    Such relief being due to the direct convergence of the axes of two eyes to one
object, he had after some years succeeded in making a binocular microscope capable
of showing perspective distance, by employing two equally inclined microscopes of

 equal power.
    Eight drawings of mechanical arrangements accompanied the paper; and the in-

struments on this plan were sho^mi to secure to the microscopist and amateur the
following advantages :

    1. The ease of observation by the equal use of both eyes, and a natural erect view

for dissecting-pui-poses,

    2. Perfectly stereoscopic views of opaque objects, and distinct definition of

thick transparent ones.

    .3. Pseudoscopic -vision for the illustration and verification of all objects, and
convertibility into a monocular microscope by the turn of a milled head.

                   On Colour-vision at different points of the Retina.
                   By J. Clekk Maxavell, LL.D., F.R.SS. L. 6f E.

   It has long been known that near that point of the retina where it is intersected
by the axis of the eye there is a yellowish spot, the existence of which can be
shown not only by the ophthalmoscope, but by its effect on vision. At the Chel-
tenham Meeting in 185(3 the author pointed out a method of seeing this spot by
looking at that part of a very narrow spectrum which lies near the line F. Since
that time the spot has been described by Ilelmholtz and others ; and the author has
made a number of experiments, not yet published, in order to determine its eflects

on colour-vision.
   One of the simplest methods of seeing the spot was suggested to the author by

Prof. Stokes. It consists in looking at a white surface, such as that of a white cloud,

through a solution of chloride of chromium made so weak that it appears of a
bluish-green colour. If the observer directs his attention to what he sees before
him before his eyes have got accustomed to the new tone of colour, he sees a
pinkish spot like a wafer on a bluish-green gTOund ; and this spot is always at the
place he is looking at. The solution transmits the red end of the spectrmii, and
also a portion of bluish-gi-een light near the line F. The latter portion is partially
absorbed by the spot, so that the red light has the preponderance.

   Experiments of a more accurate kind were made with an instrument the original
conception of which is due to Sir Isaac Newton, and is described in his ' Lectiones

Opticc'e,'_though it does not appear to have been actually constructed till the author
set it up in 1862, with a solid frame and careful adj ustments. It consists of two parts,
side by side. In the first part, white light is dispersed by a prism so as to form a
spectrum. Certain portions of this spectrum are selected "by being allowed to pass

                                                         _

through slits in a screen. These selected portions are made to converge on a second
prism, which unites them into a single beam of light, in which state they enter
the eye. The second part of the instrument consists of an arrangement by which a

                                                   _

beam of light from the very same somxe is weakened by two reflections from glass
surfaces, and enters the eye alongside of the beam of compound colours.

   The instrument is fonned of three rectangular wooden tubes, the whole length
being about nine feet. It contains two prisms, two mirrors, and six lenses, which
are so adjusted that, in spite of the very diU'erent treatment to which the two por-
tions of a beam of light are subjected, they shall enter the eye so as to form exactly
equal and coincident images of the soiu-ce of light. In fact, by looking through

the instrunaent a man's face may be distinctly seen by means of the red, the green,

or the blue light which it emits, or by any combination of these at pleasure.
   The arrangement of the three slits is made by means of six brass slides, which

can be worked with screws outside the instrument; and the breadth of the slits can
be read off with a gauge very accurately.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  41

   In each observation three colours of the spectrum are mixed and so adjusted that
their mixture is so exactly equivalent to the white light beside it, that the line
which divides the two can no longer be seen.

   It is found that in certain cases, when this adjustment is made so as to satisfy
one person, a second will iind the mixed colour of a green hue, while to a third it

will appear of a reddish colour, compared with the white beam.

   But, besides tliis, it is found that the mixed colour may be so adjusted that, if
we look directly at it, it appears red, while if we direct the eye away from it, and
cast a sidelong glance at it, we see it green. The cause of this is the yellow spot,

which acts somewhat as a piece of yellow glass would do, absorbing certain kinds
of light more than others ; and the difference between difl'erent persons arises from
different intensities of the absorbing spot. It is foimd in persons of every nation,
but generally stronger in those of dark complexion. The degi-ee of intensity does
not seem to depend so much on the colour of the hair or the iris of the individual,
as to run through families independent of outward complexion.

   The same difference is found between different colour-blind persons ; so that in
the comparison of their vision with that of the normal eye, persons should be
selected for comparison who have the yellow spot of nearly the same intensity.

  AIn my own eye the part of the spectrum from Eto is seen decidedly

Fbetter by the central part of the retina than by the surrounding parts. Near

this is reversed, and the central part gives a sensation of about half the intensity

Gof the rest. Beyond the central part is again the most sensitive, and it is decidedly

so near H.

   Before I conclude I wish to direct the attention of those who wish to study

colour to the exceedingly simple and beautiful series of experiments described by

Mr. W. Benson in his works on colour. By looking through a prism at the

black and white diagrams in his book, any one can see more of the true relations of
colour than can be got from the most elaborately coloured theoretical arrangements

of tints.

                   On the Cause of the Interrupted Spectra of Gases.

                       By G. JoHNSTOKE STo^'Er, M.A., JF.B.S.

   In 1867 ]\Ir. Stoney had instituted a comparison between the internal motions
of gases and the phenomena of light *, from which it appeared that the lines in
the spectra of gases must be attributed to periodic motions within the mole-
cules, and not to the little irregidar journeys which the molecules make amongst
one another.

   In the present communication he endeavoured to advance another step. Each
such periodic motion in the gas will throw off waves in the aether. These
waves will in general not be pendulous ; in fact the circumstances would need
to be altogether exceptional which would restrict them to so simple a form.
But whatever the character of each wave, provided only that all the waves of
the imdulation are alike, it follows from Fourier's well-known theorem that the

Undulation may be adequately represented by the simultaneous advance of a

--number of superposed pendulous imdulations one consisting of waves of the

periodic time of the original disturbance, and the rest having periodic times which

are submultiples of this. Thus, if T be the periodic time of the origuial motion
in the gas, we are at liberty to regard the undulation, whilst traversing the open

ffither, as consisting of a multitude of coexisting pendulous undulations with pe-

riods T, JT, gT, &c. So long as the motion is propagated through undispersing
aether, the waves of all lengths travel at the same speed. The component imdula-
tions therefore strictly accompany one another; and accordingly the resultant

general undulation maintains whatever complicated form it may have had at first.
   But if the light enter a dispersing medium, such as glass, an entirely new

state of things arises. In glass, waves of different lengths travel at unequal velo-

cities. Each pendulous undulation will accordingly proceed across the glass at
a rate determined by its own special periodic time. In this way the component

of the gas. It thus appears that one of the periodic motions in the molecules of a

gas will iu general be the source of several lines in its spectrum, and that all the

lines thus arising from one original motion will have periodic times which are

terms of the harmonic series T, 5T, jT, &c. ; T being the periodic time of that mo-

tion in the gas to which they are all due.

Moreover it farther appears from the structure of Fourier's theorem, that the

form of the original disturbance will determine whether all the harmonics exist, or

only some of them. Where only some at irregular intervals exist, we have lines of

a spectrum of the Second Order ; where all or a long series of consecutive harmonics

exist, we have the beautiful spectacle of one of the fluted series in specti-a of the
First Order. The fluted appearance is due to the varying brightness of the suc-

cessive lines, or, in other words, to the values of the coefficients of the successive

terms of Fourier's series, which again depend on the character of the original dis-

turbance. Drawings were exhibited of the patterns of the flutings which would

result from various simple hypotheses as to the original disturbance ; and some of
these drawings bore a striking general resemblance to patterns which occm* in

nature.

   Sufficiently detailed observations on spectra of the First Order have not yet been

made fully to test this theory or afford materials for its application to the various

inquiries of interest which it suggests ; and Mr. Stoney was engaged in endeavouring

to supply this want. Meanwhile it may be observed in general that the closeness

of the ruling in spectra of the First Order indicates that the lines are very high

--harmonics of relatively slow original vibrations vibrations which in many in-

stances correspond to wave-lengths of more than a milUmetre in length, and conse-

quently have a periodic time of several twelfth-seconds (the Xllth-second meaning

---- of a second of time).

 --In the case of nitrogen, two systems of lines giving fluted columns have been

observed one at the red end of the spectrum, formed oy lines very closely packed
together, the other at the blue end of the spectrum, consisting of lines more widely
spaced. Pliicker coimted 34 dark lines (i. e. 35 bright hues) in one of the blue

flutings, viz. that one which lies to the left of the letter C in his diagram (Phil.

Trans, for 1865, plate 1). Judging from the diagram, this fluting would seem to

extend about from wave-length 44'8 to 4o'6 eighth-metres. If so, we may con-

clude that the 35 bright lines of graduated intensity of which it consists are from
about the 1960th tip to the 1995th harmonics of a wave-length of about 0-89376 of
a millimetre. This wave-length corresponds to about 3 Xllth-seconds of time,

which may accordingly be regarded as a rough approximation to the periodic time

of the motion iu the molecules of nitrogen by which the blue flutings are occa-

sioned.

  When lines of spectra of the Second Order are the result of motions iu a gas so

slow as this, it would not be practicable to determine the periodic times of the ori-
ginal motions from observations upon spectra of this kind ; for in this case the

harmonics, if the positions of all of them were laid down on a map of the spectrum,

would be so crowded together that it would be difficult to determine with certainty
to which of them a line of a spectrum of the Second Order should be referred. Per-

baps we may obtain assistance in sucb cases from disposing tbe apparatus so as to

present to tbe eye spectra of tbe First Order and of tbe Second Order in rapid suc-
cession (see Plucker, Pbil. Trans, for I860, p. 10. § 24).

   But tbere seems to be at least one case of a more rapid periodic time, viz. tbat of
certain lines of bydrogen. Tbe ordinary spectrum of tbe Second Order of tbis gas
consists of tbe four well-known lines C, F, one near G, and h. Tbree of tbese

On hvo spectra of Carbon existing at the same Temperature. By W. M. "Watts.

In this paper the author gave an account of his attempt to ascertain whether the

two totally different spectra of carbon depend on a difference of temperature. The

No. 1 spectrum is that given by olefiant gas or carbonic oxide and various other

compounds of carbon, either when burnt in air or oxygen or by means of the electric

spark at ordinary pressures.

The No. 2 spectrum is produced only by the electric spark in a vacuum, and is

given vmder such circumstances either by olefiant gas or carbonic oxide. The

temperature of the flames producing the No. 1 spectrum varies from below 2000° C.

to 10,000° C, whilst by enclosing vapour of sodium in the Geissler tube giving the

DNo. 2 spectrum, the author found that at first the line showed, which comes out

below 2000° C, and afterwards, as the tube was heated, Na|3, which indicates a

temperature of about 2000° (as it is produced in flames which just melt platinum),

and finally Na y (which does not appear till 3000° C).

Daring these changes the carbon No. 2 spectrimi remained unaltered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               the author
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

concludes therefore that both spectra are equally producible by temperatures of

between 2000° and 3000° C, and that the difference between them, whatever its

cause, does not depend upon temperature.

Address hj rrofossor Hexkt E. Roscoe, B.A., Ph.D., F.li.S., F.C.8.,

--Gentlesien,                 President of the Section.

 In the midst of the excitement of the horrible war in which the two most scientific
 nations of the Continent are now plunged, and in which even the professors of
 chemistry and their students take a humane part, let us endeavour to turn our

 thoughts' into channels more congenial to the scientific inquirer, and allow me to
 recount to you, as far as I am able, the peaceful victories which, since our last

 Meeting, in Exeter, have been achieved in our special department of Chemistry.

 And here may I be allowed to remind you of the cosmopolitan character of science,

 of the fact that it is mainly to the brotherly intercourse of those interested in
 science, and in its applications to the arts and manufactures in different countries,

 that we ought to look for the small but living fire which in the end will surely
 serve to melt down national animosities, and to render impossible the breaking out

 of disasters so fatal to the progress of science and to the welfare of humanity' as

 that of which we are now unfortunately the spectators.
    With regard to the position of chemical science at the present moment, it will

 not take a careful observer long to see that, in spite of the numerous important and

 brilliant discoveries which every year has to boast, we are really but very im-

 perfectly acquainted with the fundamental laws which regulate chemical actions,
 and that our knowledge of the ultimate constitution of matter upon which these
. laws are based is but of the most elementary nature. In proof of this I need only
 refer to the difierent opinions expressed by our leading chemists in a discussion

 which lately took place at the Chemical Society on the subject of the Atomic
 Theoiy. The President (Dr. Williamson) delivered an interesting lectiu-e, in
 which the existence of atoms was treated as " the very life of chemistry." Dr.

 Frankland, on the other hand, states that he cannot imderstand action at a distance,

 and therefore he cannot comprehend the discontinuity of matter, an idea lying at
 the base of the notion of atoms. Sir B. C. Brodie and Dr. Odling both agree

 that the science of chemistry neither requires nor proves the atomic theory ; whilst

 the former poiats out that the true basis of the science is to be sought in the

investigation of the laws of gaseous combination, or the study of the capacity of
                    TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                  45

bodies for heat rather than in committing oui-selves to assertions incapable of proof

by chemical means.

   Agreeing in the main with the opinion of the last two chemists, and believing

that we must carefully distinguish between fact and theory, I would remind you

that Dalton's discovery of multiple and reciprocal proportions (I use Dr. Odling's

word), as well aa the differences which we now acknowledge in the power of

hydrogen-replacement in hydrochloric acid, water, ammonia, and marsh-gas, are

facts, whilst the explanation upon the assumption of atoms is, as far as chemistry

has yet advanced, a theory. If, however, the existence of atoms cannot be proved

by chemical phenomena, we must remember that the assumption of the atomic

theoiy explains chemical facts as the undulatory theory gives a clear view of the

phenomena of light; thus, for instance, one of the most important facts and

relations of modern chemistry which it appears difficult, if not impossible, to

Howexplain without the assumption of atoms is that of. Isomerism.  otherwise

than by a different arrangement of the single constituent particles are we to account

for several distinct substances in which the proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and

oxygen are the same ?; Why, for instance, should 48 parts, by weight, of carbon, 10

of hydrogen, and 16 of oxygen, united together, be capable of existing as three

different chemical substances, unless we presuppose a difterent statical arrangement

of the parts by which these differences in the deportment of the whole are rendered

possible ?

Although chemistry appears not to be able to give us positive information as to

whether matter is infinitely divisible, and therefore continuous, or whether it con-

sists of atoms and is discontinuous, we are in some degree assisted in this inquiry

by deductions from physical phenomena recently pomtcd out by the genius of

Wm.Sir Thomson. This philosopher, arguing from four distinct classes of

physical phenomena, not only comes to the conclusion that matter is discontinuous,

and therefore that atoms and molecules do exist, but he even attempts to form an

idea of the size of these molecules ; and he states that in any ordinary liquid or

transparent or seemingly opaque solid, the mean distance between the centres of

contiguous molecules is less than the hundi-ed-miUionth, and greater than the two-

thousand-miliionth of a centimetre. Or, to form a conception of this coarse-grained-

ness, imagine a raindrop, or globe of glass as large as a pea, to be magnified up to

the size of the earth, each constituent molecule being magnified in the same propor-

tion, the magnified structure would be coarser-grained than a heap of small shot,

but probably less coarse-grained than a heap of cricket-balls.

There is, however, another class of physical considerations which render the

existence of indivisible particles more than likely. I refer to the mechanical

theory of gases, by means of which, thanks to the labours of eminent English and

-- --German philosophers, all the physical properties of gases (their equal expansion

by heat the laws of diffusion the laws of alteration of volume imder pressure)

can be shovra to follow from the simple laws of mechanical motion. This theory,

however, presupposes the existence of molecules ; and in this direction again we

find confirmation of the real existence of Dalton's atoms. Indeed it has been

proved that the average velocity with which the particles of oxygen, nitrogen, or

common air are continually projected forwards amomits, at the ordinary atmospheric

pressure, to 50,000 centimetres per second, whilst the average number of impacts

of each of these molecules is 5000 millions per second.

The mention of the molecular motions of gases will recall to the minds of all

present the great loss which English science has this year sustained in the death

of the discoverer of the laws of gaseous diffusion. Throughout his life Graham's

aim was the advancement of our knowledge in the special subject of the molecular
properties of gases. With this intent he imceasingly laboured up to the moment of

his death, in spite of failing health and pressure of official business, unfolding for

posterity some of the most difficult, as well as the most interesting, secrets of

nature in this branch of our science. " What do you think," he writes to Hofmann,
" of metallic hydrogen, a white magnetic metal ? " and yet now through his labours

the fact of the condensation of hydrogen in the solid state by metallic palladium,

and to a less extent by other metals, has become familiar to all of us. Then, again,

I would remind you of Graham's recent discovery of the occlusion of hydrogen
--46 REPORT 1870,

gas in certain specimens of meteoric iron, -whilst eartli-manufactured iron contains

--not hydrogen but absorbed carbonic oxide gas proving that the meteorite had

probably been thrown out from an atmosphere of incandescent hydrogen existing

under very considerable pressure, and therefore coulirming in a remarkable degree
the conclusions to which spectrum analysis had previously led us. The position
in the ranks of British science left by Graham's death will not be easily filled
up : he accomplished, to a certain extent, for dynamical chemistry what Dalton
did for statical chemistry ; and it is upon his experimental researches in molecular
chemistry that Graham's permanent fame as one of England's greatest chemists

will rest.

   As closely connected with the above' subjects, I have next to mention a most

important research by Dr. Andrews, of Belfast, which, marking an era in the

history of gases, shows us how our oldest and most cherished notions must give
way before the touchstone of experiment. No opinion would appear to have been

more firmly established than that of the existence of three separate states or condi-

Ation of matter, viz. the solid, the liquid, and the gaseous.                                          body capable of

existing in two or more of these states was thought to pass suddenly from one to

the other by absorption or emission of heat, or bj- alterations of the superincum-

bent pressure. Dr. Andrews has shown us how false are our views on this

fundamental property of matter ; for he has proved that a large number of, and

probably all, easilj' condensible gases or vapours possess a critical point of tempera-

ture at and above which no increase of pressure can be made to effect a change
into what we call the liquid state, the body remaining as a homogeneous fluid,

whilst below this critical temperature certain increase of pressure always effects a
separation into two layers of liquid and gaseous matter. Thus with carbonic acid
the point of critical temperature is 30°"92 C. ; and with each given substance this
point is a specific one, each vapour exhibiting rapid changes of volume sind flicker-

ing movements when the temperature or pressure was changed, but showing no
separation into two layers. Under these circumstances it is impossible to say that

the  body exists  either  in  the  state of a gas  or  of a  liquid                                it  appears to  be in
                                                                                                ;

a condition intermediate between the two. Tims carbonic acid under the pressure

of 108 atmospheres, and at .35^ '5 C., is reduced -j^g- of the volume which it

occupies at one atmosphere ; it has undergone a regular and luibroken contraction,

and it is a uniform fluid; if we now reduce the temperature below 31° C, the

liquid condition is assumed without any sudden change of volume or any abrupt

Weevolution of heat.  can scarcely too highly estimate the value of these researches

of Dr. Andrews.

   As examples of the power which modern methods of research give of grappling
with questions which only a few years ago were thought to be insoluble, 1 may

--quote the beautiful observations, now well-lmown, by which Lockyer detennined

the rate of motion on the sun's surface together with those of Frankland and

Lockyer respecting the probable pressure acting in the different layers of the solar

atmosphere, and, lastly, the results obtained lay Zcillner respecting the probable

absolute temperature of the sun's atmosphere, as well as that of the internal
molten mass. These last results are so interesting and remarkable, as being arrived
at by the combination of recent observation with high mathematical analysis, that

I may perhaps be permitted shortly to state them.

   Starting from the fact of the eruptive nature of a certain class of solar pro-
tuberances, Zollner thinks that the extraordinary rapidity with which these red
flames shoot forth proA'es that the hydrogen of which they are mainly composed
must have burst out from under gi'eat pressure ; and if so, the hydrogen must have
been confined by a zone or layer of liquid from which it breaks loose. Assuming
the existence of svich a layer of incandescent liquid, then applying to the problem
the principles and methods of the mechanical theory of gases, and placing in
his formulne the data of pressure and rate of motion as observed by Lockyer on

the sun's surface, Zollner arrives at the conclusion that the diflerence of pressure

needed to produce an explosion capable of projecting a prominence to the height

=of 3-0 minutes ( 80,000 English miles) above the sun's surface (a height not

unfrequently noticed) is 4,070,000 atmospheres. This enormous pressure is at-

tained at a depth of 139 geographical miles under the sun's surface, or at that of

one G58th part of the sun's semidianieter. In order to produce a tension capable of
overcoming this gigantic pressure, the ditierence in temperature between the enclosed

hydrogen and that existing iu the solar atmosphere must be 74,910° C! In a
similar way ZoUner calculates the approximate absolute temperature of the sun's

atmosphere, which he finds to be 27,700° C, a temperature about eight times as
high as that given by Bunsen for the oxyhydrogen name, and one at which iron
must exist in a permanently gaseous form.

   Passing on to more purely chemical subjects, we find this year signalized by the

redetermination of a most important series of chemical constants (that of the
heat of chemical combination) by Julius Thomsen, of Copenhagen. This con-

scientious experimentalist asserts that the measurements of the heat evolved by
neutralizing acids and bases hitherto considered most correct, viz. those made with
a mercury calorimeter by Favre and Silbermann, differ from the truth by 1 2 per
cent., whilst the determination by these experimenters of the heat of solution of

salts is frequently 50 per cent, wi'ong.

   As the result of his numerous experiments, Thomsen concludes that, when a

molecule of acid is neutralized by caustic alkali, the heat evolved increases nearly

proportionally to_ the quantity of alkali added, until this reaches 1, -}, }, or ^ of a
molecule of alkali, accordingly^ as the acid is mono-, bi-, tri-, or tetrabasic. Excep-
tions to the law are exhibited by silicic, and also partly by boracic, orthophosphonc,
and arsenic acids. In the two latter the heat of combination is proportional for

Athe first two atoms of replaceable hydrogen, but much less for the third atom.

second unexpected conclusion which Thomsen draws from his calorific determina-

tions is that sulphuretted hydrogen is a monobasic acid, and that its rational

Hformula is therefore (S H).

   Another important addition made to chemistry since our last Meeting is a new,

very powerful, and very simple form of galvanic battery discovered, though not
yet described, by Bimsen. In this second Bunsen's battery only one liquid, a
mixture of sulphuric and chromic acids, is employed. The plates of zinc and
carbon can all be lowered at once into the liquid aiad raised again at will. The

electromotive force of this battery is to that of Grove's (the most powerful of Icnown

forms) as 25 to 18 ; it evolves no fumes in working, and can be used for a very

considerable length of time without serious diminution of the strength of the

current ; so that Bunsen wi'ites me that no one who has once used the new battery

will ever think of again employing the old forms. I had hoped to be able to

exhibit to the Section this important improvement in our means of producing a
strong cm-rent ; but war has demanded the use of other batterie.s, and Bunsen haa

been unable to send me a set of his new cells.

   Amongst the marked points of interest and progi'ess in Inorganic chemistry
during the past year we have to notice the preparation of a missing link amongst
the oxysulphur acids by Schutzenberger. It is the lowest known, and may be

Hcalled hydrosulphurous acid, H, SOj. The sodium salt, Na SO,, is obtained by

the action of zinc on the bisulphite ; as might be expected, it possesses very powerful
reducing properties, and bleaches indigo rapidly.

   The metallic vanadates have also been carefully examined, and the existence

of three distinct series of salts proved, corresponding to the phosphates, viz. the

ortho- or tribasic vanadates, the pyro- or tetrabasic vanadates, and the meta- or
monobasic vanadates. Of these the ortho-salts are most stable at a high tempera-
ture, and at the ordinary atmospheric temperature the meta-salts are most stable,

whilst, as is well known, in the phosphorus series the order of stability is the
reverse. Thus the points of analogy and of difference between phosphorus and
vanadium become gi-adually apparent.

   As an illustration of the results of modern Organic research (for in viewing

the year's progress in this ever widening branch of chemistry it is impossible to

do more than give a few illustrations), I may quote Baeyer's remarkable investiga-

tions on mellitic acid. Originally discovered byKlaproth in Honeystone or Mellite
(a substance which yet remains the only source of the acid), mellitic was supposed
to be a 4-carbon acid. Baeyer has quite recently shown that the acid contains
frn^elve atoms of carbon, or has a molecular weight three times as great as was

originally supposed. He haa shown that mellitic acid is benzol hexacarbonic
            --;

acid, Ci2 He O12, or benzol in which the 6 atoms of hydrogen are replaced by the
monad radical carboxyl (CO OH), as benzoic is monocarbonic acid, or benzol
in which one of hydrogen is replaced by carboxyl. The most interesting portion of
Baeyer's research, however, lies in the intermediate acids, partly new and partly
acids already prepared, which he has shown lie between mellitic and benzoic, and in

which from one to six atoms of hydrogen in benzol are respectively replaced by
carboxyl. Nor is this all ; for he has proved that, with two exceptions, each of

these six acids is capable of existing in three isomeric modifications, thus affording

us an insight into the arrangement of the molecule of these aromatic compounds
for the simplest mode of explaining these numerous isomers is that given by
Baeyer, in the different order in which the several atoms of hydrogen in the benzol
molecule are replaced. Thus in the first or ortho-series, the hydrogen atoms in
benzol being numbered in regular succession, they are replaced in the same regular

succession. In the second or meta series the order is 1, 2, 3, 5, &c., whilst the third

or para-series take open order, as 1, 2, 4, 5, &c.

   Amongst the most interesting series of new organic bodies are those in which
tetrad silicon partly replaces carbon. Our knowledge of these substances is
gradually becoming more complete ; the last new member prepared by Friedel and

Ladenburg, is silico-propionic acid, ^-A t| , the first of a series of cai-bo-silicic acids

containing the radical SiOoH.
   The interesting researches of Matthiessen and Wright on morphine and codeine

have thrown a new light on the constitution of these opium alkaloids. Treated

with hydrochloric acid, morphine loses one molecule of water, and gives rise to a

the practical working of the memorable discovery of the production of artificial

alizarine, the colom-ing-matter of madder, by MM. Graebe and Liebermann. This

discovery, announced at our last Meeting, is of the highest importance, whether we

regard its scientific interest or its practical and commercial value ; and it ditters
from all the former results which have been brought about by the application of

science to the production of colouring-matters, inasmuch as this has reference to

the artificial production of a natural vegetable colouring substance which has been

used as a dye from time immemorial, and which is still employed in enormous

quantities for the production of the pink, purple, and black coloiu's which are seen

everywhere on prmted calicoes.

During the past year much progress has been made in the practical working of

the processes by which this colouring-matter is obtained from the hydrocarbon

anthracene contained in coal-tar ; and new and more economical plans for eflecting

the transformation have been independently proposed by Perkin and Caro, and

Schorlemmer and Dale. The theoretical investigation of the reaction, and especially

of the nature of some other peculiar products in addition to alizarine which render

the artificial colouring-matter difl"erent from the natural colour, has been carried

out by Mr. Perkin and by Dr. Schunck. As we are promised papers on this subject

from both these gentlemen, 1 need not at present enter further into these interesting

questions.

The surest proof of perfection in a manufacture is the degree in which the waste

products are utilized, and in which the processes are made continuous. One by

one the imperfections of the original discovery are made to disappear, the products

which were wasted become sources of profit ; and in many cases their utilization

alone renders possible the continuance of the manufacture in the middle of a

rapidly increasing district. The Section will have the opportunity of inspecting

the practical working of at least two of the most valuable of these new processes.
The first of these has been at work for some time ; it is that of the recovery of the

sulphur from the vat-waste, that hete noire of the alkali-makers and of their neigh-

bours. Dr. Mond has now satisfactorily solved the difiicult problem of economically

regaining the sulphur by oxidizing the insoluble monosulphide of calcium to the

soluble hyposulphite, and decomposing this by hydrochloric acid, when all the

sulphur is deposited as a white powder.

The second of these discoveries relates to the recovery or regeneration of the

black oxide of manganese used for the evolution of chlorine in the manufactiure of

bleaching-powder. This subject has long attracted the attention of chemists; and

a feasible though somewhat costly process, that of Dunlop, has been at work for
some time at Messrs. Tennant's works at St. Rollox. During the last year a very

beautifully simple and economical process, proposed by Mr. Weldon, and first

successfully carried out on a practical scale in Messrs. Gamble's works at St.

Helens, has quickly obtained recognition, and is now worked by more than thirty-

seven fijms throughout the kingdom.

. The principle upon which this process depends was explained by Mr. Weldon at

the Exeter Meeting. It depends on the fact that although when alone the lower

oxides of manganese cannot be oxidized by air at the ordinary temperature and

under the ordinary pressure to the state of dioxide, yet this is possible when one

molecule of lime is present to each molecule of the oxide of manganese. The

manganous oxide is precipitated from the still-liquors with the above excess of

lime ; and by the action of air on this a black powder, consisting of a compound of

manganese dioxide and lime, MnOa CaO, or calcium manganite, is formed. This

of course is capable of again generating chlorine on addition of hydrochloric acid

and thus the chlorine process is made continuous, with a working loss of only 2 j per
cent, of manganese. The Section will have the advantage of seeing Mond's process

at work at Messrs. Hutchinson's, and Weldon's process at Messrs. Gaskell, Deacon

and Co.'s at Widnes.

 A third process, which may possibly still further revolutionize the manufacture of

bleaching-powder, is the direct production of chlorine from hydrochloric acid with-

out the use of manganese at all. In the presence of oxygen and of certain metallic

oxides, such as oxide of copper, hydrochloric acid gas parts at a red heat \s'ith all

its hydrogen, water and chlorine being formed. This interesting reaction is employed

by its discoverer, Mr. Deacon, for the direct manufacture of bleaching-powder
from the (rases issuing directly from the salt-cake furnace. Air is admitted,
together with hydrochloric acid gas, and the mixture is passed over red-hot bricks
impregnated with copper salt. The oxide of copper acts as by contact and remains
unaltered, whilst the chlorine, watery vapour, and excess of air pass at once into
the lime-chamber. There are many practical difficulties in working this process

on the large scale, some of which have still to be overcome ; but I believe we shall

hear from Mr. Deacon that, notwithstanding these drawbacks, he has accomplished
his end of making good bleachiug-powder by this process.

0>i the Alloys of Copper, Tin, Zinc, Lead, and other Metals ivifh Manganese.

                             By J. Fejstwick Alien-, F.G.S.

   In the year 1826 a spoon, made by Messrs. Zernecke, of Berlin, was analzyed,
and the alloy was found to be composed of copper 57-1 per cent., manganese 19'7

per cent., zinc 2.3-2 per cent. This analysis is included in a chapter on Kupfer-
mangan, by Mi-. .Tohann Tenner, in his " ' Handbuch der Metall-Legirungen,' pub-
lished at Oiiedlinburg. Berthier produced a large number of alloys of manganese

with various metals, and h.as recorded their principal properties.
   Whilst, therefore, the alloys of copper, zinc, and other metals with manganese

have been more or less known to the metallurgist for more than forty years, whilst

their valuable physical properties have been fully described, whilst, moreover,
manganese in its ores .almost approaclies iron in its abundance and in its value, and

yet for years has been suiiered to escape as a waste product from abnost every large

alkali-works, we find tlie metallurgist has not succeeded in reducing it to serve

widely except when yoked with iron.                                                                         __
To produce metallic manganese was not from the first attempted ; and it is with

extreme difficulty that even small quantities of this metal can be prepared.

   From the first it was discovered that in using any of the ores of mang.anese, the

iron and the silicon completely destroyed the value of the product. Haying ob»
tained a comparatively pure oxide of manganese, recovered from the " still liquors,"
and having mixed this with oxide of copper {not metallic copper), together with
wood charcoal, all finely ground and intimately mixed, the charge was put into a
plumbago crucible, then heated in an air-furnace at an intense heat from three to

four hours. When the pot was taken out, it was found that, still suspended in the

charcoal, and not run down to the bottom, there were innumerable fine shots of a

bright white metal ; these, being separated by washing and placed again in the

crucible and heated, fused into a pill or button covered with a layer of green vitreous
slao-. The process was continued until some small ingots were produced ; and on

the'se experiments were made as to their malleability and ductility.
   The alloy was found to be very hard and very brittle when hot ; but when cold,

although still hard, it rolled with ease, and was highly elastic. The proportions

of the alloy were about :--copper 75 per cent., manganese 25 per cent. When the

simple alloy had been produced in sufficient quantities, compound alloys with zinc

were tried in various proportions ; and these, again, rolled with complete success.
    Certain mixtures of copper, zinc, and manganese possess the advantage over both

German silver and yellow metal, that, whereas the one will only roll cold and the

other hot, the manganese alloy rolls from hot to cold.

   As a simple &\\oy, in which the proportions of manganese range from 5 to 30 per

cent., it is both malleable and ductile, with a tenacity considerably greater than

that of copper.                                                                                          .

With  zinc    a compound alloy,     resembling  in  some  of  its  qualities                                German  silver,

is obtained.

   The alloy of copper and manganese combines with tin, lead, and other metals
and from these castings are made, and applied as bearings for machinery, and other

similar purposes.

It  was  not  the  nature  of  the  metal  itself that  prevented  it  being  widely                        used                     it

was its cost. The waste of manganese is very considerable, over 10 per cent, re-

maining unreduced, and forming a silicate ; the wear .and tear of the plumbago

pots and the furnace incurred a large expense"; and in proportion to the quantity

of metal produced, the fuel consumed and the labour expended were great.
  The waste of manganese in alloys rich in that metal mil, it is feared, always he

considerable                                                            but the value of the raw material would permit some such loss, could
                                                                     ;

the other points be obtained ; and these, it is believed, have now been achieved.

The metal has been produced by heating a mixture of carbonate of manganese

with oxide of copper and charcoal in a tolerably large reverberatory furnace, and

not in a small and costly pot. The fuel used has been principally the common

slack or small coal of the district, and not coke. The labour has been proportion-

atelj' reduced; and a series of alloj's are produced that ere long promise to play no

uuiraportant part in the arts and manufactures.

   It is the excellent furnace-arrangements of Mr. Siemens that have assisted in
overcoming the difficulties at first encountered, by aftbrding the intense heat
needed, with a non-oxidiziug flame, in a quiet atmosphere.

   The following specimens were exhibited :

ganese, as ingot, sheet, and wire.

recently, and had only imperfectly united ; they contained an unusual amount of
fat. Portions of the ribs were removed and freed from fat before they were sub-
mitted to analysis, and the remaining portions were handed to the Curator of the

Museum of the School of Medicine.

   V. For comparison with these, I give' the composition of the femur and tibia of
a nine mouths foetus in column V., and of the bones from a case of osteomalacia
in column VI.

   VII. is calculated from the analysis of a healthy adult tibia by Valentin.
   VIII. is calculated from analyses of ribs of a healthy man, aged 25, by Von Bibra.

    It will be observed that the ratio of organic constituents to earthy matter is

much greater, while the ratio of lime to phosphoric acid is distinctly less, in the

ribs of paralytics than in those of healthy adults. There are the same differences
between the composition of healthy ribs and those of paralytics as between the
composition of the adult large bones and those of the fcetus ; and, generally, the
composition in cases of par.ilj'sis approaches that observed in cases of osteomalacia.
Whether the defects in the ribs of paralytics are due to arrested development or to
degeneration of the fully developed bone, it will require further experiments upon
carefully selected cases to prove; but from the evidence already obtained the
author was led to conjecture that both causes will be found to operate.

   The result of the analysis is suggestive rather than conclusive as to the condition
of the bones in patients the subj ects of general paralysis ; and it would be unsafe to
generalize from a few examples. The analysis, however, is a first instalment
towards determining, by scientific inquiry, whether the statements that have been
made, as to the peculiar liability to fracture of the bones in certain forms of
insanity, holds good as a general rule.

On a Spectroscope in tvJiich the Prisms are automaticalh/ adjusted for the Mi-
   nimum Angle of Deviation for the particular Hay under examination. Bi/
   JonN Browning, F.ll.A.8.

   In spectroscopes of oniinary construction, when several prisms are employed, a

great deficiency of light will be noticed towards the more refrangible end of tlie

spectrum.

   This arises from the fiict that the prisms are adjusted to the minimum angle of

deviation for the most luminous rays, which are near the other end of the .·spectrum.
   The Diagram shows the method in which the change in the adjustment of the

prisms to the minimum angle of deviation for each particular ray is made automa-

tically. In this diagram P, P, &c. represent prisms. All these prisms, witli
the exception of the first, are unattached to the plate on which they stand--
the triangular stand, on which the prisms are hinged together at the angles cor-
responding to those at the bases of the prisms ; to each of these bases is attached

a bar B, perpendicular to the base of the prism. As all these bars are slotted,
and run on a common centre, the prisms are brought into a circle. This central
pivot is attached to a dovetail piece, two or three inches in length, placed on
the imderside of the main plate of the spectroscope, which is slotted to allow it
to pass through. On mo^·ing the central pivot the whole of the prisms are moved,

each to a dift'erent amoimt, in proportion to its distance in the train from the first
or fixed prism, on which the light from the slit falls after passing through the col-
limator C. Thus, supposing* the first prism of the train from C, represented in the

diagram, to be stationary, and the second prism to have been moved through 1° by
this arrangement, then the third prism will have moved through 2°, the fom'th
through 3°, the fifth through 4^, and the sixth through 5°, As these bars are at
right angles to the bases of the prisms, and all of them pass through a common

centre, it is evident that the bases of the prisms are at all times tangents to a

common circle.

  ANow for the contrivance by which this arrangement is made automatic. lever

L is attached to the corner of the triangular plate of the last prism ; this lever, by

its further end, is attached to the support which carries the telescope through
which the spectrum is observed. Both the telescope and lever are driven by the

micrometer-screw M. The action of the lever is so adjusted that, when the tele-
scope is moved through any angle, it causes the last prism to tiirn through double
that angle. The rays which issue from the centre of the last prism are thus made

to fall perpendicidarly upon the centre of the object-glass of the telescope T ; and

thus the ray of light travels parallel to the bases of the several prisms, and ulti-
mately along the optical axis of the telescope itself, and thereby the whole field of
the object-glass is tilled with light.

   Thus the apparatus is so arranged that, on turning the micrometer-screw so as
to make a line in the spectnmi coincide with the cross wires in the eyepiece of the
telescope, the lever L, attached to the telescope and prisms, sets the whole of the
prisms in motion, and adjusts them to the minimum angle of deviation for that

portion of the spectrum.

   The author had first called attention to the subject in 1868 ; at that time a very
successful experiment had been tried in Baker Street, Portman .Square. In Liver-
pool, in 1869, Bold Street, Church Street, and Lord Street were watered with salts
during the month of July. The report of the result was A-ery favourable, and the
experiments have been continued this year. In many towns experiments liavo

tion of the roadways. It is difficult to prove the economy resulting from the use
of the chlorides over a limited area ; but over large areas it is very evident. The
importance, in a sanitary point of view, of the use of chlorides has been clearly
established. The chloride of calcium decomposes the carbonate of ammonia con-

tained in the horse-droppings, the results being carbonate of Ume and chloride of
ammonium, which two results, combining with the chloride of sodium and the car-

bonate of lime contained in the roadway, cause the concreting effect so important
in the prevention of dust and the preservation of the roads.

          A. new Chlorine Process witJwut Manrjanese (luitli illustrations').

                                    By Henet Deacon.

  A heated mixtm'e of hydrocliloric 'acid gas and oxygen or air are passed over

heated salts of copper, lead, or manganese, or pieces of burnt clay, or similar porous
bodies previously soaked in solutions of the salts. Under these circumstances tlie
chlorine of the hydrochloric acid is set free ; and the action is so complete that, by
proportioning the surfaces of the salts and current of gases, the whole of the chlo-

rine can be liberated or all the oxygen or air absorbed. At 750° F. the reaction is
most active with copper salts ; lead salts require a higher temperature, and man-

 ganese salts still higher ; and as the temperatures increase, it is believed chlorine

reacts on the vapour of water produced to re-form hydrochloric acid. With copper

 salts no such re-formation occm-s. If the temperature be too high, chloride of
 copper alwaj'S sublimes, whatever salt of copper be first employed.

    The author predicted this reaction, so far as the chloride of copper and of man-
ganese are concerned, from the belief that chemical forces may be united and
 resolved as mechanical forces are, and as, he believes, is evidenced in the ordinary
 manufactures of sulpliuric acid and of sulphuric ether by the continuous processes.

     Tlie positive proof or disproof of this theory appears only to be possible by con-
 sidering the time occupied. If a result follows from the formation and subsequent
 decomposition of a compound, the total time will be the time of the two processes
 added together ; but if it be a direct result of the union of the forces, it will be the
 time only of either process alone. This proof being at present unavailable, the
 author relies on the test of the other proof of a correct theory, viz. its power of

 foretelling unknown events, and claims in this instance to have shown the great

 probability of the truth of his theory, admitting that it is not yet strictly proved.

   On Cyanogen. By Thomas Faieley, F.C.S., Science Master at the Leeds
                                         Grammar School.

  --I. Prqntration of Cyanogen. The author has found the most convenient method

 for the preparation of cyanogen to be the action of one part of pm-e potassium cy-
 anide, dissolved in as little water as possible, on two parts of powdered copper
 sulphate, mixed vsdth scarcely more water than sufficient to moisten and cover it.

    The operation may be performed in an ordinary bottle or flask ; and the cyanide
 solution should be added a little at a time, as' the action is very rapid. Much

 water prevents the action. Besides its convenience, this method gives at least
 two 15ths of the weight of the cyanide as cyanogen. Careful experiments, made with
 mercuric cyanide, show that it 'is very difficult to obtain more than one 15th of its

--weight as cyanogen, i. e. only one third of the cyanogen it contains.
    n. Hydrogenation of Cyanogen. In a former paper the author showed that when
 cyanogen and hydrogen are passed over platinum black at 140° C, they combine.

 He ha.9 repeated and extended these experiments, and finds that the substance ob-

 tained by passing the gases into dilute hydrochloric acid is the chloride of an organic
 base contaming C, II, N, CI in the exact proportions of the chloride of ethylene
 diammouium. The chloride is soluble in absolute alcohol, and, heated with alkalies,
 gives ofl" a liquid base. The chlorplatiuato is very soluble in water, and soluble to

                                                                          I
TRANSACMONS OF THE SECTIONS.  55

some extent even in strong alcohol. In forming this salt, if platinum solution con-

taining acids of nitrogen be used, chlorplatiuate of ammonium is obtained. In

using platinum black, dark-colom-ed products are formed, which partly remain
with the platinum, and interfere with the process. The author has tried all the
other forms of platinum, and they all act more or less ; but finds that platinized

charcoal is the best. He prefers cocoanut-shell charcoal, because of its greater

absorptive power ; but ordmary charcoal, containing the same proportion of pla-

tinum, 5 per cent., answers very well.
   Hydrogen from dilute sulphuric acid and zinc is passed through a wash-bottle,

then through a cyanogen-bottle (giving oft' cyanogen from the mixture mentioned
above). The mixed gases pass then through a wash-bottle containing water, then
through an empty bottle, then through a long calcium-chloiide tube to dry them
thoroughly. They then pass over the heated charcoal placed in a flask or in a tube

bent into a convenient form, and heated in an air-bath to 190° to 200° C, accord-

ing to the rapidity of the current of the gases.

  When this apparatus is working, dense white fumes are seen in the Liebig's

bulb containing dilute hydrochloric acid, through which the gases finally pass.
With a sufficient excess of hydrogen, little cyanogen escapes unacted on ; and
the charcoal remains as efficient after some days' use as at first.

    This platinized charcoal also serves well for the hydrogenatiou of hydrocj^anic acid.
   Ordinary charcoal possesses in some degree the property of causing the gases to
combine at a temperature of 210° C.

 --III. Cyanogen Hydriodate. This substance is obtained by bringing the two dry
--gases into contact more conveniently by passing cyanogen into dry ether, and then

saturatiog it with dry hydriodic acid gas. It crystallizes out diu-ing the process.
It has a reddish-yellow colour and onion-like smell, and stains the skin, paper, &c.
dark brown. It absorbs moisture from the air with avidity, and is decomposed by

water and by alcohol. From the aqueous solution the iodine is entirely precipi-

tated by argentic nitrate. It is dried and freed from ether by passing over it a
current of diy hydrogen while the flask containing it is placed on the water-bath.
Heated above 100° C. it decomposes, giving off free iodine. Analyses give per-

centages agreeing well -with the formula Cj N^ Hg I3.

  A compound containing more 11 I than the above exists, but is exceedingly im-

stable, continually losing hydriodic acid at ordinary temperatures.
   These substances were obtained while experimenting on the hydrogenation of

cyanogen by the action of metals on cyanogen and excess of hydriodic acid ia

etherial solutions.

   Note on the Distillation of Sulphuric Acid. By Thomas Faikley, F.O.S.

   In an attempt to obtain sulphuric anhydride by distilling sodium anhydrosulphate
with strong sulphuric acid, the author observed the great facility with which sid-

phuric acid boils and distils in the presence of alkaline sulphates. By heating sul-

phuric acid and some alkaline sulphate over an ordinary Bunsen rose-burner, in a
glass retort sheltered simply from draughts of cold air, quantities of pure sulphuric

acid may be readily obtained. If the sulphuric acid contains acids of nitrogen, as it
should do when an acid free from arsenic is required, these come over first, along
with any water that may be present. Lead sulphate crystallizes out during the

process, but does not interfere till it has accumulated from repeated operations.

   On the Furification of SanJcey Brook. Bi/ Alfred E. Fletcher, F.O.S.

   The Sankey Brook flows through St. Helens, in Lancashire. Its chief impuri-
ties are free acid and sulphide of hydrogen.

   The author proposes to allow the water to flow over beds of the old alkali waste,
which is to be found in immense quantities in the neighbourhood.

   This, containing hyposulphite of calcium, would give oft" sulpliurous acid when
.dissolved in the acid water of the brook, and thus destroy the sulphide of hydrogen,
the two gases forming together sulphur and water; at the same time the lime

·would neutralize the free acid.

    A'ir-]i6llutlon from Chemical Worlcs. By Alfkeb E. Fletcher, F.C.S.

  On tlie Utilization of Seivage, iviili special reference to the Phosphate Process.

                                By Davib Foebes, F.B.8.

    It was stated that sewage irrigation was tlie only process which had as yet uti-
lized the entire liquid as well as the solid contents of the sewage. As, however,
there are many cases in which sewage irrigation is neither applicable nor advan-
tageous, it is desirable that some chemical process should be sought for by which
the sewage could be so far purified by precipitation that the supernatant water
could be allowed to run off directly into rivers without danger to health or animal
life, whilst the precipitate should be of so high a value as manure as to pay for its
transport to a distance for the use of the agricidturists. The experiments made
already on the London sewage by the phosphate process, and on the present occa-
sion successfully repeated on a small scale before the audience with Livei-pool
sewage, appear to fulfil in a gi-eat measure these conditions. This process, brought
forward by the author in conjunction with Dr. A. Price, is based upon the fact
that certain mineral phosphates, when in a freshly precipitated state, eagerly com-
bine with both organic matter and ammonia in sewage. The process required
nothing beyond a reservoir containing the sewage, to which the phosphates (in
major partof alumina) are added, preferably in the state of solution in hydro-
chloric or sulphuric acid, from which, by the addition of a little milk of lime
(just sufficient to neutralize the acid which holds them in solution), they are at
once precipitated, along with the organic matter and part of the ammonia in the
sewage. The deposit subsides rapidly, and leaves the water clear and colourless,
even if tinctorial substances of great power are present : in the experiments shown,
ink was added to the Livei-pool sewage, but the colouring-matter was instantly
removed along with the precipitate. The effluent water obtained by this process
is, of course, not any thing like so pure as water ordinarily supplied for drinking-
purposes ; still the water from the London sewage at Barking Creek, so purified,
could, as was shown, be drunk without repugnance, fishes could live in it, and it
had remained free from offensive smell for months, during the entire hot summer
of last year, without any tendency to'putrefy or emit any disagreeable odour. With
regard to the value of the precipitated manure, it was admitted that no known
chemical substances could precipitate from sewage the whole amount of substances
valuable for agriculture ; and it was only claimed that so much of them had been
extracted as to leave the effluent water innoxious, whilst one of the most impor-
tant featui-es of the process, in which it differs from all the others, is, that all the
substances employed in the purification augment the agricultural value of the pre-
cipitated manure, and thus render it of such value as to enable it to bear the cost

of transport to a distance.

  On the Action of Sulphurous Acid, in Aqueous Solution, on Phosphates and

                    other Compounds. By Dr, B. W. Geelanb.

    Sulphurous acid in aqueous solution dissolves various phosphates without

decomposing them, even when the oxide forms with sulphurous acid an insoluble

compoimd. In this respect the tribasic phosphate of lime is particularly interest-

ing. By means of sulphurous acid a solution of 1'3 sp. gr. can be obtained. This

keeps very well in the cold; but a rise of the temperature to 19° determines the
gradual precipitation of sulphite of lime. If the solution is quickly heated, a com-

pound corresponding to the formula 300, PO3, SOj, 2II0 is fonned, which sepa-
rates as a white crystalline powder, and is characterized by great stability. It is a
powerful disinfectant and an active manure. The solution gives dibasic phosphate
of lime by boiling imder reduced pressure, by standing in vacuum, and by mixing

phosphate, even if the tiibasic salt is in solution. Phosphate of magnesia-ammonia

mixing with alcohol, into two layers, the lower being principally an aqueous solu-

tion of acid phosphate of soda, and the upper one an alcoholic solution of acid

sulphite of soda. If the crystals of the phosphate are mixed with a little M^ater

        Note on the Occurrence of Vanadium. By Dr. B. "W. Gerland.

    The author's friend, Mr. Jon. Donn, discovered a large deposit of a sandstone
 the chemical analysis of which proved it to contain vanadiate of lead and copper'
beside a great number of other metals, also thallium in appreciable quantity!
The manufacture of vanadic acid from this ore is not difficult. The author has
preparedSJ lbs. of pure vanadic acid from 1 cwt. of picked pieces of the sandstone.

    Vanadic acid is likely to prove useful by its oxidizing property in both neutral

and acid solutions. As the lower oxide of vanadium formed in this process is apt

to take up oxygen from the air, the vanadic acid can play in solution the part of
nitrous acid in the vitriol-chambers. For instance, a solution of 30 grnis. of

aniline in hydrochloric acid, mixed with 2 grms. ammonium vanadiate and much

water, deposited, after some time, a deep-blue substance, which increased in quan-
tity until all aniline had disappeared. The vanadiate was left in solution.

  When solutions of two salts are mixed together, it has been foimd that they at

once begin to decompose one another; but if the new compounds are themselves

soluble in water, the decomposition is never complete, but the four salts remain
together in solution in certain proportions, dependent on the strengih of affinity of
ea«h base for each salt-radical, and on the actual amount of each. If, however

one of the new compounds is insoluble in water, it removes itself from the field of

 action, and a redistribution of the constituents takes place, until the whole of the
 insoluble salt that can be formed is formed and precipitates. If one of the new-
 compounds is so sparingly soluble that it crystallizes out, it is inferred that a fur-
 ther redistribution must also take place tUl the amount that the water holds in
 solution is sufficient to balance what remains of the original compounds. This is
 what has been termed " reciprocal decomposition."

    In most cases that have been examined, this action takes place rapidly, the
 balance being attained apparently as soon as the salts ai'e thoroughly mixed ; in
 other cases, however, the action will go on for minutes, hours, or even days.
 Quantitative experiments had been made on the rate of formation of ferric meco-
 nate, ferric ferrocyanide in oxalic acid, potassio-iodide of platinum, the sulphates
 of barium, strontium, and calcium, oxalate of magnesium, and acid tartrate of
 potassium. It was found that where aU four compoimds remain in solution, the

 amount of new salt produced in equal periods of time becomes gradually less and
 less till the limit is very slowly attained ; but where one of the new compounds
 crj'stallizes out, the maximum of chemical change is not at the commencement of

 the action but after a certain quantity of crj'stals have been already deposited. In

 this latter case many circumstances of a mechanical nature affect the rate, which
 do not influence the decomposition when all the conipomids continue in solution

 but a rise of temperature was found in both cases greatly to accelerate the chemical

 action.

                     On the Soda Manufacture. By "W. Gossage.

    This contribution was a supplement to a paper on the same subject read at Man-

 chester in 1861, noticing various improvements connected with the processes of
' manufacturing soda during the lapse of nine years since that period, and giving
 also some details of the increase which has taken place in the extent of this impor-
 tant manufacture during that time. One of the most important events has been
 the passing of " The ."Ukali Act, 186.3," rendering it imperative that manufacturers

 decomposing common salt for the production of sulphate of soda, should condense

 not less than 95 per cent, of the hydrochloric acid gas evolved by such decompo-
 sition. In the former paper, the means the author had devised and carried into
 successful operation in the year 1836, for effecting such condensation, were de-

 scribed, these means being now adopted imiversally, and so successfully that, in
 many instances, this condensation exceeds 99 per cent. The most important use

 for the hydrochloric acid obtained by sucli condensation is the manufacture of hypo-
 chlorite of lime, or bleaching powder, the demand for wliich has taken an extra-
 ordinary development since the introduction of straw. Esparto grass, and some
 other substances than rags for the manufacture of paper. At the date of the pre-
 vious paper, the chlorine was obtained by the action of hydrochloric acid on per-
 oxide of manganese. Recently Mr. Walter Weldon, of Loudon, has perfected a
 process by which peroxide of manganese is obtained from the chloride of man-
 ganese prodnced by the action of hydrochloric acid on peroxide of manganese
 and this process has been successfully carried into practice in this district, also in
 that of Newcastle, and it has already been adopted by some of the largest manu-
 facturers in both localities. Allusion was then made to Mr. Deacon's very scien-
 tific process for the manufacture of chlorine without the use of manganese. Mr.
 James Hargreaves, of Widnes, has also devised means for producing chlorine with-
 out the use of oxide of manganese. The iron slag is treated with hydrochloric
 acid, and thereby protochloride of iron in solution is obtained as a by-product,
 which is evaporated, producing dry jirotochloride ; and this, hj slow application of
 heat with access of atmospheric air, becomes perchloride, which undergoes decom-
 position, yielding chlorine and peroxide of iron. In the former paper it was re-
 marked that nearly all the sulphur used in this manufacture, the cost of which is
 about equal to two fifths of the total cost of 'materials required, was reobtained in
 combination with calcium, forming what is expressively designated as "alkali-
 waste ;" and it was noticed, also, that this presented a problem worthy of attention

 for its solution. Mr. L. Mond has made a near approximation to the solution of

 this problem. His process consists in causing atmospheric air to be brought into
 intimate contact with the alkali-waste as this is left in the lixiviating vats after

Atreatment with water.     very pure sulphur, almost absolutely free from arsenic,

is obtained by this mode of working, which has been carried out successfully by

various manufacturers ; but the quantity of sulphiu- obtained is far short of that

contained in the waste, and the author considered the problem still remained as an

exercise for ingenuity and perseverance. The former mode of obtaining copper and

silver from the burnt residua of coppery pyi-ites which had been used for yielding

sulphur to manufacture sulphuric acid, has been superseded by a process devised

by Mr. Henderson, which consists in mixing a small proportion of salt with burnt

pyrites, previously gi-ound to a fine powder, exposing this mixture to a low red

heat, and passing through it a current of air. By these means the small poi-tion of

sulphur which has escaped being consumed in the biu-nt pp'ites becomes oxidized,

producing sulphate of iron, which decomposes common salt, yielding chloride of

copper and sulphate of soda, which are obtained in solution on lixiviating the pro-

duct with water. The copper is then precipitated from the solution by means of

Airon, and is obtained in the metallic state.  large quantity of oxide of iron is

obtained as a residuum from the lixiviation. This is sold to the iron-smelters for

the production of iron. These operations are carried out very extensively by the

Tharsis Metal  Company at  Glasgow, Newcastle, and  Widnes                                         and at  the Widnes
                                                                                                ;

Metal Company, ^h. J. A. Phillips has carried out successfully a process invented

by Mr. Claudet, of Loudon, for exti-acting gold, silver, and lead from the burnt

residua of coppery pyrites. Li the year 1861, diuriug the negotiation of the French

Treaty of Commerce, it was estimated that the total quantity of salt decomposed

in Great Britain for the production of soda was 260,000 tons per annum. Of this

quantity 125,000 tons were decomposed in what is called the Newcastle district,

and 1.35,000 tons in the Lancashire district. According to the returns of the Alkali-

Manufacturers' Association for the year 1869, the total quantity of salt decomposed

for the manufacture of soda was 326,000 tons, thus .showing an increase of 66,000

tons, or 25 per cent, on the total. Of this quantity the decomposition in the New-

castle district in 1869 was 142,000 tons, which, being compared with 125,000 tons

in 1861, shows an increase of 17,000 tons, or 13-6 per cent. The decomposition in

the Lancashire district is retm-ned as 184,000 in 1869, against 135,000 tons in 1861,

showing an increase of 49,000 tons, or 36 per cent. Thus the Lancashire district

in 1860 exceeds by 30 per cent, the total quantity decomposed in the Newcastle

district during the same year. One of the most important applications of soda to

other manufactures is that of the production of soap. In the year 1852, when the

excise duty was finally abolished, the total production in Great Britain was equal

to 1600 tons per week, less than one half of which was produced in the Lancashire

district. The present production in the Lancashire district is fully equal to the

total production in 1852. Regarding the immense number of manufactories at

work in Lancashire for the production of chemical substances to be used in bleach-

ing, dyeing, calico-printing, &c., the conclusion was arrived at that Lancashire is

the largest seat of chemical manufactiu-es in this country.

0)1 a Metliod for the Determination of Sulphur in Coal-gas.

               By A. Veknojt HAHcorRT, F.E.S.

This paper gave a description of a piece of apparatus, which was exhibited in

action, and an account of the results obtained with it. The apparatus consisted of

a small Bimsen burner, whose nozzle passed into a glass cylinder, closed at both

ends, through which air was drawn by an aspirator. The products of combustion

were washed with an ammoniacal solution of copper dm-ing their passage through

Aa system of bulbs.  Woulfe's bottle, tilled with fragments of pimiice steeped in

ammoniacal solution of copper, served to purify the air at its entrance, and also to

charge it with ammonia.

The apparatus had been tested by passing through it carbonic acid mixed with

a known amount of sulphurous acid, and also by washing a second time the gases

leaving it. Satisfactory results had been obtained. Moreover two or more ana-

lyses of the same sample of gas gave numbers which were closely concordant.

                                            By the Eev. H. Highton, M.A.

Silica is found in various forms, more or less insoluble. Some kinds can only

be united with alkalies in the heat of a glass-furnace ; other kinds can be dissolved

imder a high pressure, and after a considerable lapse of time, by solutions of al-

kalies                          other forms, again, to which  the  author  particularly wished to call atten-

tion, can be dissolved under proper precautions even in the cold. Natural silica

of this kind was exhibited both from Germany and Enofland.

By means of this soluble silica, artificial stone can be formed harder than any

--Anatural stones, except the very hard granites and primitive rocks. The process is
as follows :                        concrete is made with any good hydraulic cement. When this

is dry, it is steeped in an alkaline solution of silica, in which is placed a quantity

of free silica. The following chemical process then takes place. The lime in the

concrete extracts the silica from the solution, leaving the alkali free, which im-

mediately attacks the free silica and conveys it in its turn to the concrete. This

process ^oes on continually till the lime in the concrete is saturated with silica.

  By this process, within a week the strength of the concrete is increased from

50 to 150 per cent. ; and by a longer continuation of the process the strength is

still more increased.

   The stone formed in this manner has been tried as a pavement in the busiest
part of Cheapside, and in many other parts of London, and for steps, lintels,
sills, &c., in many parts both of this kingdom and abroad, as well as in India.

this manner.

   As a cheap strong stone, when manufactured on a large scale, it is likely to su-

persede natural stone, except where the latter is very cheap and abundant.

   In localities, as on the Thames, where there are facilities for obtaining good

hydraulic cement and hard broken stone, it can be manufactured at a much lower

cost than Yorkshire or other stone can be procured.

       On Atmospheric Ozone, By T. Moffatt, M.D., F.E.A.S., F.G.8.

   The results in this paper were deduced from observations extending over a

period of twenty years. The author stated that the maximum of ozone occurred
with the conditions of the equatorial cui-rent of the atmosphere, and the minimum

with those of the polar current. The quantity of ozone is greater in the night
than in the day. It varies with the seasons. With thimderstoi-ms, the aurora, the

zodiacal light, hail, snow, and sleet, it is above or below the mean quantity, ac-

cording to the readings of the barometer. If the readings be increasing, ozone is

in minimum quantity ; but if they be decreasing, it is in maximum quantity, with

these phenomena. The author does not consider that the electrolytic action of
the sunbeam upon water and vegetable essences produces ozone ; it is, however,

he states, produced by the action of the sun's rays upon turpentine. He believes

phosphorescence to be the chief source of atmospheric ozone ; and from results
deduced from a long series of observations on the phosphorescence of the sea in

connexion with ozone, he finds tliat the maximum of the latter takes place when
the sea is phosphorescent, and the minimum when it is not phosphorescent.
From observations taken diuring four passages over the North Atlantic, it would
appear, the author states, that the minimum of phosphorescence of the sea and

of ozone occur in the " ice-track " and in the proximity of icebergs.

On the Quantity of Phosphoric Acid excreted from the System in connexion with

      Atmospheric Conditions. By T. Moffatt, M.D., F.B.A.S., F.G.S.

   The author mentions that in a paper of his on the above subject, read at
the Meeting of the British Association last year, he gave the results of ob-

servations for each month. These results showed that the maximum quantity of

phosphoric acid is excreted under the conditions of the equatorial cm-rent of the

atmosphere, and that the minimum takes place with those of the polar cun-ent.

Observations continued during the winter months of last year afford similar re-
sults, from which the author concludes that the quantity of phosphoric acid formed
in the system by the oxidation of the phosphorus in the protein and phosphorated
fat of the blood in the peripheral system, and in the limgs, is determined by the
pressure of the atmosphere, just as phosphorus is oxidated out of the system.

                                 By J. Arthur Philiips.

   It has long been known to those engaged in copper-extraction by the wet

process that the precipitate produced not only contains a notable quantity of

silver, but also traces of gold. No attempt, however, to separate the precious
metals, and to turn them to profitable account, had been made up to the com-
mencement of the present year, when Mr. F. Claudet patented a process for tho

separation of silver from ordinary copper-liquors by the addition of a soluble

iodide.

   The amount of silver present in burnt ore seldom exceeds 18 dwts.^per ton ; and
as the whole of this is never obtained in solution, it foUows that, in order to ob-
tain satisfactory commercial results, the process employed should be both cheap

and expeditious.

    The Vftts in -wliich the burnt ores which have been roasted with salts are lixi-
 viated, generally receive some eight or nine successive washings, either with water
 or with water acidulated by hydrochloric acid ; and of these the first three only
 contain a sufficient amount of silver to be worth working.

    For the purpose of removing the soluble salts, hot water is employed ; and as a
large proportion of the chloride of sodium used remains undecomposed, it acts as a
solvent for the chloride of silver produced during the process of fumacing.

   The several operations for the extraction of silver are conducted in the following
manner ; and as the first three washings contain Do per cent, of the total amount

of that metal dissolved, these alone are treated.

    These liquors are fii-st run into suitable wooden cisterns, each of the capacity of
about 2700 gallons, where they are allowed to settle. The yield of silver per
gallon is now ascertained by taking a measured quantity, to which are added hy.
drochloric acid, iodide of potas.sium, and a solution of acetate of lead. The precipi-
tate thus obtained is thrown upon a filter, and, after being dried, is fused with a
flux consisting of a mixture of carbonate of soda, borax, and lampblack. The
resulting argentiferous lead is passed to the cupel ; and fi-om the weight of the
button of silver obtained the amount of that metal in a gallon of the liquor is

estimated.

   The liquor from the settling-vat is now allowed to flow into another, whilst at

the same time the exact amount of a soluble iodide necessary to precipitate the
silver present is run into it from a gi-aduated tank, together with a quantity of
water equal to about one tenth of the volume of the copper-liquor. During the
filling of the second tank its contents are constantly stin-ed ; and when filled, a
little lime-water is added, and it is allowed to settle during forty-eight hours.

   The supernatant liquors are, after being assayed, run off", and the tank again
filled, whilst the precipitate collected at the bottom is, about once a fortnight,

   This precipitate is chiefly composed of sulphate of lead, iodide of silver, and

salts of copper, from which "the latter are readily removed by washing with dilute
hydrochloric acid. Thus freed from salts of copper, the precipitate is decomposed
by metallic zinc, which reduces the iodide of silver completely, and, to a certain
extent, also the sulphate of lead. The result of this decomposition is : -.

             On the Absorption of Hydrogen b>/ Electro-deposited Iron.

                 By "W. Chandler Egberts, Chemist of the Mint.

   The author reminded the Section of a paper read during the Meeting of the Bri-
tish Association at Exeter, by Dr. Jacobi of St. Petersburg, on the electro-deposi-
tion of iron, specimens of which were submitted for inspection.

   The well-known experiments of Mr. Graham proved that palladium occluded 900
times its volume of hydrogen ; and Dr. Jacobi considered that the electro-deposition
of iron was attended 'by a similar absorption of hydrogen, although to a less degree.

  By submitting this idea to the test of experiment, the author found that the iron

contained at least 15-5 times its volume of hydi-ogen. The experiments were
effected by heating the iron hi vaaw.

   Similar results were also obtained by Lenz and Klein.
   Mr. Graham also proved that tubes of malleable iron, when heated to redness,
allowed hydrogen to penetrate their walls. The experiments were then attended by
unavoidable errors ; but by employing a tube of iron electro-deposited on a rod of
wax, Mr. Roberts was enabled to confirm the results .obtained by INlr, Graham,

On the Chemical Composition of Cotton. By E, Schtinck, Ph.D., F.R.S.

It is generally supposed that cotton, wlien quite pure, consists entirely of woody

fibre or cellulose, and that its composition is conseq[uently represented by the for-
mula 0(2, Hjo, OxQ. It is certain, howerer, that in the raw state, as furnished by
commerce, it contains a number of other ingredients, some of which occur so coni

stantly that they must be considered essential constituents of cotton, viewed as a
vegetable product. The object of the bleaching process, to which most cotton

fabrics are subjected, is to deprive the fibre of these other ingredients, and leave the

cellulose behind in a state of pmity. Notwithstanding the importance of an accu-

rate knowledge of every thing relating to cotton from an industrial point of view,

the substances contained in it along with cellulose have never been subjected to a

?)ecial chemical examination, and, consequently, very little is known about them,

he object which the author had in view in undertaking his investigation was to

endeavour to throw a little more light on the nature of these substances. All

foreign and extraneous matter inti'oduced during the process of manufacture was
left entirely out of consideration. The author fm-ther confined his attention to those

constituents of the fibre which are insoluble iu water, but soluble in alkaline lye,

and are consequently precipitated by acid from the alkaline solution.

The material employed by the author was cotton yarn, which he preferred to

unspun cotton for several reasons, the principal being that yarn is comparatively

free from mechanical impurities (such as fragments of seed-vessels, &c.), while, oil

the other hand, if proper care be taken, no impurity is added dm-ing the process of

spinning to those previously existing. The yarn was boiled in an ordinary bleacher's

keii- for several hours, with a dilute solution of soda-ash. The resulting dark-

brown liquor, after the yam had been taken out, drained, and slightly washed, was

removed from the. keir into appropriate vessels, and mixed with an excess of suU

phuric acid, which produced a copious light-brown flocculent precipitate, while the

liquid became colourless. This precipitate was allowed to settle, the liquid was

poured off; and after being washed with cold water to remove the sulphate of soda

Aand excess of acid, it was put on calico strainers and allowed to drain.  thick

pulp was thus obtained, which, when dried, assumed the appearance of a brown,

brittle, horn-like substance translucent at the edges. In one experiment 450 lbs. of

yam, made from East-Indian cotton, of the variety called "DhoUerah," yielded

0-33 per cent, of the dried precipitate. In another experiment, made with 500 lbs.
of yarn spun from American cotton, of the kind called in commerce " middling

Orleans," 0-48 per cent, was obtained. The total loss sustained by yam during the

bleaching process amounts to about 5 per cent, of its weight. Only'a small portion,

therefore, of the matter lost is recovered by precipitation of the alkaline extract with

acid. This precipitate formed more especially the subject of the author's investi-

gation. It was found to consist almost entirely of organic substances ; and of these

the following were distinctly recognized :

  A1. species of vegetable wax, to which the name of "cotton wax" may be

        given,

A2. fatty acid, identical with margaric acid.

3 and 4. Brown resinous colouring-matters.

   5. Pectic acid.

  A6. trace of albuminous matter.

   The author described the method employed by him for separating these sub-
stances from one another, and obtaining them in a state of purity ; and he then gave
an account of their properties and composition.

                                              By Peteb Spence, F.G.S.

The author stated that he had been engaged in a series of experiments with the

view of determining the boiling-points of the saturated solutions of various salts,

by blowing into these solutions steam of 100° C, and taking the highest point

of temperature attainable by this means as the boiling-point of the saturated solu-

tion of the salt operated upon. This was following out into practical results the

discovery brought by the author before the Exeter Meeting, that steam of 100° C.

gives mucli higher temperatures than its own in such solutions. Several difficulties

were alluded to ; but these the author hoped to overcome, and concluded by giving

a list of solutions that he believed are determined with an approach to accuracy.

               On the Retention of Organic Nitrogen by Charcoal.

                        By Edwaed C. C. Stanford, F.CS.

   This paper -was a continuation of one read by the author at the Exeter Meeting

Alast year, entitled " Chemical Method of treating the Excreta of Towns. " In this

paper the value of the dry as opposed to the water-closet system was warmly advo-

cated. It was shown that the only two real disadvantages alleged against the appli-

cation of the dry system to large towns were :

1st. The large quantity of valueless material required to te carted in and out;

and

2nd. The difficulty of obtaining the necessary supply.

These two difficulties are at once removed by the process proposed by the author.

Instead of earth, X-charcoal, or charcoal derived from the carbonized excreta, is

used as the deodorizer; of this, in proportion to earth, only one-fourth of the

quantity is required, while the substance removed aflbrds by reburning the neces-

sary supply. The daily increase of this is available for manure. So far, therefore,

from being applicable only to small towns, the system must pay best where the

population is the densest. The niti-ogen, phosphoric acid, and potash are all re-
mtained and the expense of removal
                               ;    proportion to that by water carriage is

intinitesmal.

Houses properly constructed are only visited once a-year, and the removal is less

in amount, and even less disagreeable, than that of the house ashes. All the malaria

and other evils of connexion with sewers are avoided, and health is ensured.

Twelve months' experience on a lai-ge scale are stated to have fully demonstrated

all the advantages claimed for this process, and proved it an efficient solution of the

sewage difficulty. As, however, some chemists have assumed that the action of
charcoal on animal nitrogenotis matter is to oxidize it into nitrates, this was made the

subject of a special investigation. The author showed in his former paper that

excreta being already an oxidized product, there was little foundation for this as-

sumption as far as regards this animal matter. Now he also shows that even meat

when dry is unaffected by either X-charcoal or seaweed charcoal. Mixtures of these

charcoals with meat and with solid and fluid excreta were allowed to become dry,

and then tested monthly for nitrogen for six months. It was found that there was

no loss of nitrogen, no oxidation, and no formation of nitrates. As this result is

contrary to the usual view, further experiments with other charcoals are promised.

Dtist as a Ferment. By Chakles E. C. Tichborne, F. O.S., M.R.I.A.

   The author's paper was an attempt to deal with the chemical activity of dusts as

actual ferments. He referred to his researches in 1866 (the cholera year), in which

he demonstrated that the organic portion of street dusts in large towns consisted of
stable manure finely ground. Such dust generally gives an acid reaction, but there

were some cases taken from the locality of cab-stands which presented traces of
ammonia. The following is one of the specimens given :

   The large amount of iron in some of these dusts is peculiar; for instance, that
obtained from the " Ancient Concerts-room " gave 21 per cent, as the amount of

peroxide in the inorganic matter. This probably proceeds from a slow combustion

of the gas-burners.

Some further experiments were then instituted to determine how far, and to what

extent, these dusts would operate as ferments, and a volumetric system of measu-

rino- the intensity of any process of fermentation was contrived. The process is

based upon the reduction of a nitrate of any base to a nitrite in the presence of sub-

stances undergoing putrefactive fermentation. In these experiments precautionaiy

measures were adopted, so that all the fermentations induced were proper to the
Adusts used as ferments.
                            mixture of cane- and milk-sugar was the pabulum

used in conjunction with mineral substances, including a weighed portion of ni-

trate of potassium. These expeiiments, conducted in flasks closed with cotton-

--wool, were kept at a temperature of 20° to 28° C. They were examined from day

to day in the following manner : 5 cubic centimetres of the clear liquid were with-

drawn with a gi'aduated pipette, and the level of the remaining liquid marked upon

the flask, so that it could be made up to the original level if there is any loss from

evaporation. The 5 cubic centimetres were then mixed with a little mucilage of

starch and iodide of potassium. On acidulating with sulphuric acid, blue iodide of

etavcli is at once formed in each case, representmg the N^ O3 present, or the nitrate

Areduced.  volumetric solution of hyposulphite of sodium was then used for the

estimation of iodide of starch found. ' It is rather a curious observation that, if the

nitrate of potassium did not exceed J of a grain to the ounce of fermenting liquid

after the first 24 hours, all traces of nitrites disappear, although there is still nitrate

present. The results are different if we introduce 2 to 3 grains. It is probable

that, in the reduction of the nitrates preparatory to the assimilation of the nitrogen,

a nitrate is the first sta^e ; but that if the ferment bears a considerable proportion

to the nitrate present, the nitrogen will be assimilated in the form of some lower

compound of nitrogen. One point of importance is evident, that, in the examination

of potable waters, if nitrates are present, but if no nitrites, it is no proof that decom-

position is not actually proceeding at the time as regards the organic matter

therein.                                                           .,        .

The different results are then given in detail as regards the dust examined, and

which were introduced as ferments. They conclusively proved the powers of these

dusts for this purpose ; they also seem to point to a cm-ious phase of the subject,
viz. that dust taken at a great height, as from " Nelson's Pillar," seems to have as

gi-eat or greater activity than that which would be obtained from a building which

is nightly crowded to siiftbcation. This may in some measure be due to the extreme
levity of the spores. There is probably an altitude of the maximum of activity

for all localities as regards dust

   On the Action of Low Temperatures on Supersaturated Saline Solutions.
                               By C. ToMLiNsoN, F.B.S.

   It is known that when a saline solution, saturated at a certain temperature, is

reduced in temperature, salt is deposited ; but in the case of certain salts their su-
persaturated solutions, contained in clean vessels, and protected from the action of
nuclei, do not by reduction of temperature deposit the normal salt, but a salt of a
modified character, and of a lower degree of hydration, as in the case of sodic sul-

phate, when a seven-watered salt is formed instead of the usual ten-atom hydi'ate.
Mr. Tomlinson, in some recent experiments, has shown that the supersaturated
solutions of certain salts may be reduced to near the temperature of zero without
any deposit of salt ; but below this they form tetrahedral crystals, which increase
until the whole of the solution becomes solid. K, now, the tube be put into snow
and water at 32°, the solid melts rapidly, and the solution becomes clear, bright, and
supersatiirated as before. This effect may be produced any number of times, pro-

vided the solution be preserved from the action of nuclei, or carriers of nuclei, such
as the air. The only precautions to this end are to use clean filtered solutions in

clean tubes, kept plugged with cotton-wool.

  A supersaturated solution of the double salt, formed by the sulphates of zinc and

magnesia in atomic proportions, became solid at --10° F., that of the double sulphate

of copper and magnesia at -- 4°, that of sulphate of zinc and potash alum at 0°, that

of sulphate of zinc and ammonia at 4°. Other examples are given in the paper, with
cases in which modified salts are formed and remain peimanent when the tempera-

ture is raised.

   If the cotton-wool be removed only for a few seconds, while the solution is solid,
it crystallizes dm-iug the melting into the normal salt, thus showing the action of a

nucleus.

   At these low temperatures the water of the solutions does not separate and

freeze, but combines with the saline molecules so as to form unstable hydrates. It

is remarkable that in so many cases the crystalline form of these hydrates should

be tetrahedral.

     On a Salt invisible in its Mother Liquor. By C, Tomliitson, F.B.S.

   Sir David Brewster has pointed out a method of examining precious stones in the
rough, for the purpose of determining their refi-active density and freedom from
flaws without the trouble and expense of grinding and polishing them. For this
purpose the rough stone is put into a mixture of oil of cassia and olive-oil, so ad-
justed as to be of about the same refractive density as the stone, when the latter
becomes invisible, or nearly so, while the flaws and defects start into view.

  When a supersaturated solution of the double salt formed by mixing the sul-

phates of zinc and soda in atomic proportions with a small quantity of water, boil-
ing and filtering into clean tubes, is exposed to the temperature of about 0° F., a
salt is formed, and is permanent for some days at ordinaiy temperatures, but it is
invisible on account of its having the same index of refraction as its mother liquor.

The latter is now only a satm-ated solution. On closing the tube vdth the thumb,

and inverting it so as to allow the mother liquor to drain off", air enters into the
cavities in the crystals ; and on allowing the mother liquor to flow back, these
air-filled cavities, having a different refractive index, become -visible, and have a

massive appearance.

   The present condition of the electro-deposition of copper and brass is put forward

paratively recent improvements to be well understood, but treating the process in a
practical manner, and with reference to some improvements and manipulations that

a salt of ammonium, is employed to deposit brass. This solution, however, evolves
hydrogen copiously, and is only -workable by means of two (irove's cells. The au-
thor finds that the evolution of gas may be either totally stopped or much lessened
by dissolving as much of the metallic cyanides as the solution will take up, and
then further charging the solution with the copper and zinc oxides. The evolution
of gas may be totally stopped by the further addition of cupric ammonide, which
may possibly carry the combined oxygen to the cathode, according to the following

equation :

At the cathode before chemical reaction.  At the cathode after chemical reaction.

{Cu,0,4NH3 + 4H,0} + H^ =                 +Cu^ + 4NH3 511,0,

Cupiic ammonide. Hydrogen.                Copper. Ammonia. Water.

--Malaguti and Sarzeau's formula for cupric ammonide being iised, that is to say,

before decomposition or chemical reaction takes place, the whole of the cupric am-
monide, together with the eliminated hydrogen, goes to the cathode ; after the de-
composition or chemical reaction has taken place, metallic copper is deposited, am-
monia is in solution, and water is formed.

    In treating the ordinary cyanide copper solution for the prevention of the evolu-

tion of hydrogen, the zinc cyanides or oxides, mentioned in the instance of the brass

solution, are left out.

  When the evolution of hydrogen has been stopped, a single Smee's cell is suf-

ficient to deposit the alloy ; but, in practice, a smgle Grove's cell, or equivalent
magneto-electric power, is employed, in order to shorten the time of immersion in

the electro-coating bath.

   The author prefers to use potassic cyanides and neutral ammonium tartrate,
when mixed with water, to form the solvent solution for either brass or copper.
The quality of brass (yellow or red) depends upon the heat of the solution.

   Acid solutions, in general, give a spreading or matted deposit, alkaline solutions
a bristling- one. The contact of the coating is promoted by working the solution
hot. The article should be pickled, scrubbed with sand, washed, scrubbed with a

portion of the depositing solution, and then placed in the depositing trough. After

deposition, the article is washed and dried in hot mahogany sawdust. Com-

plete protection from rust, and a satisfactory coating for any purpose, is given
by the use of the acid-depositing bath subsequent to that of the alkaline bath.

Communication respectinff a Besolution of the Committee of Section B on the
  2wo]iosecl establishment of a New School of Applied Science hy Government.
  By Professor A. W. Williamson, F.B.S.

   Professor Williamson communicated to the Section a Resolution which had
been passed in identical terms by the Committees of three Sections, viz. those of
Physics, Mechanics, and Chemistry. It was to the following effect :

   " That in the opinion of this Committee it is inexpedient that new institutions

for the teaching of science, pm-e or applied, such as the proposed Engineering Col-
lege for India, should be established by Government, until the Royal Commission,

now holding an inquiry into the relation of the State to scientific instruction, shall

have issued their report.
    " That the Council of the British Association be requested to consider this opi-

nion, and, should they see fit, to urge it upon the attention of Her Majesty's
Government."

   It is well known that there are in the Universities and Colleges of the United
Kingdom complete and systematic courses of instruction in the various branches of
science required for engineering pursuits, and that young men do obtain through
them the needful scientific preparation for professional work in engineering. There
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS^  69

are also special courses of instruction in engineering subjects given by men of the

greatest eminence.

   In matters relating to the higher education, Government have taken action from
time to time, by establishing special schools, without tirst taking means to ascer-
tain what arrangements already existed for carrying out the object in view, or what
kind of arrangement had been proved by experience to be most effectual for the

purpose.

   Under these circumstances, the British Association urged upon Her Majesty's
Government la?t session the desirability of appointing a Royal Commission for the

purpose of obtaining information respecting the existing arrangements for scientific

instruction in this country ; and it is well known that a Commission has already
begun to take e\idence on the subject.

   There is reason to believe that the labours of the Commission will be of great

value to the cause of scientific education, and will prepare the way for the deve-
lopment of some system worthy of England, by showing what are the available
resources of the countrj'' for such a purpose, and what has been found by experience

to be the respective merits of the various methods in use.
   Under these circumstances, it was -wath no small surprise that an announcement

was received to the effect that Government is about to establish an official engi-

neering college.

     On Newly discovered Species of Elephants *. By Dr. Leith Adams.

Notes of a recent Visit to the Great Tunnel through the Alps, and of several
   points of Geological interest suggested hy the condition of the Worhs in their

  present nearly complete state. By D. T. Ansxed, M.A., F.B.S., For. Sec.

     G.S.

   The author, referring to memoirs recently published by Professors Sismonda and
M. Elie de Beaumont on the rocks met with during the construction of the tunnel,
directed attention to the fact that the timnel ^viU perforate the crest of the main
chain of the Alps at a point nearly midway between Mont Tabor and the Mont
Cenis, and directly under Mont Frejus, the height of the crest between these limits
varying from 7000 to 10,400 feet above the sea. The valleys on the two sides of

the crest being of very different levels, the determination of the site for the tunnel

involved many difficulties, but was suggested by an Italian in 1841. The works
were commenced in 1857, and on the 31st of July there remained less than 2000 feet

out of 40,000 to pierce.

   The rocks of the crest of the Savoy Alps are metamorphic schists alternating

with bands of quartzite, gj'psum, and highly calcareous schist with masses of anthra-
cite. They are the middle and lower divisions of the mesozoic period, ranging
perhaps from the Jurassic to the Triassic periods. Near Moutiers they contain

characteristic fossils, chiefly liassic species.

   The level of the valley of the Arc at Modena, near which town the tunnel works
commence, is more than 200 feet below the point on the hillside where the tunnel
enters. This latter point is 3946^ feet above the sea. On the ItaUan side the

tunnel emerges near Bardonneche 438H feet above the sea, or 4.35 feet higher.

The bearing of the tunnel is N. 14° \V.-S. 14° E. The strike of the rocks per-
forated is nearly uniform, and is N.E.-S.W., the rocks having a mean dip of about
60° N.W. Being thus cut obliquely, the real thickness of rock is about three-fifths
the distance bored. The total length of the tunnel being about 40,000 feet, the
thickness of rock traversed is about 24,000 feet. There is no indication of fault in
any part.

         A* communication ordered to be printed in extenso among the Eeporta.
70 REPORT 1870.

   Specimens of the rocks traversed are preserved. On the French side the work

began by 420 feet of tunnelling through disintegrated and decomposed rock, repre-
senting an actual thickness of about 200 feet of weathered material. After this
there was 6000 feet of tunnelling (3600 feet of rock) through talcose and steatitic
schists, with carbonate of lime and magnesia, containing hyaline quartz and crystals

of calcite and dolomite. Among the rocks was a conglomerate, and at the bottom

coarse micaceous gi-itstone. Beyond these was 800 feet (actual thickness) of very
hard quartzite, and then 1800 feet of gypsum, crystalline limestone, and talcose
schist. All these belong to the upper and middle divisions of the anthracitiferous
rocks of the Alps, ranging from the Oxford clay to the lower oolites, both inclusive.
All the rest of the tunnel is through a vast series of schistose limestone and cal-

careous schists, often steatitic, at least 18,000 feet in actual thickness, representing

the Lias, the Rhjetic rocks, and perhaps some Triassic rocks. Throughout these
are many instances of slickensides, and a few crystals of iron-pyrites and galena.

   The author pointed out that the effect of pressure on these rocks was inappre-
ciable, except that they exhibited numerous small folds. There are very few
crevices and fissures ; these were almost all partly filled with crystals.

    Observations on temperature were made, but not very systematically, at dis-
tances of about 500 metres, by bore-holes put in laterally to a distance of about

three metres. At 6200 metres (20,.342 feet), at a depth of more than 5000 feet,
the thermometer showed 27° 0. This would show a rate of increment of one
degree Fahrenheit in upwards of 100 feet. This is confirmed by other observations
on the temperatm-e of the rock, and also of the water met with in the various

fissures.

   The quantity of water yielded during the tunnelling has been exceptionally small.
Except on two or three occasions, where ^small water-containing fissures were
tapped and water came off under pressure for a few hours, the general quantity has
hardly varied, and does not exceed 4 litres per second (say, 100,000 gallons per
day). The water contained oxide of iron and sulphates of lime and magnesia.

On the Matnx of tJie Gold in the Scottish Oold-JleJds.
        By James Bktce, M.A., LL.D., F.G.S.

  Up to July of last year, the source of the gold of the alluvial workings in
Sutherland had not been determined. Many of the miners had been at other

diggings, where the gold occurred in quartz reefs, and accordingly their search was

constantly directed to the discovery of such reefs, but without success. Sir R. I.

Murchison, Rev. J. M. Joass, Mr. John F. Campbell, and Mr. Cameron, in their

several papers, had all ofiered surmises on this point ; but no definite infonnation

had been made public. The author had directed his attention to the elucidation

of this point; he had not succeeded in detecting any quartz reef, but he had
foimd the gold in its native seat in another rock. The banks of the Suisgill burn

consisted of alternating coarse whitish granite and a highly crystalline mica-slate.

On crushing the granite and washing the sand, grains of gold were found in every
Aspecimen.
            similar result was obtained by crushing and washing specimens of

the mica-slate, but the gold was less abundant, and was absent from several spe-

cimens.

  A structure very similar existed in the Kildonan bum, whose alluvia also yielded

gold ; but the granite here was not tested by him. He would not be understood

to affirm that gi'anite was the only seat of the gold ; on the contrary, he thought it

highly probable that it was diflused through all the metamorphic rocks of the

district, as Sir R. I. Murchison had supposed. He did not think it necessary to call

in the aid of old ice-action, as Mr. J. F. Campbell had done ; the existing drainage
might be credited with the whole of the gold. The specimens of granite were

selected by himself, and washed for him by one of the men engaged in the diggings.

   Early in the last winter gold-grains were found in considerable quantity in the

alluvia of the Emck and Nairn rivers towards their mouths, and were soon after

detected at various points far up the channels of these streams. The author had
examined the upper valleys of the Errick and Nairn, and found them to consist

of a great body of granite invading metamorphic slates. He was accompanied

by Mr. W. M. M'Gillivray, of Inverness, who had had much experience in gold-

washing ; and on handing over to him for examination certain specimens of gi-anite
very similar to that of the Suisgill burn, Mr. M'Gillivray found in them several
grains of gold. Fm-ther inquiry was needed, in order to ascertain whether the gold

existed here in remunerative quantity.

                On the History and Affinities of the British Coniferce.
                      By William Cakeuthers, F.L.S., F.G.S.

   Having pointed out the great divisions of this natural order, the author traced
the appearance and development of its munbers in the stratified rocks. The Arau-
careice, of which there were fifteen living species, natives of the southern hemi-
sphere, made their appearance in the coal-measiu-es, eight species having been
determined from the structiu-e of the wood. In the secoudar}^ rocks cones be-
longing to six species had been detected, all of them having close affinities with
the section Entacta of Araucaria. The Pinece, a large group living in the northern
hemisphere, first appeared in Devonian strata, were contained in the coal, and
greatly increased in number in the secondary rocks. The Tiwodiece, having fifteen
species, living chiefly near the shores of the North Pacific, appeared in the Stones-
field slate, and were continued by species of Sequoia through the Cretaceous and
Eocene periods. The Cupressece are known only from tertiary strata by fruits and
foliage. The Taxinece, containing nearly 100 living species, have been determined
in the Carboniferous rocks from a fruit ; several fruits occm* also in the Sheppy
beds of Eocene age.

                  On the Sporangia of Ferns from the Coal-measures.

                     By William Caeruthers, F.L.S., F.G.S.

   The author had detected in calcareous nodules from the beds of coal at Bradford
several sporangia of Ferns belonging to the same species, and all characterized by
the presence of the elastic ring which is found in the Foli/podiacece. The ring is
oblique and continuous round the sporangium, and these peculiarities, together
with the shortness of the pedicel, induced the author to refer them to a Ilymeno-
phyUaceous genus. Some of the sporangia were filled with the roundish spores.

RemarTcs on the Fossils from the Eailway Section at Huyton.

           By William Caeruthees, F.L.S., F.G.S.

The great value of this collection, made by the Rev. H. Higgins, depended as

much upon the comparatively limited number of species met with as on the fine

state of preservation in which they occm-red. It was possible to arrive at consi-

derable (in some cases absolute) certainty as to the different parts of the same

species. Of the four species of Calamites, the materials existed in the specimens

from Huyton for reconstructing the entire plant of at least one. The roots, long

considered to be a distinct plant under the name Plnmdaria, were present in great

abundance. The species had a delicate fistular stem of the type described by Pro-

fessor Williamson at a previous meeting of the Section, but of great size. The

scars of the fallen branches were shown in several specimens as well as the

foliage, which was preserved in the early bud condition, as well as in its fully

developed state. Several fruits were found showing the structure of the cone,

described by the author under the name of Volkma/mta Bimieyi, but with differ-

Aences that were at least of specific value.  cone having the structure of that

described by Professor Williamson probably belonged to Calamites lonyifolitis, with

the foliage of which it was associated in these beds. Specimens of Sjjhenophyllum

were exhibited and referred to Calamites. The light thrown on the structure of

Lepidodendron by the specimens was then dwelt on, and especially two undescribed

--cones one long and slender, with a single sporangium on each scale, the other

short, and having two sporangia on each scale. The stem and foliage of Flabel-

laria (a palm-like Lycopodiaceous genus) occurred among the fossils, as well aa

several species of beautifully preserved ferns. Two specimens of insect remains

 ment at Rugby.

     Mr. Peach had discovered near Falkirk a fine series of AnthoUthes, which he
 had submitted to the author. Several of them exhibited the fruits still attached,
 and thus established the true nature of these fossils, which had been hitherto con-
 sidered so anomalous. The fruits had been described by authors as species of

    On the Formation of Boulder-clays and Alternations of Levd of Land and

                     Water. By the Eev. J. Gunn, M.A., F.G.S.

    The author observed that the boulder-clays have been regarded as indications
 of a glacial epoch, whereas at the time of their deposit the land must have subsided
 at least 500 feet beneath the present sea-level, and the greater extent of sea would
 tend to raise the temperature, except so far as it would be lowered by the influx of
icebergs. That, in consequence of such depression, the perpetual snow-line would
be altered to the same amount, and an enormous quantity of ice would be gradually
disengaged and set floating from Greenland, for instance, by marine currents in a
southerly direction ; icebergs would be the result, boulders would be dropped, and
the boulder-clay formed without the intervention of any glacial epoch. That
by the contrary process of the elevation of the land glaciers and other descriptions
of ice would be formed, and what is called a glacial epoch would ensue.

    The effect of such alternate oscillations of level might be shown to be, in the
southern hemisphere, to cover the plains and leave the mountains in the form of
islands standing out above the sea^ as exemplified in the Pacific ; and in the
northern to produce the contrary result, as now exemplified in thia country. The
author supported these changes on palseontographical evidence ; and while attri-
buting them to oscillations of the level of land and water, expressed his inability
to ascertain the causes of such oscillations, and left the solution of their origin to
mathematicians and astronomers.

  On the Glacial and Postglacial Deposits in the Neighbourhood of Llandudno.
                               ^By Hugh F, Hall, F.G.S.

  --In the paper the author described a general section of the beds exposed at the

following places : Gogarth, west side of the Little Orme, east side of the Little
Orme, Dyganwy, Rhos, Colwyn, and Llandulas.

   The base bed taken was the mountain limestone. Above this there is exposed
at the Little Orme a bed .3 to 5 feet thick of mountain-limestone rubble, produced
probably by the action of frost during the earlier part of the glacial period breaking
the exposed rock into fragments. This again is covered by a bed, which in its
greatest development (at Llandulas) is 150 feet thick, of Boulder-clay, which he
regarded as the result of the grinding down of the subjacent strata by land-ice,

--which probably at this period came down to the waters' edge in fact, the true

glacial period. He showed that this bed is invariably composed of the materials
which would result from the grinding down of the rocks in the immediate neigh-

bourhood, being at Rhos a very stiff bluish-grey clay, very full of small pebbles,
principally slate, all ice-scratched, with large blocks of mountain limestone, green-
stone, and volcanic grits, showing ice-grooves and smoothing. At Gogarth, again,
it varies in colour from dark brown to grey, very gritty and sandy, full of scratched
pebbles, and many chert fragments. At Dyganwy it is a low cliff of black clay,
--

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                78

evidently derived from the grinding down of the slate. This is the hest section
for the observation of ice-markings. In a hollow in this clay at the Orme there

is a deposit of 20 feet of stratitied grey clay, evidently a denudation bed from the

boulder-clay, showing, where opened by weathering, distinct ripple- and rain-marks.

A contemporaneous bed, the evidence of a shore condition during the depression

of the boulder-clay, of 20 feet of irregular and false-bedded sands and gravels

lies also above the boulder-clay. At the Little Orme this bed is hardened by car-

bonate of lime into a conglomerate, to be seen in the cliff and in enormous fallen

masses on the shore.
   The subsidence of the land still continuing the shore condition ceases, and a

continuous bed, common everywhere, of red clatj, some 20 feet thick, overlies the
lower sands and gi-avels. Then an elevation seems to have taken place, and

another series of sands and gi-avels, upwards of 50 feet in thickness, shows another
shore condition, best seen in the ballast-pit at Colwyn. Lastly, the thin bed of

blue-black clay, without pebbles, is exposed in the Dyganwy section, the result of

a second denudation of the boulder-clay, after both the sands and gravels and the
red clay had been carried away. This being the sequence of the beds, the author

called attention to the following points :

  F1st. That colour is no criterion for deciding as to the glacial bed, which at

Gogarth is dark brown and grey ; at Dyganwy, almost black ; Little Oime, dark

grey ; Rhos, a lighter grey ; Colwyn shore, blue ; and Llandulas, red-brown : in

fact the colour depends upon the materials of which the rocks in the vicinity are

composed.
   2nd. That the materials of which this clay is composed are always those found

in the immediate neighbourhood, and even the large boulders can generally be
traced to no great distance. Thus the Gogarth clay is evidently the result of the

grinding down of the mica-schists and limestones of Anglesey, and probably of the
millstone-grit, which is now entirely denuded from the district. The claj^ east and
west of the Little Orme and at Rhos shows the result of the passage of the ice

over the mountain limestone and Silmian beds, the latter supplying the adhesive

material which makes this clay so much stiffer. At Dyganwy the black clay is

from the underlying slates, and at Llandulas the reddish-brown is due to the

wearing of the Old Red Sandstone, which is still found inland, and many boulders

of which are seen on the shore.
   3rd. The author conceived this clay to be the result of the pressure and passage

of land-ice, disintegi-ating the whole surface of the country which it capped ; and
he would confine the term boulder-clay to this one bed, believing it to be the only

true glacial clay.

   4th. This bed is invariably denuded, rising in bosses all along the shore, and
having the superposed beds lying unconformably upon it.

   6th. The red clay (D), which is invariable in colour and constituents, showed

an undoubted change of conditions in the land dm-ing the period of its deposition,
being, as he conceived, the result of extensive denudation in more northern regions,
spread over the sea-bottom by currents, the scratched pebbles and boulders being due

to melting or stranded icebergs.

   The author argued that with such different constituents for these beds it is time
to adopt some more definite names than the general one of boulder-clay, which is

commonly applied to the series. He referred to the sections on the eastern coast

as confirmatory of his views, as illustrated by his personal observations in Holder-

ness, where as clearly distinct a series of beds occurs.

                On the Green Slates and Porphyries of the Lake-district.
        By Prof. Haekness, F.B.S., and BE. A. Nicholson, D.Sc, F.G.S.

     The authors described the sequence of the rocks which in the Lake-country are
 known as green slates and porphjTies, as being made up of traps at the base, of a
  middle series consisting of ashes, traps, amygdaloids, and trappean breccias, and

  of an upper series consisting of horustone porphyry.

     The former is very persistent over the Lake-district, while the latter is by no
 means so uniform in its occurrence. The middle series varies much in mineral
 character according to locality. The neighbourhood of Keswick and in Borrowdale
 exhibits this series in its most typical form. West and north-west from Keswick
  the ash-beds are less abundant, their place being occupied by a porphyry with
 large crystals of felspar ; and in the northern slopes of the CulcleckfeUs this por-
 phyry' is the sole representative of the middle portion of the group. At Carrickfell
 this porphyry is in contact with syenite ; and here its character has become greatly
 modified, it appearing as a diorite: and at Roughtengill it has also undergone
 changes from the influence of granite veins ; for here it occurs as a hypersthene

  rock.

     The green slates and porphyries of the Lake-country represent the Upper
 Llandeilo and a portion of the Caradoc rocks ; and their average thickness does
 not seem to be more than 5000 feet.

               On Some Thermal Spritigs in the Fens of Cambridgeshire.
                                 By F. W. Harmer, F.G.S.

     In several farm-yard wells near Chatteris in Cambridgeshire, of the depth of
 from 10 to 14 feet, the author had found on the 14th of jNIarch, 1870, water of the
 temperature of from 66|° to 742° Fahr., that of the air being then but 37° in the
 shade, and the water in Vermuden's drain (one of the main arteries of the fen-
 drainage, which is within 100 yards of one of the wells) having at the same time
 but 39 of heat, and being covered with thin ice.

    At a subsequent visit to one of the localities on June 2nd, the temperature of

 the air being in the shade 70°, and of the water in the neighbouring (kains 711°
 the well showed 791° of heat.

    An analysis of the water had been made by Mr. Francis Sutton, F.C.S., of

 Norwich, but he had been unable to discover any reason for supposing that the heat
 was generated locally by chemical causes.

    The fen-district being below the sea-level, the ground is permanently saturated
 with water at a short distance from the surface, and as this water at the slight depth
 of 10 feet seems constantly to maintain, summer and winter, such an abnormal

 temperature, its agricultural eifects cannot be inconsiderable.

    The author hoped that an endeavour would be made by local geologists to ascer-
 tain whether these thermal springs extended beyond the area of about 10 to 15
 square miles in which he had observed them, and also to detennine in what way
 and by how much the agricidture of the district was affected by them.

     Mr. Judd, F.G.S., of the Ordnance Survey, had informed the author that the
 secondary strata which underlie the alluvial deposits of the feus are in the adjoin-
 ing counties considerably faulted and dislocated ; but whether in this way the

 water described may be in commimication with the central heat of the earth, or

 whether the matter is to be explained by chemical causes, he does not at present

· offer a decided opinion.

 On the Extension of the Coal-fields beneath the yieiuer Formations of England,

    .and the successive Stratir/raphical Changes to which the Carboniferous Rochs

    have been subjected. By Prof. Edward Hull, M.A., F.R.S., F.G.S.

    The author commenced by referring to the paper which Sir R. I. Murchison had
 laid before the British Association at Nottingham, " On the Parts of England and
 Wales in which Coal may, or may not, be looked for," and expressed his gi-atifi-
 cation that his own views, arrived at by a somewhat different process of reasoning,
 coincided in the main with those of his respected chief. Especially was this the

case as regarded the absence of coal in the eastern and portions of the midland

counties, now overspread by Mesozoic formations. The author proceeded to show
that there was evidence that the coal-measures were originally deposited in two

continuous sheets, one to the north and the other to the south of a ridge of old
land, formed of SUurisn rocks, which stretched eastward from Shropshire, and
ranged along the south of the Dudley coal-field. This dividing ridge, or bai-rier,
had probably never been altogether submerged beneath the waters in which the
coal-measures were deposited. Referring to the tract of coal-measures which lay
to the noi-th of the central barrier, it was shown that towards the north the boun-
daries of the coal-formation were formed by the Cambro-Silurian rocks of North
Wales, the Lake-district, and portions of the " southern uplands " of Scotland.
The southern limits were formed by the ban-ier of old land, and over this inter-
vening area the coal-measures were spread in one continuous sheet, and attained
their greatest vertical dimensions towards the north-west. To the south of the
barrier, the strata were deposited in the greatest thickness towards the west or

south-west.

   At the close of the coal-period, disturbances of strata (resulting probably from

lateral pressure acting from the north and south) took place over the whole Car-
boniferous area of the north of England, whereby the strata were thrown into a
series of folds, the axes of which ranged along approximately east and west lines.
These disturbances were accompanied and followed by enormous denudations, by
which the coal-measures were swept away over large tracts of the north of
England, and the northern limits of the Lancashii'e and Yorkshire coal-fields were

approximately determined.
   Referring to the tract south of the central barrier. Professor Hull expressed his

opinion that the east and west flexures, beiag parallel to those of the north of
England, were referable to the same geological period, namely, post-Carboniferoua

(or pre-Permian). At this period the northern and southern limits of the South
Wales coal-field, the axis of the Mendip IliUs, and the easterly trend of the culm-
measures of Devonshke were determined. Denudation of strata on an enormous
scale accompanied these movements. After the deposition of the Permian beds

over the inclined and denuded edges of the Carboniferous rocks, disturbances

accompanied by extensive denudation took place along lines nearly at right angles
to those of the preceding period ; that is, along north and south lines approxi-
mately. To this epoch, the axis of the Pennine chain and all north and south

trendings of the strata were to be referred. Some of the results brought about by
these movements were the disseverance of the Lancashire and Cheshire from the

Yorkshire and Derbyshire coal-fields, the determination of the western limits of
the Flintshire and Derbyshire coal-fields, the disseverance of the Forest of Dean
coal-field from that of South Wales, and the uptUting of the Lower Carboniferous
rocks along the eastern margin of the Somersetshire coal-field, beneath the Jurassic

formations. From these considerations it seemed clear to the author that the

basin-shaped form of nearly all the coal-fields (the basins being sometimes partially
concealed by the Mesozoic rocks) was due to the denudations acting over areas of
elevation intersecting each other nearly at right angles, and corresponding to two

--distinct epochs the pre-Permian and pre-Triassic. Professor Hull then proceeded

distributed according to a weU-defined plan of south-easterly attenuation, or thinning

away towards the south-east ; and he concluded by discussing the views of Sir R.

or absence of coal imder the Cretaceous or Tertiary strata of the south of England.

              On the Bed and Coralline Crags. By Chaeles Jecks.

   The author suggested the following reasons, as rendering it probable that the
Red and Coralline are quite as nearly connected with each other as the Red and
Norwich Crags. If the palseontological difference between the Red and Norwich

Crags be about 20 per cent., and yet be considered synonymous, how is it that the

Coralline Crag, which only contains 10 per cent, fewer recent species than the Red,
76 REPORT--1870.

should be held as distinct from it ? When we find that 103 shells are common to

the Red and Coralline Crags which are not found in the Norwich Crag, whilst
only two are common to the Red and Norwich Crags, and are not found in the

Coralline, surely such a fact directly implies not only a connexion, hut one almost

as close between the Coralline and Red as the Red and Norwich Crags. There

seems, indeed, every reason to believe that the transition from the Coralline to

the Red Crag was gradual ; if there were now to be an elevation of sea-bottom,
including what we call the Coralline and Laminarian zones, the former would

naturally become Laminarian, while the latter would become a Littoral zone, and

this in all probability without any really sudden change in species, but by a slow pro-

cess  of  elevation                                      nay,  is  there  any sudden change  now observable  in the  species

inhabiting these zones ? do they not gradually commingle ? and if this be so as

regards the Coralline and Laminarian zones of the present time, is it not quite aa

likely to have been so with regard to the Coralline and Red Crags ?

   Sir C. Lyell, in his sixth edition of the ' Elements,' seems distinctly to favour

--the idea of the unity of the Crag, in the following extract : " The shells of the

Crag exhibit clear evidence of a gradual refrigeration of climate, which went on in

the area of England from the time of the older to that of the most modern Pliocene

strata."

   "With regard to the objection, that the denudation of the Coralline, as e\-inced

by the unconformability of deposition of certain parts of the Red Crag, shows a

certain break, as it were, in the continuity of the deposit, would it not be obviated,
in some measui-e at least, by the fact of there having been many changes in the

conditions of life in the Coralline Crag species owing perhaps to the intrusion of

other species and consequent distm-bance in their mutual relations, so that in

course of time they would die out, together with a gradual, long continued, but

decided change in climatal conditions i^ Upon the whole, then, it seems probable

that the period from the commencement to the end of the Pliocene is one of

gradual transition, of which the Coralline, Red, and Norwich Crags represent so

many stages, not distinct and separate, but more or less connected together by

various changes in the relations of one organism to another, caused by variation

of species under natural selection, and also by changes in climatal conditions and

nature of sea-bottom.

             JRemarJcs on Newer Tertiary Fossils in Sicily and Calabria.

                             By J. GwYN Jeffreys, F.B.S.

   During the last deep-sea exploring expedition in H.M.S. ' Porcupine,' in the Bay

of Biscay and along the Atlantic coasts of Spain and Portugal, Mr. Jeflreys pro-

cured at considerable depths, and especially from 994 fathoms, many species of
Mollusca in a living or recent state, some of which had been previously regarded
as fossil only, and extinct, and all of them belonging to the newer tertiaries of

Sicily and Calabria ; and he believed that a record of the fact might lead to the
discovery of the geological phenomena which had caused the fossilization of such
species in that limited area. Several of these species inhabit northern and even
arctic seas ; and among them are Terehratula cranium, T. septata, Pecten aratus,

P. vitreus, Lima excavata, Mytilus vitreus, Leda friyida, Litnopsis aurita, L.horealis,

Dentalium abyssoruin, Puncturella noachina, Hela tenella, and Pleu)'ototna carinata.

Other species now found in a living or recent state are Terehratula sphenoidea,
TelUna compressa, Verticordia acutecostata, V. yramdata (the last two being Japan-
ese), two species of Fksurisepta, Ti-ochus sutiiralis, Turho Jilosus, Omphalus mono-

cinyulatus, Scalaria pumila, Cyclostoma delicatum of Philippi (Rechcsia ?) , and
Pleurotoma hispidtda. One of the species in the second list or category (Fissun-
septa papulosa) had been also dredged by Mr. Jeffreys last autumn at Drobak, in

Norway ; and he was of opinion that our knowledge of the arctic marine inver-
tebrate fauna was very imperfect. The newer Tertiary fossils of Sicily and
Calabria had been to a great extent investigated by Dr. Philippi formerly of Cassel,
Prof Seguenza of Messina, the Abb^ Brugnone of Palermo, and Dr. Tiberi of
Resina near Naples ; and their collections had been examined by Mr. Jeffreys.

Two suggestions or questions were submitted by the author of the present paper,

                                On the Ar/e of the Wealden.

By John W. Jxtdd, F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of England and Wales.

Unconformities between formations indicate, as Mr. Darwin, Prof. Ramsay, and

other geologists have argued, the lapse of enormous periods of time. Between the

Oolitic system, terminating with the Portlandian, and the true Cretaceous, com-

mencing with the Gault, there is not only an immense physical break, but a total
change in species. The researches of continental geologists have shown that, inter-

calated between these two systems, there exists two others, each in every way

worthy to rank with them, the Tithonian and the Neocomian                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             these do not, how-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

ever, entirely bridge over the_ interval, for the Cretaceous is almost everywhere

unconformable to the Neocomian.

   The English Wealden consists of a mass of freshwater strata, probably not less
than 2000 feet thick. Forming its lower and upper members, however, are certain

fluviomarine strata, which form passages into the marine beds below and above
the Wealden. The lowest of these fluviomarine or passage series is the well-
known Purbeck formation, the marine beds of which contain Oolitic fossils. In
the Isle of Purbeck, the Isle of Wight, and elsewhere is found another series of
strata, less known, but not less important, which indicates the gradual passage up-
ward of the Wealden into the Upper Neocomian (Lower Greensand).

   Of especial interest, from the large fauna which it yields, is the marine band of
Punfield, to which the attention of geologists was first directed by Mr. Godwin-

Austen in the year 1850. This bed is only 21 inches thick, and is situated 140

feet below the top  of  the  Wealden                                        the author  has found that it contains                                                                                                                                                                                    a  series
                                                                         ;

of fossils (including many species and one genus quite new to this country) iden-

tical with those of the coal-bearing strata of Middle Neocomian age in Eastern
Spain, which are more than 1600 feet thick.

The Wealden presents every appearance of being a single continuoiis formation.

In its lower portion it contains marine beds with oolitic fossils, and gi-aduates into

the Portlandian ; in its upper part it contains other marine beds with Middle Neo-
Wecomian fossils, and graduates into the Upper Neocomian.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      are thus led to the

conclusion that the great epoch of the Wealden commenced towards the close of

the Oolitic period, that it continued through the whole of the Tithonian and the

Lower and Middle Neocomian, and only came to an end at the beginning of the

Upper Neocomian.

In confirmation of these views as to the age of the Wealden, there exists much

palseontological evidence. Still further support is afforded to them by the manner
an which Wealden and Neocomian beds are found alternating with one another in
France, especially in the Pays de Bray and in the district of Champagne.

   Professor Huxley has indicated the necessity of establishing a distinct classifi-

cation for freshwater and ten-estrial fonnations, the breaks between which do not
correspond with those of the marine series. Of this necessity the Wealden, repre-
senting, like the " Poikilitic," several very distinct marine formations, is a very

striking illustration.

   The author has before sho-\vn that the deposition of the Wealden strata of
Northern Germany commenced at the close of the Oolitic period, and had termi-

nated before the end of the Lower Neocomian. He concludes therefore that the

English and German Wealdens are not strictly contemporaneous, and that, the

areas being quite disconnected, they are probably the products of two different

rivers.

         On some Points in the Geoloc/y of Strath, Isle of SJci/e,
                    By Professors King mid Eownet.

The authors entered into a minute description of a section of the east shore of

Loch Slappin. The rocks consist of syenite, overlaid hy serpentinous marble or

ophite, and a number of imaltered stratified deposits following in consecutive order.

An unbroken passage was traced from the marble to the highest beds ; the latter

are more or less charged with Liassic fossils. The following conclusions were

--come to by the authors : (1) That the ophite of Strath is an altered rock of the

possesses the same microscopic features as those, supposed by some to be of organic

origin, which occur in a corresponding rock of earlier geological ages, known in

Canada,  Connemarra,  and  elsewhere                                   (3)  that igneous action, developing                                                                                                                                                               a gra-

nitic rock, and producing decided metamorphism in an adjacent deposit, has

operated at a later geological period in Skye than in any other part of the British

islands. Referring to their published memoirs in the ' Quart. Joum. Geol. Soc'

vol. xxiL 1866, and the ' Proc. Roy. Irish Acad.' vol. x. 1870, in which certain of

the above microscopic features in the Skye ophite were fii-st made known, the

authors in the present paper announced their discovery of some others, which

completely identify this comparatively modern rock with the " eozoonal " marble

of Canada, belonging to the Laurentian system ; and they maintained that the

repeated occurrence, so often pointed out by them, of " chamber casts " (grains of

serpentine, &c.), "canal system" (metaxite, &c.), and "nummuline layer" (chry-

sotile), in metamorphic or crystalline rocks only, proves in the simplest manner the
purely mineral origin of the so-called " Eozoon Canadense." Sections and numerous

specimens, including a large block of the Skye " eozoonal " marble, were exhibited.

   The coal-formation of Chile occupies a marginal position along the western
coast of South America, extending from Talcahuano near Concession on the north,
to the Straits of Magellan on the south. It rests unconformably upon mica-schists
and other metamoi-phic rocks, which form the main geological featui-e of the coimtry.

The accompanying rocks are alternating sandstones (grey, white, and yellow), shales

   The fossils of these beds belong, some of them, to what in Eui'ope would be un-

Mr. G. A. Lebour believes with Darwin that they indicate more probably a very

early Tertiary age.

beds in question cannot be written in short without the aid of figures.

   The Belgian formations regarded as Silurian and Cambrian are found in the
Ardennes in Brabant, parallel to the Meuse and Sambre, and near Dour in Hainault,

   The Silurian or Cambrian of the Ardennes rests imconformably on the Deyonian,
The ill-preserved fossils that have been foimd do not sufficiently determine the a^e,
consisting only at present of Dicti/onema and part of a Tiilobite belonging to the
genus Paradoxides, which would place it in the Cambrian. The true Belgian
Silurians] belong to part of the Rhenan series of Dimiont, in which Silm-ian fossils
were found in 1860 by M. Gosselet.

   The Brabant Silurian deposits extend over an area about 70 miles long, the
greatest width being 16 miles. That of the Sambre and the Meuse is a strip about
40 miles long, and less than two miles wide.

   The Brabant series is divided into four groups, the upper alone of which has
yielded fossils, and this alone is represented in the Sambre and Meuse district. The

following are the groups in descending order :

          1. Gembloux series (quartziferous schists).

          2. Oisquezcq series (variegated and graphitic schists).
           3. Tubise series (quartzites).
          4. Blaumont (lower quartzites).

   From the upper series 52 species have been obtained, several of which appear new

gian SUurians with those of other countries, the author agrees with M. Barrande
that his second stage, represented in the Bohemian district by quartzite, and also
represented in almost all Silurian districts, occurs in its ordinary state in Belgium.
In England it includes the Llandeilo and overlying Caradoc gioups, and in Ireland
the recognized equivalents, while in France, Spain, Portugal, Thuringia, Sweden,
Norway, Russia, and North America it is known by vaiious names. It is re-
presented in Belgium by the genera Illcenus, Triniicletts, Ampyx, and others.

   Species have also been found referred to Dalmanites, Cheiruriis, Lichas, Caly-
tnenes, Acidaspis, Homahnotus, but to groups peculiar to the second stage. The

great development of Orthis common in England, Russia, and the United States
is also remarkable in Belgium, Cystidea have also been met with.

On the Formation of Siuallow-Tioles or Pits ivith Vertical Sides in Mountain

                          Limestone*. By L. C. Miall.

The paper described two kinds of these cavities, one designated " cavities of ero-

Asion," and the other "cavities of subsidence."  detailed account was given of a

singular excavation at the head of Swaledale, typical of the first species. Its pecu-

liarities were defined as consisting of vertical, fluted sides, and isolated pillars in
the centre of the pits. Falling water, aided by pebbles, was looked upon as the

source of excavation, and a thick surface-covering of drift, retentive of moisture,
was regarded as an essential feature, the spongy mass discharging the rainfall at
certain regular points. Those swallow-holes were next considered whose existence

is due to subsidence of an undermined crust ; and many examples were cited and
discussed, principally from the moimtain-limestone district of Craven. The eflfects

of such subsidences upon superficial deposits (as of glacial drift) were adverted to

in conclusion.

recent change, probably of depression.

ouo-ht to produce an outflow through the straits. As the width of the straits bears so

small a proportion to the area of the sea, the cun-ent setting in might be due to a

general sinking of the bed now going on, and too slight to be perceptible on the

margin of the area subject to the depression.

isting water-line ; and to the north of Gibraltar another similar bed existed, imply-
ing an ancient littoral zone 24 feet higher than the neighbouring shore. The
Corsican marshes give evidence of a similar rise, the level flats being here and there

   The writer showed that the soil has an influence on the composition of the
cereal plants grown upon it, and on the diseases to which the inhabitants are
subject. The district in which he practises consists geologically of the Car-

boniferous and New Red Sandstone or Cheshire Sandstone system.s. The in-

habitants of the first are engaged in mining and agricultural occupations, those of
the latter in agriculture. Ansemia, with goitre, is a very prevalent disease
amongst those living on the Carboniferous system, whilst it is almost un-

known among those living on the New Red Sandstone system ; and consumption

is also more prevalent amongst the inhabitants of the former. As ansemia is a
condition in which there is a deficiency of the oxide of iron which the blood na-
turally contains, the author was led to make an examination of the relative com-
position of the wheat grown on the soil of Cheshire sandstone. Carboniferous

limestone, Millstone-gi-it, and a transition-soil between Cheshire sandstone and the
gi'it. The result of the analysis shows that the wheat grown on the soil of the
Cheshire sandstone contains the largest quantity of ash, and that there is a larger
quantity of phosphoric acid in it than in the soils of the Carboniferous and MiU-

stone-gxit systems also a much larger quantity of oxide of iron than in either

of them. He has calculated that each inhabitant on the Cheshire sandstone, if he

consumes a pound of wheat daily, takes in nearly 5 grains per day of the sesqui-

oxide of iron more than the inhabitant of the Carboniferous system, and who

seems, therefore, to be subject to this great liability to anaemia in consequence of
the deficiency of iron and phosphoric acid in the food he consumes. It is not only

in the wheat grown upon the Carboniferous system that there is a deficiency in

blood of the animals reared upon it ; so that the inhabitants upon that system take

in a minimum quantity of these constituents of the blood, compared with that taken
in by the inhabitants of the Cheshire sandstone. He stated that sheep were liable

to an£emia---a fact which he attributed to sheep-walks being npon trap and lime-
stone hills; in the soil of which there is but little, if any, iron.

  On the Glaciated Condition of the Surface of the Triassic Sandstone around
                          Liverjpool. By G. H. Moeton, F.O.S.

     The most recent progress in local geology has resulted from the examination of
  the superficial or di-ift deposits which cover the country, and the discoveiy of the

  glaciated condition of the surface of the sandstone beneath. These superficial ac-
  curuulations have been divided into Postglacial deposits (consisting of drift sand,
 bluish silt or mud, submarine forests) and Glacial deposits (including upper drift

 Band, boulder-clay, and lower drift sand). The latter subdivision is often absent;
 and, imder these conditions, the Boulder-clay usually covers the surface. The

  author explained that this clay is the dark red clay so extensively used in the
 neighbourhood for the purpose of brick-making. It contains numerous pebbles
 and boulders, varying in size from that of a pea to immense blocks 6 feet in dia-

 meter, a large proportion of them being striated and gi-ound flat on one or more
 surfaces by the action of the ice, similar to the specimens of boulders and pebbles
 brought from the glaciers of the Alps. In 1859 he described for the first time to
 the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool the evidences of the action of
 ice on the sandstone in the neighbourhood. Having at that time only found such

 judications in a single locality, he attributed the striated surface to the gi-ound-
 ing of an iceberg in the glacial sea. In 1866, having found several additional ex-
 amples of this giaciation on both sides of the river, but at no great distance from
 it, he began to entertain the opinion that a glacier had descended the valley of the

 Mersey during the early part of the glacial period ; and he made a communica-
 tion to that effect to the Livei-pool Geological Society. Lately, however, he had
 discovered similar evidences of ice-action at greater elevations, several miles from
 the river, and consequently had been compelled to adopt a new theory, namely,

 that a great sheet of ice once travelled over this part of the country from the
south-east to the north-west. The first striated surface discovered was between
 Parkhill road and the Dingle, but had been destroyed by the erection of cottages
 over the place. This surface is 120 feet above the sea, and the strata belong to
the pebble-beds of the Bunter formation. Two-thirds of a mile north the largest

surface occurs in the waste ground on the north-east of North Hill Street. It is
exposed at the present time, exhibiting several hundred square yards of ice-planed

sandstone, closely covered with fine lines and grooves, all perfectly straight and

pai-allel with each other, and running in the direction of 3o° W. of N. The sur-

face of the rock is 160 feet above the sea, and the strata belong to the pebble-beds

of the Bunter formation. Striated rock has also been found at Kirkdale, at Waver-
tree, and Thatto Heath, all places on the Lancashire side of the IMersey ; and at Ox-
ton and Flagbrick Hill on the Cheshire side of the river. The author assumed the

giaciation of the surface of the rock around Liverpool to have occurred before the
submergence of the land at the beginning of the Glacial period, and was after-
wards covered with Boulder-clay, which is partly the result of the waste of the land
and partly the cUhris deposited by icebergs during the period of subsidence. The
only alteration in the contour of' the land seems to have been in the reduced ele-
vation of the low ranges of the hills which traverse the district in the same di-
rection as the ice seems to have done. It might appear a bold assertion to state
that the country around Livei-pool was once covered with a gi-eat ice-sheet, at a

time when the land was some hundreds of feet higher than it is now ; and that it
^terwards subsided beneath the sea, when floating ice brought from the Lake-dis-

trict and Scotland debris which became scattered over the ice-gi-ouud rocks in the
form of Boulder-clay.

        On the Mountain Limestone of Flintsliire and part of Denbighshire.
                                 By G. H. Morton, F.G.S.

    The author pointed out that in Flintshire, within fifteen miles from Livei-pool,
there is a prominent ridge of Carboniferous or Mountain Limestone. It extends
continuously from Prestatyn on the coast of Wales to Llandegla, a few miles north
of Llangollen, the distance being twenty-one mUes, and the strike of the limestone
N. by S.E. and S. Instead of describing the formation generally, he had se-
lected what appeared to be the four most favom'able localities as centres of obser-

--vation Mold, Holywell, Newmarket (Flintshire), and Llangollen. He alluded

to the country around or near these places, for neither Mold nor Holywell are
actually upon the Mountain Limestone. Llangollen was included because of the
grand section presented by the Eglwyseg rocks, about a mile from the town.

--The distance of the localities from each other is as follows : From the Llangollen

limestone district to that of Mold, eleven miles ; from the Mold limestone to that
of Holywell, six miles ; and from the Holywell limestone to Newmarket, nine
miles. The Eglwyseg rocks present a magnificent section of the Mountain Lime-

stone, all the beds being exposed (except those at the base) at the western outcrop,

in a ravine with precipitous cliffs on each side. The highest strata are at the top
of the clilfs, half a mile to the west, at an elevation of 700 feet, the estimated
thiclvness of the limestone being 1200 feet. The Millstone-gi-it of the Geological
Sm-vey succeeds the limestone, and is about 800 feet thick, coal being above it at
Tyfyuuchaf. One mile and a half to the west of the town of Mold there is a fine
section of the Mountain Limestone. The vertical section of the sti'ata at Newr
market is compiled from three horizontal sections, which each show the thickness
of a subdivision. The upper, middle, and lower limestones are on the surface
disconnected by faults, but the relative geological position of each is obvious.
The lower gi'ey and black limestones rest on Silm-ian strata, and are 750 feet thick
at Moel Iliraddug. The middle or white limestone, 360 feet thick, is very different
from any of the Hiraddug strata, as it is also from the upper black and grey limer
stones and shales, 300 feet thick, which crop out from imder the overlying shales
and sandstones of the Millstone-giit. In each of the four localities the Mountain
Limestone admits of division into an upper, a middle, and a lower subdivision,
each having distinct lithological and palaBontological characters.

   Appended to the paper was a list of 120 fossils found in the district de-

scribed. An analysis of the list showed some interesting results. Excluding

a few fish-teeth and scales and plants, all of which occur in the upper lime-
stone, it appeared that the lower limestone does not contain any species pecu-
liar to it, for some of them extend upwards into the white or middle limestone,
whilst others pass up to the highest subdivisions. The earliest species, prin-
cipally found at the base of Moel Hiraddug, are Spirifcra lineata and Syringo-
pora reticulata, and they continue upwards through the whole of the Mountain
Limestone. These two species, with a Lcjndodenclron and another plant, seem to
have been the first colonists that settled do^^m in the Carboniferous sea of North
'Whales. The middle or white limestone presents 28 species which are peculiar to

it (of course common species elsewhere) ; but of these, no less than 23 have only

been found in the limestone ridge at Axton, Newmarket. This assemblage of
species in such a limited area is extraordinary. In the upper limestone 23 species
have been found to be peculiar to it ; but they are all of rare occiu'rence, only single

specimens having been found of about half of them. The common fossils have a

considerable range, while those peculiar to certain subdivisions are mostly rare forms.

              On some Future and Past Changes of the Eavth^s Climate,

                            By E. A. Peacock, C.E., Jersey.

    These important changes, he believes, are due (1) to rain and rivers, (2) de-
midations, (3) risings and sinkings of land, (4) the gi-eat range of temperature from

-- 58°F. in interplanetary space to -1-150° and more on various parts of the earth's
surface, even in temperate climates. These will accoimt for a future warm and

afterwards for a cold period, and for a glacial and a coal-period in the past.

Sir Charles Lyell gives the annual discharge of sediment by the Ganges and

Brahmapootra as forty thousand millions of cubic feet, which are equal to a circle

surrounding the earth's mean circumference two miles broad and one yard thick,

in 10-5 years and 50 days. This enormous denudation will in no long geological

period reduce the Himalayas down to the snow-line. All other mountains and

land in the world (except deserts) are also being denuded, year by year, by means of

rain and rivers, avalanches, glaciers, earthquakes, and alternate frost and thaw.

For example, the river Pinder, an affluent of the Ganges, has a fall of 500 feet

per mile tor 11 miles ; its water is all white foam, and has force enough to cany

along large boulders, which, as well as the river's bed, become broken, commi-

nuted, and abraded. For 16,000 feet in height of Mount Jawahir, there is a de-

tritus of loose rocks and stones, evidently fallen from the upper part of the moun-

tain. The like effects have been observed at the Matterhorn, in Tierra del Fuego,

the Chilian Andes, Australia, Spitzbergen, and some small English mountains.

In the Himalayas there are annual shocks of earthquakes, some of them severe,

which loosen and bring down rocks. Avalanches bring down masses of stone,

and glaciers convey along lines of stones called "moraines;" and alternate frost

and thaw split and comminute rocks and stones. In these ways mountains are

lowered, and in time there will be no mountain as high as the snow-line (unless

risings by subterranean action occur again), and then a warmer period will be the

consequence. And when the land is reduced to sea-level, the climate will be still

warmer; because the air is chiefly warmed by heat transmitted and radiated

from the earth, and land increases the cold by abstracting heat from the air in

high latitudes and where the land is high, and augments the heat by radiatioiji

in low latitudes and where the ground is low; and water absorbs and retains

solar heat *.

The latest glacial epoch seems to have been in the Recent, post-Pliocene,

and Newer Pliocene periods. Older formations, as far back as the Pei-mian in-

clusive, were warmer than at present, excepting some floating ice in the Cretaceous
Aand Permian.
               difficulty has been felt about the Miocene strata of the Superga

Hill (Turin), how they became mixed up with erratics. It is now suggested

that the hill and its strata, being of a conical form, must have been uplifted ; and

probably so in the Glacial period, whilst a glacier carrying the erratics rested upon

it. The like may be true of the " flysch " conglomerate of Eocene date in the

Alps. The largest part of Europe, the Sahara of Africa, and much of the basin of

the St. Lawrence have been submarine since the early Eocene period f. And

these submergences apparently assisted to bring on the Glacial period, because

the sea above the submerged land would absorb and retain much solar heat ; and

the uplifting of the mountains, now to be stated, must have added much to the

cold. Since the commencement of the Eocene period the Alps have acquired 4000
                       _

and, in some places, more than 10,000 feet of their present height ; and the Py-

renees have attained their present height, which in Mont Perdu is 11,000 feet %· The

Sierra Nevada, 11,000, and the Caucasus, 15,000 feet, had not then risen §. Prof.

E. Forbes stated that Sorata (Andes), 24,812 feet high, contains Tertiary fossils to

its summit. Mr. Darwin found chalk shells nearly 14,000 feet high in the Chi-

lian Andes, and Capt. Strachey found Oolitic fossils 18,400 feet high in the

Himalayas. All these mountains must have been upheaved since the Coal-

period, and consequently we have no proof that there were theii any mountains

at all with summits as high as the snow-line ; and they must have been higher

than now, and consequently colder, by just as much as they have been denuded.

But while lofty mountains have been eliminated as a source of cold in the Coal-

period, it can also be proved that there was then probably much more dry land in

the south to radiate heat, and produce a warm, equable, and humid climate which

the Coal period requires. The annual quantity of solar heat thrown upon the

earth during the geological period has probably been nearly uniform ; but not

so its effects on the earth's climate. Capt. Stiu-t'found the sandy deserts of Aus-

tralia so hot that they were almost a molten surface. On the other hand, if the
gite of Australia were now occupied even by comparatively shallow water, much

solar heat would be wholly lost. In tlie ' Porcupine ' expedition seven surface-
temperatures of the sea averaged only 58°-2 F., the extremes being 64° and

54°-8 *. Ml". Wallace shows, by his map of the Indian and Australian zoological

provinces, that probably Celebes, New Guinea, Solomon Isles, and the interme-

diate islands were once xmited to Australia ; and that Sumatra, Java, Borneo,
and the Philippines were probably united to India. But, farther, Mr. Darwin
has shown that the Atolls and Barrier reefs of the Indian archipelago, and those
of the Lidian Ocean extending from North-west Australia to the north of Mada-
gascar, as well as a very large tract of the Pacific archipelago (in the Ton-id
Zone), are all regions of Gradual Depressimi. It is therefore very probable that
there were vast additional tracts of dry land on the south of Asia and in the
Pacific, which would at once account for coal-plants and coal having been foimd

as far north as 7G°, as well as for the coal-plants and extinct mammals of Si-

beria, by reason of the extra heat radiated from the south and transmitted to

the north.

   Bat we are not bound to believe that these vast geological changes must neces-
sarily date so far back as the Coal period. The uplifting of mountains took place

since the early Tertiary, and the sinkings of land probably date within the same

period, which was famous for upliftings and sinkings. If so, we can account for
the fossil mammalia and reptiles of the Siwalik Hills, for the fossil reptiles and

leaves of plants found at QEningen, for the bones of monkeys found at the foot of

--the Pyrenees in France, for the tropical fossils of the Faluns of the Loire all

these fossils being subtropical or tropical, and due to the absence of lofty
mountains and increased area of land in the south.

   The future cold period will come on when the present land has been denuded
to below high water, and will probably be aided by natural sinkings of land, and
especially by the uplifting of mountains if such should recur. The present gra-

dual (or intermittent) rise of northern Europe and Asia will assist to produce

cold if it continues.

                       The Modern and Ancient Beaches of Portland.

                           By W. Pengelly, F.R.S., F.G.S.

    The author commenced by stating that the Modern and Ancient Beaches of Port-
 land, to which he purposed calling attention, were respectively the Chesil Bank,
 which connects the "island of Portland" with the mainland of Dorset, and the
 raised beach at Portland Bill ; and that his object was to describe the pebbles

 which, dm-ing a recent careful search with Mr. W. Vicaiy, F.G.S., he had found in

 each of them. In both cases they were such as to show that during the era of the
 ancient beach, as well as at present, the direction in which materials were trans-
 ported was up-channel, i. e. from tcest to east, and the prevalent winds were from
 the south-west. To account for the flints which occur on, at least, almost all the
 modern beaches of West Devon and Cornwall, he assumed the existence of sub-
 marine outliers of flint-gi-avel, similar to, and probably of the same age as, the
 supracretaceous accumulations which occur so abundantly in Devon, from the basin
 of the Teign eastward ; and he mentioned several facts in proof of the occun-ence
 of such outliers near the Start, the Dodman, and Lundy Island. In conclusion,
 he expressed the hope that ere long it might be part of the duty of the oificers of
 the Geological Survey to map the bottom of the British seas and channels.

association of interest, and lay there unnoticed till last year. It had then hecome

more opaque, and consequently of more interest to him. It has now all the ap-

pearance of a solid crystal of gold, and for which it has frequently been taken.
The colour is pale, hut he had observed that all gold found in quartz in that loca-

lity is light coloured, owing to the presence of a large percentage of sUver, some-
times as much as 20 per cent.

   He exhibited, also, some ounces of water-worn gold, some pieces weighing from
20 to 30 grains each, recently found in the Cain, a tributary of the Eiver Mawd-

dach, north of Dolgelly, and also a very rich specimen, broken from a quartz-lode

at the Gwynfynnydd mine, adjoining the Cain and Mawddach rivers. He said he

--brought before the Section as mineralogical facts : that of the change of the

crystal, that the gold where the crystal was found is of 14 carats fine only, that

from the quartz-lode at Gwynfynydd 18 carats fine, and the water-worn gold

--from the Cain and Mawddach 23 carats tine giving them as facts open to a good

deal of interesting speculation.

                  On Sections of Strata hetiveen H^iyton and St. Helenas.

                                B>j Charles Kicketts, M.D., F.G.S.

    The exposures made in the formation of the new railway between Huyton and
 St. Helen s, whilst confirming the general accuracy of the maps of the Geological
 Survey, have disclosed important features which would not otherwise have been

 determined.

    In the Lower Coal-measures or Gannister beds, a little north of, but somewhat
lower in the series than, those in Huyton Quarry, a succession of beds of sandstone,
shales, and clay was displayed, surmounted by a bed of coal a foot and a half thick,
probably the equivalent of the " Mountain Mine" coal formerly worked at Knowsley.

    As the line to the south of Prescot crosses the Upper Coal-measures, several
outcrops of coal are exposed, viz. " the Bastions," in the situation marked upon the
map ; a bed called in the six-inch map " Little Delf," and the " Sir John " coal,

about one hundred yards to the eastward of the places given from information as
the position of their outcrop ; and at the site proposed for the Prescot Station, the
two beds constituting the " Prescot Main " coal, a short distance beyond which,
and sixty yards from the Rainhill road, a considerable north and south fault

occurs, not marked upon the map, which throws down to the east purple and

mottled sandstones and shales of upper beds of the Coal-measures ; these con-
tinue as far as the Survey boimdary fault, by which the Lower Bunter is thrown

down to the east.

   As on the formation of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway the presence of
Coal-measures was discovered near Whiston, so likewise in a situation marked
upon the maps as Lower Bunter, there occur two small areas of purple Coal-mea-

sure strata similai' to those near the Eainhill road, having intervening beds of

Triassic sandstone, which have been thrown down by faults.
   The boundary fault of the St. Helen's Coal-field is seen at Thatto Heath, having

an intermediate step-fault on the west or dovrnthrow; it has likewise caused a
considerable amount of fracture and displacement in the Pebble-beds or Middle
Bunter. The Sutton-Heath fault is crossed by the railway where the two beds
forming the " Ravenhead" coal are cut off on its downthrow ; a little below the

lower or "main" coal trees were seen in situ, and the Rev. H. H. Higgins has

obtained from the same locality numerous specimens of the stems, leaves, and
fruits of Calamites, and also of Lepidodendron, with ferns &c. ; also a beautifully
preserved wing of an Orthopterous insect : these have been deposited in the Liver-
pool Museum.

   At the entrance to the deep cutting in the Pebble-beds near Scholes Farm,

wherever the surface is covered with the sands and clays of the Boulder-clay period,
it remains beautifully planed, grooved, and striated, the strioe being from south-
east to north-west.

   In the Lower Bunter sandstone, previously alluded to, there are several fissures
without much displacement of the oeds, the interstices being filled with a debris

consisting of subangular and rounded fragments from the Coal-measures and the
Triassic sandstone, as well as liver-coloured and quartz pebbles from the Middle
Bunter, and likewise granite, porphyrj-, greenstone, and other pebbles derived from
the Boulder-clay, one of which affords an excellent example of glacial markings. It

may therefore be inferred that these fissures must have been formed during the recent

or at least the postglacial period.

On the recent Formation of Gravel-beds resemhl'mg Middle Drift.

               By G. Johnstone Stonet, M.A., F.'li.S,

- On the east coast of Ireland, extending south of Dublin from Killiney to Bray

Head, and from Bray Head to Greystones in the coimty Wicklow, there are consi-

derable cliffs of Drift exposed to view. They consist of (1) masses of amorphous

glacial clay, usually containing an abundance of striated limestone boulders and

fragments of shells ; (2) gravel, which is almost unstratified, containing a few stri-
ated boulders and fragments of shells ; and (3) stratified beds of gravel and sand,
without striated boulders and with but very few fragments of shells. The strati-

fied beds have usually been regarded as Middle Drift, the other beds being treated

as Upper Glacial Drift or Lower Glacial Drift, according to their position.

The author had carefidly examined these formations from Bray Head to a little

south of Greystones, and had satisfied himself that the undoubtedly glacial deposits

are to the present day in process of being transformed into the stratified beds of

gravel and sand, which have been usually referred to Middle Drift.

The Drift rests directly on argillaceous slates of the Cambrian formation ; and the

first thing which attracted attention was that all the spring water of the neighbour-

hood is hard, containing an abundance of salts of lime. These could onlj^ have

been obtained from the limestones of the Drift, and consequentl)^ indicated that a

sensible amount of change is going on in it. This led the author to investigate

further, and he then found evidences of change everywhere and unmistakable.

But it will be most useful to confine this record to the appearances in two situa-

tions, which can be without difficulty identified by any person who may wish to re-

examine the groimd.

Under the railway station at Greystones, which is built close to the shore, a cliif

of glacial clay with abundance of striated boulders will be found. It rests directly on

the Cambrian slates, which are also exposed to view. Immediately in front of the

railway station the clay reaches to the surface of the ground ; but 80 or 100 yards

further south beds of stratified gravel wall be found above it, the stratification being

usually oblique to the sm-face of contact of the gravel and clay. Here it will

be easy to see evidence that rain when it falls soaks quickly through the

gravel, and then travels along the upper sm-face of the clay. In doing so it

penetrates the clay to a certain distance, from 2 to 6 inches, altering its colour from

a dirty blue, which is the prevailing colour of the glacial clay at this spot, to a light

fawn colour. If this stratum of clay out of which the colour has been discharged

be dug into, the remains of limestone boulders will be found scattered through it,

which have also been attacked by the water. There usually remains either a

powdery mass of the insoluble matter of the boulder, or such a mass with a core

of some fantastic shape, which is the part of the limestone that has not yet been

dissolved away. In a few instances specimens were foimd in which one side of the

stone had been sheltered from the water, and still retained its glacial markings.

Moreover some of the clay is washed forwards when the water travels over it, for

wherever the water dribbles out at the surface of the cliff' it carries clay out with it.

Here, then, we have an instance in which the so-called Lower Glacial Drift is being

in part  corroded  or washed away all  over its  upper sm-face and                                                 the portions that
                                                                                                                ;

remain are being added on to the lower surface of the overljdng IMiddle Drift. The

part which is being converted into Middle Drift appears to consist principally of the

insoluble stones of the glacial clay, and of such central portions of the larger lime-

stones as may outlive the corroding process.
                                                                                            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                  87

At this station, wherever the rock is exposed to view, water will be found also,

oozing out here and there from the face of the cliif between the glacial clay and the

underlying rock. Where this occurs, abundant specimens of the corroded limestones

are to be met with                                                                          and no  doubt  if  the  passage  of  water were  sufficiently  pro-
                                                                                         ;

longed, it would in time lead inevitably to the formation of gravel-beds between

the clay and the rock. But the percolation which was observed appears to be of

too modern a date. It probably began after the existing cliif was formed by the

advance of the sea.

  A case, however, in which Upper Glacial Drift has imdoubtedly been con-

verted into Middle Drift, will be found at the south end of the Ladies' Bathing-

place at Greystones. Here the upper part of the cliff consists of glacial

clay with a few striated boulders, and below it there are imperfectly stra-

tified beds of sand and gravel. These porous beds communicate with the surface-
soil by means of a chimney-like passage filled with gravel, which is exposed in the
cliff, and through which rain gained access to the beds below. These beds bear

evidence that, before they were cut across by the sea, they formed part of a sub-
terranean reservoir, in which slowly flowing water was confined between the rocks

beneath and the glacial clay above, the lowest layer of the glacial clay to the
depth of several inches having acquired a structm-e which is stratified parallel to'
its under surface. This stratified structure is continued along the clay waUs of the
passage by which the rain had access to the porous beds. In this case the corroding
and transporting action of the water upon the underside of the glacial di-if't has

probably oeen suspended since the subteiTanean reservoir was tapped by the en-
croachment of the sea ; but the appearances clearly show that it had before that

time been going on, that the water in its passage had been con-oding or carrying
away some constituents of the Upper Glacial Drift over its under surface, and that

the residue which remained became an accession to the underlying beds of gravel
and sand.

   These particular spots have been pointed out, because they can be easily identified
by other observers ; and abundant confirmatory evidence will be found all alou"-

the three miles of coast examined by the author. In some places isolated masses

of clay will be found in the gravel-beds, which may be presumed to be outstanding

portions of the glacial clay ; and in all places the ratio of the limestones to the

other kinds of stone is much less in the gravel-beds than in the glacial clays, which

is the state of things that would natm-aUy arise if the gi-avel-beds have been wholly

formed out of glacial deposits by the prolonged action of the causes which we find

still in operation.

   There is also evidence to show that the stratification of the gravel-beds is due to
causes still existing ; for in the places where there is the most immistakable evi-

dence that Middle Drift is to this day being formed at the expense of glacial drift,
it was found that the stratification of the gravel-beds was continued almost into

contact with the glacial clay, and therefore through the parts most recently con-

Anverted. But this need present no difficulty.                                                                      old mill-race, with a mound alono-

one side of it, has lately been removed to make way for the extension of Dublin

towards Sandymount. The mound when cut across presented as fully developed a

stratified structure as is usually seen in natural gravel-beds. And what made the

case conclusive was that the distribution of the materials was in most places wholly

different both in kind and degree from what the original piling of tliem together

coidd have occasioned. It must therefore have been produced subsequently, and
it was interesting to observe most of the main features of natural stratification re-

appearing in it, with their unconformable beds, separation of fine from coarse mate-

rials, and so on.

  A very simple experiment will show how much may be effected even in a short

time by the percolation of water through gravel-beds. Pour a few cans of water

upon sand which consists of particles of various degrees of fineness, and if a little
clifi" be then made in the wet sand, it will be found to be already stratified in a very

considerable degree.
88 REPORT--1870.

                On the Physical Oeohgy of the Bone-caves of the Wye.

                     By the Rev. W. S. Symonds, M.A., F.'G.S.

   Fossil bones of the exinct mammalia have been discovered in " King Arthur's
Cave," situate in Great Doward Wood, on the right bank of the Wye, between
Whitechurch, near Ross, and Monmouth. They were forwarded to Prof. Owen,
and were determined by him to be molar teeth of H. jn-iimr/enms, molar teeth of
Mhinoceros tichorhinns, gnawed astragalus and bones of M. tichorhinus, molar teeth
and bones of Equus fossiUs, upper molar and astragalus of Bos jJrinu'ffimius, shed
antler of Reindeer (Cervns taratidus), right upper canine of Hycena speleea.

   These fossil bones are from a cavern in a locality rich in caves in the mountain

limestone, now elevated to a considerable height above the river Wye, but in which
fossil bones of the extinct mammalia had not hitherto been found.

   Arthur's Cave has evidently been the den of the gi-eat Cave Hysena, as evinced

by the gnawed state of many of the bones, and the remains of that animal itself.
The physical geology of the district was described by the author of the paper.

On the Occurrence of Pebbles and Boidders of Granite in Schistose JtocJcs in

                 Islay, Scotland. By James Thomson, F.G.S.

The author described the different rocks exhibited in a section across Islaj^, from

Port Nahaven on the west to Port Askaig on the east, which principally consist of

gneiss, chloiite and mica-schist, quartzites and limestone. There is a diversity of

opinion as to the proper position of these rocks ; some consider them of Laurentian,
·while others think they are of Cambrian age. The author was inclined to think

they belonged to the latter period. At Port Askaig there is a precipitous cliff of

quartzite about 70 feet in height, made up of about one hundred thin bands varying

from 1 to 20 inches in thickness. Underlying this quartzite there is a mass of

arenaceous talcose schist, showing faint traces of stratification, containing frag-

ments, some angular but mostly rounded, of all sizes, from mere particles to great

boulders of granite, resembling the granite of the Island of Mull. Similar rocks

do not occur in the Island of Islay ; and Mull being at a considerable distance to

the north, with a deep sea between the two islands, he suggested the probability

of the granite having been transported by the agency of ice.

   These deposits resemble the boulder drifts of more recent times, in the following

respects :--first, in the absence of stratification in one part of the section, which in

another shows signs of regular deposition ; secondly, in the close proximity of

fragments of far transported rock, varying in size from minute fragments to large

boulders ; the origin he ascribed to the mass having been deposited in a tranquil
sea of mud, sand, and blocks from melting drift-ice. The absence of stratification

in one part of the section while it is present in another, may be accounted for by

the disturbing action of icebergs, when stranded in the soft plastic mass, in parts

of the sea of limited depth. He also stated that pebbles of granite had long been

sought for in the  conglomerates of the Old Red Sandstone                                                                                                                                                                                           but in no part of Scot-

land had it been found in rocks of that age, consequently it was inferred that

the gi-anite of Scotland was posterior to the deposition of the rocks belonging

to that period. The discovery of fragments and boulders of granite imbedded in

these deposits, furnish adequate proof that the age of granite cannot be restricted,

and that glacial action was not limited to any special geological period.

0)1 a Diagram of the Earth's Eccentricity and the Precession of the Equinoxes,

   illustrating their Relation to Geological Climate ami the Rate of Organic

  Chatige. By Alfeed R, Wallace, F.R.G.S.

Tlie author exhibited a diagram of the eccentricity of the earth's orbit and the

precession of the equinoxes, from which he deduced certain important views as to

the climatesof past geological ages and the changes of organic life. During the

past three million yeai-s the eccentricity has been almost always much greater than

at present, on the average twice as great, and for long periods more than three

times as great. It was shown that when the eccentricity was greatest the heat

receiA'ed from the sun at the greatest and least distances w?s as 3 to 4 ; and, owing

to the precession of the equinoxes, the winters of the northern hemisphere would

be rendered intensely cold and much longer for periods of 10,500 years, while

during the alternate periods the winters would be mild and short, the summers cool

Weand long, leading to an almost perpetual spring.      thus have cold or glacial

epochs for about 10,000 years, alternating with mild epochs for the same period,

whenever the eccentricity was high, and this was the case for fully the half of the

last three million years ; and, as such alternations must have occiu-red during every

glacial epoch, the fact of intercalated warm periods and the migrations con-

sequent on them, which have been detected by geologists, must be looked upon

as the normal condition of things. But during the last 60,000 years (probably the

whole time elapsed since the close of the last glacial epoch) the eccentricity has

been very small, and the alternations of climate and consequent migi-ations very

slight ; and as Mr. Darwin holds that alternations of climate are, by means of the

consequent migrations, the most powerful cause of modifications of species, there

must have been a comparative stability of species durin» that period of time, from

which alone we obtam our idea of the rate of specific change. This idea will

therefore be eiToneous ; and the rate of change during past geological ages may have

been, and probably was, much more rapid than has hitherto been thought possible.

During three million years before and one million after the recent epoch, no less

than 130 alternations of climate occurred (each of 10,000 years' duration), when the

eccentricity was more than double what it is now ; and these incessant changes were

thought, on Dai-winian principles, to supply a vera causa for a rapid change of

species, and thus enable us considerably to reduce the duration of geologic

periods, which had heretofore been measured by data derived from the peiiod of

organic stability since the last glacial epoch.

        On the Organization of the Stems of Calamites.

            By Professor AV. C. Williamson, F.R.S.

The author pointed out the unity of tj-pe observed amongst the British Calamites,

and the consequent improbability of the existence anywhere of two types (the one

Cryptogamic, the other Gymnospermous), as believed by Prof. Adolphe Brongniart.

He then described the various portions of the jointed stem, the centre of which is

a cellular ring of fistular pith, having transverse dissepiments at the nodes. Around

this is a woody zone, composed of wedges of barred and reticulated vessels. These

wedges are separated from each other by large meduUary rays, and smaller rays

separate the constituent laminse of each wedge, which latter spring at their inner-

most angle from a longitudinal canal rxmning from node to node. The organi-

zation  of these wedges,  canals,  and medullary  rays  was described in mmute
                     _

detail, their variations in several species being noted, as well as the diiFerences

between the arrangement at the nodes and at the internodes, which differences are

often very characteristic. The structure of the epidermal layer, or bark, was then

shown to be cellular ; it consisted of an iiTegular parenchyma, with cells of variable

dimensions. Its exterior appears to have been smooth, unlike the exterior of the

woody groove zone, which, like the interior of the latter portion, was longitudinally

fluted, the longitudinal ridges and furrows of each internode usually alternating at

the nodes. The branches were shown to be of small size, being given off from the
woody wedges exactly opposite the centre of each node, whilst the roots were

described as originating from the lower extremity of each of the internodes at the
90 REPORT--1870.

base of the stem. The specimens with larg;e branches sometimes met with, were
shown to belong to the subterranean rhizomes.

    The author then demonstrated the nature of the arenaceous and argillaceous casts

foimd in the shales and sandstones of the coal-measures. He pointed out that

these were casts of medullary cavities, formed after an almost complete absorption of

the medidlary cells had taken place. In one type, designated by the generic name
of Calatnopitus, these cavities were prolonged through the woody zone to the bark,

in the shape of a verticil of narrow canals occupying the upper part of each inter-
node, but located below and distinct from the true branches. The pai-allel longi-

tudinal grooves seen in the common specimens indicate the positions of the longi-

tudinal canals, whilst the intermediate ridges correspond with those of the large
medidlary rays separating the woody wedges. The carbonaceous covering usually
found adhering to these casts was described as throwing little or no light upon the
organization of these plants, and as being, consequently, a most treacherous guide
to their real nature and affinities. The general gi-owth of the woody zone was
shown to be exogenous, corresponding closely with that seen in the shoot of the
first year of an ordinary gymnospermous exogen. But the fructification of these

plants was proved to be cryptogamic. Hence we have in them a combination of
which no perfect parallel is seen amongst living plants. The author recognized

the close affinities of the Calamites with the living Equisetaceaj, but urged that they

should be divided into two genera, Calamites and Calanwpitus, and made into an
allied but distinct family of Calamitacese, and not actually incorporated Avith the

Equisetaceae.

On the Palceontological Aspects of the Middle Glacial Formation of the East
   of Emjland, and on their bearinr/ upon the Age of the Middle Hands of

   Lancashire. Bg Seakles V, Wood, F. G.S., and F. W. Hakmer, F. G.S.

   The design of this paper was to caution the geologists of Lancashire against
too hastily correlating the sands termed the Middle Sands of Lancashire, in con-
sequence of tlieir being intercalated between the upper and lower boulder-clays of
that county, with the deposits of East Anglia, for some time described under the
term Middle Glacial. It was shown that while in the Lancashire deposits, as at
present investigated, none but recent shells had been found, the Middle Glacial
deposits contained several extinct crag forms. Whilst abstaining from expressing
any decided opinion as to the exact age of the Lancashire beds, it was pointed out
that the evidence at present obtained would lead to the belief that they were much
more recent than the Middle Glacial of the east coast, and not improbably of the age
of the Hessle gravel of Yorkshire (the fossils of which occur at PauU and Kelsea
in Holderness), a postglacial deposit which is overlain by postglacial boulder-clay
called the " Hessle clay." The shells of the middle sands at Blackpool Clifl", in
Lancashire, are very slightly fossilized, whereas those of the east of England beds

are as thoroughly fossilized as those of the Crag. Two lists of species obtained by

--the authors from the East-Anglian Middle Glacial were given, one of certain iden-

tifications, and the other of identifications more or less doubtful from the fragmen-
tary condition of the specimens. The former list contained the following, viz.

presence of such a shell as Erycinella ovalis, of which three specimens had been

obtained. Two Crag corals, viz. Sphenotrochus intermediits and Balanophyllia cahi-

            Notes on Fossil Crustacea. B\j Hjenry Woodward, F.O.fi.

   Mr. Woodward first called attention to the progi-ess made in the investigation of
this class during the past year. He referred to the important discovery of legs

in Asaphus (made by Mr. E. Billings) as likely to decide the position of the Trilo-

bites to be near the Iso^mda, and not near the PhyUupoda, as heretofore supposed.
   The progress of investigation of the larval stages of Linmlus promises also to

throw important light on the older forms of this group, and also upon the relation
between the Liniidi and Trilohitce.

   Mr. Woodward described the follo-svingnew Crustacea, namely :

  A1. new species of Earypte^-us (E. Brodiei) from the Upper Ludlow, Stoke-

Edith Purton, discovered by the Rev. P. B. Brodie, M.A., F.G.S.

  A2. new and gigantic Phyllopod (Ceratiocaris ludensis) from the same formation

near Ludlow, preserved in the Ludlow Museimi.

  Anew3. Ceratiocaris {C. Oreto/jensw) from the Carboniferous limestone ofOreton,

Worcestershire.

   4. Four new forms of Cyclus from the Carboniferous limestone of Ireland and
Yorkshii-e, namely, C. bilobatus, C. torosus, C. Wrightii, C. Harknessi. Mr. Wood-
ward remarked upon the singular mimetic resemblance between these shields and
the young larval land-crabs figured by Mr. Westwood in the Philosophical Trans-

actions, p. 311 (1835).

  A5. new Isopod from the Lower Chalk of Dover, Luton, and Ely was described

under the name of Pulcega CaHeri.

  A6. second species oi Scyllaridia {S. Bellii) was recorded from the London Clay

of Sheppey.

   7. Lastly, Mr. Woodward described a new form [of Dithyrocaris (D. striatus),

obtained by Principal Dawson, of Montreal, from the Middle Devonian Sandstone
of Gaspe, Canada.

    Address hy Professor Eolleston, M.D., F.R.S., President of the Section.

Amongst the duties of a President of a Section the delivery of an Address has in
these latter days somehow come to be reckoned ; and that I may interpose myself

for but as short a time as possible between your attention and the papers announced
to you for reading upon your list, I ^^ill begin what I have to say without any fur-

ther preface.

   I wish first to make a few observations as to the kind of preparation which is
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

indispensable, as it seems to me, as a preliminary to an adequate and intelligent
comprehension of the problems of biology ; or, in other words, to an adequate and
intelligent comprehension of the discussions which will take place in this room
and in the two other rooms which will be assigned to, and occupied by, the de-
partment of Ethnology and Anthropology, and that of Physiology pure and pro-
per, with Anatomy.

   Having made these observations, I propose, in the second place, to enumerate

mthe subjects which appear likely to occupy prominent places our forthcoming

discussions ; and thirdly, I will, if your patience allows me, conclude with some

remarks as to certain of the benefits which may be expected, as having been con-

stantly observed to flow from a due and full devotion to biological study.
    In the first place, then, I wish to say that though the problems of biology have

--much of what is called general interest (that is to say, of interest for all persons)

attaching to them, as, indeed, how could they fail to have, including as they do

--the natural history of our own and of all other species of living organisms, whether

animal or vegetable ? some special preparation must be gone through if that gene-
ral interest is to be thoroughly and intelligently gratified. I would compare the
realm of biology to a vast landscape in a cultivated country of which extensive

views may be obtained from an eminence, but for the full and thorough appreci-

ation of which it is necessaiy that the gazer should himself have cultivated some
portion, however small, of the expanse at his feet. It is, of course, a matter of

regret to think that persons can be found who look upon an actual landscape with-
out any thought or knowledge as to how the various factors which make up its
complex beauty have come to cooperate, how the hand of man is recognizable
here, how the dip of the strata is visible there, and how their alternation is

detectable in another place as the potent agency in giving its distinctive features

but I take it that real and permanent, however imperfect, pleasure may be drawn
from the contemplation of scenery by persons who are ignorant of all these things.
I do not think this is the case when we here deal with coup d'ocil views of biology.
The amount of the special knowledge, the extent of the special training need not

necessarily be great ; but some such special knowledge and training there must be
if the problems and argumentations familiar to the professed biologist are to bo
understood and grasped by persons whose whole lives are not devoted to the sub-
ject, so as to form for them acquisitions of real and vital knowledge.

   The microscope has done very much (indeed I may say it has done almost all
that is necessary) for enabling all persons to obtain the necessary minimum of prac-

tical and personal acquaintance with the arrangements of the natural world of

whichi am speaking. The glass trough used in Edinburgh, the invention of John

Goodsir, whose genius showed itself, as genius often does show itself, in simple in-
ventions, can be made into a miniature aquarium (I purposely use a word which

calls up the idea of an indoors apparatus, wishing thereby to show how the means I
recommend are within the reach of all persons) ; and in it, lying as it does horizon-

tally and underlain as it is by a condenser, animal and vegetable organisms can bo
observed at any and at all hours, and continuously, and with tolerably high mag-
nifying-powers even whilst undisturbed. Thus is gained an admirable field for the
self-discipline in question. The microscope which should be used by preference
for exploring and watching such an aquarium should be such a one as is figured in
Quekett's work on the Microscope (p. 58, fig. 36), as consisting of a stem with a
stout steadying base, and of a horizontal arm some 9 inches long, which can carry
indiflerently simple lenses or a compound body. I think of the two it is better

that the aquarium should be horizontal rather than the microscope ; and those who
think with me in this matter can nevertheless combine for themselves the advan-

tages of the horizontal position of the instrument with those of the horizontal posi-

tion of the objects observed by modifying the eyepiece in the way figured by Quekett
(p. 381, fig. 266). It would be a long task to enumerate fully all the scientific
lessons which may be gathered, first, and all the educational agencies, secondly,
which may be set and kept in movement by a person who possesses himself of this
simple apparatus. The mutual interdependence of the animal and vegetable king-
doms, then- solidarlie as the French have called it, and as the Germans have called

it too, copying herein the French, is one of the first lessons the observer has forced

upon hiin ; the influence of physical and chemical agencies upon the growth and

development of living beings he soon finds strikingly illustrated ; the mysterious

process of development itself is readily observahle in the eggs of the common

·water-snails and in those of freshwater fish, so that the "way in which the various

organs and system of organs are chiselled out, built up, and finally packed together

and stratified can be taken note of in these yet transparent representatives of these

great subkingdoms which all the while are undisturbed and at peace : and all these

points of large interest are but a few of many which these small means will enable

any one to master for himself in the concrete actuality, and thoroughly. The

necessity for carefulness and truthfulness in recording what is seen, the necessity

for keeping in such records what one observes quite distinct from what one infers,

the necessity for patience and punctuality, are lessons which, from having a moral

factor as well as a scientific one in their composition, I may specify as belonging to
the educational lessons which may be gathered from such a course of study.

I have been speaking of the microscope as an instrument of education, and I

wish before leaving the subject to utter one caution as to its use when this parti-

cular object of education is in view. If a subject is to act educationally, it must

interrupted if your knowledo;e is not to be xmreal. And my concrete application

of these generalities is contained in the advice that no sudden jump be made fi-om

observations carried on with the naked eye to observations carried on with the

highest powers of the microscope. I am speaking of the coui-se to be pursued by

beginners, and beginners we all were once ; and if our places are to be filled (and
filled they will be), by better men, as we hope, than ourselves, they will have to be

filled, we also hope, by men who have yet to become beginners. It is in their

interest I have been speaking ; and I say that a lieginner does not ordinarily get an

intelligent conception of the revelations of the microscope except in Bacon's words,

Ascendendo continenter et ffradatim, by progressing gradually from observations

with the naked eye through observations dependent upon dissecting-lenses, dou-

blets by preference, and the lower powers of the compoimd microscope, up to obser-

vations to be made with the''higher and highest magnifying-powers. Unless he

ascends by gradations from organs and systems to structures and tissues and cells,

his wonder and admiration at the results of the ultimate microscope analysis, of

what he had but a moment before knowledge of only in the concrete and by the

naked eye, is likely to be but unintelligent.

There are three other agencies which can be set into activitj^ with nearly as

little trouble and difficulty as the simple apparatus of which I have been just been

speaking, and which will, like it, secure for us the necess.ary preliminary discipline

or " Pfojxideutik" for the rational comprehension of Biology. These are Local

Museums, Local Field Clubs, and Local Natural Histories. Local authorities,

persons of local influence, should engage and interest themselves in the starting

into life of the two former of these agencies ; and if some such person as Gilbert

White could be foimd in each county to write the Natural History of its Selbome,
I know not at what cost it would not be well to retain his services. As the world

is governed, upon each particular area of its surface there is to be found a certain

percentage of the population occupjdng it Avho have special calls for particular

lines of study. It is the interest of each country to have such means and such

institutions in being as will render it possible to detect the existence of persons

gifted with such special vocations, to give the talent thus entrusted to them fair

scope for development, and to render smaller the risk of their dying mute and in-

Aglorious. young man who is possessed of a talent for Natural Science and Phy-

sical Inquiry generally, may have the knowledge of this predisposition made

known to himself and to others, for the first time, by his introduction to a well-

arranged Local Museum. In such an institution, either all at once, or graduallv,

the conviction may spring up within him that the investigation of physical pro-

blems is the line of investigation to which he should be content to devote himself,

relinquishing the pursxiit of other things ; and then, if the museum in question

really a well-arranged one, a recruit may be thereby won for the growing army of
physical investigators, and one more man saved from the misery of finding, when
he has been taken into some other career, that he has, somehow or other, mistaken
his profession, and made of his career one life-long mistake.

   Here comes the question. What is a well-arranged museum ? The answer is,
a well-arranged museum, for the particular purpose of which we are speaking, is

one in which the natural objects which belong to the locality, and which have
already struck upon the eye of such a person as the one contemplated, are clearly
explained in a well-arranged catalogue. The curiosity which is the mother of
science is not awakened for the first time in the museum, but out of doors, in

the wood, by the side of the brook, on the hillside, by scarped cliff and quai-ried
stone ; it is the function of the museum, by rendering possible the intellectual
pleasiu-e, which grows out of the surprise with which a novice first notes the

working of his facidty of inspiration, to prevent this curiosity from degenerating
into the mere woodman's craft of the gamekeeper, or the rough empiricism of the
farmer. The first step to be taken in a course of natural instruction is the pro-

viding of means whereby the faculties of observation and of verification may be
called into activity ; and the first exercise the student should be set down to is

that of recognizing, in the actual thing itself, the various properties and peculiari-
ties which some good book or some good catalogue tells him are observaole in it.
This is the first step, and, as in some other matters, ce ii'est que le premier pas qui

coute. And it need not cost much. There is a name familiar to Section D, and,

indeed, not likely for a long while to be forgotten by members of the British Asso-

ciation generally, extiiusic means as well as the intrinsic merits of the well-loved

man conspiring to keep his memory fresh among us, and the bearer of that name,
Edward Forbes, has left it as his opinion that " It is to the development of the
provincial museums that, I believe, we must in future look for the extension of in-
tellectual pursuits throughout the land." (Lecture "On the Educational Uses of

Museums," delivered at the Museyni of Practical Geology <and published in 18(>3.
Cited by Toynbee, " Hints on the Formation of Local Museums," 1863, p. 40.)

With the words of Edward Forbes I might do well to end what I have to say, but
I should like to say a word as to the policy of confining the contents of a local
museum to the natural-history specimens of the particular locality. No doubt the

first thing to be done is the collection of the local specimens, and this alike in the

interest of the potential Cuviers and Hugh Millers who may be born in the dis-

trict, and in the interest of the man of science who may visit the place when on

his travels. But so long as a specimen from the antipodes or from whatever cor-

ner of our world be really valuable, and be duly catalogued before it is admitted

into the museum, so that the lesson it has to teach may be learnable, I do not see

my way towards advising that foreign specimens be e:^cluded. It is to my mind

more important that all specimens should be catalogued as soon as received, than

that any shoidd be rejected when offered.

  I must not occupy your time further with this portion of my address. Let me

first say that a person who wishes to know wh.it a Field- Club can do for its mem-

bers, and not for them onty, but for the world at large, will do well to purchase

one, or any number more than one, of the Transactions of the TjTieside Naturalist's

relates to a time and place so far off that there can be no truth in the book, and

who yet woidd like to try upon himself the working of the fourth disciplinary

agencies of which I have spoken, that, namely, of reading some local Natural

History on the spot of which it treats, and comparing it with the things themselves

in situ, let him repair to Weymouth, and work and walk up and down its cliffs and

valleys with Mr. Damon's book in his hands.

I shall not be suspected in this place and upon this occasion, nor, as I hope, upon

any other, of a wish to depreciate the value of scientific instruction as an engine for

training the                                            mind                         but neither, on the other hand, should I  wish to  depreciate the

I know it may be said that there are difficulties in the way, and especially practi-

cal difficulties ; hut I have always ohserved that people who ai-e good at finding out

difficulties, and especially practical difficidties, are like people who are good at

--finding out excuses, good at finding out very little else. The various ways of

getting over these difficulties are obvious enough, and have been hinted at or fully

expressed by several writers of gi-eater or less authority on many occasions. It is,

however, of some consequence that I should here say what I believe has not been

said before, namely, that a purely and exclusively literary education, imperfect and

one sided as it is, is still a better thing than a system of scientific instruction (to

abuse the use of the word for a moment) in which there should be no courses of

Api-actical familiarizing with natural objects, verification, and experimentation.

purely literary training, say, in dialectics, or what we are pleased to call logic, to

take a flagi-aut and glaring instance first, does confer certain lower advantages upon

the person who goes through it without any discipline in the practical investigation
of actual problems. By going through such a training attentively, a man with a

good memory and a little freedom from over-scrupulousness, can convert his mind

into an arsenal of quips, quirks, retorts, and epigi'ams, out of which he can, at his

own pleasure, discharge a rnitraille of chopped straw and chaft-like arguments,
against which no man of ordinary fairness of mind can, for the moment, make

head. It is true that such sophists gain this dexterity at the cost of losing, inevery

case, the power of fairly and fully appreciating or investigating truth, of losing in

many cases the faculty of sustaining and maintaining serious attention to any sub-
Aject, and of losing in some cases even the power of writing.
                                                               well-known cha-

racter in an age happily, though only recently, gone by, who may be taken as a

Caesar worthy of such Antonies, used to speak of a pen as his torpedo. Still they

have their reward, they succeed now and then in convincing juries, and they are

formidable at dinner-tables. It would not be fan-, however, not to say that a purely

literary training can do much better things than this. By a pm-ely classical edu-

cation a man, from being forced into seeing and feeling that other men could look

upon the world, moral, social, and physical, with other (even if not with larger)

eyes than ours, attains a certain flexibility of mind which enables him to enter into

the thoughts of other and living men ; and this is a very desirable attainment.

And, finally, though I should be sorry to hold with a French writer that the style

makes the man, the benefit of being early familiarized with wi-itings which the

peculiar social condition of the classical times, so well pointed out by De Toc-

queviUe (De la Democratic en Amerique, i. 15), conspired and contributed not a

little to make models of style, is not to be despised. Such a familiarity may not

confer the power of imitating or rivalling such compositions, but it may confer the

power of appreciating their excellences, the one power appearing to us to be ana-

logous to the power of the experimenter, and the other to that of the pure obser^

ver in Natural Science ; and we should undervalue neither.

Masters of Science, it must be confessed, are not always masters of style ; let

not the single instance of last night tempt you to generalize, it was but a single

instance, the writings of the man whom we in this Section are most of us likely

to look upon as our master in Science have been spoken of by our President in his

recently published volume as " intellectual pemmican ;" and if scientific reading

and teaching is to be divorced from scientific observation of natural objects and

processes, it is better that a man, yoimg or old, shoiild have in his niemoiy some-

thing which is perfect of its kind, entire and unmutilated, such as the opening

sentences of the ' Brutus ' of Cicero, which Tacitus, I think, must have had in his

memory when he vrrote his obituary of Agricola, or as the opening sentences of

the ' Republic ' of Plato, or the conclusion of the ' Ajax ' of Sophocles, than that he

should have his memory laden with a consignment of scientific phrases which,
ex hypothesi, have for him no vital reality. I have already said that I am strongly

of opinion that literary should always be combined with scientific instruction in a

perfect educational course ; these somewhat lengthy remarks refer therefore only

to systems in which it is proposed that we should have not only a bifurcation but

a radical separation of studies and students ; and the moral of this may be summed

up by saying that a purely scientific education must be a thoroughly practical one,

familiarizing the student with actual things as well as with words and symbols.

It was upon tlie solid ground that Antoeua learnt the art of wrestling; it was only
when he allowed himself to be lifted from it that he was strangled by Hercules.

Coming, now, to the second part of my address, I beg to say that the word Bio-

logy is at present used in two senses, one wider, the other more restricted. In this

latter sense the word becomes equivalent to the older, and till recently more cur-

rently used word "Physiology." It is in the wider sense that the word is used

when we speak of this as being the Section of Biology : and this wider sense is a

very wide one, for it comprehends, first. Animal and Vegetable Physiology and Ana-

tomy; secondly, Ethnology and Anthropology; and thirdly. Scientific Zoology

and Classificatory Botany, inclusively of the Distribution of Species. It may have

been possible in former times for a single individual of gi-eat powers of assimilation

to keep himself abreast of, and on a level with, the advance of knowledge along

all these various lines of investigation; but in those times knowledge was not,

and could not, owing to difficulties of intercommunication, the dearness of books,

the costliness or the non-existence of instnmieuts, have been increased at the rate

at which it is now being, year by year, increased ; and the entire mass of actually

existing and acquired knowledge was of course much smaller, though man's power

of mastering it was no smaller than at present. It would now be an indication

of very great ignorance if any body should pretend that his own stock of infor-

mation could furnish him with something in each one of the several departments

of knowledge I have just mentioned, which should be worthy of being laid be-

fore such an assembly as this. As will have been expected, 1 shall not presume

to do more than glance at the vegetable kingdom, large as is the space in the

landscape of life which it makes. What I do propose to do is merely to draw

your attention to a very few of the topics of leading interest, which are at the

present moment being, or rather will shortly begin to be, discussed by experts in

the Department of Physiology and Anatomy, in the Department of Ethnology

and Anthropology, and, thirdly, in the Department of Scientific Zoology.

   Under the head and in the Department of Physiology proper and Anatomy, our

list of p.apers and, I am happy to add, the circle of faces around us suggest to us

the following subjects as being the topics of main interest for the present year :

the questions of Spontaneous Generation ; that of the influence of organized parti-

cles in the production of disease ; that of the influence of particular nervous and

chemical agencies upon functions ; that of the localization of cerebral functions

that of the production and, indeed, of the entire rvie in the economy of creation of

such substances as fat and albumen ; and, finally, that of the cost at which the

work of the animal machine is carried on.

The question of Spontaneous Generation touches upon certain susceptibilities

which lie outside the realm of science. In this place, however, we have to do only

with scientific arguments, and I trust that the Section will support the Committee

in their wish to exclude from our discussions all extraneous considerations. Truth

is one ; all roads which really lead to it will assuredly converge sooner or later

our business is to see that the one we are ourselves concerned with is properly laid

out and metalled.

   Upon this matter I am glad to be able to fortify myself by two authorities ; and

first of these I will place an utterance of Archbishop "Whately, which may be found

in the second volume of his Life, pp. 50-68, and appears to have been uttered by

"Ahim, set. 57, an. 1844.  person possessing real faith will be fully convinced

that whatever suppressed physical fact appears to militate against his religion will

be proved by physical investigation either to be unreal or else reconcilable with

myhis religion. If I were to found a church, one of  articles would be that it is

not allowable to bring forward Scripture or any religious considerations at all to

prove or disprove any physical theory or any but religious and moral considera-

Mytions."  second quotation shall be taken from the great work of one of the

first, as I apprehend, of living theologians, John Macleod Campbell, * The Nature

--of the Atonement,' pp. xxxii, xxxiii, Introd., and it rims thus : There are " other

minds whose habits of pure scientific investigation are to them a temptation to

approach the claim of the kingdom of God on our faith by a wrong path, causing

tnem to ask for a kind of evidence not proper to the subject, and so hindering their

weighing fairly what belongs to it. No scientific study of the phenomena which

imply a reign of law could ever have issued in the discovery of the kingdom of
God. But neither can it issue in any discovery which contradicts the existence of
that kingdom ; nor can any mind in the light of the kingdom of God hesitate to

conclude that if such seeming contradictions arise there is implied the presence of

error either as to facts or as to conclusions from the facts." These are valuable words

and weighty testimonies. But in a matter of this importance one must not forbear to

foint out what may seem to be wanting even in the dicta of such men as the two

have quoted. Neither of them have allowed the possibility of error attaching

itself to the utterances of more than one of the two parties in such issues as those

contemplated. Neither appears to have thought of the cases in which religious

men, if not theologians, have brought woe on the world because of the offences

they have with ill-considered enunciations created. And whilst fully sympathi-

zing with all that the Archbishop and Mr. Campbell have said, I must say that

they  appear to                         me  to  have  left  something                                                                 unsaid                        and  this  sometliing  may  be  wrap-

ped up in the caution that there may be faults on both sides. But at any rate this

Section cannot be considered a fit place for the correction of en-ors save of the phy-

sical kind ; and all other considerations are for this week and in this place extra-

neous. In some other week or in some other place it will be, if it has not already

been, om* duty to give them our best attention.

   To come, now, to the kind of considerations which are the proper business of

DSection : let me say that for the discussion of Spontaneous Generation very

refined means of observation, and, besides these, very refined means of experimen-

tation are necessary. And I shall act in the spirit of the advice I have already

alluded to as given to the world by one of her greatest teachers, if I put before

you a simple but a yet imdecided question for the solution of which analogous

means of a far less delicate character would appear to be, but as yet have-not

proved themselves to be, sufiicient. Thus shall we come to see very plainly some

of the bearings, and a few of the difficulties, of the more difficult of the two

questions. What an uneducated person might acquiesce in hearing spoken of as

spontaneous generation, takes place very constantly under our very eyes, when a
plot of ground which has for many years, or even generations, been devoted to

carrying some particular vegetable growth, whether grass or trees, has that parti-

cular growth removed from it. When such a clearing is effected, we often see a

rich or even a rank vegetation of a kind previously not growing on the spot spring-

up upon it. The like phenomenon is often to be noted on other surfaces newly

exposed, as in railway-cuttings and other escarpments, and along the beds of canals

or streams, which are laid bare by the turning of the water out of its channel.

Fumitory, rocket, knotgrass or cowgrass {Polyc/onum aviculare), and other such

weeds, must often have been noted by every one of us here in England as coming into

and occupying such recently disturbed territories in force ; whilst in America the

desti-uction of a forest of one kind of wood, such as the oak or the chestnut, has

--often been observed to be followed by an upgi-owth of young forest trees of quite

another kind, such as the white pine albeit no such tree had been seen for genera-

tions growing near enough to the spot to make the transport of its seeds to the spot

seem a likely thing. In one case referred to by Mr. Marsh, ' Man and Natm-e,'

p. 289, the hickory. Can/a porcina, a kind of Avalnut, was remarked as succeeding

just the very analogue of the one wliich they and their opponents have to deal

with. And it is not definitely settled at this very moment. Let us glance at the

instructive historical parallel it offers. For the very gi-oss and palpable facts of

which I have just spoken there are two explanations offered in works of consider-

able authority. The one which has perhaps the greatest currency and commands

the largest amount of acceptance is that which, in the words of De Candolle,

poses that in hot summers and autumns, sucli as the present, the fissures in the

ground, which have proved so fatal this year to the young partridges, swallow up

a multitude of seeds, which are restored again to life when the deep strata into

which they are thus introduced, and in which they are sealed up as the chasms

close up, come in any way to be laid open to the vmimpeded action of the sun and

moistm-e. Squirrels, again, and some birds resembling herein the rodent mam-

malia, bury seeds  and  forget  to dig  them  up  again                              and it is supposed that they

may bury them so deep as to be protected from the two physical agencies just

mentioned. Now germination caimot take place in the absence of oxygen ; and I

would add that well-sinkers know to their cost how often the superficial strata of

the earth are surcharged with carbonic acid. The rival explanation and the less

popular (I do not say the less scientific) looks to the agency of transportation as

occuning constantly, and sufficing to explain the facts. By accepting this expla-
nation, we save ourselves from running counter to certain experiments, some of

which were carried out, if I mistake not, under the auspices of this Section (see

Brit. Assoc. Reports), and which appear to curtail considerably the time during

which seeds retain their vitality, and to multiply considerably the number of con-

ditions which must be in force to allow of such retention for periods far shorter

Athan those which have to be accounted for.       better instance of the expediency

of checking the interpretations^based merely upon observations, however accurately

made, by putting into action experiments, cannot be furnished than by recording

the fact put on record by Mr. Bentham, when discussing this question in his last

year's address to the Linnean Society.

" Hitherto direct observation has, as far as I am aware, only produced negative

results, of which a strong instance has been communicated to me by Dr. Hooker,

In deepening the lake in Kew Gardens they imcovered the bed of an old piece of

water, upon which there came up a plentiful crop of Typha, a plant not observed in

the immediate vicinity ; and it was therefore concluded that the seed must have been

in the soil. To try the question, Ur. Hooker had six "V\^ard's cases filled with some

of the soil remaining uncovered close to that which had produced the Typha, and

carefully watched ; but not a single Typha came up in any one of them. (Note

in President's Address, May 24th, 1869, p. Ixxii of Linnean Society's Proceedings.)
   To this I would add that experiments with a positive result, and that positive

result in favour of the second hypothesis, if hypothesis it can be called, are being

constantly tried in our colonies for us, and on a large scale. I had taken and written

--here of the Polygonum aviculare, the " knot " or " cowgrass " having leanit, on the

authority of Dr. Hooker and Mr. Travers (see Natural-Histoi-y Re\aew, January

-- New1864, p. 124, Oct. 1864, p. 619), that it abounds in                           Zealand, along the roadside,

just as it does in England as a glaring instance, and one which would illustrate the

real value of the second explanation even to an unscientific man and to an unassisted

eye. But on Satui-day last I received by post one of those evidences which make

an Englishman proud in thinking that whithersoever ships can float thither shall

the English language, English manners, and English science be carried, in the

shape of the second volume of the Transactions of the New-Zealand Institute,

full, like the first, from the beginning to its last page with thoroughly good mat-

ter. In that volume, having looked at the table of its contents, I tm-ned to a

paper by Mr. T. Kirk on the Naturalized Plants of New Zealand, and in this, at
Newp. 142, 1 find that Mr. T. Kirk prefers to regard the Poli/f/onum aviculare of
Zealand as indigenous in New Zealand. Hence that illustration which would have
been a good one falls from my hands. And I must in fairness add, that because

one agency is proved to be a vera causa, it is not thereby proved that no other can

by any possibility be competent simultaneously to produce the same effect, what-

ever the Schoolmen with the law of Parsimony ringmg in their ears may have said

to the contrarj'. I have dwelt upon this subject at this length with the pui-pose of

showing how much diiEculty may beset the settlement of even a comparatively

simple question which involves only the use of the unassisted eye, or at most of a

simple lens. The a fortiori argument I leave you to draw for j'ourselves,' with the

simple remark that the question of spontaneous generation is now at least one to

be decided by the microscope, and by the employment of its highest powers in

alliance with other apparatus of all but equal complexity.

   We come, in the second place, to say a word as to the extent of the influence

  which organic and living particles, of microscopic minuteness hut solid for all that,

  have been supposed, and in some instances at least have heen proved, to exercise
  upon the genesis and genesiology of disease, and so upon the fortunes of our race,
  and our means for bettering our condition, and that of our fellows. I need not
 refer to Dr. Sanderson's valuable Report (just published in the Privy Council's
 Medical Officer's Blue Book, Twelfth Report, 1870, p. 229) upon those contagion
 particles which he proposes to call by the convenient name, slightly modified from
 one invented by Professor Bechamp, of " Microzymes ;" for Dr. Sanderson is here

 to refer to the matter for himself and for us ; and when this meeting is over we
 shall all do well to lay to heart what he may tell us here and now, and, besides

 this, to study his already printed views upon the matter. It may be perhaps my

 business to remind you that these views, so far as they are identical with Profes-

 sor Halliers's as to the importance of those most minute of living organisms, the
 micrococcus of his nomenclature, the microzymes of Mr. Simon's Blue Book, were
 passed in review as to their botanical correctness by a predecessor of mine in this

--honourable office namely, by the Rev. J. M. Berkeley, at the Meeting held two

 years ago at Norwich ; and that some of the bearings of the theory and of the
 facts, howsoever interpreted, upon the Theoiy of Evolution, were touched upon by

 Dr. Child in his interesting volimie of ' Physiological Essays,' p. 148, published last

year. It would not perhaps be exactly my business to express my dissent from

 any of these results or views put forward by any of these investigators I have
 mentioned ; but I wish to point out to the general public that none of these in-
 quirers would affirm that the agencies shown by them to be potent in the causation

 of ceiiain diseases were types and models of the agencies which are, did we but
know it, could we but detect them, potent in the causation of all diseases. Many

 diseases, though, possilily enough, not the majority of the strictly infectious dis-

 eases, are due to material agents quite distinct in nature from any self-multiplying

bodies, cytoid or colloid. To say nothing of the effects of certain elements (and
 elements, it will be recollected, in their singleness and simple atomicity, have, aa

the world happens to be constituted and governed, never been honoured with the

office of harbouring life) which when volatized, as mercmy, ai'senic, and phospho-
rus may be, or indeed which, when simply dissolved, may be most ruinous to life,
there are, I make no doubt, animal poisons produced in and by animals, and acting
 upon animal bodies, which are neither organized nor living, neither cytoid nor col-

loid. Dr. Charlton Bastian is not likely to imdeiTate the importance of such agents,

howsoever produced, in the economy, or rather in the waste, of Nature yet fi'om
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

his very careful record of his own very closely observed and personal experience
we can gather that he would not demur to conceding that non-vitalized, however
much animalized, exhalations may be only too powerful in producing attacks, and

those sudden and violent and fever-like attacks, of disease. Dr. Bastian tells us
(Phil. Trans, for 1866, vol. 196, pt. ii. pp. 583, 584) that whensoever he employed
himself in the dissection of a particular nematoid worm, the Ascaris mcgalocephala,

he found occasion to observe, and that in himself, and very closely, the genesiology

of a spasmodic and catarrhal afiection, not unlike hay-fever as it seems to me, but

imder circumstances which appear to preclude the possibility of any living organisms

being the cause of it as they have been siipposed, and by no less an authority than
Helmholtz, to be of the malady just mentioned. For in Dr. Bastiau's case this

affection was produced, not only when the Ascaris megalocephala was dissected when

fresh, but " after it had been preserved in methylated spirit for two pears, and

even then macerated in a solution of chloride of lime for several hours before it tvas sub-

mitted to exat)iinatio7i." Could any microzyme or megalozyme have siu-vived such

--an amoimt of antizymotic treatment such a pickling as this ? This is not exactly

a medical association, and I ha-^e entered upon this discussion not altogether with-

out a wish to show how subjects of apparently the most purely scientific and spe-

cial interest, as Mycology and Helminthology (the natural history, that is to

say, and the morphology of the lowest plants and of the lowest Vermes), may,

when we least expect it, come or be brought to bear upon matters of the most
immediate and pressing practical importance. And in this spirit I must say a
word upon the way in which the pathology of snake-bites bears upon the matters

                                                                                                      7*

I have been speaking of, and the extent of the debt which practical men owe to

such societies as our Ray Society, and to such publications as their colossal

Yolume on the snakes of India, in which Dr. Gunther's views as to the real

history of the striking and terrible yet instructive phenomena alluded to are

combined ('Reptiles of British India'/ Ray Society, 1864, p. 167). That the

snake-poison  is    an  animal poison  is  plain  enough                                       that it        is      fatal to men  and
                                                                                            ;

animals everybody knows; but I rather think that these two facts relative to

it are not equally notorious, rich in light though they be, viz. that the po-

tency of this particular animal poison varies in direct ratio to the quantity

imbibed or infused, just as though it were so much alcohol, or so much

alcoholic tincture of musk or cantharides ; or secondly, that its potency varies

in direct ratio to another varying standard, viz. the size of the animal pro-

ducing it. Now the vaccine matter from the arm of a child is as potent

as the vaccine matter from the arm of any giant would be ; and whether
a grain or a gramme of it be used will make no difference, so long as it be

used rio-htly. There is a contrast, indeed, between the 7)wdus operandi of

these two animal poisons. I would add that iu the ' Edinbm-gh Monthly

Medical Jom-ual' for the present month there is a very valuable paper, one

of a series of papers,  indeed,  of    the like character,                                                    by Dr.  Fayrer,  where at
                                                                                                                                                                 _

--pao-e 247, among much of anatomical and other interest, I find the following

important statement: "This poison may be diluted with water, or even am-
monia or alcohol, without destroying its deadly properties. It may be kept for

months or years, dried between slips of glass, and still retain its virulence. It is

capable of absorption through delicate membranes, and therefore it cannot be ap-

plied to any mucous surfaces, though no doubt its vindence is much diminished by

endosmosis*. It appears to act by a catalytic form ; that is, it kills by some occult

influence on the nerve centres." There is such a thing as an ignorance which ia

wiser than knowledge, for the time, of course, only ; such au ignorance is wisely

confessed to iu these words of Dr. Fayrer's. An explanation may be true for

some, yet not thereby necessarily for all, the facts within even a single sphere of

study ; even a true explanation may havejjut a very limited application, as a tan-

gent cannot touch a circle at more thau a single point. The memoirs published in

our own reports by Dr. R. W. Richardson, on the action of the nitrites, and those

published by Dr. A. Crum Brovra and Dr. Fraser, there and elsewhere, on the con-

nexion between chemical constitution and physiological action, deserve especial

study as bearing on the other side     of this    discussion                                                  whilst Prof. Lister's papers
                                                                                                           ;

show how the reference of certain diseases to vitalistic agencies may become of

most vital importance iu practice. There exists, as is well kno^vn, a tendency to

resolve all physiological into physico-chemical phenomena: undoubtedly many
have been, and some more may still remain to be, so resolved ; but the public may

rest assured that in the kingdom of Biology no desire for a rectification of frontiers
will ever be called out by any such attempts at, or successes in the way of, en-

croachment ; and that where physics and chemistry can show that physico-chemi-

cal ao-encies are sufficient to account for the phenomena, there their claim upon

the territory will be acceded to, as in the cases we have been glancing at ; and

where such claims cannot be established and fail to come up to the quantitative

requirements of strict science, as in the cases of continuous and of discontinuous

development or self-multiplication of a contagious germ, and in some others, they

will be disallowed.

   Pathology has of late made a retiu-n to Physiology for much service she has
received, and this in the following directions. Dr. W. Ogle has thrown much

lio'ht on the physiology of the cervical sympathetic nervous system by his record
of a pathological history to be found in the recently issued volume (vol. lii.) of the
' Medico-Chirurgical Transactions.' The rough and cruel experimentation of war

has had its vivisections utilized for the elucidation of the physiology of nerves,
and especially of their trophic function, in the valuable volume issued by the
American Sanitary Commission, under the editorship of Dr. Austin Flint. Dr.

Broadbent has done something towards elucidating the question of the localization

sibly be a cytoid.

 of functions in particular parts of the cerebral convolutions, which was so exten-
 sively and so very exhaustively discussed at Norwich, by his paper in our most
useful and comprehensive ' Cambridge and Edinburgh Journal of Anatomy and

Physiology,' May 1870, " On the Cerebral Convolutions of a Deaf and Dumb
Woman.

    I take this opportimity of mentioning two valuable papers on the very practical
question of the influence of the vagus upon the heart's action. One of these is a

German paper by a gentleman who is a zoologist and comparative anatomist as

well as a physiologist. Dr. A. B. Meyer ; " Das Hemmungsnerven-Sj'stem des Her-
zens " is the title of his memoir, a separate publication as I think : the other is an
abstract of a paper [I have not seen the paper published in extenso as yet] by Dr.
Rutherford, " On the Influence of the Vagus upon the Vascular System," published
in the journal just referred to. Especiallj^ do I think Dr. Rutherford's view as to
the vagus acting centrifugally as regards the stomach, and carrying stimidus, not
thither but thence, to the medulla oblongata, which stimulus is then radiated
downwards by a route formed distally by the splanchnic nei've, so as to produce

inhibitory vascidar dilatation in the neighbourhood of the peptic cells, as worthy

of attention*.

  A considerable number of the papers which vnll be read before this Section,

indeed a considerable part of tlie Section itself, will be devoted to the Natural
History of Man. Nothing, I apprehend, is more distinctive of the present phase

of that " proper study of mankind " than the now accomplished formation of a

close alliance between the students of archaeology strict and proper and the
biologist with the express purpose of jointly occupying and cultivating that vast
temtory. Literature and art and the products of the arts fm-nish each their
data to the ethnologist and anthropologist in addition to those which it is the

business of the anatomist, the physiologist, the paleontologist, and the phy-
sical geographer to be acquainted with ; nor can any conclusion attained to by
following up any single one of those lines of investigation be considered as definitely
absolved from the condition of the provisional imtil it has been shown that it can

never be put into opposition with any conclusion legitimately arrived at along

any other of the routes specified. In political alliances the shortcomings of one
party necessarily hamper and check the advance of the other ; a failure in the

means or in the perseverance of one party may bring the joint enterprise to a pre-
mature close ; mutual forbearance, not to dwell longer upon extreme cases, may
finally be as eflectual in slackening progi-ess as even mutual jealousies. No such

disadvantages attach themselves to the alliance of literature with science, as the

German ' Archiv fiir Anthropologic,' issued to the world under the joint manage-
ment of Ecker the biologist and Lindenschmit the antiquarian, will show any one
who consults its pages, replete with many-sided but not superficial, multifarious

but never inaccurate, information.

   The antiquary is a little prone, if he will aUow me to say so, when left alone, to
make himself but a connoisseur ; the historian, whilst striving to avoid the Scylla

of judicial dulness, slides into the Charybdis of political partisanship; and the
biologist not rarely shows himself a little cold to matters of moral and social in-
terest whilst absorbed in the enthusiasm of speciality. The combination of minds
varying in bent is found eificacious in coiTecting these aberrations ; and by this com-

bination we obtain that white and dry light which is so comforting to the eye of
the truth-loving student, to say nothing as to its being so much stronger than the
coloured rays which the work of one isolated student may sometimes have cast
upon it from the work of another. It would be invidious to speculate, and I

have forborne from suggesting whether the literaiy contingent in the conquering
though composite army has learnt more from observation of the methods and evo-
lutions of the scientitic contingent, or the scientific more from the observation

of the literary ; it is, however, neither invidious nor superfluous to congratulate
the general public upon the necessity which these, like other allies, have been re-

   * Since writing as above I have seen, but have not read, a paper by Dr. Coats in Lud-
wig's " Arbeiten aus der physiologischen Anstalt zii Leipzig" for the present year, which
would seem to treat of this subject. The VViirtzburg Physiologicid Laboratory Eeports for
1867-68 contain, as is well known, a series of papers upon it.

duced to, of adopting one common code of signals, and discarding the exclusive

use of their several and distinctive technicalities. Subjects of a imiversal in-

terest have thus come to be treated, and that by persons novr amongst us, in a

lano-uage imiversally " understanded of the people." I have been careful to include

the paleontologist amongst the scientific specialists whose peculiar researches

Lave cast a helpful and indeed an indispensable light upon the history of the fates

and fortunes of om- species. But it is not organic science only which anthropology

impresses into its service ; and it would be the sheerest ingratitude to forget the
help which the mineralogist gives us in assigning the source whence the jade celt

has come or could come, or to omit an acknowledgment of the toil of the analytical

chemist, Avho has given the percentage of the tin in the bronze celt, or in the so-

called '' leaden " and therefore Roman coffin.
   I am very well aware that many persons who have honoured me by listening to

the last few sentences have been thinking that it is at least premature to attempt

to harmonize the two classes of evidence in question ; and that the best advice that

can be given to the two set of workers severally is, that they should work inde-

pendently  of each  other.                          Craniography is  said, and  by irrefragable authorit}^ to
                                                 _

be a most deceptive guide'; works and articles on ethnology tell us stories of skulls

being labelled, even in museums of the first order of merit, with such Jauus-like

tickets as " Etruscan TjtoI or Inca Peruvian ;" and one of the most celebrated

anthropotomists of the day has been so impressed with the fact that Peruvian as

well as Javanese and Ethiopian skulls may be found on living shoulders within the

precincts of a single German university town, that he has busied himself with

forming a pseudo-typical ethnological series from the source and area just indi-

cated. Great has been the scandal thence accruing to craniography, and the col-

lector of skuUs has thence come to be looked upon as a dilettante with singular

ghoul-like propensities, which are pardonable only because they relate only to savage

races of modern days, or to cemeteries several hundred years old, but which are not

Nowto be regarded as "being seriously scientific.                    to me the existence of such a

way of estimating such a work appears to argue a sad amount of ignorance of the

laws of the logic of practical life, or, indeed, of the chapters on " approximate

generalizations," which any man, however unpractical, can read in a treatise on

Alogic.    mans features and physiognomy are instinctively and intuitively, or, if

you prefer so to put it, as a result of the accumulated social experiences of gene-

rations of men, taken as a more or less valuable and trustworthy indication of his

chai-acter ; were this not so, photogi-aphers would not, as I apprehend, and hope

they do, make fortunes yet the face is at least as often fallacious as an index of
                                                                                                                                ;

the mind as the skull is fallacious as an index of race. The story of the miscon-

ception by a physiognomist of the character of Socrates is familiar to us, as I think,

from Lempriere's Dictionary ; and it may serve to parallel the story which Blumen-

bach and Tilesius tell us of the exact correspondence of the proportions of a skull

from Nukahiva with those of the Apollo Belvidere. The living faces in agaol,

again, to put the same argument upon other grounds, are as dangerous to judge

from as are the skvdls in a museum yet every detective is something like a pro-
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

fessor of physiognomy, and most of them could write a good commentary on L.ava-
--Ater. The ti-ue state of the case may, perhaps, be represented thus :

has had a large series of crania through his hands, of the authenticity of which, as

to place and data, he has himself had evidence, might express himself, perhaps,

somewhat to the following effect if he were asked whether he had gathered from

his examination of such a series any confidence as to his power of referring to, or

excluding from, any such series any skull which he had not seen before. He

might say, " the hiiman, like other highly organized tyjies of life, admits of great

variety; aberrant forms arise, even in our own species, imder conditions of the

greatest uniformity possible to humanity : amongst savages great -N-ariety exists
(see Bates, * Natm-alist on the Amazons,' ii. p. 129), even though they all of them

may live the same ' dxdl grey life ' and die the same ' apathetic end ;' and conse-

quently it may never, except in the case of Australian or Esquimaux, and perhaps

a few other crania, be quite safe to pledge one's self as to the nationality of a single

skull. Still there is such a thing as craniographical type ; and if half a dozen sets,
consisting of ten crania apiece, each assortment having been taken from the ceme-
                                                                                         ;

teries of some -well-marked nationality, were set before me, I would venture to say,

after considtation and comparison, that it might be possible to show that unassisted

cranioscopy, if not invariably right, even imder such favourable circumstances, was

nevertheless not wrong in a very large number of cases." If it is true on the one
hand that in gcneralibus kitet error, it is true on the other that security is given us
by the examination of large numbers for the accuracy and reliability of oiu" averages,
a principle which Gratiolet informs us is thoroughly recognized in Chinese meta-

--physics, and which he has formulated in the foUovdng words : "L'invariability dans

le milieu s'applique a tout. La verite n'est point dans un seul fait mais dans toua

les faits; elle est dans les moyennes, c'est-a-dire dans une suite d'abstractions

formulees apres le plus grand nonibre d'observations possibles." (Memoire sur
les Plis c^rebraux, p. 93). The natural-history sciences do not usually admit
of the strictness which says that an exception, so far from proving a rule, proves
it to be a bad one ; rather are we wise in saying that in them at least the univer-

sality of assertion is in an inverse ratio to that of knowledge, and that the sweep-

ing statements dear, as Aristotle long ago remarked (Rhetoric, &ii. 21. 9 10

ii. 22. 1), to a class which he contrasts with the educated, are abhorrent to the
mind of organic natm-e. It is true enough, as is sometimes said, that when

opinions and assertions are always hedged in by qualifications, the style becomes

embarrassed, and the meaning occasionally hard to be understood ; but this diffi-
culty is one which lies in the very nature of the case, and the real excellence of

style does not consist in its lidling the attention and relieving the memory by

throwing an alliterative ring on to the ear, but in the furnishing a closely fitting

dress to thought, and an accurate representation of actual fact.

   If we are told that the attempt to harmonize the results, not merely of cranio-

scopy, but of any and all natural-science investigation, with the results of literary

and linguistic research, is needless and even futile, this is simply equivalent to say-

ing that one or other of these methods is worthless. For as Truth is one, if two

routes purporting both alike to lead to it do not sooner or later converge and har-

monize, this can only be because one or other of them fails to impinge upon the

goal. It is true that by certain lines of investigation light is thrown upon a pro-
blem only at a single point, and that all fm-ther prosecution of investigation along

that line will but lead us ofl" at a tangent. Still the throwing of even a single

ray upon a dark surface is an achievement with a value of its own ; and it is a

cardinal rule in our sciences never to ignore the existence of seemingly contradic-

tory data, in whatsoever quarter they may show themselves. For what would be
said of an investigator of a subject such as physical geography, who should declare
that he would pay no attention except to a single set of data, when he was discus-

sing whether a particular archipelago had been formed by upheaval, or should be

held to be the fragments and remnants of a disrupted continent; and that if

geological evidence was in crying discord with his interpretation of the facts

Heof the distribution of species, it was not his business to reconcile them.
woidd be held to have neglected his business, as you may see by a reference to
Mr. Bentham's Address to the Linnean Society, May 24, 1869 (Linn. Soc. Proc.

for 1869, p. xcii *).

The argument from identity of customs and practices to identity of race is liable

to much the same objections and to much the same fallacies as is the argument

from identity of cranial conformation. The case may be found admirably stated

in Mr. Tjdor's work on  the  ' Early  History  of  Mankind,'  p.  276,  ed.  2           and I may

say that the means of bringing the problem home to one's self may be found by a

visit to any collection of flint implements. In such a collection, as Mr. Tylor has

pointed out, p. 205, we are very soon impressed with the marked uniformity which

characterizes these implements, whether modern or thousands of years old, whe-

ther found on this side of the world or the other. For example, a flint arrow-head

after having done duty in these iron times as a charm at the bottom of a water-tub

for cattle in Irehmd, was pointed out or at to me by a very distinguished Canadian

naturalist, who was visiting Oxford the other day, as being closely similar to the

weapons manufactured by the Canadian Indians. Now after such an experience

one may do well to ask in Mr. Tyler's words (' Early History,' p. 206) :
   " How, then, is this remarkable imiformity to be explained ? The principle that

man does the same thing imder the same circumstances will account for much, but

it is very doubtful whether it can be stretched far enough to account for even the
greater proportion of the facts in question. The other side of the argument is, of
course, that resemblance is due to connexion, and the truth is made up of the two,

though in what proportions we do not know. It may be that, though the problem

is too obscure to be worked out alone, the uniformity of development in difierent

regions of the Stone age may some day be successfully brought in with other lines

of argument, based on deep-lying agreements in culture which tend to centralize

the early history of races ot veiy unlike appearances, and living in widely distant

ages and countries."

   If the psychological identity of om' species may explain the identitj^ of certain
customs, its physiological identity may explain certain others. Some of this latter

class are of a curious kind, and relate not to matters of social or faniity, but to

matters of purely personal and individual interest, concerning as they do the sen-

sibility, and with it all the other functions of the living body. Such customs are

the wearing of labrets or lip-rings, nose-rings, and, if I may add itjwithout offence,

of certain other rings inserted in the wide region supplied by the fifth or trifacial

Anerve *.  physiological explanation may lie at the base of these practices, which

appear to put at the disposal of the persons who adopt them a perennial means for

setting up an irritation, whence reflex consequences in the course of reflex nutrition

Aand reflex secretion, as of gastric juice, may flow.         curious book was written, or

at least published, on the subject of these practices, and others akin to them, in

1653, by Dr. John Bulwer, a benevolent doctor, who paid attention to the care of
the deaf and dumb previously, I think it is stated, to Dr. Wallis, and who conse-

quently, with proper pride, if this precedence really belongs to him, signs himself

"J. B. cognomento Chirosophus." The title of the book is " Anthropometamor-

phosis; Man Transformed, or the Artificial Changeling." I was made acquainted
with its existence by my friend Mr. Tomlinson, of Worcester College, from the li-

brary of which Society I procured a copy for consultation : the book is not rare I think,

but I think it is little known ; it contains nmch that is curious, and it is, inasmuch
as it was written more than 200 years ago, St oKTjparoj rju i'n Xeiixcov, from some,
though not from all points of view, the more valuable. It is, I apprehend, to some
of these customs, as well as to others, that Zimmermann (not the author of the work
on Solitude, but Zimmermann the zoologist) alludes in a rather amusing passage,
which may be found in the third volume of his lai'ger work on the Distribution of

Species and on Zoology (see p. 257). I speak of the passage as amusing ; it is
more than that, or I would not quote it ; indeed j^ou will not see that it is parti-

cularly amusing imless I tell you that \olumes ii. and iii. are of date 1783, and are
dedicated to his own father, whilst volume i., of date 1778, is dedicated to " Ilia

Most Serene Highness and Lord, Ferdinand Duke of Brunswick, my Most Gracious

Lord." Its quality of amusingness depends upon these dates, and the speculations

they set us to make as to how the Serene Duke, his " Most Gracious Lord," had

--oftended the man of science in the interval between 1778 and 1783. It runs

thus: "If you argue from similarity of customs and ceremonies to identity of

origin of two tribes under comparison, you must first show that these customs are

not such as would naturally tend to the amelioration of the conditions of the in-
habitants in the two countries under consideration, and would probably therefore,

or can naturally, suggest themselves to each of the races in question. Or there may

be customs founded on innate folly and stupidity, and thus, for j-our argument to
be valid, you must show that of two peoples widely separated, each cannot by any

chance come into its own country to adopt the like foolish and stupid customs.
For whilst two wise heads are to make out, each independently of the other and

 contemporaneously, a "wise discovery or invention, it is mucli more likely on the
 calculation of chances, and considering the much greater number of fools and
 blockheads ('Thoren und Dummkopfen'), that in two coimtries widely apart

 closely similar follies should be simultaneously invented. And then, if the invent-
 ing fool happens to be a man of influence and consideration, ichich is, b>j the wai/,

 an excecdinghj freqnetit coincidence, both the nations are Ukely to adopt the same
 foolish practice, and the historian and antiquarian, after the lapse of some cen-
 turies, is likely to draw from this coincidence tlie conclusion that the two nations

 both sprang from the same stock." Judge and speculate for yourselves how the

 spirit which breathes in this passage was excited, but note its scientific value too.

We must not forget that it is possible, in thought, at least, to dissociate the psy-

chological unity of man from his specific identity even ; and that, as regards iden-
tity of race, it is only reasonable to expect that when similar needs are pressing,
similar means for meeting them are not imlikely to be devised independently by
members of two tribes who have for ages been separated from their original stocks.
The question to be asked is, does the contrivance about which we are speculating
combine, or does it not combine in itself so large a number of converging adapta-

tions as to render it upon the calculation of chances unlikely that it should have
been independently invented? Yet this veiy obvious principle has been neglected,

or Lindenschmit would not have found it necessary to say that, by laying too much

stress upon certain points of national identity in the stones ixsed for the formation
of cromlechs or dolmens, the HiinenvoLk might be made out to have chosen to
settle only in those parts of Germany where erratic blocks of granite or other such

large stones could be found ! (Archiv fiir Anthropologie, iii. p. 115, 1868).

    Sir John Lubbock's recently published work on ' The Origin of Civilization

may, I anticipate, cause the history and genealogy of manners and customs to enter

largely into the composition of our lists of papers. There is no need for me, as

the author of the book is here himself to speak, as annoimced, for himself, to occupy

your time in recommending his work ; but I may be allowed to say that the utility

of such pursuits as those which Sir John Lubbock's book treats of receives some
little illustration from the fact that, as we learn from him and from Mr. Tylor, the
human mind blunders and errs and deceives itself in these subjects in just the same
way as it does in the kindred, though more immediately arising, pressing, and im-

portant matters of social and political life. In these latter spheres of observation

we are apt occasionally to mistake one of those intermittent reactions of opinion,
produced as eddies are produced in a river by the deposit of sand and mud at an-

gles in its onward course, for a deliberate giving up of the principles upon which
all previous progi-ess has been dependent. The straws which float upon the surface

of a backwater may be taken as proofs that the river is about to flow upwards, and
a feeble oarsman in a light boat may be deceived for some moments by the back-

ward drifting of his small craft. Now an analogous blunder is often made in mat-

ters of purely historical interest ; and we may do well to learn from the experience
thus cheaply earned. " The histoiy of the human race has," says Sir J. Lubbock,

p. 322, I. c, '' I feel satisfied, on the whole been one of progress : I do not of course

mean to say that every race is necessarily advancing ; on the contrary, most of the

lower are almost stationary :" but Sir John'regards these as exceptional instances,

and points out that if the past history of man had been one of deterioration, w^e

have but a groundless expectation of future improvement ; whilst on the other, if

the past has been one of progress, we may fairly hope that the future wiU be so

also.

   Mr. Tylor's words are equally to the purpose, though, as forming the end of a
chapter merely and not the end of a book, they are less enthusiastic in tone

(p. 193, Tylor, ' Early History of Mankind'). They run thus :--
   "To judge from experience, it would seem that the world, when it has once got

a firmer grasp of new knowledge or a new art, is very loath to lose it altogether,
especially when it relates to matters important to man in general, for the conduct
of his daily life, and the satisfaction of his daily wants, things that come home to

men's 'business and bosoms.' An inspection of the geographical distribution of

art and knowledge among mankind seems to give some gi-ounds for the belief

that the history of the lower races, as of the higher, ia not the_, history of a course

of degeneration or even of equal oscillations to and fro, but of a movement which,
in spite of frequent stops and relapses, has on the whole been forward that there

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

has Deen from age to age a growth in man's power over nature, which no degrad-
ing influences have been able permanently to check."

   I must not trespass into the province of the botanist, but I should be glad to

say that no easier method of learning how the natural-history sciences can be made

to bear upon the history of man, as a whole, can be devised than that furnished by
the perusal of such memoirs as those of Unger's upon the plants used for food by

man. The very heading and title of the paper I am specially referring to appears
to me to have an ambiguity about it which, in itself, is not a little instructive. In
that title, "Botanische Streifziige auf dem Gebiete der Cultur-Geschichte," the
latter word may be taken, I imagine, etymologically at least, to refer either to cul-

ture proper, or to floriculture, or to agriculture. At any rate, the paper itself
may be read in the Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Academj^ for 1859 ; it has, I

suppose, superseded the interesting chapters in Link's ' Urwelt und Alterthum,'

of date 1821 ; and it is not unlikely, I apprehend, to be itself, in its turn, super-

seded also.

   Coming, in the third place, to Zoology, I suppose I shall be j ustified in saying
that the largest issue which has been raised in the current year, an issue fur the

examination of the data for deciding wliich the two months of July and August

which are just past may have furnished persons now present with opportunities,

is the question of the Irinship of the Ascidians to the ^^ertebrata. There is or

was nothing better established tiU the appearance of Kowalcwsky's paper, now

about foiu" years ago, than the existence of a wide gulf between the two great

divisions of the animal kingdom, the Vertebrata and the Invertebrata : notliiug

could be more revolutionary than the views which would obviously rise out of his
facts ; and within the present year these facts have been abundantly confirmed by
Prof. Kupfer, whose very clearly written and beautifully illustrated paper has j ust
appeared in the current number of Schultze's ' Arcliiv fiir niicroscopische Aua-

toniie.' Kupfer's researches have been carried on upon Ascidia canina but they
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

more than confirm the accuracy of what Kowalewsky had stated to take place in

--Ascidia mammillata, and which may be summed up briefly thus : In tlie larval

Ascidian we have in its caudal appendages an axis skeleton clearly analogous, if

not essentially homologous, to the chorda dorsalis of the vertebrate endsryo, as con-

sisting, like it, of rows of internally placed cells, and giving insertion by its sheath
Weto muscles.
                             have further the nervous system and the digestive taking up in

such embryos much the same positions relatively to each other, and to this mol-

luscan chorda dorsalis, that are taken up by the confessedly homologous system in

the Vertebrata ; we have the nervous system originating in the same fashion and

closing up like the vertebrate myelencephalon out of the early form of a lamellar

furrow into that of a closed tube ; we have, finally, the respiratory and digestive

inlets holding the vertebrate relationship of continuity with, instead of the inver-

tebrate of dislocation and separation from, each other. Such are the facts ; but I

am not convinced that they will bear the interpretation that has been put upon

them                         though I nmst say the possession of this chorda dorsalis by the active loco-
                          ;

motor larva of the Ascidian which one day settles down into such immobility

lends not a little probability to Tsiv. Herbert Spencer's view of the genesis of the
segmented vertebral column in animals undoubtedly vertebrate. But on this view

I should not be inconsistent with myself, inasmuch as, to waive other considera-

tions, the chorda dorsalis in each case would be considered as an adaptive or teleo-

logical modification, not a sign of morphological kinship*. Much perplexity may

or must arise here ; and whilst entertaining these views, I felt myself bound to ex-
amine myself strictly to find whether in not taking them up, I might not be giving

way to that reactionary reluctance to accept new ideas which advancing years so
frequently bring -^^ith them ; but a recent paper, by Lacaze-Duthiers, published in
the 'Coraptes Rendus' for May 30, 1870, and translated in the 'Annals and Magazine

of Natm-al History ' for July 1870, woidd justify me, I think, in calling that reluc-

tance by another name. For in that paper the renowned malacologist just men-

tioned has brought to light the fact that there is another sessile and solitary Asci-

dian, the 3Iolgida tubulosa, which goes through no such tadpole-like stage as had

been supposed to be gone through by all Ascidians except the Salpoe, which is

never active and never puts out the activity which is so remarkable in the other

Ascidians, but settles down and remains sedentary immediately after it is set free

from the egg-capsula, neither enjoying a Wanderjahr nor possessing a chorda dor-

Wesails.  are not surprised after this that M. Lacaze-Duthiers observes that

" although embrj^ology may and must furnish valuable information by itself, it may

also, in some cases, lead us into the gravest errors." Mr. Hancock, of Newcastle-

upon-Tyne, has sent lis a paper upon this subject, which will be read duly and

duly noted by us.

Leaving Malacology, which has not in the United Kingdom obtained the same

hold as yet upon the public mind that it has on the Continent, where, lUve Ento-

mology, there and here, it has a periodical or two devoted to the recording of the

discoveries of its votaries, I have much pleasure in directing attention to two short

papers by Siebold in the ' Zeitschiift fiir wissenschaftliche Zoologie ' (xx. 2, 1870), on

parthenogenesis in PoUstes yalliea v. diadema, and on pcedogenesis in the Strepsi-

ptera. In each of these short papers Siebold informs us that adequate room and

time coidd not be given them in the Innsbruck meeting held just a year ago, or in

the report of the meeting. It is to me a matter of difficulty to think what there

could have been of greater value than those papers in a section of Wissenschaftliche

Zoologie ; it vri.ll be to all present a matter of congratidation to learn, from the

venerable professor's papers, that he will shortly favour us with a new work on the

subject of parthenogenesis. Afresh instance of parthenogenesis in Diptera, viz. in

ChirononiHs, has just been put upon record in the St. Petersburg Imperial Academy's

Memoirs (xv. 8, January 1.3, 1870).
   The subject of the geographical distribution of the various forms of vegetable

and animal life over the surface of the globe, and in the various media, air, earth,

water, fi'esli and salt, whether deep or shallow, has always been, and will always

remain, one of the most interesting subsections of biology. It was the contempla-

tion of a simple case of geographical distribution in the Galapagos archipelago

which brought the author of the ' Origin of Species ' face to face with the pro-

blem which the title of his work embodies ; and it is impossible that sets of ana-

logous and of more complicated facts (many of which, be it recollected, such as
the combination now being effected between our own faima and ilora and those

of Australia and New Zealand, are patent to the observations of the least observ-

ing) shoidd not, since the appearance of that book, force the serious consideration

of the explanation it offers upon the thoughts of all who think at all. The won-

ders of the deep-sea faima will, I apprehend, form one, the commensalism of

Professor Van Beneden another, subject of discussion, and furnish an opportunity for

receiving instruction to all of us. Tlie one set of observations is a striking exem-
plification of the way in which organisms have become suited to inorganic environ-
ments ; the other is an all but equally striking exemplification of the way in which
organisms can fit and adapt themselves to each other. The current journals have*,

as was their duty, made us acquainted with what has been done in both of these

directions ; and 1 am happy to say that in the case of the deep-sea explorations, as
in that of parthenogenesis and spontaneous generation, a new work, giving a

connected and general view of the entire subject, is announced for publication.

One instance of the large proportions of the questions which the facts of geo-

graphical distribution bear upon, is furnished to us in the address recently delivered

before the Geological Society by its president, who is also our president, and who
may have forgotten to refer to his own work (see ' Nature,' No. 24, 1870). Another
may be foimd in the demonstration which Dr. Giinther, contrary to our ordinarily

taught doctrines, has given us (Zool. Soc. Trans, vol. vi. pt. 7, 1868, p. 307) of the

partial identity of the fish-faunas of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central

America ; many, thirdly, are furnished to us by Mr. Wallace's works passim.

It would be superfluous, after introducing even thus hurriedly to your notice so

large a series of interesting and important subjects as being subjects witli which

we shall forthwith begin to deal in this Section, to say any thing at length as to the

advantages which may reasonably be expected to accrue from the study of Biology.
I may put its claims before you in a rough way by saying that I should be rejoiced

iadeed if, when money comes to be granted by the Association for the following up

the various lines of biological research upon which certain of its members are en-

gaged, we could hope to obtain a one hundi-edth, or I might say a thousandth part

of the amount of money which has in the past year been lost to the State ana to

individuals through ignorance or disregard of biological laws now well established.

I need say nothing of the suffering or death which anti-sanitary conditions en-

tail, as surely as, though less palpably and rapidly than, a fire or a battle ; and I

might, if there were time for it, take my stand simply upon what is measurable bv

money. This I will not do, as it is less pleasant to speak of what has been lost

--than of that which has been or may be gained. And of this latter let me speak

in a few words, and under two heads the intellectual and the moral gains accruing

from a study of the Natui-al-Hi story Sciences. As to the intellectual gains, the
real psychologist and the true logician know very well that the discourse on method

which comes from a man who is an actual investigator is worthy, even though it be

but short and packed away in an Introduction or an Appendix, or though it cover

but a couple of pages in the middle of a book, like the ''Regulse Philosophandi"

of Newton, more than whole columns of the " Sophistical Dialectic" of the ancient

Schoolman and his modern followers. " If you wish your son to become a logi-

--cian," said Johnson, "let him study Chillingworth" meaning thereby that real

vital knowledge of the art and science can arise only out of the practice of reason-

ing                 and as  to  the value  of  actual  experimentation                             as   a  qualification  for writing
                 ;

about method, Claude Bernard and Berthelot are, and I trust wiU long remain,

living examples of what Descartes and Pascal, their fellow-countrymen, are illus-

trious departed examples. (See Janet, ' Revue de deux Mondes,' tome Ixii. p. 910,

1866.)

I pass on now to say a word on the working of natural-science studies upon the

faculty of attention, the faculty which has very often and very truly been spoken

of as forming the connecting-link between the intellectual and the moral elements

of om- immaterial nature. 1 am able to illustrate their beneficial working in pro-

ducing carefulness and in enforcing perseverance, by a story turning upon the use

of, or rather upon the need for, a word. Von Baer, now the Nestor ot biologists,

after a long argumentation (Mem. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Petersbourg, 1859, p. 340)
of the value which characterizes his argumentations generally, as to the affinities of

certain oceanic races, proceeds to consider how it is that certain of his predecessors

in that sphere, or, rather, in that hemisphere, as Mr. Wallace has taught us Oceania

is very nearly, had so lamentably failed in attaining or coming anywhere near to

the truth. This failure is ascribed to something which he calls " Ungenirtheit," a

word which you will not find in a German dictionary, the thing itself not being,
Von Baer says, German either. I am happy not to be able to find an exact equi-

valent              for this word in  any single  English  vocable                                 the  opposite  quality shows it-
                                                                                                ;

self in facing conscientiously "the drudgery of details, without which drudgery,"

Dr. Temple tells us (Nine Schools Commission Report, vol. ii. p. 311), "nothing
worth doing was ever yet done." Mr. Mill, I would add, speaks to the same eflect,

and even more appositely, as far as our purpose and om- vocations are concerned, in

his wise Inaugural Addi-ess at St. Andrews, p. 50. For the utter incompatibility of
an draXain-ajpos CrjTrjais (these two words give a Thucydidean rendering of " Un-

genirtheit ") with the successful investigation of natural problems, I would refer

any man of thought, even though he be not a biologist, to a consideration of the
way in which problems as simple at first sight as the question of the feeding or

non-feeding of the salmon in fresh water (see Dr. Mcintosh, Linn. Soc. Proc. vii.

p. 148), or that of the agencies whereby certain moUusks and annelids bore their
way into wood, clay, or rocks, must be investigated. It is easy to gather from such
a consideration how severe are the requirements made by natiu-al-science investi-

gations upon the liveliness and continuousness with which we must keep our

faculty of attention at work.

I shall speak of but one of the many piu-ely moral benefits which may be rea-
                                                                    ;

sonably regarded either as the fruit of a devotion to or as a preliminaiy to success

in natural science. Of this I will speak in the words of Helmholtz, taking those

words from a report of them as spoken at the meeting of the German Association

for the Advancement of Science, which was held last year at Innsbruck. There

Professor Helmholtz, in speaking of the distinctive characteristics of German

--scientific men, and of their truthfulness in particular, is reported to have used the

following words : " Es hat diesen Vorzug auch wesentlich zu verdanken der Sitten-

strenge \md der uneigennutzige Begeisterung welche die Manner der Wissenschaft

beherrscht und beseelt hat, imd welche sie nicht gekehrt hat an aussere Vortheile

und gesellschaftliche Meinungen." These words are, I think, to the effect that the

characteristics in question are in reality to be ascribed to the severe simplicity of

manners and to the absence of a spirit of self-seeking[-which. form the guiding and

inspiring principles of their men of science, and prevent them from giving them-

selves up to the pursuit of mere worldly advantages, and from paying undue homage

to the prejudices of society. I think Sittenstrenge may be considered as more or

less adequately rendered by the words severe simplicity of manners ; at any rate, as

things are known by their opposites, let me say that it is the exact contradictory

of that ^^ profound idleness and luxuriousness " which, we are told by an excellent
authority (the Rev. Mark Pattison, " Suggestions on Academic Organization,"

--p. 241), for whose accuracy I would vouch in this matter were there any need so to
--do, " hare corrupted the nature'^ of a large class of young men amongst ourselves

whilst the absence of a spirit of self-seeking is, in its turn, the contradictory of a cer-

tain character which Mr. Mill (/. c. p. 90) has said to be one of the commonest
amongst us adults, and to which Mr. Matthew Ai-nold has assigned the very con-

venient epithet of " Philistine." Investigation as to whether these undesirable

tendencies are really becoming more rife amongst us, might be carried on with

advantage in a place such as this, in the way of inquiries addi-essed to colonists
returning home after a successful sojourn abroad. Such persons are able to note

differences without prejudice, and, ex hi/pothesi, with unjaundiced eyes, which we

are apt to overlook, as they may have grown up gradually and slowly. But, per-

haps, researches of this kind are not quite precisely the particular kind of investi-

gation with which we should busy ourselves ; neither would the leaders of fashion,

whomthe persons with  all the responsibility for this illimitable mischief rests, be

very likely to listen to any statistics of ours, their ears being filled with very dif-

ferent sounds from any that, as I hope, will ever come from Section D. Whether
men of science in England are more or less amenable to blame in this matter than

the rest of their countrymen, it does not become us to say ; but it does become and

concern us to recoUect that we have particular and special reasons, and those not

far to seek, nor dependent on authority alone, for believing and acting upon the be-

lief that real success in our course of life is incompatible with a spiiit of self-seek-

ing and with habits of even refined self-indulgence.

Note on the Changes produced in Lotus corniculatus hy Ctdtivation.

                    By Prof. T. C. Aecher, F.B.S.E.

myDuring a late visit to the Shetland Islands,  attention was called to a singu-

lar transformation produced by giving greenhouse cultivation to the hardy and

beautiful Lotus corniculatus so common in our fields.

One of the most a^eeable spots in the Shetland Islands is that on which the

interesting garden and hospitable mansion of Miss Mowatt is situate on the south

side of the island of Bressay. The garden is especially interesting; for in it the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

 triumpt of genius over natural difficulties is constantly shown, in tlie unremitting
 exertions of the fair proprietor to cultivate all the plants capable of introduc-
 tion, and also the native plants which, with care, conduce to the beauty of the

 pastures.

    Amongst other familiar denizens of the hill-side, the L. cnrnieiilatm has been
 a favourite for pot-cidture with Miss Mowatt, who has found a very remark-

 able change to take place in that plant imder cultiva,tion in her greenhouse.

 From being procimibent and herbaceous, the stems become erect and woody, rising
 in the largest plant I saw to the height of something over 3 feet ; the wood of

 the stem being extremely hard, approaching that of the Medicago arlorea found
 in Italy, whilst the leaflets are increased from the usual number of five to seven.
 These shrubby plants, fi'om all I could ascertain, are easily propagated by cuttings,

 but do not bear seed. They are, however, valued as evergreen window-plants
 and I saw several so cultivated in Lerwick, all derived from Miss Mowatt's plants

 On the Osteology of Chlamydophorus truncatus. By Edwaeb Atkinson, F.L.8.

  A fine male specimen of this little Edentate, now nearly extinct iu its sole ha-

bitat (Mendoza, Argent. Rep. S. A.), having been presented to the Philosophical
and Literary Society of Leeds, has afforded a rare opportunity for reviewing and

connecting the published accounts of its osteology. The adult animal is barely

m6 inches length.

   Reference was made to its bibliography from Dr. Harlan, of Philadelphia

--(1825), to Prof Hyrtl, of Vienna (1855), and Dr. Gray (I860).
    Head. The general confoiiuation of the head is very remarkable, differing from
all other Edentates in its relative dimensions, and excelling all its congeners both
in altitude and in breadth, as compared with length.

    Loiver jaw has pachydermatous characters, e. y. its great depth, perpendicular
ramus, rounded angle, and the shortness of its coronoid process as compared with

the condyloid; yet it bears a resemblance to the jaw of the insectivorous Ma~

--croscelides, which has also a short coronoid.
    JEar. The external ear is unique iu structure. There is no pinna; but a flat-
tened and ossified acoustic tube, analogous to the meatus auditorius externus, ex-
tends from the tympanic bulla for a length of 4 lines, ascending over the zygoma,
and terminating close to the eye by a delicate cup-like cartilaginous concha, which

--is protected and concealed by the fur just below the overhanging chlamys.
   Scapula. The shoulder-blade differs in form from all the Edentata, is curved
downwards to a sharp point like a pruning-hook, has its dorsal surface divided by
two spines into three nearly equal portions (as in Choloejnis). The upper spine sup-

--ports an enormously long acromion.
   Stermim. The manubrium and first mesostemal bone have a sharp crest or
keel, a vestige of a bird-like sti'ucture seen iu a less degi-ee in Clwlajnis and Dasy-
]yi(s, and in the " interclavicle " of Ornithoi-hytichvs. This feature, however, in
 Chlainydophorifs, taken together with the ribs, which are ossified in front and arti-

--culated in the middle, is more oiTiithic than in either of these animals.
   Pelvis. Anomalous in all its parts. The pubis is open in front, as in the Sloths
and the Shrews, but proportionately more than in either.

   The sphaTonui, or bony pelvic shield, which forms the characteristic truncated
extremity of the body, is formed by the confluence of the tuhcra ischii, and
strengthened by bony buttresses from the sacrum. The structure of this mar-
vellous development was described in detail. It has no analogy to the cutaneous
skeleton in the Armadillos proper ; for in these the bony plates are never united

--to the pelvis or other normal parts of the skeleton by a true synostosis.

' Dmtition. Ch. truncatus is a true homodont, with eight grinders on either side
of both maxilla and mandible. They are slightly curved, so that each tooth,
taken together with its antagonist, describes an arc of 25° with the convexity for-
wards. The first tooth of the lower jaw has no opponent, and therefore no masti-
catory surface. The eighth upper tooth is also without an antagonist, but, unlike
its analogue in front, it lias a double facet,
                                                                                                                                                ;

  --Mode of gait. From various considerations it seems probable tliat Chlamydo-

phorus, like Myrmecophaga jubata and Ham's, walks on the back of its fore feet.
This is inferred partly from the worn dorsal aspect of the strongly flexed toes,
partly from the soft fur which clothes the radial half of the palm, but chiefly from

the remarkable development of the palmaris lotigus muscle and the connexions of
the palmar fascia.

                    On Protandry and Protogyny in Btitish Plants.

                   By Alfred W. Bennett, M.A., B.Sc, F.L.8.

   That self-fertilization is the rule rather than the exception even in hermaphro-

dite plants, has been recently admitted by most botanists. This may be eftected

either by the phenomena of dimorphism and trimoiphism, by the fact that in the
same flower the pistil and the stamens arrive at maturity at difl'erent periods, or
by special conti-ivances for facilitating the carrying of the pollen by insects fi-om
one flower to another. This paper was devoted to illustrations from common
British wild flowers of the second of these sets of phenomena, a number of in-
stances being described in which the pistil ripens before the stamens (protogyny),
the stamens before the pistil (protandry), and in which the two organs arrive at
maturity at nearly the same period (sjnacmy).

7'inthus populi, and appeared healthy : but there must have been constitutional
weakness, for of 16 which assumed the pupa state, only 6 produced moths ; of
these, 3 were males, 2 females, and 1 hermaphrodite.

    In form and colouring the influence of the female parent predominates in all the
specimens, one only having the margin of the wings strongly denticulated, as in
»S'. ocellatus. In the hermaphrodite specimen the riglit antenna is pectinated, and
the whole of the right side of the insect presents the characters of S. ocellatus, the
male parent, whilst the left or female side 'differs from an ordinary $ S. populi

only by a little more brilliancy of colour. The generative organs are much dis-

torted, and there were no ova in the abdomen.
   The author also exhibited a series of Hadena assimilis, Doubleday, taken

during the present summer in Scotland. This insect (possibly one of the forms of
Crymodes exulis, Guen^e) is interesting as a circmnpolar species, found abundantly
in Lapland, Iceland, and Labrador ; Scotland seems to be the southera limit of its

distribution. It is extremely variable, no less than IG forms having received dis-
tinguishing names and Dr. Staudinger states that out of 400 examples from Ice-

                                                                                                         ;

the variety assimilis has yet been observed in the British Islands.

   Dr. Staudinger has described a larva as that of Crymodes exulis in the ' Stettiner
entomologische Zeitimg ' for July 18o7, p, 238, which has also been figured in
Milliere's ' Iconographie.' In its habits and strvicture, this larva resembles He-

On the Steypireyor Wlidle of the Icelanders. By Henry Bird.

The Steypireyiir of the Icelanders is identical with the Baltenoptera Sihhaldii of

Gray, the Rorqual of the Norwegians, and the Sulphur-bottom of the Americans.

Its average size is about 85 feet long, and 12 feet to 15 feet diameter in the

thick part of the body ; it frequently, however, attains greater proportions : one

was caught oft" Iceland in 1866, having a length of 110 feet. They have been

--estimated to weigh upwards of 200 tons about the weight of 3000 men. I have

seen a foetal whale which weighed 1740 lbs., and measured 18 feet \h inch long.

The colour of the Steypireyor over the back and greater portion of the body is

black, the chest and under parts being marked with greyish-white streaks, which

sometimes incline to yellow. They are occasionally seen of a red colour, but this

is owing to  a    red  slime  that  covers  the  skin                 this slime washes off after death.
                                                                   ;

Such red whales are invariably very fat.

That part of the skin or blubber situated under the throat is divided into pecu-

liar folds or wrinkles, which run longitudinally from the front of the jaw to the

umbilicus. They reach in height to the top of the pectoral fin, and are eighty-

two in number. This folded blubber is called Rungi by the Icelanders.

The form of the Steypireyor is the very ideal of symmetry ; to compare it to that

of other whales, it is what a fine clipper vessel is to a mud-bai'ge ; consequently
it is capable of great speed. In their respirations they " blow " four or five times

at each rising, and then dive for ten or fifteen minutes.

In sleeping, they float almost motionless on the water, breathing or spouting

feebly at regular intervals when I have so seen them, tliey have been in pairs,
                                                                                                                           ;

and invariably lying side by side, the head of one to the tail of the other, I

presume for protection.

The blubber is G or 8 inches in thickness, and that from a good whale will

contain 100 ban-els of oil. It is a common error to suppose that this oily covering

acts the part of a blanket for preserving the animal heat, at least so far as regards

the oil, for oil is^ a good conductor of heat. It is a significant fact bearing on

this point that the blubber of a mature fcEtal whale I examined did not contain

a trace of oil. Its real use, then, is as a storehouse capable of containing a vast

suppl}' of food.

The following is, I consider, rather an interesting fact : I found the oil con-

tained in the blubber off the throat and tongue was nearly pure oleine, while that

from elsewhere contained 10 per cent, stearine. It is easy to imagine the effect
that would be produced had the oil from these parts been of similar character to
that from the rest of the body, they being so peculiarly exposed to tlie action of
cold ; for, on the animal going into freezing water, they (the throat &c.) would
become so rigid as to cause it serious inconvenience, if not to endanger its life. I
think the fact above observed likely to be of practical value to whalers ; I would
recommend them to keep the blubber from the afore-mentioned parts separate,
limpid oil being more valuable than thick.

   In the spring, and also from the end of Juno to September, the Steypireyor is
to be seen in great numbers off the east coast of Iceland ; but up to the last few
years they have never been hunted, as their capture was considered a matter of
considerable difficulty and danger, owing to their great swiftness and supposed
ferocity. They have generally been accredited with very murderous propensities,
and with the habit of attacking and smashing the boats of the whalers ; but this
is a pure error : I have assisted in the captm-e of a large number, and they have in-
variably shown a timid and inoffensive disposition. The reason that they have
been accused of such malignity of character has, I think, arisen through several
accidents having occiu'red in consequence of their having been attacked with the
ordinary harpoon in mistake for the Greenland whale, when, on feeling its sting,
owing to their great strength and beautiful proportions, they are enabled to dive
with such velocity as frequently to drag boat and crew under water.

   They are exceedingly fond of each other ; when one of a family is wounded,
the others, perfectly regardless of their own danger, will remain by it until it
dies. I saw one cow whale behave in such an extraordinary manner after her calf
had been killed, that I concluded she had gone mad.

   These whales are now captured by means of an implement termed a rocket-

harpoon. This weapon is fired from a kind of gun or tube which is balanced on
the shoulder of the harpoonsman : on its entering tlie whale, a shell with wliich it
is armed explodes, and, provided the rocket has been well-aimed, causes instant
death. The shell contains a bursting-charge of one pound of gunpowder.

Notes on Bmcldsh-vxder Foraminifera. By Henry B. Bkadt, F.L.S., F.G.S.

The Rhizopoda of thirty-two brackish localities, comprising river-estuaries and

lagoons at various portions of the British coast and the "Broads," "Meres," &c.

of the Eastern Counties, had been examined, and the following conclusions drawn

from the results :

1. The different tj'pes of Foraminifera possess variable powers of accommodating

themselves to decreased salinity of the water.

Of the forty-foui- reputed genera constituting the British marine rhizopod-fauna,

only twelve are entirely absent from the brackish gatherings. Seven others

may be regarded as only accidentally present and not at home in subsaline

waters. Of the remaining twenty-five, seven, viz. Cormispira, Cristellaria, Poly-

morphina, Glohu/erina, Textularia, and Patelliiia, have considerable adaptive power,

but brackish specimens are invariably small and thin-shelled; they do not

occur where the admixture of fresh water is very great. The genus Lagena is

abundant in such localities, together with Bulimma (B. ovata), PlanorhuUna (P.

mediterrancnsis) , and Discorhina (D. c/Iohularis and D. rosacea). Lastly, a number

of genera flourish in pools which at times contain only traces of saline constituents,

viz. Qubiqueloculina, Trochammina, Lituolu, Truncatidina, Rotalia, Pohjstomella, and

Nonionina. Specimens of Poh/stomcUa stnatopimctata and Konionina depressula liad

been found in fresh water.

114 REPORT 1870.

   2. The living- Foraminifera of the fens may he compared with their immediate

predecessors iii point of time by the examination of the bed of clay nnderlying the
peat throiiEfhout the district. Out of forty-one specific and varietal forms found
subfossilized in the clay, twenty have sm-vived the changes in the physical aspects

of the country ; no fresh type has appeared, and the few varieties which now exist,

not present in the clay, generally represent depauperated conditions of certain of
the older t^-pes.

   3. Decreased salinity of water tends to produce certain changes in the characters
of the Rhizopoda, especially in the nature of their investment. This is chiefly
dependent on the deficiency of calcareoxis matter. Thus Sliliola (normally porcel-
lanous ) and Trochammina (normally arenaceous) are represented in brackish water
by forms having a keratose investment, which is scarcely altered by treatment with
strong acids. In other genera the deficiency of mineral constituents causes thinning
of the shell-wall.

   >Some species, notably Konioynna depressxda and Poh/sfomelhi striatnptmctata, are

often of a green colour when living in pools where the admixture of fresh water is
considerable ; and it was stated, under reserve, that there were indications that the

colouring-matterinight be chlorophvU.

  4. Two species of Foraminifera hitherto undescribed are amongst the commonest

of brackish Rhizopoda, A'iz. Quinqncloculina fusca s.ndi Trocliammina macrescens*.
   Eight species not before recorded from British localities had been found in the

--brackish gatherings, viz. Qinnqxclocidina Canrteinna, D'Orb., Lacjena Li/plIn,Se^.,

Denfalina ffutfifera, T>'Ovh.,MargiimUna (jhihra, D'Orb., Teaiiilariaf/lobuIosa,'EhYenh.,

On the Terrestrial and Marine Fauna of the Strait of Magellan and Western
              Patagonia, By Egbert 0. CxjiranfcurAM, M.D., F.L.S.

   The author, after briefly adverting to the climate and phj-sical features of the
above regions, made some remarks on the distribution of tlie classes, genera, and
species of the animals occurring therein, mentioning some of the more remarkable
facts observed by him. Beginning with the Mammalia, the existence of the pimia
{Fc'lis concolor), two species of ox, a Mephitis or skunk, an otter, the sea-lion

(Otariajuhatd), the fur-seal {Arctoaphalns falklandicus), the guanaco, a species of

deer, and a variety of Rodents were recorded from the Strait. No Marsupials

were met with in Patagonia proper, but a small opossimi (Didelphis clcf/ans) not
uncommon in the neighbourhood of Concepcion occun-ed in the island of Chiloe.
More than eighty species of birds were procured in the Strait of Magellan and on
the western coast of the continent as far north as Chiloe. The Raptores comprised
two species of Vidtriridcp. (the turkey-buzzard and the condor), seven species of

Falconid(r>, and four of Strigidce. Among the more interesting of the remaining

land-birds enumerated were a humming-bird, a paraquet, and two species of
woodpecker. In speaking of the water-fowl, some of the more remarkable breed-
ing-stations of these birds were pointed out on a coloirred chart of the Strait, certain
of which had been observed by the old voyagers of the Elizabethan age. But one
true reptile, a small lizard (lii/f/odenis pccfinatus), was recorded from the Strait of
j\Iagellan ; but on the west coast of Patagonia Amphibia were found as far south as

--Lit. 51°, and these consisted of two species, one, the Hyhdes leptopus, discovered

by INIr. Darwin at Yaldivia ; and the other the type of a new genus named by Dr.
Giinther Kannophryne. About twenty species of fish were obtained ; and of these,
seven were members of the family Trachiuidoe, and representatives of the genera
Ampliritis, Chfrnichthys, Eleyinus, Kotothcnia, and Harpayifer. Reference was
made to two new genera, i. e. Maynea (family Lycodidre), and Psammohatis (family
Raiadfe). The Invertebrata were then passed in review, and the more interesting
forms remarked on. Regarded as a whole, the fauna of the Strait and Western

Patagonia appears to belong to the Chilian tj^e.

       On the Foundation of Zoological Stations. By Dr. Anton Dohen.

  DohmDr. gave an account of liis exertions in Naples to construct a large

building close to the sea, containing waste aquariums, extensive laboratories, and

observatories, a scientific library, and whateTer belonged to the practical pursuit

of marine zoology. He asked the moral assistance of the British Association for

overcoming some possible resistance at Naples, as the place for the establishment
was to be had only by cession of territory of the VUla Eeale, the celebrated
park of the city of Naples.

  He added remarks on the importance of zoological stations in other parts of

the world, and said that his scheme was worked out with the view of facilitating

the foundation of such stations.

                                                          By Sir "Walter Elliot, F.L.S.

The Rock-snake (Python mohtrm, L.) inhabits the whole of India, but prefers

the dense forests clothing the base of the mountain-chains and extending, according

to Mr. Swinhoe, even to China. In these haunts it attains its greatest size ; and

the statements made relative to its bulk and power of swallowing its prey, current
among the natives, require to be carefully scrutinized, and only received with the

gTeatest caution. Credible instances have been related by Capt. (afterwards Sir)

Murray Maxwell of a specimen on board the ' Alceste ' which swallowed a goat, the

horns of which were seen distending the skin for many days afterwards. Lord

Walden, President of the Zoological Society (when Lord Arthur Hay), described,

in the ' Madi-as Journal of Literatm-e and Science,' an individual 17 feet long

which had swallowed a gravid axis deer. The case which I wish now to mention

rests entirely on native testimony                                                                                                                                                          but it was  carefully sifted and tested by a very
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

Aof Mysore.
                                         Parsi merchant whom he had long known as a contractor for the

commissariat when he (General Cabbon) was Commissary-General, called on him

at Bungalore in 1835 or 18.36, and in course of conversation mentioned that on

landing at Coompta, from Bombay a few days before, on the Malabar coast, he had

seen a rock-snake that had just been kiUed, having swallowed a bison {Bos gaurus).

Although his informant was a person deserving of credit, the General detemiined

to investigate the matter fully, and sent for the evidence of the most respectable

eye-witnesses and who appeared most trustworthy. The sum of their testimony

showed that the snake had been upwards of 30 feet long, that it had swallowed a
young bison cow with the horns fully developed, and that it had been so completely

gorged in consequence, that it had been unable to retire to its lair, which led to its

discovery and easy destruction. The relation is given for what it is worth. It rests
on what is allowed to be a sufficient amount of evideuce for the establishment of a

matter of fact, viz. the concurring testimony of a large number of eye-witnesses,

recorded with care immediately after the event.

  A specimen 11 feet long, kept in captivity for several days, showed no fear of man.

It tried to seize fowls, dogs, &c. which approached it, but was checked by the rope

which confined it. When the cord was lengthened it used to glide perpendicularly

with the greatest ease up the smooth stem of a tamarind-tree near which it was

picketed, and lie all day coiled on a branch. At lenglh, wishing to destroy it, the
basket in which it was secured at night was sunk for 36 hours in the river ; but on
being taken out it was found to be as lively as ever. Dumeril and Bibron, how-

ever, state that aU the PythonidoB are aquatie in their habits, and P. molunts the

most so                                  but its continued vitality after                                                                                                                   such        prolonged immersion shows it to be

Abnormal Petals on Flowers of Eanunculus aquatilis. By Thomas Gibson.

blown flowers, the principal part of which were beneath the surface, at depths

Yarying' from a few inches to a foot or more, "was discovered in a pit. The water
was about 4 feet deep and quite clear, and gave full eilect to the splendid array of

such very unusual iiowers.

  When the stem is cut and left in the water, the petals of flowers which blow on

the detached branch are not inflated, and are in form and size like those produced
bv Raminculm jietaliis-Jloribttiidus, being broader and shorter, and having the nec-

tary much more produced than those of H. heterophyllus.

   It has no floating leaves, and its capillary or submerged ones are quite rigid, and
liavino- the peduncle opposite on a stem which is rather slender, very hollow, of a
whitish-green colour, and semitransparent. The stipules are like those produced
by Ranunculus hcterophjllus.

 " The author has paid great attention to this Ranunculus each year, and has found
abundance of flowers ; but only a small portion of them with inflated petals, and
those generally under water and always without a cah^x.

   After studj'ing the habits of this curious plant carefully for the last five sum-
mers, he has come to the conclusion that it is capable of making a great effort to
extricate itself when the water suddenly becomes too deep for it ; and so, just as a

man who had fallen into the deep would throw oft' his coat and his shoes to enable
him to keep his head above water, this little plant, when in like difficulty, throws

off its calyx and inflates its petals to enable it to reach the surface and there per-
form its usual functions in the sunshine in its usual waJ^

   In 18B5 there had been a heavy and rather sudden fall of rain, and the pit was
much fuller of water than usual, which fully accoimts for the great number of in-
flated flowers which were to be seen at that time.

            Parasitic Habits of Pyrola rotundifolia. Bif Thomas Gibson.

   During a few months' residence at Southport in the summer of 18G9, the author
spent some time and labour with a view of clearing up a difliculty respecting this
plant, some naturalists considering it to be a parasite, while others hold the oppo-

site opinion. He examined a large number of roots, but failed to find any situation

where the Dwarf Willow (Salix rcpcns) was not in company with the Pip-ola, the
roots being frequently so matted together as to render it almost impossible to sepa-

rate them.

    The long stoloniferous root of the Tyrola differs from the root of any other plant
which has come under the author's notice. It is smooth, of a yellowish -white
colour, and about one line or the tenth of an inch in thickness; it runs underground
at from 2 to 3 inches below the surface, and threads its way amongst the roots of
other plants for yards together, throwing off at various distances others, which,
after threading their way for some distance, generally terminate by sending a
young plant to the surface ; the root-stock still proceeding and frequently making a
turn almost at right angles, especially where it comes in contact with the root of
Salix rcpcns, the vicinity of which it never leaves.

    Clumps of the Pi/rola covering a piece of 'ground were frequently found several
3'ards in circumference, which was evidently all growing from one underground
root-stock or stolon. This root-stock sent out at intervals on the underside little
tufts of small fibrous roots, of a dark but bright claret-colour, which contrasted
beautifully with the white stolon out of which they grew. The roots of the Dwarf
Willow arc much thicker than those of the Pyrola, very woody, and of a light
brown colour. Out of these roots there also grew at various distances little tufts of
claret-coloured fibre, so like those which spring from the root-stock of the Pyrola,
both in colour, shape, and size, that it was impossible to find a difl'erence even with
a good lens. These tufts of fibre, so much alike in both plants, were frequently
matted together in such a manner as to render it almost impossible to separate them
 without breaking either one or the other.

    Only one instance was found where the two plants were in actual contact with
 each other. One of the lateral shoots from the stolon of the Pyrola had penetrated
 the root of the Willow and stuck fast in it. The root was about the thickness of a
 good-sized office pencil, and in a state of decay. Whether that decay was caused
 by the root of the Pyrola sucking the sap, and so causing the death of the plant, or
----

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                               117

 whether its being in a state of decay, and of coui'se soft, was the cause of the Pi/rola
 entering ; the author is iucluied to think that the former was the case, and that for

 three reasons :

    1st. It had evidently been in contact some time, because the side shoot of the
Pyrola had attained the full thickness of the parent root, which is not usually tho
case with the lateral shoots.

   2nd. The white shoot, after entering- the Willow, had become of the same brown
colour, and the two root3 were so incorporated together that it was impossible to
say for a certainty where the one ended and the other began.

   3rd. That the root did not go through the Willow, and so proceed on its way, as

in all probability it woidd have done had the AVillow been soft with decay when

the Pyrola entered.

   The author concludes that the two plants have a kind of sympathy for each
other ; and if it does not amount to the Pyrola being a parasite on the Willow, it
certainly must have some mysterious affinity for it. lie has found Orobanche
hederoi with much less proximity to the Ivy tliau the disputed plants are to each
other, and has also seen Monotropu hyjoopitys with no ajjpearance of parasitic habits,
and j-et all naturalists believe these plants to be parasites.

   Now, except it can be disproved by its habits and associations in localities which
he has not yet had the opportunity of studying, tho author must conclude the
Pyrola to be a parasite upon the ^^'illow.

     On the Abnormal Growth of Ferns. By Townshend M. Hall, F.G.S.

    In this communication the author gave some results of his observations with
reference to the increasing prevalence of abnormal structures amongst certain

species of ferns in the south-west of England, but especially in Devonshire, Ho
stated that his remarks did not in au}' way relate to the variations of ferns which

had been subjected to artificial treatment imder cultivation, but simply to the
changes which appeared to have taken place during the last few years amongst

those commoner species which abound in every wood and hedge-row. From the
profusion in which they grow in the south-west of England, there are several
species which may be looked upon as aflbrding an excellent indication of that
change, which, whether it may be called development, or whether it be considered

retrogression, is so rapidly effecting an alteration amongst this tribe of plants.
   Of the various species of ferns, the Scolopendrium vuhjare appears to have been

amongst the first to assume bifid and midtifid forms, and so rapidlj^ have they

increased, either by sowing the spores or by inoculation, that there are now many

localities where plants bearing abnormal fronds are the rule instead of the excep-

tion. Other common forms of this fern are the crisped and crested, naiTOW and

ramose ; all showing, however, the marked tendency of the species to depart from
its normal structure.

   Many other ferns, such as the following, have also recently appeared in the De-

vonshire lanes with bifurcated leaves :
                                                                                               ;

LastreaJiUx-7nas (male fern).                  spleenwort).
Pteris aqtdlina (brake fern).
                                           Aspleniuvi trichomanes (wall spleeu-

Polystichum anijulare (shield fern).
Athyriimi felix-fcemina (lady fern).       Osmunda rcyalis (royal fern).

The abnormal growth of several of the above-named ferns is by no means con-

stant; although under cultivation some of the variations of Lastreu filix-mas,

Pohjpodium vulffcire, and Polysticlmm am/idare may be not only retained, but also
improved upon. As an illustration of this the author mentioned a plant of Poly-

stichum anyidare, which he transplanted from a neighbouring lane into his fernery

a few years ago, when it had only two or three fronds which were bifm-cated, the

remaining leaves being in their normal condition. Within twelve months all the

fronds became bifurcated, and the succeeding year brought them out with a thickly

crested multifid termination ; whilst at the same time a fresh element of variation

appeared in the bifurcation of each of the pinnae or side leaves. In another season

the pinnfe also had become crested, and so the whole plant has gone on, becoming

more and more divided and subdivided, until all its original character has passed

away ; and the twenty-nine fronds of which the plant at present consists, and which
ought of course in a normal state to have only as many terminations, have now

become multiplied to such an extent that on the smallest and least crested of all

the fronds may be reckoned no less than 137 small but well-defined terminations,

whilst some of the larger leaves have upwards of double that number. During all

this time the plant had never been moved or meddled with in any way, and the

only attention it received was an occasional watering during the spring and whilst

the fronds were sprouting out.

The fern which, in its natural state, is at the present time imdergoing the greatest

amount of change is the Pteris aquilina, or common brake. The observations of

the bifid and multifid forms of this species were said to date from five years ago

up to which time the author knew of only one locality where an abnormal plant

could be met with. Now the variations have increased to such can enormous ex-

tent that even in this short space of time this species bids fair to outstrip Scolopen-

drimn vidyare in its race towards what, in strict botanical language, would perhaps

be called " teratological metamorphosis."

The warm and moist climate of the south-west of England and the corresponding

portion of Ireland appears more especially favourable to the growth of such ferns

as have a tendency to depart  from their   original  and  recognized  type                     whilst, on
                                                                                            ;

the other hand, in the drier atmosphere of France and Italy, Spain and Switzerland,

it was noticed that the ferns did not seem to have reached an equally advanced

stage of abnormal growth. This question of geographical distribution was one of

considerable importance, and as such was deserving of a full investigation.

In conclusion, the author said that the change now taldng place so extensively

amongst the Cryptogamia deserved to be especially observed, because it appeared to

be a change of comparatively recent date. As far as he was aware, no instance of

a fern with an abnormal growth had hitherto been noticed amongst the fossilized

remains of the Old Red Sandstone, or in the still more luxuriant and diverse flora

--of the Carboniferous period, or even in any of the Mesozoic strata, lower, middle,

or upper ; whilst, advancing a step further into the recent period, it was remarked

that up to the time of De Candolle there was scarcely a botanist who had made

any investigations in this department of botanical science.

Note on the Larval State of Molgula, ivith Descriptions of several neiv Species

               of simple Ascidians. By Albany Hancock, F.L.S.

   The author of this paper shows that in two members of the genus Molytda the
usual tadpole-like larva is developed, notwithstanding M. Lacaze-Duthier's recent
discoveiy, that in a certain species stated to belong to this genus there is no such
tadpole-larva, but that the young on escaping from the egg is a comparatively
inactive xVmosba-like creature. There is some probability, however, that the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                            119

species examined by this distinguished foreign naturalist belongs to another genus.
Should this prove to be the case, the interest of his discovery will not be lessened
on that account, as it would seem to establish the fact that the tadpole-larva con-

dition is non-essential in the development of the Tunicata, and may have important

influence on the doctrine of Kowalevsky respecting the relationship of the Tunicata

to the Vertebrata.

   The paper concludes with the description of two new genera, namely Corclla and
Eugyra, and nineteen new species of simple Ascidians.

    On a Pentaci'imis (P. Wyville-Thomsoni) from the Coasts of Spain and
                       Portugal. By J. Gwtk Jeffreys, F.B.S.

    During the recent deep-sea exploring expedition in H.M.S. 'Porcupine' Mr.
 Jeffreys dredged, at a depth of 795 fathoms, between Vigo and Lisbon, specimens
·of a fine PeHfacrinus, about a foot long. Associated with it were Zeda ohtiisa and
other arctic species of IMollusca, besides several kinds of simple and compound
 Corals and Hydrozoa. The tentacles or arms of the same species of Peiitacrinus
were afterwards taken by the dredge, in 364 fathoms, near the entrance to Cadiz
Bay. In the latter dredging the Mollusca were mostly of a southern character, but
included Vcrticordia acuticostatn (a crag and Sicilian fossil, as well as living in the
Japanese sea) and a few northern species, such as Plmrotoma turricula and Trochzis

amahilis. There were likewise some remarkable and apparently new Echinoderms,
Corals, and Hydrozoa. This was stated by the author to be the first instance of a
true Pentacrinm having been found in the European seas. Two species inhabit the
West Indies, viz. the well-known P. caput-medusa and P. 3Iicl/eri. The species
now exhibited had evidently not been attached at its base, which is quite regular
and free, although it was imbedded in sandy mud, with the lowermost cirri serving

to keep the Pentacrinus in an upright position, like the horizontal and spreading

roots of a fir tree.

           On an existing Favositoid Coral*. By W. Saville Ej;nt.

    In this communication the author gave a description of an existing coral closely
allied to the Palseozoic genus Favosites, which he last year discovered amono- the
collection of Madrepores contained in the Paris Museum. Unfortunately no record
of the habitat of this interesting form has been preserved, though, at the same time,
its recent origin is undoubted. The author has proposed to distinguish this fonn

by the name oi Favosifijmra Deshaycsii. The author pointed out its close aifi-
nities to Alreopora, an existing genus common throughout the Red and Eastern
seas, and from which it dilfered only in its possession of irregulary disposed, but
perfectly developed tabuhe. Through Koninckia, a coral of the Cretaceous forma-

tion, it is immediately allied to the Palaeozoic genus Favosites ; and he affirmed to
haying recently discovered among the collection of fossd corals contained in the

British Museum a form having no history attached to it, but undoubtedly referable
to the American Devonian or Carboniferous deposits, in no way diflering generi-
caUy from the existing coral in the Paris Museum. He distinguishes this species
by the name of Favositipora palceozoica. The author regarded the structure of F.

I)eshaijcsii as strong evidence in refutation of the theory advocated by Professor
Agassiz, " that all the tabulate corals are to be referred to the Hydrozoa," its near

ally ^/reo;;orrt being- sucli a well-known Actinozoon. He also expressed his

opinion that no septate coral could justifiably be referred to that lower group,
septa being essentially intermesenteric developments, which could consequently' be
possessed by Actinozoa alone.

   The author likewise referred to this form as bearing out his opinion that the

   * This coral is i3gured and fully described in the ' Annals and Magazine of Natural
History ' for November 1870.

corals of tlie Pala30zoic epoch were as liiglily organized as those peopling the ex-

isting seas. As he had shown, a species generically the same existed at that remote
epoch, associated witli members closely allied to Alvciqjora, but presenting a higher

type of organization in their constant possession of tabnlre. In the genus Favosites
the author also recognized an immediate connecting-link between the hitherto
presumed distinct sections of the Tabulata and Perforata.

   The author exhibited diagi-ams illustrative of the structure of Favositipora
Dcshayesii, and also photogi'aphs of the original f-peciniens contained in the Paris
Museum, these latter having been prepared for him through the kind courtesy of
Professor Milne-Edwards.

   On Abnormal Forms of Ferns. By E. J. Lowe, F.B.S., F.L.S., F.G.S.

   This is a continuation of a paper read at Dundee. Wild varieties under cultivation
are less permanent than if plants are raised from the spores of their abnormal fronds.

It is possible to divide and subdivide a single frond into endless varieties of form,

and to change the character of their reproductive organs. The fifty illustrations
exhibited tell their own tale, and they are the result of the following experi-
ments :

   1st. Spores were sown from a normal frond, and every plant raised was normal.
   2nd. Spores were sown from a normal frond in the same seed from and in equnl
proportions with spores from an abnormal frond, and the result was that 90 per cent,
of the plants were abnormal.
   3rd. Spores were sown in separate pans from remarkably formed fronds, the
result being plants like the parent from which they were gathered.
    4th. Spores were sown from most singular-looking fronds, a dozen varieties
sown together, the result being a large number of remarkable varieties.
    5th. Spores were taken from a dozen of these most remarkable seedling forms,
and they were mixed together, the result being even more extraordinary. In this
experiment 4000 plants were raised, of which no two were precisely alike, and not
one was of the normal fonu.
    It has only been by mixing the spores of two or more varieties that the extraor-
dinary forms now exhibited have been obtained. It therefore seems to follow that
 spores mixed together produce different varieties to those sown separately.

spend a few daj's at numerous stations on the shores, at distances varying from ten

to fifty miles apart.

   The total number of species obtained, not including- Nudibranchiates, amounted
to about 818, of which Gl9 have been identified or described. In the list of named
species about 355 were not previously recorded as inhabiting the lied Sea, of which
53, including 3 genera, are new to science.

   In a recent work by Professor Issel, 640 species of MoUusca, including Nudi-
branchiates, are enumerated as the total number recorded from the lied Sea
(including some doubtful), of wliich 191 were collected by himself in the Gulf of

Suez.

   The extraordinary dissimilarity between the fauna of the Red Sea and of the
Mediterranean, which has been frequently noticed, appears to be confirmed by

further researches ; and although it is remarked by Issel that some of the Suez
species seem to be so nearly related to their representatives in the MediteiTanean

and Atlantic that they may easily be supposed to have been oiiginally the same,
and that their distinguisliiug characters may have been acquired during the series

of ages through which they Lave been separated, such species compose but a small
percentage of the whole, and it is by no means certain that more remote localities,

such as Japan and Australia, especially the former, do not fui-nish about as many

examples of relationship to the Em-opean fauna.
   The most important object of the report was to throw light upon the geogi'aphical

distribution of Mollusca ; but for this it would be required to publish at length the
list of the species with the other localities at which they are recorded to have been

found. It would then be shown that the number of Suez species common to Japan,
the Philippine Islands, Australia, the Sandwich Islands, &c., prove a much wider

distribution of the MoJlusca of the Pacific and Indian Oceans than of those of the

Atlantic, where the shores of America possess but few species in common with the
coasts of Europe and "West Africa. The fact of a species in several instances having

been obtained from only two localities very remote from each other, such as Suez

and Japan, is a proof of the very small amoimt of knowledge we possess of the

fauna of the intervening seas.

   The specimens were chiefly procured from water under 500 fathoms, off the coast
of Ireland. Amongst the few specimens of Nemerteans no new form occurs. The
Annelids are on the whole of a northern type, many of the race having been pre-
viously procured by Mr. Jeffreys oft' the Shetland Islands, and well known in the
northern seas generally. There were several new and most interesting species,
including a Sthenclais, a form allied to Lecmira, but probably requiring a new genus
for its reception, a Eunice, Kothria, and C'Ji(stoffone. The Antinoii sarsi of Kinberg
and the Pctfa pusilla of Malmgren were, besides, added to our fauna.

          On the Desert Flora of North America. By Dr. C. C. Paeey.

   The desert-tracts in North America, Ijdng het-ween 32° and 40° north latitude,
comprise a series of interior basins shut in by mountain-barriers from the moist
oceanic currents. These desert-districts, while vaiTing somewhat in their physical
features, owing to diiierences of elevation or geological structure, are characterized
by an arid climate, scanty rains, and i^ide extremes of heat and cold, both annual
and diurnal.

    In the lowest depressions the local drainage is collected in the form of salt lakes
or wide saline flats, the surplus water being lost by evaporation.

   In the desert vegetation there is a marked distinction between the annual and
perennial plants, the former being of slight texture, evanescent, and rapidly matm--
ing, the latter exhibiting scanty foliage, frequent spinescent branches, and large
tap-roots; the leaves are frequently coated with a copious resinous varnish, or
clotlied with a dense wooll}' tomentum, serving in either case to check growth.

   The list appended to this paper contained 188 species, of which Dicotyledons are
represented by 169 species, included in 48 natural orders and 144 genera. Mono-
cotyledons include 19 species, comprised in 4 natural orders and 10 genera. The
natural order Compositaj is represented by the largest number of species (44),
nearly one-fourth of the whole. Leguminosas, which includes most of the dwai'f
trees and larger shrubs, has 25 species.

The author stated that the Ebalia was dredged by ]Mr. Jeflreys ofl" Uust, Shet-

--land, in 1804, and that it difiered from all the other British Ebalias kno-um to him,

and then described it as follows : " The carapace is pale, with faint whitish-pink

blotches ; the slightly raised pink tubercles are surrounded by white rings, givhig
the carapace a mottled appearance. The first pair of legs are equal in length, short,

but very broad, the upper edges of the joints arched, with a sharp perfectly smooth

keel. The other feet are slender, faintly granulated, and, in addition, have on the

outer edges strong and long blunt spines ; the upper joints have each a single row

of C or 7,                                     the  two  next  generally  two  rows  each                      the  lowest  joint  pointed  and
                                                                                                            ;

smooth. These spines on the smaller legs, \f\\h. the very peculiar form of the

larger ones, are so marked that he felt justified in naming it Ebalia spiuosa. Should

it have been found in the Scandinavian seas and described, this name must then be

considered only provisional."

The leaves are, unlike those of other cresses, strictly compound, each leaflet being

jointed, and very apt to drop ofl" without decay or fading. They then act as seeds,

producing one or more little plants, and, like seed-leaves proper, waste away as the

embiyo thrives. The terminal leaflet often gives birth to tour or five plants ; in

one instance nine, in another ten were formed. This also takes place, without de-

tachment or extra moisture, even in the linear leaves high up the flowering stem.

The joints of the short petioles sometimes germinate too after the leaflets have

fallen. From observations without lens ("by the aid of the naked eye," Archer)

the radicle appears first, as a white thread ou the upperside of the leaf, the plu-

uiide being at first enclosed in a green transparent vesicle, which bursts like an

egg. The first plant always jjprings from the depression at the jimction of the

leaflet -^-ith its petiole, and those on the midrib precede the others, none ever ap-

pearing, as in BryojihjUum, on the outer edge. With this exception, the whole of

the upper surface seems to bristle with life at ever)^ point, ready to break out under

favourable circumstances. The phenomena may be promoted, and easily observed,

by laying the leaves, in various postures, on wet blotting-paper, lint, moss, &c. in

Aa dish, which shoukl be frequently sprinkled -wdth water.                                                          dried specimen of the

On certain Brinciples to he observed in the Establishment of a National Museum
              of Natural History. By P. L. Sclatee, M.A., F.R.S.

   It having been now finally determined that the natural-history collections of the
British Museum shall be removed from their present site to South Kensington, to
form the nucleus of a national museum of natural history *, it appears to me that
the principles upon which the proposed new institution are to be established and

conducted are well worthy of the special and most serious attention of the British

Association for the Advancement of Science. The inaugm-ation of a National Mu-

seum of Natural Plistory by one of the nations tliat have contributed most largely
to the advancement of the natural sciences is an event that is not likely to recm*

very often. If the opportunity thus presented be properly taken advantage of, and

the new institution started upon sound piinciples of administration and arrange-

ment, there can be no doubt that a most material impetus will be given to the pro-

gress of natural science in this country.

   Under these circumstances I think I need hardly apologize for troubling the Sec-

tion with a few remarks upon certain points which appear to me to be most essen-
tial to be observed in the establishment of a National Museum of Natural History.
These, I trust, will at all events provoke discussion, and induce some of the many

distinguished natvu-alists present at this_Meeting to turn theif attention to this most

important subject.

   The energies of our rulers, especially in these troubled times, are too fully occu-
pied with ordinary politics to allow them to bestow much care on such a matter,
and unless it be forced on their attention by the British Association, or in some

other authoritative manner, the result will be, I fear, that the sj'stem of adminis-

tration now followed in the British Museum as regards the Natural-History collec-

tions will be transplanted along -with the collections themselves, and the excellent

opportunity of a grand reform, which may never again present itself, will be utterly

wasted f.

   The remarks which I propose to offer to the Section on this subject may be

divided into three heads. First, I will say a few words concerning what appears

to me to be the best mode of government of the proposed National Museum of
Natural History ; secondly, I will speak of the form of building which in my

opinion ought to be adopted ; and lastly of the arrangement of the collections

within that building.

   I. Of the form of Government of the National Museum of Natural History.

myOn this part of           subject I shall        make but few remarks, having         regard    to the

fact that, in common with many other of my fellow naturalists, I strongly com-

mitted myself on this point some years ago, and have in nowise changed my views

since that period. In the memorial, of which I hold a copy in my hands, and which

was presented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1866, having been sig-ned by

25 leading members of the Royal, Linuean, Geological, and Zoological Societies, it

wiU be found to be stated that in our opinion the chief administration of the Na-

tional Museum of Natm-al History should be entrusted to one officer, who shall be

immediately responsible to some member of the Government. Those who are ac-

quainted with the present mode of administration of the natural-history collections

in the British Museum wiU, I am sure, readily agree to this proposed reform. It

Avill be recollected that the govei-mnent of the British Museum is vested by Act of

* On the 3rd of August last year a vote of £6000 was proposed in the House of Com-

mons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to clear the ground '' for the erection of a Natural-
History Museum " on the site of the International Exhibition at South Kensington, and

carried, after a division.

t  In the  '      bill  to  enable  the  Trustees  of  the British  Museum  to  remove  portions  of  their

collections," prepared and brought in by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1862, it was

proposed to be enacted that the trustees might remove the natural-history collections to

Sovith Kensington and certain pictures to the National Gallery. But, in a subsequent

clause, it was proposed to be added that " except in so far as was therein before expressed, Clo-

thing therein contained should affect the rights, 'powers, duties, or obligations of the trustees of
the British Museum.'" At that time, therefore, it was clearly intended to continue the rule

of the trustees over the natural-history collections when removed to South Kensington,
                                                                --

--124 REPORT 1870.

Parliament in a body of fifty trustees, consisting principally of great officers of state
and of nominees of certain families whose ancestors have contributed to the hetero-

geneous contents of that builduig. Aniougst these fiftj^ trustees there are but two

or three that are in any wise interested in natural history. Their secretary and

chief executive officer is the present principal librarian, with whose great literary

qualifications for his position every one is well acquainted, but who would not, I
am sure, claim for himself in any sense the name of a naturalist. It will thus be

seen that the actual government of om' natiu-al-histoiy collections is at present

vested in persons who have no special qualifications for the task. But, it may be

said, there is the superintendent of the natural-history collections, and the keepers

--of the various departments into which they are divided have they nothing to do

with the administration ? To this I reply, very little indeed, unless their advice

is asked, or unless they choose to offer it. And, in the latter case, the}' can only

address the trustees through the secretary, who is the only official present at the

meetings of the trustees, and in whose hands, therefore, the administration of the

natural-history collections is practically vested. This objectionable form of govern-

ment, we think, ought to be replaced by appointing a director of the proposed new
institution, " immediate^ responsible to one of the Queen's ministers." This simple

form of admiuisti'ation has been most successful in other scientific institutions,

such as the Kew Gardens and Herbarium and the Royal Obsenatory, and we be-

lieve it would be the best in the present case. It might, however, be advisable to

give the director of the National Museum of Natural Ilistory a board of advice,
composed of the heads of the principal departments into which the Museum is
divided. Or another mode of softening the despotism would be to appoint a boai-d

of visitors, consisting of distingmshed naturalists. These might be delegates from

whomthe principal scientific societies of the coimtry, each of  would be specially

bound to see that the particular branch of science to the advancement of wliich his

Society is devoted received its fair share of attention.

   As regards the subordinate appointments in the National ^Museum of Natural

History, these ought to be made, if not on the nomination of the director, at least

not without his fidl sanction and approval. The director, being held responsible

for the well-doing of the whole establishment, shoidd certainly be allowed to select

his own officers more or less directly. It is well known that some of the appoint-

ments made by the trustees in the departments of natural history in the Biitish
Museum have been, to say the least of them, in nowise felicitous, and that in one

case at least great public scandal has been caused by the notorious incompetence

of the person nominated. It is in vain to address remonsti'ances to a body of ir-

responsible trustees ; but if the director is required to sanction every nomination,

we shall know to whom to apply in case of any appointment not being up to the

mai-k,

       II. Of the form of Buildiiif/ of the National Museum of Natural History.
   In discussing the form of building best adapted for a great National Museum of

Natural History, let us begin by considering the principal classes of persons for
whose accommodation it is or ought to be constructed. These are :

   1. The public at large, who go there to get a more or less general notion of the

structure of natural objects and of their arrangement in the systema tiatures,

   2. The student who uses the Museum for scientific purposes.
   ·3. The officers of the institution, whose business it is to amass and arrange the

collections.

   In the opinion of most members of parliament, apparently especially of those who

represent metropolitan constituencies, the first of these three classes is that whose

accommodation ought to be first considered in the present case. In my opinion,

and probably in that of most of those here present, the NatioUtal Museum of Natural

History ought to be constructed primarily for the accommodation of the third of
the three classes ; for, unless the officers of the institution have ample space and

opportunity to examine and arrange the collection, it is obvious that neither the

public nor the special student can be benefited thereby. At the same time I do
not think that the public ought to be utterly excluded from their Museum four
days in every week, as is now the case j and I therefore put it forward as an axiom
         --

         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                         125

that some system of construction of tlie new Museum should be adopted whereby

the public can be admitted all day and every day to -view the collections without
interfering with the scientilic work of the establishment or with the special exami-

--nation of objects by students. Tliere is, so far as I know, only one plan by which

this object can be carried out namely, by arranging the exhibited objects in large
wall-cases, to which access is obtainable from the back by doors opening into

work-rooms adjoining the exhibition-room. In this way any ordinaiy object can

be removed out of the series into the adjoining work-room, and returned to its

place without disturbing the public in front of the cases, just as any article can be

taken out of the shop windows in Regent Street without interfering with those

who are looking into them from the pavement outside. This system of exhibition
would be attended by the further very great advantage that the glass cases may be

hermetically sealed on the side towards the public, and the ingress of dirt and

dust thus prevented. Those who are acquainted with the filthy state of the speci-
mens in the public galleries of the British Museum, in spite of frequent cleansings

inflicted upon them, will readily appreciate the merit of this plan*.

This collocation of the exhibition galleries and corresponding working-rooms being

insisted upon as of primary importance, the general form of the building must de-

Mypend somewhat upon the site on which it is to be placed.  own belief, however,

18 that a hollow square, or something approaching that form, will in many ways be

most convenient for a National Museum of Natural History, and the sketches

which I now exhibit, which have been prepared for me by my accomplished friend

Mr. Osbert Salvin, will serve to show the general plan of arrangement which I

propose. The building might be of three or four stories, since, in the system of
exhibition which I advocate, it would not be necessary to have top-lights. The
basement, which might be partly below the surface, would be dedicated to taxi-
dermy and to rooms for unpacking, storage, and mechanical work of all sorts. In

the outer galleries running round the whole length of the groimd story, I should

firopose to arrange the entire series of vertebrates from the highest mammal to the
 owest fish. The specimens, according to the system already spoken of, would be

placed in hermetically sealed glass cases along the inner walls of the galleries. The

inner series of rooms surrounding the interior of the hollow square would be the

working-rooms for the oflicers of the Museum and the students of natural history,

and would communicate with the glass cases on the inner side of the outer galle-

ries. Each set of working-rooms would, of course be in immediate apposition to

the glass cases containing the corresponding series of exhibited objects. TJie lights

to these working-rooms would be furnished from the inner sides of the hollow

square.

In the first story of the building I should propose to arrange the series of inver-

tebrate animals in exactly the same way, with the rooms for officers and students
immediately adjoining them on the inner side.

The third story might contain the botanical and mineralogical collections, and

perhaps certain others which it might not be possible to introduce into the general

series, imless room could be foimd for these collections in the second story.

   In a circular buUdiug, the centre of the hollow square, I should propose to place
the library above and lecture-theatre below. The libraiy might be connected by

light iron galleries with the different working-rooms, so that the students of every
department would have equally ready access to it.

   Such is a slight outline of the kind of building I would propose for a National

Museum of Natural History. It is, of course, a mere sketch, and there would be,
no doubt, many difliculties in the details to be surmounted, but none, I think, such
as an experienced architect would not be able to overcome. The advantages of

this plan would be :

   1, The Museum might be opened to the public eveiy day, without interfering

   * In an admirable article on tliis subject in ' K^ature' for May 26, 1870, Prof. Flower
has attributed the original invention of this mode of exhibition to myself, I liaving first

brought it under his notice. It appears, however, from a subsequent communication to
'Nature' by Prof. Flower (June 2, 1870), that the same plan had been already proposed by
Dr. Hooker in the ' Gardeners' Chronicle ' for 1858, p. 749. I can only, therefore, claim to
be an (not the) original inventor of this method of arrangement.

sent arrang^emeut, the collections are only open two or three days in the week,
during which scientific work is suspended, as regards all objects in the public

galleries.

than they are in cases opening in front.

                                                     Natural History.

   The remarks which I have already made under the previous head will have

served to show the Section that I am an advocate of what has been called the

" typical," but what it would be better, perhaps, to call the " representative

system of arrangement of the natural-history collections. Nor am I able to under-
stand how any reasonable person cau seriously maintain that eveiy object in a

National INIuseum of Natural History ought to be exhibited to the indiscriminating

public. In accordance with the views of the memorialists of 1858, who may be

considered as having inaugurated tlie reform in our natural-history collections which
1 hope to see shortly carried out, the collections should be primarily separated into
two series : («) objects for public exhibition; (6) objects for private study. The
class a, which is to be arranged in the public galleries behind the hermetically
sealed glass cases, should embrace a very full and well-selected series of represen-

tatives of the principal forms of every class. In some cases it may be necessary to

place in this category examples of every species of a group, in others only a selec-
tion of each genus or of each family. Every specimen exhibiting the external form

in this series should be carefully prepared and mounted in a natural attitude. The

representative species of the group having been selected, specimens of both sexes
and of all ages should be placed in the series, as likewise examples of variation, if

any such are knowai. The skeleton and other preparations of the internal structure
should be added, as also the eggs and nests in the case of birds, and examples of
corresponding structures in other classes. In short, the utmost endeavours should
be made to illustrate, by preparations, models, and drawings, the life-history of the
selected " representative ' in as complete a manner as possible. To every exhi-
bited specimen should Ido attached a printed label, giving its scientific and popular
name, locality, and origin, and some short explanation regarding its chief peculia-
rities and most noticeable points of interest. There can, I think, be no doubt what-
ever that a small but well-selected series of any branch of the kingdom of nature,
arranged after this method, would be of much greater interest and much more in-
structive to the public at large than ten times the number of objects arranged ac-

cording to the present fashion of the British ftluseum.

   On the other hand, the great mass of the collections (&) intended only for the

private examination of experts should be treated after a very different fashion. In
this division of the collections, the object is to arrange specimens in as small a
space as possible, and, at the same time, in the most convenient manner for easy

examination. The work-rooms immediately adjoining the part of the public gal-
leries appropriated to division a of any class, will, of course, be devoted to the re-

   A* great deal has been said by those who have advocated the retention of the natural-

liistory collections in their present site, about tlie importance of keeping up their conjunc-
tion with tlie National Library. It is, of course, obvious that their removal will necessi-
tate the acquisition of a special library of natural history for the new museum. I believe,
liowever, that a library of the kind, sufficiently comprehensive for all practical purposes,

can be got together without much difRcidty and at a comparatively small cost, and that,
when formed, it will be of much greater use for those working at tlie collections than the
present overgrown establishment at the British Museum. It must be also recollected that
the library of the British Museum is only available for the use of the officers. The books

cannot be brought to the specimens nor the specimens to the books by ordinary students.

ception of di\-ision b of the same class, so that the whole a and b, being separated

only by the partition -wall at the back of the glazed cases, -which will be pierced by
frequent doors, will practically form but one collection. In these work-rooms,
moreover, should be assembled together the whole of the specimens relating to the
particular class to which they are devoted. In the British Museum, according to
the present system, the mounted specimens are in one room, the skins in a second,
the skeletons in a third, and the spirit-preparations in a fourth. So that, in order

to make a complete examination of a small mammal, for instance, it may be neces-

sary to go to four or five different parts of the building, ranging from the galleries

to the cellars, and from the extreme north-east corner of the former to the furthest

south-west corner of the latter. In the new National Museum of Natural History,

it is to be hoped, this inconvenience will be remedied by the entire amalgamation
of the various collections of skins, mounted specimens, spirit-specimens, and skele-
tons into one uniform series. Besides the gi-eater convenience of this mode of
arrangement, another obvious advantage will be that the future student will be
induced to devote his attention rather to the whole structm-e of the organism than
to confine it to one particular part. If bird-cabinets were accompanied by skele-
tons and corresponding specimens in spirits, there can be no doubt that a much
more perfect system of ornithology than any that we have yet attained to would be

quickly arrived at. Our new National Museum must take the lead in this great

reform, and set an example to other collections. In the same waj^, as every natu-

ralist -nail allow, our conchological brethren will lose nothing by having the soft
bodies of the mollusca close at hand to aid them in their investigations on the form

of the external shell. There may be, of com'se, some exceptional cases in which

it will be practically impossible to adopt this course ; but, as a general rule, the

Erinciple should be insisted upon that every specimen, of whatever nature it may

 e, should be located in the rooms devoted to the reception of the class to which it
belongs, and should be placed as nearly as possible in immediate apposition to its

nearest natural allies.

   To carry out these principles to their legitimate issue, I do not hesitate to sup-
port the view put forward by Prof Flower and other naturalists, that the palseon-
tological department of the British Museum, as at present constituted, ought to be
totally abolished, and its contents distributed amongst the zoological and botanical
collections, so that extinct forms may be studied in association with their nearest
living representatives. The arguments in favour of this plan are, I think, unas-
sailable ; and although some little difliculties may be met with in carrying it out,

there are none, in my opinion, that may not be overcome by judicious treatment.

There is no doubt, I believe, that the progress of palreontology and palseophytology

has been much retarded by the neglect of the students of the extinct forms of animal
and vegetable life to make themselves sufiiciently acquainted with the structure of
the corresponding foinns now in existence. So long as fossils were looked upon

as the products of numerous successive and independent creations, there might

have been some excuse for this mode of dealing with them ; but now that we
regard animated nature, past, present, and future, as one and indivisible, now that
we acknowledge the stream of life, since its first appearance on this planet, to have

been unbroken and contimious, let us exhibit its products, whether existing or ex-
tinct, in one continuous and imbroken series. The structure of an extinct organism

can only be coiTectly understood after study of the nearest allies at present in ex-

istence. The best palaeontologist must be he that has deduced his knowledge of
extinct beings from comparison of their remains with the corresponding parts of
those now alive. Those who appreciate these truths will not fail to allow that
the proposed amalgamation of the paljeontological collection with the general series

in the new Museum of Natural History will be a decided step in advance, and one

imperatively called for in the present state of natm-al science.

   I have now, I think, touched upon some of the principal points on which changes
are required in our present system of treatment of the collections of natural history
belonging to the nation. It would be easy to go into further particrdars in which
reforms are needed. Especially I might call attention to the inadequacy in point
of numljers of the present staff' of oificers in some of the natural-history depart-
ments of the British Museum, the insufficiency of the yearly sum allowed for ac-

quisitions, the vexatious regulations concerning tlie examination of specimens, and
the miserahly insufficient accommodation for private study ; but all tliese things

·we may well hope to see altered in a new institution, and I will not take up time

by enlarging upon them. In conclusion, however, I will recapitulate the principal
topics touciied on in the following propositions, which I trust the members of the

British Association will agree with me in putting forward as the " platform " of

reforming naturalists.

   1. The administration of the new Museum of Natural History should be vested
in a director, who should be immediately responsible to one of the Queen's

ministers.

  --2. The collections should be primarily divided into two serieS; those intended

for public exhibition, and those reserved for private study.
   3. The collections for public exhibition should be arranged in their natural

order in one continuous series of galleries, so as to give the best possible general
idea of the principal forms of life and of their arrangement according to the natural
system.

   4. The collections for private study should be arranged in rooms immediately
adjacent to the public galleries, in such amanuerthat the corresponding portions of
them shovdd practically form but one series, and that the private student should
have access at all times to objects in the public galleries.

  A5. complete library of natural history should be furnished for the special use

of the institution, and be placed in some central portion of the building, equally

accessible to all departments.

   C. The collection of osteology, the spirit-preparations, the skins in store, the
series of British animals, the collection of " nests .and nidamental structures," and
all other subordinate collections should be amalgamated with the general series.

   7. The collections of the palajontological department shoidd likewise be amal-
gamated with the general series.

       The Natural History of Hainan. By Hobert Swinhoe, F.R.G.S.

   This is a sketch of the natural history of Hainan, based on the observations and
collections made by the author during his visit to the island, a narrative of which
was read before the Geographical Section. The botany, climate, and geology are
briefly touched upon ; tlien follow remarks on the mammals, birds, insects, and
shells which were collected, the affinities of the two former suggesting a wider
separation in former times of the island from the Chinese main and its closer con-
nexion with Cochin China.

                  On the Structure of the Shell in the Pearly Nautilus.

                        By Henry Woodward, F.G.S., F.Z.S.

    After referring to the great interest attaching to the KautiUdcp. on account of
 .heir vast geological and geographical range, the author proceeded to describe the
 shell with its septa and siphuncle, the latter being only found in the Cephalopoda,

 and nearly confined to the Tetrahranchiata. The camerated structure, however, is
found in many mollusca (as Spondyhts, Uuomphaliis, Vermctuft, &c.). The author
 suggested that if any incipient character could be found leading up, as it were, to
the siphuncle, wo might fairly infer that it was only a more highly differentiated
       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.     129

form of shell-growth. Such incipient structure occurs in Ostraa, in which the
shell-muscle (in aged individuals) dips down from layer to layer, offering a rough
approximation to the siphuncle in Atiiria. Mr. '^^^^odward described the structure
of the shell, and showed by actual dissection that no vascular system exists con-
necting the shell with the animal by means of the siphuncle. The siphuncle
proves upon examination only to be a thin pearly tube, within which is another,
composed of an extension of the periostracum, and quite destitute of structure.
Shell-structure proves, when once formed, to be dead matter destitute of change,
save where actually in contact with the mantle of the animal, which alone can add

to or repair the shelly covering.

A Statement in rephj to the two Objections of Professor IfiLvle;/ relative to

        certain Experiments. By H. Chaelton Bastian-, M.D., F.R.S.

The objections raised by Prof Huxley, in his Inaugural Address, against certain

experiments bearing on the possibility of the genesis of living things from not

living materials were two in number. One was an objection of a practical cha-

racter, and another purely theoretical. The former was to the effect that the very

fact of its heing possible to preserve meats of all kinds for years, by adopting

almost exactly the same process as that which had been employed in these expe-

riments, was of itself evidence sufficiently strong to excite a doubt as to whether

there was not some source of error in these experiments, even though it had not

hitherto been detected. The results of some inquiries which the author has since
made show, however, that whUe the meats are subjected to a much higher tem-

perature than had been supposed (this, too, for a prolonged period), organisms

are to be met with even in provisions obtained from the most approved sources,

and sold as "perfectly good" (see 'Nature,' Nos. 47 & 48). But although the

·quality of the provisions may not be affected by the presence of these organisms,

the objection which was urged against such experiments as those of the author

must lose its value, especially when the fact is also borne in mind, and which

was freely confessed to him by one of the best preparers of these preserved meats,

that in a certain number of the failures which occur, the cause of the putrefaction

or mouldiness cannot be accounted for. In many cases the obvious failures are

due to defective closure of the tin case in which the provisions are enclosed ; but in
certain of the failures, of course few in number, neither this nor any other cause

of failure could be ascertained. The author then proceeded to consider the second

or theoretical objection which had been started. Does it not seem almost incredi-

ble, Prof Huxley asks, that the living things which are now supposed to be

J>roduced de novo] should be, in most cases, almost precisely similar to the lower
 brms of life which are ordinarily met with in organic infusion ? Theory seemed

only capable of being met by theory, and he claimed that in the consideration of

such a question as this, which was admitted to be still an open one, the advocates

of either of the two opposing views must not strongly urge an objection which,

though it might be good and valid if all the world thought with him, would turn

out to be not valid at all if the views of his opponents were correct. The author

accordingly contended that although it might be extremely difficult, almost im-

possible, to explain the coincidence above referred to if eveiy living thing did

really originate from a preexisting living thing, the objection, on the other hand,

80 far from bein^ an objection, was in reality only what might have been expected

if the views which he and others hold are really true. He then pointed out why

he thought that if living matter could arise independently of preexisting living

matter, it would be only reasonable to suppose that such new-born living matter
would not only be as plastic and modifiable as the lowest known living things are

now admitted to be, but capable of rapidly going through even gi-eater changes

than are at present recognized. This being the case, from his point of view, a

similarity between the developmental forms resulting from new-born living matter

and the organisms usually met with in infusions was only what might have been

expected. Our present state of knowledge does not permit us to say which or

130 REPORT--1870.

what combination of the physical influences now existing is most potential in

bringing about the supposed transition from the not living to living modes of com-

bination ; and therefore it is impossible to say how far the apparent very great

difi'erence in condition in certain of these experiments ought to have left its im-

pression upon the living things met with. If we could only be as sure of starting
with materials of precisely the same molecular composition, which, however, was
impossible, the author was inclined to believe that we might be able to procure
definite kinds of organisms, almost as surely as we could now produce different
kinds of crystals. He afterwards fully discussed the various possibilities of error
in his own experiments, and gave reasons why he thought that none of these
sources of fallacy had existed in four of his ovra. experiments which were made in

concert with Dr. Frankland.

On the TJieory of Natural Selection looked at from a Matliematical Point of

              View. By Alfred W. Bennett, M.A., B.Se., F.L.S.

   The author gave in his adhesion to that portion of the Darwinian theory which
maintains the evolution of species from a common ancestry, but held that that
part of the hypothesis which regards natural selection as the prime agent in bring-
ing about these changes rests on a much more debateable basis. The title of Mr.
Darwin's great work, ' The Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection,' is
itself a misnomer, since it only attempts to account for the survival and pei-pe-
tuation of certain among a number of " spontaneous " variations. Taking the re-
markable facts of mimetism, so largely insisted on by Darwinian writers as a
bulwark of their theory, the author luaintained that this explanation really breaks

down at the outset. Two points admitted by all advocates of the principle of na-

tural selection are, that it always acts with extreme sloAvness, and that every step
must be directly of advantage to the species which simulates the outward form of
some other species, or of some inanimate object. Proceeding on this basis, and apply-
ing mathematical calculation to the solution of the problem, it was attempted to be
shown that the earlier steps in the transformation cannot have occurred through
the operation of natural selection, because they must be entirely useless to the
individual, and that the chances against the accumulation of a sufficient approxi-
mation towards the species ultimately mimicked, on which the principle of na-

tural selection could operate, is something like ten millions to one, even when
every advantage is thrown into the scale of the natural selectionist. The author
then proceeds to show that even Mr. Darwin does not claim for the principle of
natural selection the origination of the tendency to variation which is the

foundation of all differentiation of species on the hypothesis of evolution. Since,
therefore, some other principle, at present xuiknown to us, originates these varia-

tions, what right have we to say that this principle then ceases to act, instead of

being the main agent in all the other subsequent changes ? Of the laws of va-
riation, Mr. Dai-wiu says, our ignorance is profoimd. The paper then points out
the remarkable analogy that exists between the exhibition of the phenomena of
mimetism and the development of instinct. Both faculties are absent in the
whole of the vegetable kingdom, very feebly apparent in the Protozoa and Coelen-
terata, but slightly in the MoUusca, appear with extraordinary perfection in the
Insecta and Arachnida, are comparatively in abeyance among the Pisces and Rep-
tilia, and again strongly developed in the Aves. This parallelism would appear
to indicate a closer connexion between mimicry and instinct than has been
generally supposed. One of the founders of the theory of natural selection, Mr.
A. R. Wallace, displays, in his recently published volume of ' Contributions to the
Theory of Natural Selection,' a strange want of faith in his own principle, by
denying its potency in the case of the evolution of man from the lower animals,
and even in producing the different races of mankind. The same luws, the writer
thinks, must be supposed to govern the whole organic world ; and if some other
principle, connected with man's reasoning powers, must bo looked for to account
for his raising himself from the brutes, the same principle, connected with the
instinct of animals, must be applied to accoimt for their power of developing new

species adapted te the circumstances of their environments. In corcl'-ision, the

author considered that although the discoveiy of the law of natural selection
marked an era in the history of natural science, and gave a wonderful impulse lo

original research, the danger now is that the law will be pressed into services

which have no claim upon it, and that iu the hands of injudicious partisans it will
become a hindrance rather than an aid to science, by closing the door against
fm-ther investigations into other laws which lie behind it.

On Protoijlasm and the Germ Theories. By Gilbeet W. Child, M.A., F.L.S.

   After an examination of the various germ theories which had been put forward,
the author said it appeared to him that abiogenesis in some form or another was a
necessary consequence of certain other theories which were gaining groimd at the
present moment, by the Darwinian hypothesis and the theory of evolution. It

was hardly conceivable that we could theoretically hold that the original simple

forms from which the whole animal and vegetable world had been developed, had

sprung into existence out of the regvdar order of the evolution of the universe. What

was called the germ theory of disease threw an interesting light on the question.
Zymotic diseases were now generally believed to result from the multiplication and

reproduction of germs in the blood of the man or animal affected. The matter to
be accounted for was how the disease-germ appeared, disappeared, and afterwards

again cropped up in the same district at great intervals of time. If the old theories
were to be maintained in their entirety as to the fixity of species, every one of
these diseases must have existed somewhere from the begimiing. That was a view

which was hardly credible, but it was held nevertheless. On the other hand, the

hypothesis of the evolution of these germs de novo, by abiogenesis, would
account for such phenomena in an intelligible manner. In conclusion, the writer
was far from thinking that abiogenesis is proved to take place at the present
time. His own experiments, published in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,'

I860, did not pretend to prove this. It is quite possible, and indeed probable,
that the small moving masses of protoplasm found by Dr. Beale and himself in
his experimental vessels might, as suggested by the President in his Address, have
resisted the boiling temperature to which the contents of those vessels had been
subjected. If this were so, it no doubt nullified the evidence of those experinients

so far as they tended towards the solution of the main question at issue ; but if so,
it equally nullified the evidence of M. Pastem-'s researches, on which the opponents

of the doctrine of abiogenesis rested their case. The latter were therefore re-
duced to this dilemma, either these minute organisms which were found in the

experiments of the writer and others can withstand the boiling temperature, or
they cannot. In the former case, there is no evidence left on either side ; in the

latter they must have been produced by abiogenesis.

On some of the more Im])ortant Facts of Sitccession in Relation to any Theory

of Continuity. By Dr. Cobbold, F.B.S., F.L.S.

The author remarked that for several years past the Biological Section had per-

mitted, if it had not actually encouraged, the reading of papers on the theory of

natural selection. The facts he had here selected for exposition were such as

represented what might be termed the apparent chronology of the organic series,

or, in other words, the ascertained times of the coming and flourishing of the larger

Aanimal gToups.  true conception of what was or ought to be understood by the
-- --expression " equivalencies " botanical, zoological, or geological lay at the basis

of a correct appreciation of the sig-nificance of the records of animal, vegetable, or

sedimentary rock distribution throughout all time. Further, he ventured to assert

that the gi'andeur of the formative scheme of Nature, whether testifjing to an

evolutionary method of production or to a series of creative acts, few or many in

number, could only be adequately realized by the naturalist whose powers of allo-

cation and gi'ouping enabled him to grasp the import of those relations. He then

proceeded to deal with tlie facts of succession, describing the various known groups,
and glancing at the times of origin and succession of the placental mammals, say-
ing the first thing that the record suggested was the rapidity with which the most
divergent groups made their appearance. Of course there was no real basis for an
assumption of coeval creation. It might be held, on zoological groimds, that we
ought not to separate men and monkeys, but retain them as one under the
ordinal title of Primates. He adopted the division of the placental series of
Mammalia into twelve groups, not from any rigid belief as to their separate

equivalencies, but because they were sufficiently distinctive for practical purposes,
and form on the whole perhaps the fairest expression of grouping which our
science could at present afford. After dwelling at great length upon the suc-
cession of the various groups, he stated that as regarded the highest of all, the
placental division, lie would only say that, as he understood the doctrine, the
strictest demand of the development theory did not require, as was commonly sup-
posed, a lineal descent as between Bimana and Quadrumana ; but it was certainly

held that either of these groups, as we now know them, might have been sepa-

rately evolved from more generalized primatal types, the intermediary terms being

possibly connected by a long antecedent and far more generalized common proge-
nitor. In that connexion the most advanced evolutionist must own that the as-

sumedly missing tertiary primatals constituted a great and natural bar to the

popular acceptance of the theory of descent by natural selection. On the other
hand, a multitude of considerations seemed to him to outweigh all the data thrown

into the anti-continuity side of the balance.

On the Development of Germ-life. By Dr. P. Ceace-Calyekt, F.R.S., F.C.S,

The author has been engaged during the last twelve months in a series of re-

searches with the view of determining if the germs of fermentation and putre-

faction can be carried any distance from their source of production by a current of

atmospheric air, and communicate their decomposing action to a fluid suscep-

tible of undergoing a similar change. To answer this question, he has made many

experiments, but will now only give the following details.

The first question was, what apparatus should be employed to deprive atmo-

spheric air of the germs it contains.

  He passed slowly (during four hours) a gallon of air first through a tube 2 feet

in length, filled with cotton-wool, and then through another tube, 6 inches long,

filled with small fragments of pumice-stone heated to redness.

Secondly, air was passed through the same length of cotton-wool, and then

through 18 inches of red-hot pumice-stone. The two bulks of air thus purified

were made to bubble slowly into pure water, deprived of animal or vegetable
Alife,
        drop of each of the fluids was examined under a microscope of 800

diameters, and the following results were obtained :

   Having thus found the method of depriving atmospheric air of its life, he em-
ployed the same purified air to ascertain if he could, as stated above, convey by

a current of it the germs produced in one mass of matter into another. To effect
this, the purified air was made to bubble through a pint of iiuid in an active

state of alcoholic fermentation, one of acetic fermentation, one of butyric, and in
one containing putrid meat. The results were, that a very small quantity of life
was observed under the microscope after several hours in pure water, weak sugar
or albumen solution through which the air from the alcoholic or acetic fermentatiA'e
fluids had passed ; but it was in large quantities in the albumen solutions, in which
the air had previously bubbled through the putrid fluid and butyric ferment,
thus showing that the germs belonging to the vegetable kingdom cannot be con-
veyed any distance by air in motion, whilst those of the animal kingdom are easily

carried.

   There are many experiments which the author intends publishing, but he
limits himself to record only one, in consequence of the light it throws on many of

the results published of late on spontaneous generation, viz. that if the albumen
of a newly laid egg is mixed with pure distilled water free from life, and the
whole exposed to the atmosphere for half an hour, life will be observed, and in an
hour or two mycrozyma and vibrios will be found in considerable quantities;
therefore no experiment as to the existence of life in fluids is of any value except

when air has been excluded, and that the fluid intended for examination has not

been exposed for a short time to the atmosphere.
   The author hopes shortly to present to the Iloj'al Society papers on the " Te-

nacity of Microscopic Life," "The Special Germs of Putrefaction," "Sponta-
neous Germination,' and, lastly, "On the Germ Theories of Contagious and In-

fectious Diseases."

   The author discussed at length the present position of the controversy on hetero-
wenesis, or the supposed creation of the lowest form of plants and animals de novo.

He first refeiTed to the theological bearing of the subject, which he believed to be

overrated. But the author expressed his opinion, resulting from experiments and
observations which extended over a long series of years, that those who prefer to
adopt the theory of the creation of living forms only from germs ah'eady in ex-

istence would eventually find their view to be correct. He then proceeded to con-
sider the recent experiments of Dr. Bastian, who believes that he has not only been

able to create " protoplasm " by the combination of inorganic materials, as it was
hinted possible some time since by Professor Huxley, but that under his hands
there had been spontaneously produced from inorganic materials, combined in a
manner circumstantially described by him, "truly organized plants and small ciliated
infusoria." The author first criticized the terms in which Dr. Bastian had de-
scribed the results of his experiments, characterizing them as vague, and giving

instances of the vagueness. Then he showed how some of them were absolutely
adverse to Dr. Bastian's own hypothesis ; and finally he proceeded to describe at
length a number of experiments of his own, made in June, July, and August last,
and to compare them with notes of a series of experiments tried by him in 1863,

which left little doubt on his mind that the plant types (mildew or mould) believed

by Dr. Bastian to have been spontaneously produced in infusions, really spring from
atmospheric germs, which, in some instances, become developed in the open air
upon bare rocks and stones, but which the author showed to be present in rain-
water fallen from the clouds, and in distilled water exposed to the air. The result

--of his experiments may be thus briefly epitomized : In IS&i the author found the

same plant types (various stages of mildew) in infusions of orange-juice, cabbage-
juice, and pure distilled water exposed to the air; and during the past summer ho
again found the identical types in infusion of orange-juice, and in water caught in a

shower of rain. At both periods, too, he found low animal types in the atmosphere.

--The author concluded his paper as follows : " Here I leave to the judgment of

men of science the results of my experiments, which any boy possessed of a micro-
scope may repeat as effectually as I have performed them. And if the believers in

spontaneous generation still insist that their hypothesis has not been refuted, and

mythat, assuming  observations to be correct, their view of the case has not been

fiilly disproved, I am not prepared to deny this ; but, on the other hand, I must be

permitted to retort that their experiments have only proved, so far, their inability,

notwithstanding- all their precautions, to exclude invisible germs from their infu-

sions. As to the mysterious appearance of these microscopical types on their solu-

tion ill vacuo, what is it compared with the presence of some of the internal para-

sites of man and the lower animals ? and who would have credited twenty years

since the story of the wanderings and metamorphoses which those forms undergo

before they find their way into the final habitat designed for them by nature ?

There is, however, very little chance of the controversy coming to an end at present.

It is fascinating and sensational, and so far quite in accordance with the spirit of the

age. Nor is it desirable that it should cease, for it is causing microscopical obser-

vers to direct their attention more and more to the beginnings of life and to the

development of these living types, which are visible only with the aid of the lens 5

and I know of no subject more worthy of the consideration of biologists."

On the Scientific Value of Physical Beauty. By Feederic T. Mott, F.Ii.G.S.

   The purpose of this paper was to point out the connexion between the compara-
tive beauty of objects and their rank in the scale of nature ; to show that beauty is
not bestowed capriciously, but has always a scientific meaning ; that it is the index
of maturity, of climax, of perfected function, and ought to be taken into account as
such in every system of classification. The connexion between beauty and matu-
rity was illustrated by natural facts, and a theoretic reason for it was suggested.

              Contribution to the Migration Theory. By Dr, Caton.

   This paper contained the results of a series of experiments on the phenomena of
inflammation as seen in the transparent membranes of fishes and batrachians,
chiefly in reference to the migration of blood-cells from the vessels, described by
Addis'on and Waller, and more recently by Professor Cohnheim.

   In the experiments on the frog the migration of colourless corpuscles was seen
to take place from the vessels of the mesentery, though not in every instance. In
the fish, notwithstanding close observation, the escape of blood-cells was never
seen. Pus-cells were apparently formed in the tissues during acute inflammation.
It was observed that venous congestion did not occm- to the same extent as in

--bati-achians and mammals, possibly accounted for by the venous character of the

heart in the fish. In the tadpole migration was seen to take place with the greatest
activity whenever any considerable congestion occun-ed. In fishes and batrachians
alike it was found that yeneral fever caused the deposit of white blood-cells along
the walls of vessels ; and if, as in bati'achiaus, great congestion subsequently oc-
curred, the cells in contact witli the wall were seen to migrate, the more readilj' if

the wall of the vessel were thin and delicate, as in the tadpole.

   On the whole it seemed probable that congestion was the main cause of cell-

migration, and that the question whether red or white cells escaped depended
merely on the one or the other being in contact with the wall of the congested
vessel. Pus-cells appeared not to originate entirely from migrating blood-cor-
puscles ; indeed it seemed possible that the two had no connexion with one another,

and were mwely accidentally associated : for in these experiments pus-cells had been

produced where there was no migration ; and, on the other hand, blood-cells were
seen actively migi-ating where all local inflammation had heen carefully avoided.

   The author called attention to a microscopic preparation from Mr. Dallinger's

cabinet marked " Hydatid from the Human Brain." It was clearly a cysticercus,

diflering, however, as regards its hooks, from the ordinary measle infesting man

and the pig. At first sight its appearance reminded him of Dr. Weinland's Ci/s~

ticei'cus acanthotrias, as given in his ' Beschreibung zweier neuer Tsenioiden aua

Adem Menschen,' a commimication published in 1851.  further examination

would be necessary before finally pronouncing upon this point; but he was in-

clined to regard Dr. Weinland's triple-crowned cysticercus as a variety of a

hitherto imdescribed tapeworm, of which this specimen was the true normal

representative in the larval state. At all events, it was a distinct form of armed

cysticercus from the human brain, having been originally sent to Mr. Dallinger by

a student at St. Bartholomew's Hospital.

Reniarls on the Heart of a Chinese Dog containing Hcematozoa, received from

    F.L.S.

   The author exhibited the heart in question, and gave an account of the zoological

position and afiinities of its contained nematode parasites. He remarked on the

endemic character of the helminthiasis thus set up amongst the dogs of China,
adding that the animal in question had, according to Mr. Swinhoe, "died at

Shanghae in the month of April 1869, after three days of great sufiering." He

referred to similar preparations in the possession of Prof. Bennett of Edinburgh,

and the Cui-ators of the Museum of the Army Medical School at Netley. He dis-

puted the question of its identity with M. Bohe Moreau's so-called Spirojdera
sanguinolenta, showing also that it had no genetic relation to the Filaria papillosa
hcematica of Messrs. Grube and Delafond. The author had already discussed the
probable nature of these latter haematozoa in his memoir " On the Prevalence of
Entozoa in the Dog," first communicated to the Linnean Society,

   The author commenced by a reference to the researches of Bilharz, Giiesinger,
Leuckart, Weinland, and Harley in reference to this parasite, and remarked upon
the severe endemics occasioned by its prevalence in Egypt, at the Cape, and at the

Mam-itius. He himself had first discovered this parasite in England when dis-

secting an African monkey which had died at the Zoological Society's menagerie,
Regent's Park. The grounds on which he had altered the generic title (from

Didoma to Bilharzia) were recognized as just, both abroad and at home. He had

fully investigated the characters presented by the eggs, their contained embryos,
mode of egress, movements, alterations of form, rapid growth, structm-e, behaviour

under reagents, and various other particulars. He had likewise sought to rear
them in slugs, insect-larvse, Entomostraca, Gammari, and various fishes. From a

patient under his care the author procured at least 10,000 eggs daily ; and from

these he reared ciliated cone-shaped embryos not unlike those of the common fluke-

                 Oil the Connexion of tJie Hi/oid Arcli with the Cranium,

                          B>j Professor W. H. Flo^\-ee, F.E.S.

   In tlie sheep, as is well known, the anterior arch or cornu of the hyoidean appa-
ratus is described as consisting of three hones, of which the uppermost is by far
the largest and most important, and has received the name of stylo-hyal. This
bone is long, compressed, and at the proximal end enlarges and divides into two
short branches^ by the anterior of which it is continued as a cartilaginous band to
the cranium. The upper end of this band is again ossified in the form of a curved
cylindrical plug of bone, with a truncated lower extremity, lying in a groove ou
the side of the tympanic bone, the edges of which groove meet around it in adult
animals, aud often become anchylosed with it ; but this is only a secondary con-
nexion. The primary connexion is with the periotic or petro-mastoid bone, imme-
diately in front and to the inner side of the stylo-mastoid foramen. In embryonic
specimens it can be traced as a distinct band of cartilage lying to the anterior aud
inner side of the lower end of the Fallopian aqueduct, and passing to the upper
and back part of the tympanic cavity, near to the spot from which the stapedius
muscle takes origin. This is, then, the true proximal extremity of the anterior arch

of the hyoidean apparatus, if we leave out of consideration the stapedius and incus,

--which, there is reason to believe, are developed from the same rod of cartilage

question which is not discussed in the present communication. Whatever may be

the case with regard to the origin of the last-named parts, it is a subject of easy
demonstration that in the sheep there is an ossified portion of the upper end of the
hyoid arch, above and distinct from the stylo-hyal, which becomes firmly united

with the periotic, and which may ossify either from a separate centre, or by ex-

tension of bone from the periotic. "Whether it should be considered as a process

of the periotic, or as a separate element, may still be a matter of opinion ; but the

existence of such a part as a distinct portion of the hyoid arch requires recognition.

It may be conveniently distinguished by the name of tympano-hnal, as it is always

in relation with the tympanic bone^ and continues the hyoid arch up to the wall
of the cavity of the tj-mpanum.

    This portion of the skull can be distinctly recognized at the spot indicated (»'. e.

to the anterior and inner side of the stj'lo-mastoid foramen) in almost aU mammals,
though in Aery different degrees of development, usually in accordance with the
size and amount of ossification of the remainder of the anterior arch. Thus, in
those of the Ungulata, as the ruminants, and especially the horse and rhinoceros,
in which the stylo-hyal is very largely developed, the tympano-hyal is most con-
spicuous ; but where, as in the pig, the anterior arch is little ossified, the tympano-
hyal is comparatively rudimcntaiy. In the Cetacea it is quite distinct, though
small, and a fine band of cartilage can often be traced from the upper end of the
stylo-hyal into it, imbedded in the great ligamentous mass wliicii attaches that
bone to the exoccipital and surroimding parts of the cranimn, and which of course

is only a secondaiy connexion.

   In man this bone or process is also quite distinct, although it seems to have

been generally confounded with the stylo-hyal. The so-called styloid process of
the temporal bone has long been known to have a separate centre of ossification,

and is also generally recognized as the homologue of the stylo-hyal of other mam-

mals, one of the main points of difl'erence being, that whereas in all others it is an

independent bone not connected directly with the cranium, in man it is always

anchylosed to the " temporal," and forms a process of the skull.

   If a human skull at the period of birth is examined, a very small round piece

of bone sm-rounded by a deep groove can be seen exactly where the tympano-hjal
is foimd in the sheep, just behind the posterior limb of the inverted arch fonned
bj' the tv-mpanic bone, and in front and to the inner side of the stylo-mastoid
foramen. This increases somewhat in size as age advances, fomiing a distinct
process, supported and partly embraced in front by the vaginal process of the
tympanic. The true styloid or stylo-hyal at birth is a slender rod of cartilage,
often partially ossified in the centre, and invested by a strong fibrous sheath, from
which the stylo-hyoid, stylo-glossus, and stylo-pharyngeus muscles take origin.
 Thou.a-h it occasionally becomes anchylosed in the adult with the tjTnpano-hyal, as

is the case with those skulls which haA-e very long styloid processes, this does not
occur so frequently as is described in most works on anatomy. In the large
majority of skulls,"before middle age, the stylo-hyal is free, and is commonly lost
in maceration. The short process which is always present, and which is com-

monly considered as a riidimentaiy styloid process, is really a distinct portion of
the hyoid arch, corresponding with the tympano-hyal of the sheep.

   The commimication was illustrated by specimens and diagxams.

On the Correspondence between the Anterior and Posterior Kvtremit)/, and the

  Modifications of the Position of the Limbs in the higher Vertebrata. By

   Professor AY. H. Floater, F.R.S.

This communication was chiefly devoted to an exposition, by means of speci-

mens and diagrams, of the views held by most English anatomists of the serial

homologies of the diflerent bones of the extremities, founded upon comparison

of the anterior, cephalic, or preaxial border of the one, in the primitive position,

with the same border of the other, which leads to results opposed to the Adews

of Wyman and other American anatomists, founded upon the principle of antero-

posterior symmetry.         '

In this paper the author defended the teleological method of studying anatomy,

as having led to many discoveries, and as the life-spring of much of its interest,
Aat the same time deprecating a nil-admirari mood in these researches.
                                                                                                                      teleo-

logical explanation is not " a pretty golden ball to divert the racer from his

course," but rather a golden thread to be traced throughout. He considers it

legitimate to compare limbs &c. with an ideal exemplar, whether we adopt the

apophysar origin for them or not. AVith respect to the latter theory he inquires.

If the' anterior limb is a dependence of the occipital vertebra, of which particular

one is the posterior ? He would rather refer a limb to several vertebra (to five,

perhaps), from their divisions and nerves of supply. He thinks the more multi-

plied rays of the fin of the skate but show a relationship to the Sepia ; and, indeed,
in the inollusks generally there is more of a gradation to the vertebrate skeleton
than is conmionly supposed. The abdominal fins of thoracic fishes are, however,
as much removed forwards as the fore limbs of mammalia are backwards on the

apophysis theory.

   FcAv animals retain the most normal disposition of their limbs, the extensors all

external, the flexors all internal, or in human anatomy anterior ; some climbing
animals, as the sloth or the seal, do so more than most ; also man when he clasps
or climbs, or more imperfectly, in his hind limbs, when he sits in the oriental

fashion. An eversion has commonly occun-ed in the upper or fore extremity, an

opposite inversion in the lower. In cursorial animals the former is compensated

for by a pronation in the lower part of the limb ; a still greater pronation in the
mole causes the olecranon to point upwards, and the palm to be turned outwards,

as it is in man in swimming. Few animals below the monkeys probably can

supinate the hand; the squiiTcl does it from the wrist- and finger-joints. The
author is disposed to agree with those who make the iliac fossa to coiTCspond

cranon, and the origin of the tiiceps in the upper, but not the groin to the axilla.

138 REPORT 1870.

   When we reflect on the situation of the arteries of the upper and lower extre-

--mities, we notice that at first sight they disagree with the above views, that is, in

the upper part of the limbs, the brachial artery being on the flexor, whilst the

femoral is on the extensor aspect. For the artery of the thigh to be analogous to
that of the upper arm, the popliteal should be a continuation of the ischiatic, and

not of the femoral ; and it is so in the fowl : in man also the ischiatic passes

through the meshes of the lumbo-sacral as the brachial does through the brachial

plexus. For the representative of the femoral artery in the arm we must fix pro-
bably on the acromial or some other of the higher branches. The direction in

which the main vessels emerge from the trunk accounts for this.

   The above is a plan of the supposed homologies in the upper muscles of the
limbs. The short abductors are only present in the lower extremity, and then
most developed when the cervix femoris is longest and abducting force required.
The deltoid is peculiar to the upper limb with the clavicle and acromion, this
muscle agreeing with the iliacus and psoas only in its insertion between the ex-
tensors and flexors, but rather to be considered as belonging to the same category

as the trapezius. This last is a protractor, whilst the lower parts of the latissimus
dorsi and pectoralis major, or those parts continuous with the inner portion of tlieir

duplicated tendons, are its antagonists or retractors. The sartorius and gxacilis

appear the solo representatives of the tripartite deltoid, their insertion distant, but

prseaxial, between the flexors and extensors.

   With respect to the innervation of the two limbs, it appears that each set of

--muscles, flexoi's, or extensors is supplied by nerves corresponding that is, that no

nerve to a flexor supplies an extensor. The median and ulnar nerves in the arm
are purely flexor, the musculo-spiral extensor. The flexors have their supply espe-
cially from the fore part of the brachial and great sciatic plexuses, the extensors

from the back, and pronators and adductors may be arranged with the former,

supinators and abductors with the latter ; the extensor nerves also being uiostly
given oft" high up, as are the origins of these nmscles. The musculo-spiral in the
arm represents the anterior crural in the leg, plus what answers to the peroneal, or
part of it ; in fact the musculo-spiral supplies all the extensors of the upper extre-

mity, the anterior crural only those of the thigh, the peroneal lielping it out in the
leg," but sometimes arising high up in the plexus rather than in the middle of the

thigh. The peroneal muscles in man are but partially extensors, but their tendons
in some animals pass before the fibula. The pectoral nerves answer to the obtu-
rator, though the latter passes to its destination difterently from what the pectorales

--do of necessity, from the suppression of the fore part of the shoulder-girdle.

Similar reasoning applies to the course of the musculo-spiral. The gluteal and

subscapidar draw from all the roots of the plexus, and any diftereuce is only
apparent. Tlie several nerves of the latissimus dorsi and gluteus maximus also

correspond.

   In many animals the resemblance between the front and hind limbs is gi'eater
than in man ; the differences are, as already in some measure sliown, of an adaptive
nature, especially in the osseous and muscular parts. In the fore limb we have a

more varied volitional impulse, extensive pronation and supination, the opposable

thumb, a more intricate nervous plexus for the combination and separation of

nervous influence, more easy to suppose in its details than to prove ; the general

arrangement of the body and the relations of trunk and limbs account for other

Howdifferences, as the course of the vessels.  these modifications in the instance

of limbs, and generally in natm-e, are brought about seems a mystery : it is allow-

able to doubt whether it is either by the gradual modifying action of external

influences or by natural selection, or both together ; and also allowable to believe

that a species remains for ever the same till destroyed by adverse circiuustances,

and becoming the progenitor of other species by some unlcnowu law of progression

or development, connected probably with reproduction, and causing their sudden

rather than gradual advent on the earth.

Albumen and its Transformation into Fibrin by the Arjency of Water.

                           By John Goodman, M.D.

The author asserted that albumen is known as the pabulum vitcs, a substance into

which all foods are said to be transformed by the digestive process. It is denominated

the " raw material " from which all organic animal structures are ultimately formed,

and abounds in the sanguineous and lymphatic systems. Yet albumen is not capable

of giving general nutriment unless it be first transformed into organized mate-

Nowrial.  that organized substance is fibrin. It is formed out of and at the

expense of the existing albiunen, and composes the white corpuscles of the lymph-

and blood- and chyliferous vessels, and is found to constitute almost the entire

mass of the organism. It supplies waste of tissue, is employed in the nutrition,

growth, and reparation of the organism and in the reproduction of the species, and

is vitally necessary for the performance of all the functions of the body. The trans-

formation, therefore, of albumen into fibrin is a process of essential importance in

tlie sustentation and maintenance of vitality itself; as necessary, indeed, as is the

transformation of the inorganized substances of nature into the organized pro-

ducts of the vegetable kingdom, for the supply and sustenance of man and animals.

Although this transformation is of such vital import, and these two substances are

evidently dissimilar in their appearance and character, hitherto chemical science

has been imable to discover any very clear and satisfactory distinction in their

elementary composition ; nor can the most able physiologist more than guess at

the mode and means by which fibrin is developed in the animal organism.

Under a cognizance of these facts the author instituted some time ago a series

of experiments having a special bearing upon these important questions.

  AExp. 1. portion of albumen from the egg was suspended in ropes in a glass vessel

filled with pure water.

Exp. 2. Another similar portion was suspended in sea-water.

Exp. 3. The albumen was arranged in dilute alcohol.

Exp. 4. The albumen was suspended in the atmosphere ; and in each instance the

substance was left to stand for a period of from twelve to twenty-four hours or

more.

In No. 4, after the period stated, the only observable change which had taken

place was the evaporation of the water of its fluidity, and the formation of a brittle

and still transparent rod.

In Nos. 2 and .3 a slight change only was perceptible, a very thin, flimsy, and

almost transparent veil being seen to surround the suspended albumen.

   In No. 1, however, in a very short space of time, a beautiful opaque tohite veil

began to make its appearance upon the entire surface of the albumeu, and bubbles

of gas were seen to oe eliminated. The albumen yradually cxchanyed its simple,

yranular, transimrent, and komoyeneous ap])carance for that of an opaqtie white,
jftbrom, and oryanized formation, as seen by the aid of a microscope or powerful lens.

Beautiful Jibi-inoas threads of the most delicate construction tvere seen shootiny forth
in various directions and clinyiny to contiyuous objects ; and idtimately the entire sub-

stance under the microscope was found to consist of striated bundles of threads or
Jihrillce, resembling spun glass. ('Specimens were placed upon the table.)

   Any physiologist witnessing this product would be unable to pronounce it to be
                                                                                  ;;

140 REPORT--1870.

any thing else than a beautiful specimen of genuine organized fibrinous substance.

Hitherto we haA^e not been able to collect enough of the gas to subject it to analysis.

These experiments, still being continued, appear to be fraught with incalculable

results as regards nutrition, growth, and reparation of tissue, &c. in the animal

economy, and the development of certain kinds of disease. Fibrin is of essential

Talue also in the arrest of haemorrhage and of the eruption of purulent matter

among the tissues of the body, and appears to be a chief and fundamental source

of all vital energy, strength, and function.

   In No. 2 we have, as previously known, an illustration of the influence of neutral

salines in the prevention of the formation of fibrin ; and in No. 3, the reason why
the London draymen and others, who so extensively indulge in alcoholic drinks,

notoriously possess so little stamina and feeble constitutional vigour.

The ivater-dressing now so extensively employed in hospitals powerfully corro-

Weborates the results of exp. No. 1.  have often seen ulcers and sores of long

standing, although previously devoid of any tendency to cicatrization, when sub-

jected to the action of water in wet lint (covered by waterproof), in some twelve

to twenty-four hours they very frequently assume an opaque white and fibrinous

appearance, sometimes by a perfect bloom of the same covering the entire surface

or at other times by the formation of white edges, and little dots or islands of the

same appearing in various parts of the sore ; water thus effecting in the living

tissues and fluids the same process, and repeating the experiment before us in the

living organism itself.

This experiment appears to unfold a new view of the functions of the lymphatic

and lacteal systems and absorbent veins. Excess of water cannot exist in the

sanguineous system ; but it is in the absorbents that not only is albuminous matter

collected, but also water is absorbed from the circulatory system, the tissues, the

atmosphere by the skin, and other parts of the system, for the great and essentially

important purpose, the transformation of albumen into Jihrin, by the admixture of

the former with that fluid in their parietes, and in the lymphatic and mesenteric

glands.

Finally, the product herein formed cannot be albumen, which does not coagulate

at a temperature below 145° Fahrenheit, and this formation was produced in cold

water. Either, therefore, the product of these experiments must be accepted as
veritable fibrin, or some substance highly resembling the same, and not albumen

or the coagulation of albumen must henceforth be admitted to take place sponta-

neously in water perfectly cold.

On the Comparison of the Shoulder-hones and Muscles with the Hip-bones and

   Referring to the view of rotation of the fore and hind limbs in opposite direc-

tions, propounded in his ' Essay on the Limbs of Vertebrate Animals,' and now
admitted by most anatomists, he was of opinion that the extension of the same

principle to the shoulder and pelvic girdles, suggested by Prof. Flower in the last

Number of the ' Journal of Anatomy,' cannot be maintained. On the contrary, he

gave reasons for believing that the outer surface of the scapula, behind tlie spine,
together with the subscapularis and teres minor muscles, correspond with the outer
surface of the ilium together with the glutei muscles ; that the spine of the sea-

pula corresponds with the crest of the ilium, and the anterior edge of the scapula
with the linea ilio-pectinea ; and that therefore the supraspinatus muscle corre-
sponds with the iliacus iiiternus, and the hinder edge of the scapula with the
hinder edge of the ilium. This was followed by a detailed comparison of the
several muscles of the hip and the shoulder.

        On the Homoloc/ical Relations to one another of the Fins of Fishes.
                    By Professor G. M. Humphet, M.D., F.E.S.

   The object of this paper was to show that the so-called "median" and " lateral"
fins of osseous fishes are in reality serially homologous. It was shown that the
" median " fins are, strictly speaking, double, each being formed by the coalescence
of two lateral elements, produced in the two lateral laminae (neural or haemal, as
the case may be) of the embryo. In the case of the ventral fins, the wider sepa-
ration of the lateral laminas being caused in this part by the presence of the

abdominal viscera, the coalescence of the lateral elements of the fins is prevented,
and each half remains as a distinct fin. The similarity of structure and appearance
of the pelvic bones and their fin-rays to the interspinous bones and their fin-rays
was pointed out, and the connexion of the pelvic bones and the interspinous bones
with the rest of the vertebral skeleton was shown to correspond. The pectoral fins
being admitted on good gi-ounds to be homologous with the ventral fins must, if
the view here taken is correct, be also serially homologous with the elements of
the anal fin,

          On Blight in Man and in the Animal and Vegetable World.
                           By RicHABD King, M.D., F.E.S.

   The author having defined the terms Blight, Contagion, and Infection, according
to the acceptance of these terms by the best authorites, proceeded to illustrate his

paper on " Blight in Man and in the Animal and Vegetable World." He com-

menced with the fairj'-riugs, the eyesores in our parks and lawns, and he recog-

--nized two distinct forms not hitherto noticed the fairy -ring withered and the

fairy-ring luxuriant. In the fairy-ring withered grows the champignon in the
periphery of the ring, in the luxuriant ring grows the mushroom throughout its

--entire ring. He then proceeded to the potato-disease, where he recognized two

distinct forms the withered haulm and the blotched haulm. He then proceeded

--to the rinderpest in the cow and the sheep, and he there recognized two forms

of disease the mouth-disease and the foot-disease. In man he recognized two
distinct forms of disease--cholera and diarrhoea as well as fevers. He attri-

butes all these diseases of the animal and vegetable world to one cause under
two difierent circumstances, as gas passing out of the earth as a terrestrial gas

--and coming back to the earth as a poisonous vapour, the gas passing out of the

earth generating the withered fairy-ring, the withered haulm of the potato, and
cholera; the poisonous vapour falling upon the earth producing the luxuriant
fairy-ring, the olotched haulm of the potato, and diarrhoea.

    Cui bono ? Plough up the luxuriant fairy-ring, cut ofi' the blotched haulm of
the potato, and treat diarrhoea, all are amenable to treatment ; but the fairy-rino-
withered, the potato-plant withered, cholera in man, and the rinderpest in the cow
and the sheep are not amenable to treatment. Drive out of the infected locality

man from his home, the cow from her shed, the glandered horse from his stable, and
the sheep from his walk, and you will save them ; do not leave them in the infected

district to constantly inhale the poisonous gas which has produced the disease.

     On the Action of some Gases and Vapours on the Red Blood-corpuscles.

On a new Metliod of studying the Capillary Circulation in Mammals, By

    Dr. S. Steicker, Professor of Experimental Pathology in Vienna, and
    Btjrdoi^^ Sanderson, M.D., F.B.S., Professor of Practical Physiology in
     University College, London.

   All conclusions as to the capillary circulation which are derived from obsen-a-
tions of cold-blooded animals are subject to the objection that their functions are
carried on under conditions considerably remote from those which exist in man.
It has therefore been long desirable to change the field of research to mammalia.
There is, however, no mammalian animal in which any external part is sufficiently
transparent for observation under the higher powers of the microscope. The me-
thod must therefore necessarily involve vivisection ; so that an anesthetic is abso-
lutely necessary. Most happily chloral is foimd to be completely adapted to the
purpose. About three grains of chloral under the skin was found to be sufficient

to render a fidl-sized guineapig motionless and insensible for many hom'S.
   One of us (Dr. Sanderson) was familiar with the remarkable structure of the

guineapig's omentum, and had already described it in connexion with another
inquiry. The omentum of the guineapig is a membrane of extent relatively com-
parable to that of man, but its structure is entirely different. First, it is attached,
not to the transverse colon, but to the greater curvature of the stomach ; secondly,
it consists, not of four layers of membrane, but two ; and lastly, it contains very
little fat, but in place of it a great quantity of cells, which are collected in a pecu-
liar way about the blood-vessels and in thek neighbourhood, partly in the form of
perivascular sheaths, partly in the form of little collections or nodules consisting
of cells lying in the meshes of a plexus of capillaries. Hence, from the simplicity
of its anatomical relations, and particularly from its being attached on one side
only to the stomach (in which respect no membrane is comparable with it), from
its perfect transparency, from its abundant vascularity, and from its containing
not only vessels, but living cells, and these cells of two kinds, namelj^, epithelial
and parenchymatous, it is obvious that the omentimi of the guineapig offers a

splendid field for observation.

   For observation the membrane must be immersed ; immersed, however, not in
water, for water would at once irritate and kill the tissue, but in solution of
common salt of proper strength. Such a solution is what physiologists call an
indifferent fluid, because, when it comes in contact with living cells, it does not
appreciably interfere with their vital processes. Secondly, it cannot be in a natural
condition unless it retain the temperatm-e of the living bodv. The arrangement
for securing this is somewhat complicated. The membrane is laid out in a glass
dish, whicli is supported on the stage of the microscope by a hollow brass plate,
through which a stream of water flows at a rate and temperature so regulated that
the dish and its contents are maintained at a temperature closely agreeing with

that of the body.

   For commencing the observation this is all that is necessary. If, however, it is
continued, the observer soon encoimters two difficulties, both of which must be
overcome. The one arises from the clouding of his objective when it is brought

near the warm surface of the saline solution ; the other, from the rapid evaporation

of the solution, and the consequent alteration of its density, and eventual desic-
cation of the membrane. The first difficulty is obviated by warming the objective
the second by providing for the renewal of the water contained in the bath
by the constant influx of fresh water at a rate corresponding to that at which

it wastes.

   The operative procedure is extremely simple. The guineapig having been tho-
roughly chloralized, is laid on a support or block, the upper surface of which is in

the same horizontal plane with that of the microscope stage. An incision is made,

which extends for two inches at most from the outer edge of the left rectus muscle,

a little below (behind) the end of the ensiform cai'tilage horizontally outwards so
as to divide one or two costal cartilages. The muscles must next be divided and

the peritoneum carefully opened. The stomach can then be drawn out of the

abdominal cavity without difficulty, especially if the additional precaution be
employed of first removing some of its contents. In doing this, very little mani-

pulation is necessary, and special care must be taken to avoid touching the deli-
cate structiu'e attached to its border which is to be subjected to observation. The

moment that the organ is fairly out of the abdomen, the membrane must be floated

into the warm bath prepared for it, and is then ready for examination. It is,

however, found very advantageous to cover those parts of it which do not lie

directly under the microscope with sheets of blotting-paper. This arrangement

lias two advantages ; the risk of evaporation is diminished, and the undulatory
movements of the water are prevented, so that the object is rendered much steadier

than it would otheiwise be. The enlargements we have hitherto employed are
Weinconsiderable, the most useful objective being the quarter of Ross.
                                                                        have no

doubt, however, that we shall eventually be able to apply both air and immersion

objectives of higher magnifying-power.

The objects which present themselves to the observer in the omentum of the

Weguineapig are manifold.  content ourselves viiih barely enumerating them.

Veins and arteries may be studied of various diameters, some of them siu-rounded

by sheaths containing fat-cells, some by similar sheaths containing the cells of

which mention has already been made, others so free that their structm'e can be

perfectly studied. LabjTinths of capillaries of surpassing beauty can be studied

Both in the sheaths of the vessels and in the little nodules of tissue in their neigh-

bourhood ; and finally the epithelial elements with their characteristic spheroidal

nuclei by which the wonderful connective-tissue network of the omentum is every-

where covered.
   After the conclusion of the Meeting the method was exhibited to a large number

of medical gentlemen by the authors.

On the Intimate Stnicture of the Human Lung. By A. T. H. Waters, M.D.

          On the Anthropolocjy of Lancashire. By John Bedboe, M.D.

   The author said that it had been supposed that the Teutonic character of the in-
habitants of South Lancashire might date from the occupation of Manchester, du-
ring the Roman period, by a cohort of Frisians. Possibly the blood of the Celtic
Britons, here as elsewhere, might have been somewhat aifected by colonization of
this kind under Roman auspices ; but it seemed more probable that the southern
part of Lancashire was not really Saxonized until the reign of Ethelfiith of Nor-
thumbria, who made gi-eat conquests in this direction. But the northern portions
of the county remained British much longer, and were not thoroughly Teutonized
until their colonization, in common with Cumberland and Westmoreland, by Scan-
dinavians from Ireland and Man. Certain Scandinavians also found their way into
South Lancashire, and thus a few local Danish names were found, such asFormby;
and in Domesday Book certain Drenghs appeared as holding lands at Warring-
ton, " drengage " being a Scandinavian tenure, and the word " drengh"' being still
in use in Norway. Since the Norman Conquest no ethnological change worthy of

mention had occuiTed in the northern part of the county, and the physical type in

that quarter was accordingly pretty distinct. The Norwegian element prevailed in
it over the Kymro-British. The Anglian was weak and the Gaelic douDtful._ The

stature was tall, the hair often light, and the features of Norse type. The evidence
of philology pointed in the same direction. In South Lancashire the original An-

glian type had been  obscured by the prodigious extent of  immigration                                                   moreover,
                                                                                                                      ;

the stature had been degraded, and the type otherwise affected, by the results of

the recent great development of manufacturing industry. It was, however, still

distinguishable, and resembled that of Northern Mercia. The principal points in

the paper were supported by numerical tables.

                 On the Ottoman Turhs. By John Beddoe, M.D.

   The observations of the author had led him to the conclusion that the physical
type of the Ottomans, at all events of the peasantry of Anatolia, had not, probably,
very much changed since the Turkish Conquest. At that time, no doubt, consi-
derable intermixture of blood had occurred between the Seljukian and Ottoman
Turks and the conquered people ; but any subsequent crossing had been pretty
much confined to Rumelia and the towns ; and a well-marked Turanian physiog-
nomy was still very prevalent among the Anatolian peasantry. The Turkomans
were most Turanian in aspect, and next to them came the pastoral tribes called
Ym-uks, then the Anatolian peasantry, and, lastly, the Rumelians and the Mussul-

man population of the large towns, in whom the original Turkish element was ex-

tremely dilute. These differences of aspect corresponded to the known or probable

differences of blood ; and it appeared unnecessary to invoke the aid of supposed

climatic influences to account for them.

            On the Position of Australian Languar/es. By Dr. Bleek.

   The author traced certain analogies between the several Australian and Dravidian

languages, placing them all in Max Miiller's great nomadic or Turanian class ; and

although the Australians have, with few exceptions, no grammatical distinctions of
gender, the author does not think that this necessarily excludes them from the sex-
denoting family. The use of suffixes and post-positions in the Australian languages
led him to infer tliat they have been derived from the more temperate zones. In-
deed the nations using suffix-pronominal languages are found on the outskirts of
the Tropics, and in temperate and cold latitudes ; while those speaking prefix-pro-
nominal tongues are restricted to the Tropics. And, again, the suffix-pronominal
class are addicted to sidereal worship, and the prefix-pronominal to ancestor-wor-
ship. The author, however, carefully showed that the physical descent of a race by
no means necessarily coincides with the descent of its language ; and, in conclusion,
expressed his belief, based on a study of the mythology and the present customs of
the Australians, that these have degenerated from a higher state of civilization.

   The author observed that weapons in various parts of the world, of prehistoric

date, were found to present extraordinaiy evidences of identity. He called atten-

tion to the possibility of finding evidences of identity of root-words in the names
of weapons, and, as an instance, called attention to a name for aiTOW. This among
the Sentals and Gonds of India is sar. The like form is to be foimd in many Ian-

       On Ancient Sculptures and Objects of Art from Irish Cairns.
              By Eugene Alfked Conwell, LL.D., M.R.I.A.

If the early history of a country, at a period concerning which there are no

written records, can be best studied from the instructive memorials of bygone ages,

we have the advantage of possessing in Ireland some rare monuments of departed

splendour, in the form of cairns, or ancient tombs, which still happily survive the

ravages of time and decay.

   The author's present intention is not to treat of the well-known tumuli at Dowth

and New Grange, in the County of Meatli ; these, among archaeologists, have had,

and deservedly so, a world-wide fame. In the same county, however, there exists
a much less known, and perhaps far more interesting series of cairns, which until

recently have escaped aU notice and investigation. Remarkable as they are, and

reverenced and sacred as they must have been in former times, strange to say, these

cairns have not yet been identified with any description or historical allusion in the

ancient annals of the country.

During an excursion in June 1863 to the Loughcrew Hills, where these ancient

tombs are most conspicuously situated, about two miles south-east of the town of

Oldcastle, the author found the remains of thirty-one cairns, partially destroyed, no

allusion to which was inserted on the Ordnance Maps beyond a few dots, with the

word " stones " appended. The rural popidation of the neighbourliood believed

these heaps of atones to be the magical work of a witch, and had current among

them a legend to that effect. Hence the name given to the highest peak, Sliabh-

na-Caillighe, or "The Hag's Mountain."

After having made some preliminary explorations in two of the cairns, he had

the good fortune to enlist the interest of the proprietor of the estate, the late James

Lenox William Naper, Esq., in having a thorough examination of the place

imdertaken. It must, however, injustice, be stated here that, in securing his co-

operation and indispensable assistance in supplying labour &c., the author was

Wm.mainly indebted to the scientific tastes of his agent, Charles  Hamilton, Esq.,

J.P., of Hamwood, who also communicated with Colonel Sir Henry James, R.E.,

as to the omission of these cairns on the Ordnance Maps ; in consequence of which
a highly qualified Sapper, Mr. Thomas Pearson, was sent from the Ordnance De-

partment, Phoenix Park, with instructions to remeasure the hills, and to insert the

antiquities on a map 25'344 inches to a statute mile *.

In a paper which the author had the honour of reading before the Royal Irish

Academy on 26th February, 1866, he described these cairns, naming each by a letter

of the alphabet, in some cases with an index figure. Out of tiie remains of thirty-

one cairns, fourteen were found to contain parietal or chamber-stones, richly covered

with sculptures ; in some cases the work having been punched, and in others clearly

and cleanly cut or engraved.

In each of the cairns careful drawings have been made of the devices upon these

stones, amounting to 11.5 in number, several of which were exhibited to the Section.

In the well-known cairn at Dowth there are eleven inscribed stones, and at the
celebrated tumulus of New Grange twenty while in Cairn T, at Loughcrew, as

                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

many as thirty-one, no two being exactly alike ; and many most elaborately

covered with devices, which afforded stnmger evidence of their having been in-

tended as symbolic emblems than the (in many cases) evidently ornamental sculp-

tures at New Grange.

terior, and about a foot from the bottom, was found, imbedded among the clay and
stones which filled up the chambers, a well-rounded stone ball, 3 inches in dia-

meter ; material probably brownish-red hematite.

                                                                         Cairn H.

The present remains of this cairn, the richest of all in its yield of prehistoric ob-

jects, are only between 5 and 6 feet higher than the adjoining gi'oirad, and 18 yards

in diameter. With the exception of about half a dozen large overlapping flags, the

covering- or roofing-stones of the interior chambers had long since disappeared,

leaving what remained of the original mound entirely overgrown with grass, and

exposed to the destructive influences of rains and frosts. The unroofed passage ami

chambers in its interior were filled on top to a depth of about 18 inches with loose

stones and earth. Having removed these, the author found the passage itself, from

that to the bottom, a depth of about 3 feet more, completely packed with human

bones in a fragmentary state, and nearly all showing evidences of having been burnt.

Several hundreds of these human bones were collected on the spot and preserved,

as they appeared to belong to persons of various ages and -sexes. Of these were

portions of skulls, shoulder-blades, limb-bones, &c. The three chambers of this

cairn were found filled with a veiy miscellaneous mixture of stones, broken bones,

and earth ; the latter in a soft, stitF, retentive state. These contents were removed

--with great care ; and from them were obtained the following : One end of a bone

bodkin                                     one half of a bone ferrule ;  six pieces of  bone-pins, of which one. If inch
                                        ;

long, and highly ornamented, still retains a metallic rivet, which apparently

fastened on a head ; one tine of an antler, 3 inches long ; fourteen fragments of very

rude pottery, being portions of urns ; ten pieces of flint ; upwards of 200 sea-sheUs,

principally limpet- and cockle-shells ; some varieties of small lustrous or shining

stones ; several hundred sea-pebbles, of vai'ious hues and sizes ; a small brown

stone ball ; one round bone-disk, such as is found inserted between the vertebrae

in the skeleton of a whale.

Underneath the stone basin in the northern chamber were found, imbedded in

damp eai'th and mixed with small splinters of burnt bones, six stone balls, the

largest about an inch in diameter ; but they were in so soft a state that they could

scarcely be touched without injm-ing them. Five of these appear to be white car-

bonate of lime, and the sixth a dark-coloured ball, probably made from a fossil, as

it exhibits root-like fibres. Chiefly in the southern chamber, and for the most

part imbedded in wet stifi'clay, the author obtained the most remarkable collection

of bone implements, glass, amber, iron, and bronze which probably has ever been

found together under similar circumstances. In a few instances, where the bone

articles chanced to be protected by an overlying stone, and in other respects in a dry

position, the sound bone still retains its original polish, giving these ai'ticles all

the appearance of being quite modem. In all other cases they were foimd in such

a soft state that it was with difficulty they could be extracted h-om the tough clay

without breaking them. Of these bone implements (nearly 5000 specimens, some

in mere fragments), upwards of 100 are still perfect in form, and are of various shapes

and sizes, some resembling in contour the flint knives of Scandinavia ; some are

perforated by a single hole near the end. Upwards of 500 of the fragments of these

bone objects are ornamented with rows of fine parallel transverse lines. Seventy-

three of them are engraved (twelve of these on both sides) in a very high order of

art, with circles, curves, ornamental puncturings, &c. ; and on one, in cross-hatch

lines, is the representation of an antiered stag. Ten fragments of white and

polished bone combs, of various patterns, turned up, seven of which are engraved

on both sides, but the heads only and the roots of the teeth of the combs now re-

main. There is also a portion of another bone implement, highly ornamented,

resembling in shape the cardboard upon which ladies in the present day are accus-

tomed to wind silk thread.

 --Amhei: Four beads, the largest scarcely a quarter of an inch in diameter, and
--four fragments of other amber beads. Glass. Three small beads, two blue and one

green                                      two fragments, or broken pieces, of glass ;  one tapering piece of hollow glass
                           ;

--(apparently) 1 inch in length, and resembling a shark's tooth or a Eupert's drop.

Bronze. Six open rings (that is, not closed into one solid piece), varying from 5 to

--lapping- a thin plate of bronze, besides seven broken portions of other rings. Irmi.

Not lying together, but mixed up with the earth and debris which filled the

--southern chamber, the author foimd : seven specimens of iron objects; one is an

open ring, about | inch in diameter ; one half of another ring, somewhat larger
two pieces, each about 1 inch long, of uncertain use ; one thin piece, f inch long
and ^ inch broad ; one piece, li inch long, presenting the appearance of being the
leg of a compass, a tool vdth which the bone implements were evidently inscribed

and ornamented. Lastly, an iron fundi, or pick, 5 inches long, with flat point or
working end, with the head, or larger end, bearing evidences of being hammered,

and thus indicating its use.

   Many of the devices or designs upon the sculptured stones in the cairns have
been executed in punched or picked work, in many cases each impact or stroke in
the line being stiU quite visible. The author has fitted the point of this instrument
to many of these pimched patterns, and they afforded every appearance of having

been executed with such a tool as this. In a later examination of the remains of
this cairn (June 1868), assisted by two men, the following were found :-- Nine small

open bronze rings, of different s"izes ; one link, or ring, material probably steatite,^

nearly worn across in use in one place, and which may have been used as part of

an ear-ring                                              one flint nodule, sponge-shaped, well  polished on upper surface ;                       one

the other blue, diftering in shape ; one " ihuhh head " of solid glass, about \ inch

in length, and of a very soft gi-een colom' when held up to the light ; fifteen por-

circles and other ornamentations.

broken stones, and underneath a thin flag which formed the floor of the chamber,

the author found a bead and pendant, to all appearance portions of a necklace of stone.

From among the loose stones which filled up the unroofed chambers here, the

author collected upwards of 1000 portions of bones : two bone flakes, similar to

Hthose found in Caim : 154 fragments of very rude pottery ; one piece, about

3 inches square, being the upper portion of an urn, is very inartistically ornamented

with three slight ridges, and about an inch from the top there is a single per-

foration                                 another larger piece, ornamented with four slightly raised ridges, is per-

forated by two holes, one IJ inch below the other. When the interior chambers

were cleared of all the loose stones &c., on Tuesday evening, 19th September, 1865,

Mr. Naper, Mr. Hamilton, and Archbishop EiTington were present at the raising

of the remarkable large oval stone basin which occupied the floor of the northern

compartment. Immediately miderueath it were several splinters of charred,

blackened bones                                                                 and, imbedded in the stiff' wet earth  below,  the  author  foimd

nearly f inch broad. Dr. Thui-nam, who has seen it, prouoiinces it to he somewhat
larger than those of the same unharbed type found by him in the Wiltshire barrows.
The two small compartments into which the passage itself is divided were filled
up to the height of 18 inches with charred bones, broken into small fragments. On

the top of these, in the first chamber, a piece of bent bone was found, 9 inches
long, tooled and rounded at one end, to all appearance being a broken portion of
a bow. The most remarkable thing about it is that it has lain there so long that it

nowis silicified. In the second chamber, and in a similar position (that is, on the

top of the charred bones which filled the compartment), the author found a roughly
finished bone dagger, 7 inches long and nearly 1 inch broad.

   Among the loose stones at the bottom of the central chamber, and close to the

entrance to the northern crypt, was found a bronze pin, 2i inches long, with head
ornamented and stem slightly so, and still preserving the beautiful green polish

peculiar to bronze *.

   The author does not propose offering any theories or opinions, contenting him-
self with the simple statement of facts, and leaving others to draw such conclusions
from them as .their various judgments may suggest. One fact, however, appears to
him to be established, viz. that the cremation of the dead has been practised in
Sliabh-na-Caillighe up to a period when the people had become acquainted with
the use of articles made not only of stone and of oronze, but of iron, glass, amber,
 and bone.

                On the Discovery of Plati/cnemic Men in Denhighshire.

   Bij "W. BoTD Dawkins, M.A., F.R.S., and George Busk, F.R.S., F.L.S.

   Mr. Boyd Dawkins described a refuse-heap at Perthi Chwarexi in Denbighshire,
and a sepulchral cave which he discovered close bv, containing from twenty to
twenty-five human skeletons, bm-ied in the crouching posture, and, associated with

 a flint flake, a few fragments of marine shells, the mussel, cockle, and Mi/a trun-
 catn, and broken bones of animals. The latter were of the same species in both
cave and refuse-heap, viz. dog, fox, badger, marten, wild cat, pig, roe, red deer,
goat (Bos Iwiffifroiis), Celtic short-horn, horse, water-rat, hare, and rabbit. The
two deposits are therefore of the same relative antiquity. Tlie same group of ani-

mals occurred also in the cave at Cefn, near St. Asaph, in which human bones were
found along with flint flakes. The human skulls and bones also from a chambered
tomb near Cefn are of the same character ; and therefore the refuse-heap, the in-
terments in the two caves, and the tumidus are probably of the same date. The
hmnan skulls are of the ordinary type termed " Ancient British," and some of the
 leg-bones present the peculiar character which is denoted by the term platvcnemic,

 while others are of the normal shape. This diversity destroys the value of platyc-
nemism as a character of race. It has not been observed before in any British ske-
letons. The presence of the flint flakes, coupled with the crouching posture of the
 skeletons and the shape of the skulls, proves that some deposits are of Neolithic
 age. Professor Busk pointed out the difl'erence in the platycnemism of the Den-
bighshire skeletons and that in those which have been discovered in France and
 Gibraltar ; and maintained that the evidence in favour of its being a race-character
completely broke down. The remains found in Denbigh indicated a small race, ave-
raging from 5 to 5 feet 6 inches in stature.

This section aiibrds a rough measure of the difference in time between the two

periods of the occupation of the cave.

   If we allow that for a considerable time past, immediately outside the historical

--epoch, the disintegration of the cliff has been equal, in equal times, of two feet, if,

then, in twelve hundred years, to put it at the lowest, only a thickness of twenty-
four inches has been accumulated, it would take three thousand six hundred years
for a deposit of six feet to be formed ; and thus the harpoon and flint stratum would
be about four thousand years old. The accuracy of this calculation is, indeed, in-
jured by the possibility that the winter cold was more intense and the splitting
action of the frost greater in pre- than in post-Roman times. Nevertheless the

change from the arctic severity of the postglacial winter to the climate which we

now enjoy in Britain has been so gradual, and spread over so long a period, that
it may be assumed to have been very small in so short a time as four or five

thousand years.

   These two layers containing ti'aces of man gradually coalesced as the excavation

passed into the cave, and at last became so confused together as not to be easily

distinguished at a few feet fi-om the entrance. The remains of a gigantic bear,

which had been eaten probably, may be assigned to the lower horizon, which

furnished flint flakes and a bone harpoon in form resembling that used by the

natives of Nootka Sound. The upper or Romano-Celtic stratum continued to supply

evidence of the comparatively late date of its accumulation in barbarous imitations
Aof coins of Tetricus (a.d. 267-273).
                                       portion of the ivory handle of a Roman

sword and a coin of Trajan have also been found, along with large quantities of the

bones of animals that had been used as food. Several spurs of cocks proved that

the inhabitants ate the domestic fowl, which was probably imported into this

country either directly or indirectly by the Romans. The most striking object,

however, is a beautiful sigmoid fibula made of bronze, and ornamented with a

beautiful pattern in red, yellow, green, and blue enamel. It is an admirable ex-

ample of the art of enamelling (" Britannicum opus " ?) which seems to be peculiar

to the Celts.

The Relation of the Ancient Moabites to Neighbouring Nations, as disclosed in

  the newly discovered Moahite Stone *. By the Rev. C. D. Ginsbxjrg, LL.D.

The newly discovered Moabite stone discloses several important facts in the rela-

tion between the Moabites and the neighbouring nations which are niaterial con-

tributions to ethnology, geography, and paleography, in celebrating on this

triumphal pillar the enfranchisement of Moab from the thraldom of Israel, by

successive victories which Mesha, king of Moab, gained over Omri, king of Israel

and his dynasty {circa B.C. 884) ; the new facts bearing upon these departments,

therein exhibited, may be stated as follows :

1.  The Moabites were an  independent  nation from  the reign of  Solomon                                             they
                                                                                                                   ;

were resubjugated by Omii (B.C. 924), and Mesha regained the liberty of his

coimtry aud the land remained in the undisturbed possession of_ the Moabites up
                                            ;

to the time when the " Burden of Moab " was pronounced (Isaiah, xv., xvi.),

B.C. 726.

   2. In military prowess the Moabites under Mesha, whose country was not quite
as large as the Coimty of Huntingdon, were superior to the Jews. This is evident
from the fact that the king of Israel was afraid to undertake the expedition against
Moab alone, that he solicited and obtained the aid of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah,
and of the king of Edom, that even these three allied armies, led by their re-
spective sovereigns in person, dared not to confront the Moabite army in a straight-
forward invasion, and that they were ultimately completely diiven out of the
country. It is this victory which Mesha celebrates on the stone.

   3. The ritual of the Moabites must have closely approximated that of the Jews
for the vessels of Jehovah were at once transferred from the sanctuary of the Jewish
service to the temple of the Moabite deity (lines 17, 18). For other identical prac-
tices comp. line 17 with Numb. xxxi. 17, 18, 35, 40.

   4. The Moabites were, moreover, superior to the Jews of that time in their
architectural skill. Immediately after Mesha gained the victories over the three

allied kings, he erected buildings which, as far as historical records ai-e concerned,
have no parallel in the Jewish annals. This is evident from the building of
Korcha, with its parks, fortifications, towers, palaces, prisons, waterworks (lines

21b to 26 a), the construction of the stupendous road across the Amon (line 26),

and many other structures erected in the single reign of Mesha.

    5. Its geographical importance cannot be overrated. It not only specifies thir-

--teen out of the twenty names of the places in Moab mentioned in the Bible, viz.

the Amon (river), Aroer, Ataroth, Baal-meon, Beth Baal-meon, Beth Diblathaim,

--Bezer, Dibon, Iloronaim, Jahaz, Medeba, Nebo, Kirjathaim, but gives fom- new

names of places, viz. Beth-Bamoth, Bikoran, Korcha, and Siran.
   6. The language of the Moabites is almost identical with that of the Hebrews

indeed it has preserved forms and phrases which have gi-adually been eliminated from

the Hebrew. Any one who can ti-anslate the Hebrew Pentateuch will be able to
imderstand the inscription on the Moabite stone. The characters are the so-called

PhcEiiician or Cadmean, and exhibit the primary som'ce from which the original
forms of the Greek alphabet are derived.

TJie Discovery of a Kitchen-midden at Bahjcotton in County Corlc.

                      By Professor Harkness, F.R.S.

The author, after alluding to several kitchen-middens which have been dis-

covered on the coasts of Ireland, described one which had recently been met with

on the shore at Ballycotton in the County Cork. Here great quantities of the

shells of Fiirpura lapillus occur, and in the soil beneath those shells, bones of ox,

goat, and pig are found, the long bones of which have been broken for the marrow

contained in them.

The sea has for several years been making great inroads on the coast at Bally-

cotton                            and small knolls of peat, which                                                                                      rest  upon  the boulder-clay,            are seen on
                               ;

the shore between high- and low-water marks. Near the base of these peat knolls

bones of ox, goat, and pig are to be met with ; and the long bones here have also
been broken for the marrow. Associated %vith these are the bones of birds, which

belong to the crane, not now indigenous to Ireland, and the wild swan.

 A_ gi-eat thickness of peat formerly occupied a portion of the district which mar-

gins Ballycotton Bay on the west. This has, however, been in a great measure
                                                                   ;

removed for fuel, and tlie peat knolls are portions of the remains of this thick mass

of peat.

   The vegetable matter composing the peat knolls consisted principally of leaves of
oak, alder, and hazle.

  A considerable subsidence must have taken place in this portion of the coast of

Ireland, as the remains of the food of man and leaves of land-plants are now found

at a level considerably below that of the ordinary high tide.

                On the Massagetce and Sacce. By H. H. Howokth.

   The Chinese authors, translated by Stanislas Julien, and the ' History of the White
Huns,' by Mvian St. Martin, were the author's chief authorities. These enabled
him to identify the ]\Iassagetce of Herodotus and the Greeks with the Ta Yetha of
the Chiaese wi'iters and the Sacre with the Sai and Szu of the same authors and
the Sabs and Sakas of the Indian Epics, and to arrive at the very probable conclu-
sion that Massageta is the indigenous name of the tribes called Sacre by the Per-
sians ; so that Massageta and Saca are in fact equivalent terms, and refer to at
most mere branches of one race.

   This race has been declared by several competent authorities to be Turanian or
Arian ; the Chinese writers enable him to describe it definitely as Thibetan.
The Khiang or Thibetans were, before the supremacy of the Turks, the dominant
race of central Asia. It is interesting to connect them with the subjects of To-
mji-is and the gi'eat enemies of Cyrus.

   The evidence is overwhelming to show that the Massagetse were the ancestors of
the Indo-Scyths, who overran Bactria and destroyed the power of the Greeks in
Asia. So that we may also, the author considers, correlate the subjects of Kad-
phises, the great restorer of Buddhism, with the Thibetan race ; these facts, in his
view, effectually disposing of the old notion that the Saxons had any thing to do
with the Sacae and the Massagetae with the Goths. It also disposes of the more
popular delvision that the Welsh are descended from the Cimmerians. Cimme-
rian (the Gimiri of the cimeiform inscriptions) is only a transcription of the name
Saka, and is equivalent to it, one being the Semitic, the other the Arian name of
the same race.

            Pre-Turlish Frontagers of Persia. By H. H. Howoeth.

   In a previous paper the author connected the Massagetfe and Sacae with the
Khiang or Thibetan races, and, on the other hand, showed them to have been the

ancestors of the Indo-Scyths, who overthrew Bactria and the influence of the
Greeks in Asia. Continuing their history, we find that the Indo-Scyths were

divided into five kingdoms, of which Kouei chang was the chief, and that about
the year 16 a.d. Kouei chang destroyed the four other kingdoros, and became very
celebrated. It is constantly referred to both by the Armenian and Persian authors.

Its gi-eat heroes were Korsa'ko (the Kadphises of numismatists) and Kanichka, who
was the regenerator of Buddhism, and who introduced that creed into Thibet

and China. Previously to his conversion his people had been sun-worshippers
and the author traced to them that form of Mithraism which was introduced at

Rome by Pompey, and which he brought from Parthia.
   On the decay of the power of Kouei chang the nomades on the Persian frontier

are again found imder the name of Yuetchi and Jatoi. V. St. Martin has iden-
tified them with the Ilaiathelah of the Persians and the Epthalitae of the Greeks.

   About tbe fom'th century the Avarian Huns overran Transoxiaua and the coim-
tiy as far as the Indus, and in the pages of Procopius, Prisons, and Cosmas the topo-
grapher, the nomades are called White Huns, and their country Hunnia. These
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;;

are the Huns and Avares of the Indian epics. They were simply Getse led by a
caste of Huns. Procopius describes them as very civilized and quite difterent to
the European Huns. These White Huns the author identified with the Khazars.

  Now the Khazars, there are very strong reasons for believing, were Circassians

therefore the Circassians are the lineal descendants of the Massagetfe of Herodotus.

That they have a very large Thibetan element among them has long ago been
shown by Mr. Hodgson, the best of all authorities on such a subject. This race
genealogy clears up a great many difficulties in the ethnogi'aphy of the Persian

frontier.

                        On tlie Avares. By H. H. Howorth.

   The Lesghian tribes of the Caucasus have not received the attention they de-
serve. One of them is called Chundsag, another Avar. Since the days of Klaproth
it has been known that almost every name of a Hunnic and Avarian leader in
ancient times is still found as a familiar name among the Avars, the Chundsags, &c.
of Leghistan or Daghestan. The conclusion has, however, always been evaded
that both Avars and Huns were neither more nor less than the ancestors of these
Caucasian tribes, that they spoke the same language as the Lesghs in fact. The
author believed this identification to be consistent with every fact we know of the
Huns and Avares, and that it explained many difficulties.

   Again, the ^Ivares were the dominant race of Central Asia before the Turks

they were the conquerors of the Epthalitas, who were thenceforward known as
White Huns, and of the Himnic invaders of India mentioned in the Indian epics.

   De Guignes, in his ' History of the Huns,' and in an interesting essay in the
25th volume of the ' Transactions of the French Academy,' showed long ago that

the Avares were the same people whom the Chinese call Jouan-Jouan. It did
not suit his theory, however, to make the Huns and Avares the same people. He
preferred to identify the Huns vnth. the Hiongnou, who have been most conclu-

sively shown to have been Turks by Klaproth, Remusat, and others. This identi-

fication is not trustworthy. Hun and Jouan-Jouan are so nearly alike in form

that it seems impossible for every -wTiter to have overlooked the fact that they are
the same name ; and yet, so far as the author knew, they have never been identified

as such before. The Avares and the Huns were the same folk, as we know from

the relation of Western writers. If the Avares were identical with the Jouan-
Jouan, the Hims must have been so too. The author postponed the interesting
questions that arise on this identification to his paper on the Huns, and concluded
by giving a history of the Avar invasions from Eyzantine, Chinese, and Eastern
authorities, the latter made accessible by the labours of Stanislas Jidien and
Vivian St. Martin.

            On the Racial Aspects of Music. By J. Kaines, F.A.S.L.

   The author, in a very brief glance at the characters of the music of the various
races of men on the globe, drew particular attention to a striking anthropological

fact ; namely, that the music of the peoples of the north-west of Europe, unlike

that of all the rest, was pervaded by a settled melancholy. He sought to account
for this phenomenon physically and psj'chically. He drew attention to the climatal

and general physical conditions under which the peoples of the north-west of
Europe live, and suggested that, in the constant war with Nature, and the endea-
vour to modify Nature's laws, they acquired a gi-avity, awe, and sadness, of which
the peoples of the sunny south knew nothing, as their nmsic showed. Nature having
used them more kindly. The author conti'asted the biographies (as well as the

music) of the German and Itiilian composers, and showed that the men difiered as

widely ; sadness and sorrow marking the one, brightness and gladness characterizing

the other. He commented upon the introspectiveness of the northern peoples, and

the rapt attention and morbid analysis they give to the great problems of Life,
Heath, God, and Immortality ; and stated that the contemplation of these and such
sublime mysteries saddened and brightened by turns all their thoughts and impres-
sions. It was cmious to note that even the dance-tunes and popular airs of the
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS,  153

Germans, Norwegians, and Swiss (as Las been remarked by Mr. H. F. Chorley, the
eminent musical critic) were in a minor key. " Joyousness," continued the author,
" is a plant that does not flourish in the bleak north. It flowers and blossoms

perennially in the south, because there the air is balmy and soft. There the sides
are always bright, and beneath man's feet the earth is fruitful though untilled.
There Nature uses her children kindly, and even ' prepares for them a table in the
wilderness.' " The author remarked incidentally that not music only, but the other

arts of expression (architecture, sculpture, and the mythologiesof the north of Europe)

were imbued by the same melancholy spirit. He concluded by a few observa-

tions on the character of ancient Roman, modern Anglican, and dissenting Church

music.

        The Manx of the Isle of Man. Bij Richard King, M.B., F.E.S.

   The habitat of the Manx is the Isle of Man, and is situated in St. George's

Chaimel, at nearly an equal distance from the shores of England, Ireland, and

Scotland. It is remarkable that so near home we should know so little of the

Manx.

   The manufactures of the island, with which the Manx have little or nothing to

do, are inconsiderable ; but the principal source of its wealth, due to the Manx, is the
Herring-fishery, which brings in a return of upwards of £60,000 per annum.

More than 600 Manx boats are engaged in the Herring-, Cod-, and Ling-fisheries,
einploying 3800 men and boys, and 3600 square yards of netting.

   The Manx are robust, frank, hospitable, and enterprising, and, in common with
all the Celtic races, excessively superstitious. The language of the Manx is one of
the six Celtic dialects which philologists have shown to belong to the class of

Indo-European languages, and which are divided into high and low, the high being

the Welsh, Cornish, and Ai-morican, the low being the Erse division, or the Gaelic,

Irish, and Manx. As a spoken language the Manx is not unlikely to die out in

another generation, being rarely used in conversation except amongst the pea-
santry. In most of the parish churches tweny-tive years ago it was used three

Sundays out of four, but it is now entirely discontinued.

   The insular banks issue one pound and five poimd notes. These notes are se-
cured by guarantees on land deposited in the Roll's Office. The currency of the

Isle of Man is now assimilated to that of England. The copper coinage has im-

--pressed on the reverse the arms of the island three armed legs and the motto

" Quocunque jeceris stabit." This device, which was the ancient symbol of Tri-
nacria or Sicily, according to some authors, was introduced into the' island by the
Normans, according to others by Alexander the Third, King of Scotland ; still it

is a question whether the Manx did not originate the ancient symbol of three legs.
   The zoology of the Isle of Man hardly if at all diflers from that of the sur-

rounding countries. The animal which attracts the attention of zoologists is the

Manx Cat, the Stubbin or Ruinpy, a tailless variety of the common Cat, Felis

catus. Traditiou asserts that the species was introduced at the time of the de-

struction of the Spanish Armada. According to Train, the Manx Rimipy resem-

bles somewhat in appearance the cats said by Sir Stamford Raffles to be peculiar to
the Malayan archipelago. They are best seen in a wild state, when the caudal
vertebraB are entirely wanting ; but by admixture with the common cat they are

found with tails of all lengths. Tailless poultry are also common on the isle. The

probability is, therefore, that the tailless cat and tailless poultiy are peculiar to
the Isle of Man.

              On the Builders of the Megalithic Monuments in Britain.

                                   By Dr. A. S. Lewis.

 --The aul:hor di\dded the inhabitants of Britain into three groups the Kyniric,

long-headed, dark-haired, and light-eyed ; the Iberian, dark-eyed and dark-haired;

and the Teutonic, round-headed, light-haired, and light-eyed. He controverted

the idea that the Iberians were the original race, and that they were exclusively
the builders of the megalithic monuments which were found all over Britain ; while

the Iberians were found in much smaller numbers in the north than in the south of
154 REPORT--1870.

Britain. The author attributed the megalithic monuiiients to both the Kymric and
Iberian divisions of the great Celtic race, and supported his views by a careful con-

sideration of the statistics of the physical characteristics of the inhabitants of Great
Britain collected by Dr. Beddoe, President of the Anthropolog-ical Society of
London, concluding by an appeal to those interested in the science to collect fur-

ther statistics.

RemarTcs on Stone Implements from Western Africa.

      By Sir Joiln Lubboce, Bart., M.P., F.R.S.

Considering that at the present moment Africa is probably the most backward

in civilization of all the gi'eat continents, it is somewhat remarkable how deficient

it is in stone weapons ; that being, no doubt, owing to the great abundance of

sands containing iron, and the facility with which that metal is obtained. This

infrequency and almost entire absence of stone implements has been alluded to on

various occasions by those who have felt it to be a difficulty with respect to the

theory that the use of stone in all cases preceded the use of iron and other metals.

But although implements of stone are of rare occurrence in Africa, still they are by

no means altogether imknown. The first stone implements from the Cape of Good

Hope we owe to ilr. Busk. Others have been discovered by I\Ir. Dale, the Inspector

of Education in Cape Colony ; and they are remarkably similar to the flakes and

spear-heads which are found in Europe and elsewhere. In Egypt, also, stone wea-

pons of a very simple character have been found ; but from Southern Africa nothing

has yet been received that could be called an arrow-head. Sometimes small stone

implements are called arrows which are realty not worthy of the name. The truth

is that a sa\ age is very careful indeed in the manner in which he manufactures his

arrow-heads. It has probiibly taken him a day, or a day and a half, to get near his

game ; and it would be veiy provoking to him to miss his aim from any deficiency

in the form of his weapon. It is therefore great economy of time on his part to

devote a considerable portion of it to the manufacture of arrows which will be

tolerably true. Therefore perhaps scarcely sufficient caution is used in calling

small stone implements arrow-heads. Again, a very common type of stone imple-

ment found in Europe, the scraper, does not appear to be abundant in Africa. Sir

John exhibited a specimen from the Cape of Ciood Hope, which he said was the

nearest approach to the type which has come from that part of the world without

being at all a typical specimen. Stone implements of rough flint have also been

found in Mount Sinai, and a specimen was sho-wTi, found by Mr. Freeman, at Wady

Ithm, in the Syrian district, on the road to Petra. But the specimens to which

Sir John principally desired to call attention were some which have been sent over

by Mr. Reade from Western Africa, that gentleman being engaged in scientific

research in Africa at the expense of an enlightened merchant, Mr. Swanzy. It is

true that implements of this character have been sent to Europe before, but

they were very few, and did not attract much notice. Those now exhibited were

obtained at some feet underground, in sections exposed by the river near Accra.

There are several interesting points in Mr. Reade's letter, which accompanied them,

Weone being the idea that these stones are thimderbolts.  Imow that is a notion
--which exists almost all over the world from Western Europe to the far distant

regions of Hindostan. That they may be employed as charms, and also as medi-

cine, is a very general notion. Neither the depth at which these stones were found

or the superstitious notions connected with them can be taken as evidence that

they were of gi'eat antiquity. One of the axes from the African collection was put

in contrast with a tray of other axes from all parts of the world, in order that at-

tention might be called to the extreme similarity of these primitive implements.

There were examples from New Zealand, North America, Chili, English, Irish, and

German specimens, from Spain, British Guiana, South America, fi'om the river
Amazon, and from Australia. That common t^'pe, therefore, may tridy be said to bo

found all over the world. Besides the ordinary type, there was a wedge-shaped,

thick and very rounded forai, not so vridely distributed. The collection contained

also a quartz-pebble, which had a hole carefully drilled through it, and had been used

probably as an ornament. Considering the abundance of ores of iron in this African

district, and the facility with which they could be smelted and metal obtained,
Sir John thought it probable that these stone axes belong to a time before the
natives of this place became acquainted with the art of smelting ii-ou.

On a recent Examination of British Tumuli and Monuments in the Hehrides
  and on the Western Coast of Scotland, with suggestive Inferences. By J. S.
   Phen6, F.G.S., F.B.G.S., Member of the British Archceological Association.

The object with which the investigations had been conducted was the observ-

ance of natm-al physical circimistances of position in conjunction with the oldest

archfBological remains ; more especially where the author had been so fortimate as

to meet with undisturbed relics of prehistoric ai-t. The first object of interest to

which he dkected attention was the tumulus in the larger Cumbrae, in the Firth

of Clyde, of the diSerent parts of which photographs were exhibited. It contained

five stone cists, each formed of four slabs of red sandstone, with a large overlying

slab for a cover. Within the cists was a layer of fine white pebbles. The cists

were in an apparently studied position, the largest being placed nearly north and

south, and on each side one of smaller dimensions tending towards the east and

west                          the two  latter contained  bones  apparently burnt, with an  incinerary urn of
                           ;

one of the oldest types of British pottery in each. To the rear of the first was a

small cist containing the skull and bones of a child, and on the western side of that

one in which there were no remains. The fu-st and largest cist contained the bones

of a large man. In the small cist, with the bones of a child, were portions of a

broken urn, and in the western one a clean and empty urn only. There was a
uniformity about the whole mound which pointed clearly to the cists being of one

date, and that they represented one funereal operation. By the permission of the

Earl of Glasgow, he made a cutting through the timiulus, and found abundant proof
that the mound had been raised by art.

The position of the remains--the principal tomb having on each side one with

evidences of cremation, of persons, as the bones indicated, of less stature than the

occupant of the central cist, and therefore probably of women ; that of the youth

--at the rear, and the presence of the empty cist or cenotaph suggested the idea,

admitted by Dr. Wilson in his ' Prehistoric Annals of Scotland,' of the custom

of immolation on the death of a chief or archpriest.

The next object to which the author called attention was a tumiilus at the

northern end of Cantire, which is still under investigation, in which was discovered

an urn similar in design to the principal one from Cumbrae. Like results had

attended his researches in the vicinity of Cuff HiU in Ayi'shire, of Berigonium in

Argyleshire, and in the island of Arran ; in each case pottery of the same type was

discovered.

   Referring to the archseological indications, a similar repetition of memorials

occurred again in the dLrection of the Crinan Canal. Other discoveries were

referred to by the author, who stated that on the western coast and islands up to

Durness, by Cape Wrath, indications of a Pagan race were to be foimd ; not
the least remarkable amongst which were some specimens of sei-pent mounds and
constructions, identical with those of Ohio and Wisconsin. His investigations had
so far terminated at the remarkable criicifomi temple in the island of Lewis,
which he considered displayed striking indications of astronomical arrangement.

      On a Flint-flake Core found in the Upper Valley-gravel at Salforcl,
                         Mancliester. By John Plant, F.G.S.

   The rivers Irwell and Mersey, from Manchester to liverpool, flow down a wide
valley, eroded through beds of Keuper or Bunter sandstone. The present river-bed
is of moderate width to Runcorn-gap, below which it becomes a wide estuary. In
earlier times this estuarine character may have extended inland even to Mancliester,
for wide tracks of gravels, sands, and silt spread away from the river banks on either

side ; under these lie the Boulder-clays and sands of the Postpleiocene or glacial
drifts. The oldest sands and gravels of estuarine origin lie the highest and most dis-
tant from the river, except over places where the Bunter beds crop out in high banks,
in some places 200 feet above and a mile beyond the river ; and from these beds
are a series of well-marked river-terraces, dropping inwards towards the river.
These are composed of old alluvium with smooth, flattened, and iron-stained pebbles

in layers of sand and fine silt. The lowest terrace is meadow land, at times deeply
flooded, and receiving new layers of silt. In the great flood of November 1866 three
inches were deposited in twenty- four hours. The oldest sands and gravels may pos-
sibly be related to the age of the high-level gravels of the river Somme, and to the

flint-weapon gravels of the south-east of England. Lancashire is a county almost
devoid of flints, either natural or artificial ; and thus weapons of the palaeolithic
age are altogether absent from its drifts, and not more than a score of weapons of the
neolithic age have been to the present discovered in its drifts and cave-deposits.
These later stone weapons are also poor in make, and have no racial peculiarities.

The only exception of a weapon with palaeolithic features is the one now described,

which fortunately was taken from the bed of drift in my presence, July 1869. It

was lying in a four-feet bed of laminated sandy silt, under six feet of river-gravel
and yellow clay, with rough gravels and the boulder-clays below. The excava-
tion was near the Ordsall Lane railway-station, about 1000 feet from the banks
of the river, and nearly 108 feet above the river level, the average level of the middle
teiTace higher up the valley. The deposit where the flint-core lay probably repre-
sents the age of the river when it flowed over the middle terrace. The flint-core
bears the size and shape of a horse's hoof; from the front curved face five fine flakes
have been struck, and smaller ones fi'om other parts. The original surface is shown
in three places, and encrustations derived from the soil adhere very firmly on the

fractured parts, supplying a strong proof that, whatever may have been its origin,

it had long lain in its bed under the river-gravels.

On ce^'tain remarkable Earthworks at Wainfleet, in Lincolnshire.
                     By the Eev. C. Sewell, M.A.

These works consist of a series of mounds, about forty yards long and twelve feet

high, lying parallel to the sea front, which is now two miles from them, but which
Ain Roman times came close up to them.
                                        Roman sea bank runs along then- face,

and appears to take its shfipe from the contour of their front. The Roman station

of Vanonia, according to Camden and Stuckley, lies about a mile to their rear.

Traces of these mounds can be discovered over a mile and a half of ground. At the

Anorth and south ends they have been much mutilated.  central piece, about 300

yards lon^, remains entire. This block of mounds is divided into live separate groups,

the divisions between them being marked by narrow watercourses running at

right angles to the general direction of the mounds, and terminating in well-marked

regular depressions, which, on the supposition of this being the site of dwellings,

might have been freshwater-tanks. The mounds at this point extend backwards

from the ancient shore-line a space of 400 yards, standing, with little interval

between them, one behind the other, as many as twelve or fourteen in number.
   No traces of remains or human handiwork have been observed in these mounds,

though they are being constantly dug down and removed for one piu-pose or

another. They are composed of the soil on which they stand, though there is an

accoimt th<at some of them are of a black peaty soil, which, however, can be found

within a short distance. No mention has been made of these mounds either by
Camden or by Dugdale in his ' History of Draining,' which treats largely of this

--neighbourhood ; but their antiquity is undoubted, if only on the evidence of their

local name the Hilly Tofts. The popular account of their use is that they are the

remains of ancient salt-works, though the method by which salt was made upon

them by evaporation of sea-water is not very clearly made out. If this theoiy of

their use be the true one, they are interesting as being probably the source of supply

of salt to the Roman settlements all along the east of England. Another theoiy is

that the mounds are to be connected with the Danish invasions of England. It is a

plausible suggestion, but founded on no evidence, that the hollows between the

mounds were used as places to lay up the Danish ships while their crews made their
advance inland. The name Tofts points to some connexion with Danish occupiers

but if that name really indicates "an inhabited spot," the Danes, whether they

used the mounds as dry docks or not, may have found them occupied by human

dwellings. In spite, therefore, of all absence of remains, it is possible that we

have here the site of an ancient British fen-village, raised on mounds, as the

Swiss lake-dwellings were on piles, above the watery waste around them.

                The Mental Characteristics of the Australian Aborigines.

                      By C. Staniland "Wake, Dir. A.S.L.

   The chief inference to be drawn from the mental characters exhibited by the
aborigines of Australia is that they are children whose intellect has, by the
exigencies of their situation, been continually exercised, and therefore become more
than ordinarily keen and active, while the moral nature has remained almost
wholly in abeyance. From the data furnished by the paper, it is evident that the
Australian aborigines occupy the lowest position in the scale of humanity, and that
they show what must have been the condition of mankind in primeval times.

                 On an Implement of Quartz from St. Oeorge^s Sound.
                        By Heney Woodward, F.G.S., F.Z.S.

   The author drew attention to a ciystal of quartz, having its terminal planes
preserved at both ends, which was foimd by his colleague Mr. Thomas Davies
among a number of other minerals in the British Museum forming part of the old

Sloane collection.

   The interest attaching to the specimen is of two kinds : it is, first, of historic
interest, for upon close examination there was found inscribed upon it in ink (in
Gapt. Cook's writing), "St. George's Sound, N.W. coast of America : Gapt. Cook,"
thus proving it to have been brought home by that illustrious explorer ; and,
secondly, it is of prehistoric interest, for the crystal had been employed to bore or
pick holes in the ice by the Esquimaux, as proved by the notches made in its sides
for fixing it securely in some handle of wood. Such implements are used at the
present day by the Esquimaux to bore holes in the ice to catch fish in winter.

Whilst wars have fi'om time to time changed the political geogTaphy of foreign
states, we, who happily live in our sea-girt isle, possess frontiers which for many

long years have been preserved intact ; and now that we meet again, for the thu-d

time, in this rich and eutei-prising seat of commerce, we may tranquilly take note
of any changes which may have been lately made in the boundaries of other king-

doms. But such changes in political geogTaphy, though specially to be delineated

on maps, need scarcely occupy attention at a Meeting of the British Association,

and we may hand them over to the politician. Oiu' chief duties are to receive and

discuss all communications which reveal to us new discoveries in Physical Geo-

graphy and the affiliated branches of Science in all parts of the globe.

  This Section E had for many years the title of Geography and Ethnology ; but

the latter term has recently been abstracted from us, Ethnology having been rele-

gated to the newly constituted comprehensive Section of Biology. Now, although

I have often presided over this Section when it possessed its double title, I admit

the value of the change, seeing that we are relieved from the duty of receiving and

discussing those anthi-opological memoirs which are intimately connected with

physiology and comparative anatomy. Such memoirs could not be adequately dis-

cussed by geographers, and they are'^now submitted to competent judges. At the

same time I earnestly hope that papers relating to Ethnography, including accounts

of the language and customs of distant peoples, and which"^ is intimately bound

up with the physical geogi-aphy of countries, will, as heretofore, flow into our hall,

and thus render oiu- meetings on this occasion as successful and popular as they

have been during past years. In the course of the present Meeting a paper will be

subjects, so inseparably connected with Geogi-aphy, should ever be severed from it

in the proceedings of the British Association.

Geography in a broad sense is so closely allied to many researches, that, since

the foimdatiou of the British Association, it has at times been coupled Avith different

mysciences by our legislators. At first it was very naturally gi-ouped with      own

pecidiar subject, Geology, which may well be termed the Comparative Physical Geo-

graphy of byegone ages. But this union did not last long, because my brethren of

the hammer, ever producing more memoirs than coidd be discussed at any one

Meeting, the Geogi'aphers, who were desirous of having niiich time and attention

allotted to themselves, withdrew and no longer took part in Section C.

In those days Geogi-aphy could not find a separate place in the list of sections

for it was a canon in the constitution of the British Association, that the number

of sections was to be for ever limited to seven. But as time wore on, changes, of
necessity, occurred. The first of these took place in Section B, which began by

including Chemistry and Agi-icidture. But this connexion of a pm-e Science with

the practical objects of proprietors and farmers could not be permanent ; and the
cultivators of the soil (finding no space for their exhibitions, and taking the British

Association as a model) established that most important national body, the Eoyal

Am-icultural Society.

   Next the medical men, finding that no adequate justice could be done in one

mysection to their diversified subjects, separated from us, and at the suggestion of

lamented friend Sir Charles Hastings, founded the great Medical Association of

Britain.

   Through this withdrawal of medical science, the Section denoted by the letter

E remained for some time a blank, without any scientific duties attached to it;

and it was only in the year 1851 that, on my owa suggestion, and at the Ipswich

Meeting, the blank Section was refilled under the title of Geography and Ethno-
logy. Under this title I have read addresses to the Section at Leeds in 1858, at
Oxford in 18G0, at Newcastle-ou-Tjme in 1863, and at Bath in 1864.

   In alluding to such wi-ittcn addresses, it is well to remind the younger members
of oiir body that during twenty-five years they formed no part of our Pro-

ceedings. These preludes to the business of each Section were for the first time

introduced in the year 1856, and the person who led the way in these usefid and
now necessary parts of our duties was the present Earl of Derby, who then, as Lord

Stanley, presided over the Statistical Section at Cheltenham. I cannot advert to

this fact, so highly creditable to my noble friend, who is now a Vice-President of

our whole body, without reminding you that his illustrious father, whose name will

ever be revered in British histoiy, and whose beneficent deeds will ever be gi-ate-
fully remembered in Lancashire, was himself an admirer and patron of geogra-

phical explorers, and a Fellow of the Society over which I preside. I refer you to

my last Anniversary Address to the members of the Eoyal Geographical Society
for the expression of my admiration of his character.

   Before I speak of some" few of the contributions which will, I trust, be brought

imder our consideration, let me glance at the rapid progress of discovery in recent

years, and, first of all, at the great and impoi-tant additions to pure Geography
which have been made in Central Asia both by Eussian and British explorers.

  AVith   all  the  western  portion  of  that  vast  region  in which lie  the  Khanats of

^

Khiva, Bokhara,_and Khokan, some of you may now be acquainted, through the

accounts of Eussian observers, who have already fixed the correct positions of the

chief towns, mountains, and rivers of Western "Turkistan. Proceeding eastwards

from the Sea of Aral, the Eussians have, for the first time in history, rendered the

Eiver Syr Daria (the Jaxartes of Alexander the Great) navigable by steam-vessels

of a limited size, and fixing military posts on its banks, have ascended towards its

sources and taken possession of the populous and flourishing city of Tashkent, a

great mart of caravan commerce.

   Again, Eussia has triumphed over the Khan of Bokhara, the savage ruler
who in years gone by barbarously put to death two British officers, Stoddart and
Conolh', and who has now met with a due humiliation. As peace has been con-

cluded between the Emperor of Eussia and those turbulent chiefs, who have now

been rendered subordinate to a great civilized nation, we may hope that the
160 REPORT 1870.

blessings of commerce will restore this fine region to some portion, at least, of the
"wealth and dignity which it held in those ages when its monarchs ruled over nearly

one-half of the then civilized world. The crude and ill-founded apprehensions which

once existed that these advances of Russia would prove highly prejudical to British

India, have, through due reflection, entirely evaporated from among British states-

men, who are now convinced that it is much better for the commerce and peace of

both nations that intermediate wamng chiefs should be kept under by a strong

power. After all, between the great territories of Russian lurkistan and those of

British India, there lies the long, broad, and mountainous region of Affghanistan,

with whose present ruler we are on good terms.

But what about  Eastern  Turkistan ?  some  of my hearers may say                                                                                                             what about
                                                                                                                                                                           ;

those enormous tracts which lie immediately to the north of the north-western

mountains of British India, the Himalayas, and Cashmere ? The answer which I

have given in my last Address to the Royal Geographical Society is the most satis-

factory explanation which can be offered, and I here give the pith of it. The

Russians have not advanced beyond the chain of the Thian Chan into any part of

those territories in which the cities of Kashgar, Yarkand, and others are situated.

These countries, which until a few years ago were held by the Chinese, and are

inserted in all old maps as an integral part of the Chinese empire, have entirely

extirpated theu' conquerors, and the mass of the natives, being Mahommedans, are
now under the rule of a brave soldier of their own faith, who, under the title of

the Ataligh Ghazee, or Leader of the Faithful, has brought the people into a state

of perfect order, after having been in the most tumultuous and insurrectionary state

so long as the Chinese vainly attempted to govern them.

The process by which an intercourse has been established between this Eastern

Turkistan and British India has been so eminently characteristic of the efforts of

a powerful trading nation like our own, that a very brief account of it may be
acceptable to some of my hearers in this great mart of commerce. Tea-plantations

having been successfidly cultivated by om- countrymen upon the southern and

lower slopes of the IlimaJayan Mountains, it occurred to a most able British civilian,

Mr. Douglas Forsyth, who was diplomatically employed in Cashmere, that the

population of Eastern Turkistan having been so long accustomed to drink tea, and

having been entirely deprived of it since all intercourse with China had ceased,

would gladly hail the reappearance of their favourite beverage, if a supply could

be brought to them from the south. Mr. Forsyth accordingly sent a small sample

(a horse-load only) of tea across the mountains, as a present to the great ruler of

this new kingdom. As this present was "gratefully received," one of our British

tea-cultivators at KangTa, Mr. Shaw, resolved to face all the difficulties of a pas-

sage through the lofty mountains of the Karakonmi and Kuen Lun ; and, fitting

out a caravan bearing tea, he conducted it himself in safety by Yarkand to Kashgar,
where he was well received by the Ataligh Ghazee. At first, indeed, things

looked unpropitious, for Mr. Shaw was proceeding fairly and simply as a British

merchant, when there arrived just at the same time a warlike-looking Englishman.

This was Mr. Hay ward, late of the 72nd Regiment ; and for a time both were

placed en surveillance, but most amicably treated. In fact Mr. Ilayward had been

sent out by the Royal Geographical Society to explore, if possible, that great

desert plateau, the Pamir Land, occupied entirely by nomade Kirghis, in which

the rivers Oxus and Zerafshan have their rise ; but being unable to force his way

thither through certain disturbed tracts to the north-west of the Punjaub, he took a

route which led him to Y''arkand. The arrival of the two Englishmen, which at

first seemed so unintelligible and suspicious, turned out to be in the end most ad-

vantageous to all parties concerned ; for Mr. Hayward had it in his power to fix

the latitude and longitude of places never before visited by a geogi-apher, whilst

Mr. Shaw, dmiaferens, gratified the Ataligh Ghazee not only by his manners and

address, but particularly his packages of tea. After a j^ear s sojourn at Kashgar

and Yarkand, in Eastern Turkistan, Mr. Shaw returned to British India, and the

Viceroy, the Earl of Mayo, seeing the prospect of establishing a profitable alliance

with this new sovereign, his Excellency not only received an envoy sent by the

Ataligh Ghazee to his Excellency and the Queen, but has recently sent a special

British mission to that great chief ; and for this important mission he has wisely
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                    161

selected Mr. Douglas Forsyth and Mr. Shaw, as negotiators in the establishment

of a treaty of commerce between the respective coimtries; a letter from Mr.

Forsyth to myself, wiitten on the eve of his departure from Ladak, on the 2nd

of July last, and containing matter of great geographical interest, will be read in

the course of this meeting. It will be seen by this letter that, grand as are the
geogi'aphical discoveries made Captain Montgomerie and his pundits, a grander

and richer field than any yet described seems now to invite exploration. I may

add that I have received a letter from the Earl of Mayo, dated the 18th of July
last, in which he speaks hopefidly of this important mission.

   On our part, we have thus opened out a market for our Indian teas, and also for
many articles of British manufacture, in exchange for which we shall receive not

only specie, but also the fine silks and wools of Tm-kistau, and many mineral pro-

ducts of those mountains, some of the peaks of which rise to upwards of 24,000
feet, and many of whose level tracts and plateaus are 14,000 to 17,000 feet above
the sea. To obtain a full insight into the nature of this hitherto unknown region

and its remarkable ruler, I refer you to an admirably clear and telling memoir by

Mr. Shaw, published in the 'Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society,'

June 7, 1870.
   In making these observations, I would invite some of the enterprising merchants

of Liverpool, Manchester, and other places in this flourishing county of Lancaster

to transmit to Yarkand, via Bombay and the Punjaub, some of their gayest but

stoutest cloths and cottons ; and I venture to prophesy that the Turkistaii people

will rejoice in the arrival at the remote Yarkand of such British goods, for which

they will gladly exchange the products of their own country or pay in specie.

   But, to return to Geography, Mr. Haj^ward, notliing daunted by his first failure,

is now endeavouring to explore the mysterious Pamir Land, which no European

has ever yet traversed, though Lieutenant Wood of the Indian Navy did, many

years ago, reach one extremity of it in an endeavour to determine the source of the

Oxus, as recorded in the tenth A-olume of the ' Journal of the Royal Geographical

Society.' I earnestly hope that Mr. Hayward will be the first geographer who will

have described this lofty region, which the natives term, in their Eastern style,
" The Upper Floor of the World." If he should traverse the Pamir Land, I have

learned, Dy correspondence with the Russian Imperial Geographical Society, that

our countryman will then have a free passage granted to him through all Russian

Turkistan. It is thus that our Science makes its cultivators of every nation as

kindly and considerate to each other as Freemasons. Let me add tliat the Royal

Geographical Society has awarded its Founder's Gold Medal to this brave and

energetic man ; and we fervently hope that he wiU come home through Russia

before next year, to receive his well-merited reward.

 --Dee2}-Sea Soundings. The remarkable additions to Geographical and Natural-

History knowledge which have been made of late years by sounding and dredging

at great depths in the ocean, have excited the liveliest interest. The attention of

modern geogi'aphers was long ago directed to this subject by Parry, James Ross,

and Captain Denham, R.N. The last of these measured downwards in the ocean,

between South America and the Cape of Good Hope, to the great depth of 770(5

--fathoms, and thus enabled geographers to realize the aphorism of Alexander Hum-

boldt that the greatest depths of the sea would be found to be at least equal to

the height of the loftiest mountains. Subsequently Dr. "N^^allich, who ably served

as the naturalist on board the ' Bulldog,' commanded by Sir Leopold M'Clintock,

enunciated the then novel and surprising truth that certain marine animals

(including starfish) lived at the depth of 1260 fathoms, and even preserved their

colours when brought to the surface.

   More recently the scientific explorations of the deep sea to the north and west

of the British Isles, as conducted by Dr. W. Carpenter, Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffi'eys, and
Professor Wyville Thomson, have thrown much new light on this attractive

subject. They have vastly extended our acquaintance with many submarine data,

including the temperatm-e of the sea at various depths, and have proved that

currents of difterent temperatures (each containing a characteristic faunci) are

running, as it were, alongside of each other, or in contiguity, beneath the surface

of tlie sea.

162 REPOK'T--1870.

These data, and a consideration of the various species of marine animals which

·were found, are supposed to have had such material bearings on geological science,

mythat it would be a dereliction of  duty as an old geologist if I were not to

endeavour to disentangle the vmquestionably true, novel, and even startling facts

which these researches have made known, from one of those speculations which

the eminent leader of this expedition has connected with them, and which, if acqui-

esced in, might seriously affect the inductions and belief of practical geologists.

  Dr. W. Carpenter, in a lecture given in the Eoyal Institution, in summing up

--his views as to the effects of the discoveries then made, thiis spoke: "The facts

which I have brought before you, yet stiU more the speculations which I have

ventured to connect with them, may seem to unsettle much that has been generally

accredited to geological science, and thiis to diminish rather than to augment our

stock of positive knowledge ; but this is the necessary result of the introduction of
a neio idea into any department of scientific inquiry " *.

   To this statement I beg to demur. Sound practical geologists, whether they be

Uniformitarians, Catastrophists, or Evolutionists, like the great Naturalist who

now worthily presides over the British Association, are all agreed in the funda-

mental truths of this science as established by positive readings in the stone-books

of Nature. They are confident that undemable proofs exist of an enonnous

succession of deposits, which have been accumulated under the seas of former

periods, in each of which tlie physical geogi-aphy of our planet, and with it the

orders of animals and plants, were very dissimilar fi-om each other, and also differ

still more, as we examine backwards to the earlier deposits, fi-om those of the

Wepresent day.  believe, upon the evidences presented to us, and, irrespective of

all theory, that the vast accumulations under the seas of those periods have had

their relations to each other thoroughly and conclusively established by a clear

Weorder of supei-position.  further believe that the deposits so relatively placed

contain, each of them, organic remains, which are, in great measiire, peculiar to

the one gi-eat group of sti'ata which they occupy.

   With these indisputable proofs of geological succession as established by clear

superposition of the formntions, and the distinctive fossil characters of each, I

necessarily dissent from the suggestions of Dr. Cai-penter and other naturalists,

that, inasmuch as the present deep-sea bottoms contain abimdance of Glohigerina;,

with such animals as Terehratulida, both of which differ little from the forma

found fossil in the chalk formation, it may be infeiTed in a broad sense that we are

still in the Cretaceous period.

  May we not, indeed, by a similar bold hypothesis, affirm that we still live in the

older Silm'ian period ? for, albeit no bony fishes then existed, many Glohigmnce

and creatures of the lowest organization have been found in these old rocks and

associated with TerehratnlidcB and Lhujxdcp, the generic forms of which still live.

Revering, as I do, those great naturalists who have shown abmidant proofs of

mythe progress of creation, or, as others term it, of evolution, I hold to  opinion,

mymatured by a long experience, whilst I dissent from the inferences of     friends

Dr. W. Carpenter and Professor Wyville Thomson, that the recent discoveries may,

or can, unsettle much which has been accredited to what I call sound geological

history, as established on absolute observations and separated from all theory.

   The new ideas which have been introduced by the meritorious labours of

Carpenter and his associates do not, as he has suggested, diminish the amount of

positive knowledge ; on the contrary, they aug-ment it, though they do not
shake, in any way, the foimdations of geological science. I willingly grant, how-

ever, that these new discoveries overthrow the theoiy that defines the depths in

the sea at which certain groups of fossil animals must have lived.

   Whilst on this topic, I rejoice that, at this Meeting, we are to be furnished with
an excellent paper by my distinguished friend Captain Sherard Osborn, on the

whole subject of Ocean Deep-sea Sounding as earned out by the Admiralty, and in

which he will illustrate, by maps and sections, much of his own most energetic

operations in reference to submarine telegraphy.

  In connexion with the interesting subject of the geography of the ocean, I may

call your attention to a little work of great merit which has lately appeared, under

the title of 'Physical Geography, in its Eelation to the prevailing "Winds and Cur-
Arents,' by ]Mr. J. K. Laughton.
                                                           perusal of this book will show how wide is the

held embraced by this important branch of geogTaphical science, and at the same

time how much yet remains to be done before we attain to a satisfactory know-

ledge of those great movements of the ocean and atmosphere included under the

terms Gulf-stream, Equatorial cun-ent, Trade-winds, Monsoons, and so forth.

Mr. Laughton, in the book to which I allude, has called in question the accuracy

of the prevailing theories intended to explain these grand and, in some respects,

complex phenomena. The received hypothesis with regai-d to the ti'ade-winds, for

example, first outlined by Halley towards the end of the seventeenth century, but

developed by Hadley about fifty years later, and modified a few years ago by Maury,

he shows to be quite inadequate to explain all the facts of the case. Tliis hypo-

thesis, as is well known, assumes that the lower strata of the atmosphere near the

equator, being overheated by the sim's rays, expand and rise into the upper regions

of the aerial envelope, their place being taken by a cooler air, which rushes fi-om

the higher latitudes of the north or south, as the case may be ; and, moreovei', that

the ascending heated air travels backwai-ds, as an upper current, to the latitudes

where the cool wind originates, and then, descending again, the aerial circulation

is completed. One of the most striking objections made by Mr. Laughton to this

explanation is, that the equatorial zone is far from being the hottest part of ti'opical

and subtropical regions. He shows, as a matter of fact, in the North-Atlantic

basin, that the Great Desert of Sahara has a temperature from 20 to 50 degrees

hotter than the equatorial zone yet, so far from a cool current of ah" being drawn
                                                                                                                                                  ;

in from the Atlantic towards this heated region, the north-east trades pass sti-aight

onward in their southerly com-se vrithout the slightest indraught towards the

African coast. He also shows that there is no proof of a vertical movement of the

air at the equator, or in the latitudes where the upper currents are supposed to

Adescend again.                                            multitude of similar or parallel instances are adduced fi-om other

parts of the eailh ; in fact nothing has more sui-prised me, in pei-usmg the work,

than the great amount of reading and research the author has applied to the eluci-

dation of this and kindred problems.

Having shown the untenability of the received hypothesis, he modestly advances

a new one of his own. This is difficult, perhaps, to explain in a brief manner

but he shows, from the most varied evidence, that the general movement of the

atmosphere over the whole earth is from west to east, and that in regions where

the prevailing winds at the earth's surface are not westerly, an upper and

strong westerly movement exists above the lower winds. The trade-winds, mon-

soons, and all other partial atmospheric movements, he shows to be chiefly eddies

and reflected cm-rents of greater or less constancy ; and he confirms this supposition

by an exhaustive examination of the laws of movement of air and other fluids. I

may say, in short, that even those who may not agree with the author's reasonings

will find both pleasure and profit in studying the rich store of observation and lucid

argument contained in this little work.

  Among the many interesting papers which will be read before you during the

present Meeting, I may announce two, on subjects of great general interest, by

--General Sir Henry Eawlinson one on the Site of Paradise, and the other on the

River Oxus                                                 both the fi-uits of long study and  research, and sure to be listened to
                                                        ;

with the attention that every thing emanating from so distinguished a geographer

and philologist so well deserves. An important communication from Dr. George

Campbell on the Physical GeogTaphy of British India is also expected, a subject

which has been for yeai's a special study of the author, dming his residence in a

high oflicial position in India. Mr. T. T. Cooper, a ti-aveUer who has distinguished

himself by his persevering endeavours to ti-averse the diificult country between

Western China and our Indian possessions in Assam, will read a paper on Eastern

Thibet, in which he will dilate on the commercial bearings of his explorations,

which were undertaken with a view to discover a route for an overland trade

between the populous and productive regions of the Yang-tsze-Kiang in China and

the equally rich and densely populated plains of British India.

With regard to Afi-ica (that great continent which still continues the principal

field of geogi-aphical enterpi-ise), I have to announce that Mr. Winwood Reade,

                                                                                               11*
--164 REPORT 1870.

wlio has recently returned from an exploration undertaken under the auspices of
the Royal Geographical Society, and at the cost of an enlightened merchant,

Mr. Andrew Swanzy, will communicate to the Section an account of his hazardous
journey to the Upper Waters of the Niger and to the Bour6 country. Mr. Reade

explored a portion of the Niger not previously visited by any European traveller,

and opened up a tract of populous coimtry, in which is situated the town of Fara-
hana, containing 10,000 inhabitants, previously unknown to geographers.

   In respect to those portions of Central America with which many readers have
become acquainted through the descriptions of Stephens and Squier, I may inform

you that you will be interested in a communication from Captain J. Carmichael
upon countries occupied by the Indians of British Honduras and Yucatan. Ascribing

an Eastern and probably an Egyptian origin to the earlier buildings and temples

of the aboriginal American Indians and their idols, the author, who has explored

the region he describes, and speaks their language, endeavours to throw additional

light on the subject. He confesses, however, that in these mysterious monuments
he finds as much difficulty in assigning them definitely to any race of men as
British and other authors have had in fixing the origin of our own most ancient
monuments at home, such as Stonehenge and other Druidical remains. He differs
from Stephens and Squier and those authors who do not assign a great antiquity
to these reliquiae, and shows tliat when the Spaniards took possession of the

countiy several of the colossal buildings and temples had even then a very antique

appearance.

   Captain Carmichael discusses with spirit the question of the former use of the

huge and lofty tumuli which abound, and suggests the probability that many of

the well-chiselled and beautifully formed stone buildings and ornaments were
fashioned into their present shapes by stone implements only, all the arrow- and
spear-heads which he found being made of obsidian. The Indian king of these

parts had a palace at Quiche which, according to Torquemada, rivalled that of
Montezuma in Mexico. The enthusiasm with which Captain Carmichael describes

these old ruins will, I hope, secure the attention of the Section.

 --Two of our Secretaries, Mr. Clements Markliam and Mr. IMajor, will communicate

papers, the first being an outline of an elaborate work he is preparing on the history

and progress of all the surveys in India ; the latter on the long debated question of

the so-called Landfall of Columbus.

   Governor William Gilpin, of Colorado, who has recently reached our shores

from that grand central region of North America, will, I trust, favour us with a

sketch of that rich, metalliferous, mountainous country, which ten years ago he

thoroughly described, when he energetically advocated the execution of that

--Agigantic railroad which now happily connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans*.
Geo(jrapliical Education.  strong desire on the part of the Coimcil of the

Royal Geographical Society to induce the heads of our public schools to promote

the study of geographj', on a plan prepared by Mr. Francis Galtou, led us to offer

annually two medals, to be competed for in an examination directed by the Society.

It gratifies me to aimounco in this town that in the two years during which these
honom's have been distributed, the medals adjudicated each year have been won

by young men in the public schools of Lancashire, viz. Liverpool College, and

liossall School, near Fleetwood.

   WJien we consider that all the leading schools of the United Kingdom were

invited to compete for these honours (and several of them did so compete), the ftict

which I have just mentioned does great honour to this prosperous mercantile
county, which among its rising generation doubtless contains many a young

aspirant to win the fame of Raleigh.

   I may conclude this Address by dwelling for a few moments on the topics

--which, of all others, most interest myself, and I doubt not, the great majority of

my countrymen the explorations of inner Equatorial Afiica by Sir Samuel Baker,

Viceroy of Egypt has so liberally afforded liim, will surely add largely to oiur

acquaintance with the vast central and watery region on each side of the equator.

A letter which he wrote to me from Ivhartoum in March 1870, stated that, having

received in sections, on the backs of camels, all the vessels of his river and lake

flotilla from England, as prepared by Mr. Saniuda, he was full of hope and confident

of success. Recently, I have received a longer and most interesting letter from him,

which will be read at the present Meeting, and which graphically details the diffi-

Weculties over which he has triumphed to the present time.                  learn from this

November, can only reach Gondokoro much later than he anticipated : we have

further to reflect upon the fact that after arriving at that place his gi'eat difficulties

would commence; for, in the Baii country, peopled by negroes who have been

rendered furious and wretched by cruel slave-dealers of various nations, he would

also have to transport all his vessels and materials along the right bank of the Nile,

where the great stream flows over granitic rapids. He has also to carry all his

goods over the Assua River, a great tributary ot the Nile, by a wire or chain bridge,

which he had to construct. Having vanquished these obstacles, and having reached

that portion of the Nile in which his vessels could be launched, he would then sail

up the stream until he reached his own great lake, the Albert Nyanza. This

.accomplished, and cheered by his charming and devoted wife, he woidd be

thoroughly master of a position wholly unprecedented in the history of African

discovery *.

As I have ah'eady alluded to a very barbarous tract through which he would have

to pass, and which was formerly traversed by Speke and Grant, I would observe that

it is specially to such tracts that Baker holds instructions from the Khedive to

extirpate the cruel slave-dealers who have brought about these horrors by the

robbery of their ivory from the natives and the capture of women and children.

I specialh' m.ake this allusion, because a mistaken notion had arisen in Egypt that

Sir Samuel proceeded on a mission to abolish slavery altogether. Now, <as every
Egj-ptian household contains slaves as their only domestic servants, we leamt from

our Associate, Lord Houghton, when he visited the Suez Canal, that the Egyptians
were much prejudiced against Sir Samuel. But no such Quixotic and, I might

say, impossible task has been assigned to Baker, for domestic slavery is ingrained in

all parts of Africa as a regular institution of the land. Atrocious and cruel slave-

deahng and robbery may, however, be thoroughlyput an end to ; and this my friend

has already commenced, through the agency of Egyptian soldiers. Of his energy

in these philanthropic measures you will have a pregnant proof in the letter which

will be read to you. In this way the poor African serf may be assured that when

he sows his grain he will reap a crop at a future day.

I can well imagine the delight with Avhich Baker will define with his flotilla the

western boundary of his great lake, and delineate the course of those lofty moun-

tains on its western shore which he had only seen at a great distance in his former

Wejourney.    may also picture to ourselves how he would rejoice in exploring wide

tracts of that vast unknown interior in which large bodies of water lie, which are

supposed to feed the Congo. The point of the compass, however, which will bo

first sought by the intrepid A'oyager will, I doubt not, be the southernmost end of

the Albert Nyanza, because it is there that he hopes for the happiness of falling in

with and relieving his great contemporary Livingstone.

If, indeed, that indomitable missionary, who unquestionably stands at the head

of all African explorers, should succeed in tracing a connexion between the waters

of the Tang.anyika Lake, where he was when we last heard from him, and the

south end of the Albert Nyanza, why then the meeting of these two remarkable

men will be the happiest consummation of our wishes. And if that shoidd be

accomplished. Sir Samuel Baker himself will, I doubt not, cheerfully award the

greater share of glory to his fellow explorer, who will then liave proved himself to

be the real discoverer of the ultimate southern sources of the Nile.

In waiting for the solution of this great problem I adhere, in the meantime, to

the opinion which I previously expressed, that if Livingstone be still at or near

XJjiji on the Lake Tanganyika, to -which place supplies have been sent to him, he
will at once proceed to determine that problem, and will not think of a return to
England until the grand desideratum is carried out.

   Judging, indeed, from his own original observations respecting the coui'se of
those rivers which take their rise in 8° to 9° S. lat., and believing as he did that
most of them flow by the western side of Lake Tanganyika and do not enter that

lake, it seems to follow that, in pursuing a N.N.-westerly direction, several of these
waters must feed the Congo and so issue on the west coast. If such should prove

to be the fact, why then this great traveller will have been the first to determine

the true sources of both the Nile and the Congo.

   And here I would ask why any one who knows what Livingstone has undergone
should despair of his life simply because we have had no news from hiin during
the last fifteen months ? Did not much more than that period elapse whilst he was

in the heart of Africa without our receiving a word of comfort respecting him ?

By the last accounts he was hospitably received by Arabs who are friendly to the
Sultan of Zanzibar, who is Livingstone's patron and also a protector of the Negroes.

   I had written thus far, and all was in tj'pe, when I received a letter from Dr.
Kirk at Zanzibar, dated 29th June, 1870, which has comforted me exceedingly;
for, sanguine as I have been as to the safety and success of Livingstone, I am now

better supported than ever in my anticipation of his ultimate triumph. Dr. Kirk

thus writes :

   " News has reached me, by natives from the interior, that the road is now clear,

and that the cholera did not pass the town of Unyanyembe. Livingstone is there-

fore out of danger, and I hope the stores sent have now reached him. The rainy
season being at an end, Unyamwezi caravans are daily expected, and will no doubt

bring, if not letters from the Doctor himself, at least news of hiiu from the Arab

Governor of Unj-anyembe. The coast near Zanzibar is now healthy."
  Looking then, as I do, to the astonishing and enduring resolution of my friend,

and his thoroughly acclimatized constitution, remembering that he has already
gone successfully through privations imder which even his attached negro youths
all succumbed, I still hold stoutly to the opinion that, by reaching the Albert
Nyanza, he will determine the great problem of the watershed of South Africa, and

then return to embrace his children, to whom he is devotedly attached, and receive

the plaudits, not only of his admiring countrymen, but of all civilized men.
   Should this happy finale be brought about, he will have the great additional

delight of finding here his venerable father-in-law, the Eev. Eobert Mofi'at, who,
after half a century of successful missionary labours, is present at this Meeting

of the British Association.

   In conclusion, I have the honest satisfaction of knowing that, as President of the
Royal GeogTaphical Society, and as the sincere friend of Livingstone, I have, with

the warm aid of my deeply lamented friend the Earl of Clarendon, been successful
in urging om- Government to relieve the great traveller who was gazetted as Her

Majesty's Consul to all the kings and chiefs of the interior of Africa.
   I have only to add that if diplomatists are recompensed according to the energy

and capacity with which they execute their duties, I confidently anticipate that,

--on his retm-n to Britain, this uudaimted Envoy to unknown lands this sound

--geographer and zealous Chiistian missionary will not only receive a becoming

pension, but will also be honoured by some distinction of the Crown, which
assuredly our beloved Queen will gladly confer upon him.

         Letter from the Wliite Nile. By Sir Samuel Baker, F.R.G.S.

   In this letter, addressed to Sir Roderick Murchison, Sir Samuel Baker described
the proceedings of his expedition up to the 15th Jime last, and gave an interesting
account of the present condition of the White Nile. Previous to his departm-e from
Khartum, he had been assured that the Great White Nile had ceased to be a navi-
gable river. It appeared that the floating rafts of marsh vegetation, which, in
1865, caused an obstruction in the river between the mouths of the Ghazal and
Giraffe tributaries, having been neglected by the Khartum authorities, had in-

creased so much as to form now an impenetrable barrier. The vast masses of

floating islands continually brought down the stream had produced a new district

many miles in extent, beneath which flows the current of the river. The slave-

traders, thus shut out from direct communication with the field of their enterprise,

had, however, discovered a passage to the river beyond the banier, by the Bahr

Girafle, which proved therefore to be an arm of the Nile, instead of an independent
stream like the Sobat. In leaving Khartum with his flotilla. Sir Samuel resolved

to ascend by this newly discovered passage. He entered the lower mouth of the

Giraffe on the 17th February, in N. lat. 9° 26'. The water was 19 feet deep, and

the current about 3| mUes an hour, with a breadth, from bank to bank, of about
GO yards. At that time the river was about five feet below the high-water mark
of the flood-season. . The stream was winding, and had a mean course from the

south-west. Foiu- small granitic hills formed good land-marks in the boimdless

flats within 15 miles of the junction, and fine forests bordered the river for about

30 miles, diversified by plains of extremely fertile soil. As the expedition pro-

ceeded the woods ceased altogether, and the steamers depended on the supply of

fuel stored in the vessels in tow. At a distance of about 180 miles up the Giraffe

the di-y land  disappeared, and  they sailed  through    a  boundless   marsh                            the   river
                                                                                                      ;

narrowed, the current diminished, and at length progress was stopped altogether

by a dense growth of high grass. This was in lat. 7° 47' 46'', and 272 miles by

dead reckoning from the mouth. As the guides assured him that a passage really

existed through this to the main Nile, Sir Samuel set 1000 men to work to cut a

channel through the obstruction ; and, after thirty-two days' labour, a canal, eight

miles long, was made, but only to find the stream beyond too shallow to float his

steamers. He compared the marsh-grass to sugar-cane in thickness and tough-

ness ; and the tangled confusion of decaying vegetation beneath it, to a depth of
five or six feet, resembled a mixtm-e of fishing-nets, ropes, mud, sailors' swabs,
sponges, and canes, all compressed together in a firm mass, beneath which the

water was from ten to twelve feet deep ; while grass, about nine feet high, covered

the surface as far as the eye could reach from the mast-head. In the clear river,

beyond the obstruction, dry land appeared on either bank, and forests^ within two

miles. Herds of antelopes and buflaloes were on the plains, and the rifles secm'ed

a supply of meat, which was much needed. From the point where the vessels

grounded. Sir Samuel proceeded, with Lieutenant Baker, in a small rowing-boat,

hoping to find deep water further ahead ; but he foimd the river impassable, and
concluded that the Girafie was only practicable during the season of flood. The

whole flotilla of thirty-four vessels turned  back  the  way they   had     come                         and   as
                                                                                                   ;

the rainy season had set in, putting an end to further progi-ess, he established the

encampment, from which he wrote, at Towfikeeya, near the junction of the Giraffe

with the Nile. He intended to remain here till November, and then, with all his

force of 2000 men, cut a passage through the obstruction in the main river, on his

way to Gondokoro. He spoke cheerfully of his prospects ; his stores were aU

safely warehoused, and all his men in fair health. Since his settlement at Tow-
fikeeya he had liberated 305 slaves, who were being carried down the river by

slave-dealers ; half of them the property of the Turkish Governor of one of the

Nile settlements.

On the Great Movements of the Atmosphere. By Alexander Bttchan.

The author gave the results of an examination of the mean pressure of the at-

mosphere and the prevailing winds over the globe, based on barometrical averages

calculated for 516 places, and on the mean direction of the wind calculated for 203

places. The broad results were these :--In each hemisphere pressures are highest

in winter and lowest in summer. In winter; the highest, and in summer the lowest

pressures are over the continents ; and in winter very low pressures prevail in the
northern parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In Central Asia the summer

pressure is 0-900 inch less than in winter. This implies the removal in summer of

a stratum of atmosphere from the interior of Asia of about 900 feet in thickness.

Towards the regions where pressm-es were high, the winds flow from aU directions,

not directly towards  the centre,  but at angles  from   about  60  to  80  degrees                            and
                                                                                                            ;

from areas of high pressure the winds are found to flow out in every direction.

The inflow and outflow of winds are reducible to the single principle of gravitation

and so marked is this, that if there be any other force or forces which put the winds
in motion, they must be altogether insignificant as compared with gravitation.
The author gave, as the well-digested results of numerous observations, that there
was no general flow of the surface-winds of the north temperate zone towards and
from the polar regions ; the regions of high and low pressure were the true poles

of the winds.

                On the Physical Geography and Races of British India,

                             By Geokge Campbell, D.C.L.

     On the Ruined Cities of Central America. By Captain Caemichael.

   The author commenced by giTing a general descriptive account of these ruined
cities, and stated that, in his opinion, formed on piersoual investigation, the
architecture of the Aboriginal Indians of Central America was but a diversified

reproduction of that of Eastern countries. He then pointed out a number of simi-

larities in their architecture, designs, customs, &c. to those of the East, and showed
how, as a general ride, it was very difiicult to explore these ruins, owing to the

hostility of the existing tribes of Indians.

   As regards their antiquity, he assigned to many of them an earlier foundation

than that accorded by Messrs. Stephens and Squier, and adduced some very con-
vincing if novel proofs in support of his theory. The picture he drew of the palace
of Quiche, in Guatemala, fulh' bore out the statement of Torquemada, that they
rivalled those of Montezuma and he showed that if that city, whose foundation

                                                                                                                                                                    ;

has been authoritatively established as coeval with the commencement of a line of

sixteen reigns of kings fi'om Nimaquichi?, a king of Kichiquel, or, to speak briefly,

a city of some eight hundred years' standing, was some fifty years ago in such

thorough repair that the Padre of a neighboming Indian village, who walked
among its streets and palaces, imagined himself in Old Spain, what must be the

era of those numerous ruined cities compared to which Quiche was modern ?

   He then pointed out their great length, and added that, in connexion with this, a

remarkable fact had seemingly been overlooked by most Central American writers,

viz. that the stone buildings whose ruins we now find extant were used as temples,

palaces, and public ofllces generally, the poorer inhabitants living in palm-thatched
huts of a perishable nature, an arrangement which represented an almost incredible
amount of population.

   The author then proceeded to analyze the various elements composing the archi-
tecture of the ruined buildings and monuments, and gave an account of the various
uses to which the teocaH or tumuli were put by tlie Toltecan and Aztec priests,
viz. for sacrificial and burial purposes, to serve as beacons, as warlike defences, &:c.

He then explained the relations between the temples and alcazars or palaces, and

offered a few hints as to tlie deciphering of the hieroglyphics, a subject to which
he has paid much attention, showing that they chiefly were the works of the
Indian priesthood, and above aU were intended to inculcate moral and religious
precepts, chronological events being made entirely subservient, and pointed out their
analogy to the stone tablets of Moses, on which were engraven the ten command-

ments.

   The author r?fen'ed briefly to the round towers which contained the estufas for
the sacred fire of Montezuma in connexion with the worship of the sun, and passed

on to explain the nature and significance of the A^arious hideous idols to whom

human sacrifice was offered on the summit of the teocali, and stated it as his belief

that these idols, as well as all tlie planed stones, were carved with cliay or flint

instruments. He remarked that he had often found flint and obsidian imple-
ments, but in no instance an instrument of metal. He gave a detailed account of

a ruined city called Xmul, in British Ilondmas, which he claims to have discovered
and concluded by expressing his firm conviction in the belief of the existence in

the same splendid palaces and temples as in the days of the Spanish Conquest, and

whose priests inscribe fresh precepts on their tablets and altars, and who would
then read to us theu" now mystical hieroglyphics. He supported this statement
by giving an account of certain explorations he had made having this object in
view. He left these facts in the hands of those interested in scientific discoveries
and should sufficient interest in the matter bo awakened from what he had now

made known, it would be but another testimony to the valuable results derived

from these meetings of the British Association.

      Topogmpliical Slcctcli of tlie Zcrafslian VaUeij. By A. Fedchenko.

   The author was employed during 18G9 in a scientific exploration of the valley of

the Zerafshan river, in which is situated the city of Saniarcand. He penetrated

up the valley as far as the Fan ri^·er, one of four streams which by their union,
according to the natives, form the Zerafshan. The Lake Iskander Kul lies in the
mountains, separating the Zerafshan from the Oxus, at an altitude of 7000 to 8000
feet. The river-valley is bordered by moimtains of great elevation. Approaching
Samarcand the Zerafshan branches off into two channels, reuniting ten or twelve
miles lower down (below the city), near Khatyrchi, on the western frontier of the
new Russian province of Turkestan. The island thus formed is the richest and
most populous district of the entire valley. The country to the north of the river
is Steppe ; but a considerable portion of it is cultivated, and the road from Tash-
Kupriak to Samarcand, a distance of twenty miles, passes almost entirely by gar-
dens and fields. The gi-eat volume of water diverted by canals of irrigation from
the Zerafshan abundantly satisfies the thirsty ground. The islands formed by the
arms of the river have an exceedingly rich soil, and every inch is cultivated with
cotton, wheat, barley, rice, millet, or lucerne ; the \iUages are very numerous, and
all surrounded by gardens and irrigating canals. The river, rising in lofty, snow-
clad mountains, and having a rapid current at certain seasons, fertilizes as well as
waters the whole lower district thi-ough which it flows, by brinping down a large
quantity of earthy sediment. The author gave a description of the various large
towns in the valley, and the fairs held in them. In his description of Samarcand,
he stated that the city contained 1846 shops, 27 caravanserais, 7 baths, 86 Mesjids,

and 23 colleges ; the population is 30,000.

                Letter on Eastern TurTcestan. By T. D. Foesyth.

   Previous to his departure from Leh, on his present mission to the ruler of
Eastern Turkestan, tlie writer communicated to Sir Roderick Miirchison some notes
on geographical problems requiring to be solved in this little-known region and the
country further to the East. The Yarkand envoy had informed him that the
precious stones supposed to come from Khotan were obtained from Kharkhand, a
place under the sovereignty of the Chief of Kashgar, but situated forty days' march
to the east of Khotan. This place is not to be found in the best maps of the
Chinese Empire ; but it is mentioned by Marco Polo under the name of Uharchan,
which the commentators had supposed to be the same as Karashahar. It appears,
however, to be a distinct place, of large size, and situated in a rich country to the
north of Lhassa. The road to it, according to the envoy, skirts the foot of a range
of mountains, and crosses a large plain, through which run twelve large streams
flowing into Lake Loh, for so he pronounced Lake Lob. The Yarkand and Kash-
gar rivers, according to the same authority, do not flow into this lake, but lose

themselves in the desert. The inhabitants of the shores of Lake Lok live on fish,

                             By General W. Hbine, U.S.A.

   The author visited the Atlantic side of the isthmus eai'ly in the present year on
a mission intended to examine the correctness of the statements of M. Lacharme,
an engineer who explored the interval from the Tuyra River on the Pacific side
and the Cacarica branch of tlie Atrato on the Atlantic, and declared there were no

great obstacles to the construction of a canal at that point, the length to be cut

being only 52 miles, .and the greatest elevation only 186 feet. The author was not
able to ascend the Atrato, but all he saw went to confirm M. Lacharme's statements.
These he gave in detail, showing that they were foimded on a conscientious survey,
with all necessary scientific instruments. From his own observations and those of
the recent United States Survey, the author demonstrated the utter impractica-
bility of any other part of the isthmus for the purposes of an interoceanic canal,
and insisted upon the necessity of a further sui'vey by the line of the Atrato and

Cacarica.

                          On the Great Currents of the Atmosphere.

                By John K. Laughton, M.A., F.E.A.S., F.R.O.S.

   The author pointed out several geographical facts which were opposed to the
received theory of the trade-winds, known as Hadley's theor3^ Heat does not
cause a wind towards any of the principal areas of greatest temperature ; either

towards the Desert of Sahara, the Arabian Desert, the interior of Australia, the

Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, or even, when carefully traced, towards the Great
Prairie of North America. The effect attributed to the rotation of the earth also

is not consistent with numerous observed facts, such as the S.E. wind in the Gulf

of Mexico, the N.W. wind on the coast of North Africa, between Cape Verde and
Cape Palmas, the N.W. gales in the North Atlantic, the S.W. wind on the south
coast of Australia, and A'ery many others ; the idea, indeed, appeared to have been

formed in a temporary forgetfuluess of the power of friction, which in the case
of air is very intense. Winds which, in accordance with Pladley's theory, have
been very generally divided into polar and equatorial, seem more naturally to divide

themselves into easterly and westerly. As our experience grows larger, we learn

that the westerly winds have an extent and a power incompatible with the idea of
their secondary nature. They extend from 60° N. to 60° S., interrupted only by
the trade-winds. The trade-winds are small in comparison, and of very limited
height, the westerly winds blowing above them as strongly as they do both above
and near the sm-face in temperate zones. The westerly are really the primary
winds, whilst the equable trade-winds, of very limited volume, are reflex streams
of air caused by the impact of the great westerly winds on the continental barriers,
whether against mountain-ranges or against the more sluggish air which lies over

the land. In the Atlantic we see the main westerly stream of air dividing, on
about the parallel of 45° N., and turning north as a S.W. wind on our coasts, or
south as a N.W. and N. wind on the coast of Portugal. On the other hand, at the
extreme west,"the westerly wind continually dragging away the air fi'om the eastern
side of the Rocky Mountains, causes such a tendency towards a vacuum, that the
air from the south and north is induced towards it. It was impossible to say
definitely why the atmosphere should have this prevailing westerly motion, but the
author was inclined to seek its cause in the attraction of the heavenly bodies.

The Landfall of Columhus. By K. H. Major, F.S.A., Hon. Sec. E.O.S.

   It is surprising that after the lapse of nearly four centuries there should be any

doubt as to the spot in the New World which was first lighted on by Christopher

Columbus. In this paper the author set himself to show, not only that the name

which Columbus gave to that spot was for nearly two centuries applied to an

island to which it never belonged, but that among the advocates of various islands

for the honoiu' of being the true landfall the very latest had to be confuted, while

the one who had adduced the best arguments in fa,vom' of the correct island had

been gi-eatly at fault with respect to the point of anchorage. Columbus gave the

name of San Salvador to the island which he first discovered. Its Indian name

was Guanahani. In 179.3 Juan Bautista Munoz, in his 'Historia del Nuevo

Mundo,' declared his belief that Guanahani was WatUng's Island, in contravention

of the maps which from the beginning of the eighteenth century had given the name

of San Salvador to Cat Island. In 182o Navarrete, in his ' Coleccion de los Viages

y descubrimieutos que hicieron por mar los Espaiioles desde fin del siglo xv.,"
believed it to be Turk's Island. In 1828 Washington Irving, in his ' Life of Co-

lumbus,' decided in favour of Cat Island, relying mainly on Captain Slidell Mac-

kenzie's interpretation of the 'Diary of Columbus;' and in 1837 this conclusion

received the weighty approval of the Baron Alexander von Humboldt in his

' Examen Critique de I'llistoire de la Geographic du nouveau Continent.' In 1856

the claims of Watling's Island found a fresh champion in Capt. Becher, of the

Hydi'ographic Office, in his work entitled the ' Landfall of Colimibus ; ' but in 1864,

and again so late as 1869, Senhor de Vamhagen, in his ' Verdadera Guanahani de

Colon,' has put in a claim for the island of Mayaguana. The author of the paper

first examined these respective claims by the light of the ' Diary of Columbus ' him-

self, the real fountain-head of information upon the subject; and having shown

therefrom that the arguments in favour of Cat Island, Turk's Island, and Maya-

guana were untenable, proceeded to fix the identity of Guanahani with Watling's

Island by a process which reduced the chances of eiTor to a minimum. He pro-

duced a facsimile diagram of a map of the Bahamas published in 1601 by Herrera,

the official historiographer of the Indies in Spain, and laid down by him from the

original documents in the handwritingof Columbus and his contemporaries, which, in

his official position, he had under his special charge. The value of this authoritative

map was all the greater that it was constructed before any question was raised on

the point in dispute ; it was new enough to contain all the islands in their approxi-
mately correct position, but old enough to contain, not only the name of Guanahani,

but a large proportion of ancient names identical with those at present existing.

Side by side with this was a diagram made from the Admiralty Survey, showing

these islands as now known, and with their modern names. Out of twenty-four

islands thus brought under comparison, ten retained, in the modern map, the same

names as they held in the old, thus affording valuable stations for accurate com-

parison. Of these ten, one was Senhor de Varnhagen's Mayaguana itself, which was

represented,  toe/ether with the island of  Guanahani, on Herrera's map                                                                                                                                           so that His
                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

Excellency's claim was completely neutralized, since by no possibility could two

islands be made identical which were so markedly distinct as to have several other

islands lying between them. The comparison between the two diagrams plainly

showed that Guanahani was Watling's Island. But while thus demonstrating the

coiTectness of the conclusions of Munoz and Capt. Becher on this head, the

author entirely disagxeed with the latter as to the point where the Admiral first

anchored off that island, and also as to his movements while there. Capt. Becher

makes Columbus anchor a little to the south of the N.E. point of the island ; and
when he tripped his anchor, makes him sail round the northern end of the island.

He also makes Columbus's ship follow the boats in their reconnaissance. Not one

of these statements or conclusions is in accordance with the ' Diary,' nor would such

a movement lead to the topogTaphical discoveries recorded. The ' Diary' says that

Columbus took the ship's boat and the caravel's barges and went along the island

in a N.N. E. direction to see the other part of the island to the eastward ; and as the

trending of the .southern part of the east side of the island is itself N.N.E., it is

clear that such a movement necessitates starting from a point on the S.E. of the
172 REPORT--1870.

island. This very manifest ftict is in accordance witli the discoveries made by
Columbus on the island, and also with what took place when Columbus left his
moorings for the second island, for he then saw several islands, and was doubtful
which he should visit first. This would really be the case when starting from
the S.E. point of Watliug's Island, but would not hold good if he started from the
anchorage assigned by Capt. Becher; so that the author has here, for the first

time, demonstrated that the first anchorage of Columbus in the New World was

oli* the south-east point of Watling's Island.

      Journey into the Interior of Hadramaut. By "Weeisteii Mitnzinger.

   The author, after recovering from woimds received in Abyssinia, accompanied
Capt. Miles on an excursion eastward from Aden towards the interior of Arabia.
The region traversed aboimded in Himyaritic inscriptions and in other vestiges of
remote civilization. The travellers went by sea as far as Bir Ali, and travelled

thence into the interior for a distance of about 300 mUes, their furthest point
being a place called Ilabban, 3000 feet above the level of the sea. Their route

was laid down by compass bearings, and they took barometric observations for
height. From Bir Ali the country formed a plain with a gentle slope inland,
nearly covered by isolated hills and ridges of sandstone with flat tops, all of the
same height, about 1500 feet above the plain, and quite destitute of vegetation:

the very narrow strips of alluvial soil in the rapines, not one-tenth of the whole,
are alone capable of cultivation but these are generally well cared for, and yield

                                                                                                                                                                              ;

three and even four crops in the year, being irrigated by wells. These patches
form a number of oases with a dense population and towns of several thousand
inhabitants. The people cultivate dates, millet, wheat, and the Abyssinian grain
called tef. Water is generally met with, in boring, about fifty feet from the sur-
face. Beyond this region, and further inland, thej' came to what M. Munzinger
called a granitic and metamorphic land, with roimded hills boimding several wide
plains. Here there was more vegetation, with some fine trees ; and wild hogs,
gazelles and herds of cattle were met with. The people belonged to different
races, and the Himyaritic language was not entirely lost or forgotten, in spite of
1200 years of Islam. But all spoke Arabic, though in a very strange dialect;
there was an absence of religious feeling and of regular government, and civiliza-
tion was at a very low ebb, the only sign of it being the very large houses with
several stories, each of them a castle in itself. The travellers met with little hos-
pitality, but were not actually ill-treated. At Ghorab they were near the Desert
of Akhaf, described by Wrede, and the Bahr el Safli, or Sea of Saffi, so called from
King Saffi, who, in an attempt to cross the desert, disappeared with his entire army.
The desert was described as an immense sandy plain, covered with numberless un-
dulating hills, which gave it the appearance of a moving sea, and as lying 1000
feet below the level of the gi-anitic land. On the desert are white patches formed
of impalpable powder, into which if a plummet with a sixty-fathom line is thrown,
the whole slowly disappears. In one of these quicksands the ill-omened King

Saffi and his host found a tomb. The whole region of Hadramaut and Yemen is

full of curious legends, and abounds in geographical and historical questions of the
deepest interest. The author confessed that the excui'sion of Capt. Miles and
himself formed but a small contribution to our knowledge of Arabian geography,
but hoped it would incite other travellers to explore this nearly unknown laud.

regarding the site of the traditional Garden of Eden of the Hebrews. He re-

marked, in the first place, that on examining the early traditions of nations, "we

invariably found the Heaven-land, tlie abode of the gods, the connecting-link

between divinity and humanity, to lie in that region of the earth from which the

recording race took its intellectual origin. In illustration of this he need only

refer to the Olympus of the Greeks and the Merit of the Aryans, which latter had

three sites, accoi-ding to the habitat of tlie three branches                        of the  Aryan race                                               the
                                                                                                                                                   ;

Persians, or Western Aryans, placing their Iran-vij in the Paropamisus, while the

Meru of the Central Aryans was in Pamir, and of the Eastern about the Sacred Lakes

in Thibet, and in each of these there were supposed to be fom- rivers flowing from

a common centre. There was ground, then, for supposing the Paradise of the

Hebrews to lie in that region which was the cradle of the nation, namely, near

Ur of the Chaldees, which the author had been able to demonstrate, from cunei-

form inscriptions, to have been situated on the lower Euphrates, at the place now

called Muzheir. The name of " Hebrew " was also derived from the same locality,

the zone, or belt, of alluvial land between the river and the tertiary formation
having the specific title among the Arabian geogi'aphers of Ihr, or " the bank ; " so

that Ibri was a perfectly correct ethnic title for the Abrahamic emigrants. Fur-

ther, the author suggested that Gan-eden, which we translate " Garden of Eden,"

was nothing more than the Hebrew rendering of one of the old vernacular names

of Babylonia, which was Gana-duni (or, with the case-ending, Gana-dmni/as),

Gana signifying apparently " an enclosure," while Vuni or Aduni was one of the

earliest gods worshipped in the country. Without, however, insisting on this

identification of the name of the covmtry, he would rely mainly on the names and

attributes of the four rivers which watered the garden, and which were evidently

intended, as Kalish has remarked, to furnish an exact geographical description of

Eden. These rivers, as it is well known, were Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel, and

Euphrates. Now the land of Babylonia was constantly illustrated in the cunei-

form inscriptions by the names of four rivers, two of wliich answer to the Tigris

and the Euphrates, and the other two were named tlie Surrapi and the Ukni. The

latter two were Assyrian terms, and their Babylonian equivalents had not yet been

identified. The Surrapi seemed, however, to answer partly to the Biblical Gihon,

and Ukni to the Pison, and they represented respectively the left hand, or eastern

arm of the Tigiis, and the right hand, or western arm of the Euphrates.

Regarding the Pison, it is said in Genesis, "The name of the first is Pison,

that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold ; and

the gold of that land is good : there is bdellium and the onj-x stone." The name
Pisun, coming from the Hebrew verb "to disperse," signifies " the overflow;" and

as in all ages there has been an outlet to the Euphrates above Babylon, where the

flood drains oft' to the south-east, varying constantly in its com-se and name, and as
Ukiii'h&d. been shown on independent grounds to mean " the onyx," or "the onyx-

river" (though probably the term really refers to alabaster, quarries of which existed

just outside the Euphrates alluvium), the author considered there was good reason

for identifying the stream with the Pison of Genesis. Bdellium he considered to

mean "pearls " (Bedolat), which were obtained at the mouth of the river, from the

banks in the Persian Gulf; and the land of Havilah he believed to be tlie strip of

sandy desert which  skirts  the  Ai-abian  upland                                    Haul siguifnng simply " sand."
                                                                                  ;

With regard to the Gihun, or the river "which compasseth the whole land

of Cush," his theory was, that in very early times the left branch of the Euphrates,

which left the main river just above Babjion and ran due east to the Tigris, was

considered to be the same as the left arm of the Tigris itself, that arm being

prolonged in the same line to the eastward, while the right arm of the Tigris was

considered to be the true continuation of the upper course of the river following

the same general direction of south-east. In a rough way, it might be said that the

left arm of the Euphrates thus crossed the Tigris and formed the Gihun. He justified

this theory on philological grounds, showing that the left arm of the Tigris had

retained the name of GiiM, absolutely identical with the Hebrew reading of Gihon,

almost to the present day, and discussed the whole subject in some detail. As

to the description of the Gihun as "encompassing the whole land of Gush"

(which, by a very bold guess, our translators had rendered " Ethiopia"), " Cush," or
--174 REPORT 1870.

"Kish," was one of the primitive capitals of Babylonia, and it gave its name
apparently to the whole country along the river. " Kiisiya " was mentioned in
that quarter among the possessions of Darius Ilystaspes. Various other reasons
for this identification were adduced.

   The third river oft'ered fewer difSculties, as no one had ever doubted that the
Heddekel was the Tigris. The fourth river was Perat, or the Euphrates. In the
inscriptions the word is often represented by the sign for " water," in the same
way as it is called in Scriptm-e " the great river ;" but usually the upper river has
the name of Purat, where we have probably a very ancient root, signifying " to
abound" or " fructify," common to both the Aryan and Semitic tongues ; the lower
river, below the Pison branch, is called in the inscriptions the river of Sippara,
from the town of that name.

Early Traditions regarding ilie River Oxus.

By Major-Gen. Sir H. Eawlinson,^.C.5., LL.D., D.C.L., F.B.8., SfC. \

   Whether Bournouf was right or not in regarding the term Pamir (the region in

which the Oxus takes its rise) as a contraction of Upd Mem, "the country above

Mount Meru," and in thus associating the name directly with the holiest spot in

the Brahmanical Cosmogony, the author of the paper thought it was certain that

the geographical indications of the Puranas all pointed to this quarter of Central

WeAsia as the site of the primaeval Aryan Paradise.  were not, however, limited

to Sanscrit authorities in studying this subject ; the Puranas were supplemented

by the traditions and travels of the Buddhists, and in these later sources of infor-

mation we often find evidence of so direct a nature aa almost to meet the require-

ments of modern science. Thus, in regard to the four rivers of the Aryan Paradise,

which were named by the Brahmans, 1, the Sita; 2, the Alakananda ; 3, the Vakh-

shu ; and 4, the Bhadra, the Buddhists varied both the order and the nomenclature,
classing the foiu' rivers as, 1, the Ganges ; 2, the Indus ; 3, the Oxus ; and 4, the

Sita ; and, fiu'ther, deriving them from a great central lake, which was named
A-neou-ta, and one of the representatives of which was either the Kara-kul or the

Sarik-kul Lake of Pamir. The Buddhist traveller Hiouen-thsang in a.d. G44

recog-nized in the Tsung-ling, or Pamir chain, the Su-merii. of his national cosmo-

graphy. Capt. Wood, in the account of his journey to the som-ces of the Oxus,

had furnished us with an explanation of the origin of the old legend of a four-

rivered Paradise. He observes that " the hills and mountains which encircle Sir-
i-kul, give rise to some of the principal rivers in Asia. From the ridge at its

eastern end flows a branch of the Yarkand river, one of the largest streams that

waters Chinese Tartary, while fi-om the low hills on the northern side rises the

Sirr, or River of Kokan, and from the snowy chain opposite, both forks of the Oxus

as well as a branch of the River Kxmer are supplied. ' Although the position of

these various streams is now known to be incorrect, we had a right to infer that

the many-rivered wealth of Pamir had so impressed the imagination of the primi-

tive Aryan colonists that in their subsequent migi'ations towards the south, and

with a more extended geographical knowledge, they transferred the physical
features of the fatherland to the abode of Brahma and the gods, precisely in the

same way as the Semitic Jews, after being transplanted to the coast of Syria,

preserved in their delineation of the terrestrial Paradise the memoi-y traditionally

handed down of their old habitat in Babylonia between the Tigris and the Euphrates.

Another Aryan legend confirmed this presumed connexion between the head-

streams of the Oxus and the several rivers of Asia which were fabled to fall from

heaven upon Mount Meru, thence to flow to the suiTOunding world. One version of
the Purauic legend described the rivers flowing from Mount Meru as seven ; and

this had its parallel in the popular geography of Pamir, for the region of the Upper
Oxus was known to the Ii-anian division of the Aryan race by the name of the

Country of the Seven Rivers. The passage in the Vendidad to this effect was

confirmed by Abu Eihan El-Biruni, a very competent authority. The author

believed that a critical examination of the geography of the Puranas might lead to

some curious results as to the period and track of the various Aryan migrations.

    Journey to ilie Upper Waters of the Niger. By W. "Winwood Reade.

   In the course of his recent journey of exploration in the interior of Western
Africa, undertaken under the auspices of the Royal Geogi-aphical Society, and at
the cost of Mr. A. Swanzy, the author penetrated to Farabana, on the Upper Niger,

and to Boure, celebrated for its gold-fields, 450 miles from Sierra Leone. He

returned from Sierra Leone to Falaba, on his second attempt to reach the Niger, at
the end of Jime, 1869, and within a month of starting had the pleasure of beholding
the gi'eat river, at the large and previously imknown town of Farabana. The Niger
here was only 100 yards broad, and canoes for the passage of travellers were only

--used during the rainy season. The Upper or Western Niger had been previously

visited by travellers at two points, by Mimgo Park ftt Segon and by Caillie con-
siderably higher up ; but the point reached by the author was the highest yet

--attained, and he claimed to have discovered the shortest and best route yet known

from SierraLeone to the river a discovery which would eventually lead to important
commercial results, and which established the singular fact of the lise of the river
within so short a distance of the sea into which it flows.

             On the Basin of Lake Titicaca. By E. G. SatirEE,

   The author gave the result of his recent explorations, in company with Prof. A.
Kaimondy, in the district of Lake Titicaca, in South Peru. The elevated plain in
which this lake, as well as that of Aullagas, is situated, forms a ten'esti-ial basin,
termed by the author the Thibet of America. It has an estimated length of between
500 and 600 miles, its width varying from 100 to 200 miles, the total area being
calculated at about 100,000 square miles. Its eastern border is bounded by the
loftiest part of the Andes, a vast unbroken, snow-crowned range, whose lowest peaks
rival Chimborazo in altitude. The slope of the Titicaca basin is gentle towards

the south, and the waters of the lake lie at the gi'eat elevation of 12,864 feet above

the level of the sea. Some of its tributaries are scarcely fordable even in the dry

season ; and its waters are discharged through a broad, deep and swift, but not

turbulent stream. El Desaguadero, into Lake Aullagas ; it is therefore a freshwater

lake. The Desaguadero is about 170 miles long, and has a faU of not far from 500

feet. Of Lake Aullagas, which the author did not visit, almost nothing is known.

The maximimi length of Titicaca is nearly 120 miles, and its gi-eatest width between

40 and 60 miles. The lake had been explored by Mr. Pentland in 1827-28 and in

18.37; and his chart, published by the Admiralty, was still the most trustworthy

guide to its geographical features. Messrs. Squier and Eaimondy navigated it for

three weeks in an open boat, and the author of the paper bore testimony to the

general accuracy of Mr. Pentland's observations. There were, however, some errors,

and these he had rectified in a map he (]\Ir. Squier) had published. The eastern,

or Bolivian shore of the lake is abrupt, but the western and southern shores are

relatively low ; and the water in the bays and estuaries is grown up with reeds and

rushes, amid which myriads of water-fowl find shelter and support. The roads

across the marshes are stone causeways of Inca origin. It was easy to see that the

lake once covered a much larger area than it now occupies. In many places, aline

of 100 fathoms did not reach the bottom. The diflerence of level between the dry

and wet seasons amounted to from 3 to 5 feet. The dry season leaves bare a large

tract of land, covered with a kind of tender lake weed, called in the Quichua lan-

guage llacta, and this supports herds of cattle at a time when the pasturage of the

drier coimtry is withered. The lake never freezes over, but ice forms near its shores

and where the water is shallow. Its waters during the winter months are from

10° to 15° Fahr. warmer than the atmosphere, and therefore exert a favourable

influence over the climate of its shores and islands. The prevailing winds are from

the north-east, whence they often  blow with  great  force                       and  severe  storms are
                                                                              ;

not infrequent. The efibrts to place steamers on the lake have failed, chiefly owino*

to the scarcity of fuel. The population of the neighbourhood consists chiefly of

Aymara Indians, between whom and the Quichuas there is physically a marked

difference.

On the South-African Gold-fields. By Captain Sir John SwiNBtTRNE, Bart.

The part of South Africa treated of by the author was the district lying between

the Limpopo and the Zambesi rivers, and between 27° E. long, and the Indian
Ocean. The shoi-test practicable route to it is by way of Port Natal and Harrismith.

There is no public conveyance between Maritzburg and Hanismith, a distance of

150 miles, and the road is very bad, as all the rivers and valleys are crossed at right

angles. The Drakensberg is crossed on the road at an altitude of 6400 feet. From

Harrismith to Potchefstroom, a distance of 190 miles, the countrj^ is undulating

and almost destitute of wood. Seventy -five miles further Rustenburg is reached,

the sea. The .Southern Gold-fields, as far as the actual metal has been found,
extends from N.W. to S.E., a distance of forty miles by fourteen miles broad.

There are five different mines within a mile of the settlement ; two three miles to

the south-east, one thirteen miles north ; two twelve miles, and one thirty-five

miles up the river, to the north-west of tlie settlement ; making a total of eleven

mines which have actually been worked and gold extracted. Besides these there

are numerous other reefs where gold has been discovered ; but these have not

yet been worked. In most of the mines two shafts have been sunk to

an average depth of fifty feet, and all are upon the site of ancient workings.

The original miners appear to have worked the reefs more in the manner of

quan'ics than mines, leaving great holes or pits. There are two descriptions of

--quartz, one red and honeycombed, the other of a bluish -grey appearance, the gold

in the latter being coarser, but more easily discriminated than in the red ore. The

climate of the gold country is very healthy. From the end of April to October no

rainfalls; the other months are subject to violent thunder-storms, but there is

scarcely a day without some hours of fine weather : the nights are always cold, in

June the thermometer falling as low as 38° Fahr. about an hour before simrise,

while it ranges as high as 88° or 90° during the day. The prevailing wind for nine

months of the year is S.E., blowing strong during the day, and dying away at

sunset. The Northern Gold-fields lie 327 miles to the N.N.E. of the Tati, in the

Zambesi basin, their northern part being the Umfidi river (the Tole or Banyeka of

Livingstone's map), and their southern boundary the Bembees. The latitude of

the principal workings is 18° 11' S., and the longitude 30° 34' E., and they are distant

205 miles from Tete, and IGO miles due south of Zumbo, on the Zambesi ; at present

they have not been veiy productive. The countiy is densely peopled by the Mes-

huna nation, industrious workers in iron and earthenware, and growing all kinds

of grain and pulse. The author, who visited these previously almost unknown

people, gave a sketch of their recent dealings with the invading Matabele Caflres,

On the Harlours of Western India. By Capt. Taylor, (late) I.N.

During his service in the late Indian navy of nineteen years' duration, the author

has been employed in surveying various harbours hitherto unused on the western

coast of India                                                      aud as  the results of these surveys, showing the                                                    existence of har-

prised to learn last spring that "the Viceroy has applied to the Home Government

to send out a civil engineer, possessed of special experience, to be employed in'

examining' the coast of India, with the view of discovering sites for ports." Among

the ports surveyed by the late Indian Navy were, first, Poshetra and Seraia, or

Kanibalia, situated at the entrance of the Gulf of Kutch, and sheltered from all

the prevailing winds. Either of them is capable of receiving the largest iron-clad

of the navy. Seraia might be compared to the Mersey, and Poshetra was some-

thing between Cork Harbour and Milford Haven, without their hilly features. No

expensive breakwaters were needed, and they simply required lights and beacons

to guide vessels in and out, wharves for ships to lie alongside, and roads in the

interior to briug down produce. Since the opening of the Suez Canal, the northern

position of these ports, which previously would have been a disadvantage, has

become one of their strongest recommendations. They are 300 miles to windward

of Bombay, i. e. nearer to Aden, in the south-west monsoon, the season when the

fresh crops require carriage to Europe. Neither steamer nor large sailing-vessel

would find real difficulty in getting out of the Gulf of Kutch. The author found

that the strong winds of the south-west monsoon blew only for three or fom- days

at a time, and then abate for a day or two. The Mualims, or pilots of Kutch, are

a caste deservedly famous for skill and daring ; many of them have quadrants and

nautical tables, and can determine the latitude by sun and pole-star, and their lon-

gitude by dead reckoning. Some of their boats are large, well built, and decked,

and carry a pair or two of carronades. Large native vessels coming from the Ma-

labar and African coasts can now, after the commencement of the south-west

Amonsoon, boldly run into the gulf.         third important harbour on the coast of

Katiawar was Chanch Bunder, formed by Shalbet Island, and surveyed by the late
Capt. R. Ethersay. Southward of Bombay there was the excellent harboiu* of the

Rajpuri, or Jinjera river, without the usual bar of sand that is found at most river-

mouths along this coast, but having 3| and 8f fathoms at low tide, and 4^ fathoms
inside in mid-channel. Next to this, following a southerly direction, was the

Jyghur, or Shastri river, the principal channel to which has 3 fathoms at low tide.

Kalbadevi Bay, Viziadroog, Desghur, Sedashighur Tudri, or Mirjan river, and

various other ports capable of being made serviceable in our commerce with

India, were also described ra some detail.

On Windward Great Circle Sailing. By John T. Towson, F.B.G.S.

The author referred to the tables constructed by him, and published by the

Admiralty twenty-four years since, in which he pointed out the value of wind-
ward gTeat circle sailing. The other modification of this sailing had been brought

into successful use ; but windward sailing, although it appeared most simple, had
been generally misunderstood by practical men. Some had obtained charts having

great circle routes laid down. If they were driven from this track by adverse

winds, they returned as soon as the wind would permit them, not perceiving that
when they had quitted one great circle there was another great circle, which was

their nearest route. Others imagined that this sailing consisted in going a certain

--number of miles to the northward. The rule was simple : " Find the great circle

course, and put the ship on that tack which is the nearest to the great circle
course." In January last he was invited by Mr. Ashbury to prepare sailing-direc-

tions for the ' Cambria' yacht. The directions which he prepared were shown by

a chart. It consisted of the great circle com-se, corrected for variation for every

part of the Atlantic that it was probable that a vessel should pass. All the ma-

riner had to do was to ascertain his approximate position, and then he would find

by inspection how to keep the ship's head by compass. The distance from the

Elace of destination was also given by another chart, containing the position of
  oth yachts at noon for each day. Mr. Towson showed that the ' Cambria ' saved

the race by superior navigation. This sailing gave the greatest advantage when

the distance oi longitude was greatest ; and thus the ' Cambria ' attained all the

advantage that this sailing could afford in the first five days, which was about
110 miles; afterwards the superior power for an ocean race possessed by the
' Dauntless ' prevailed, and reduced this advantage to a minimum.

178 REPORT--1870.

   The principal objection that of late has been raised against great circle sailing is
"the series of ever-changing courses which a vessel must pursue." This is correct
with regard to true courses ; but it will be seen, by reference to the large chart,
that compass courses across the North Atlantic vary less than those on a rhumb

or on a parallel.

Notes on Analogies of Manners hetiueen the Indo- Chinese and tJie Races of the

                   Malay Archipelago. By Col. H. Yule, C.B.

The author believed the Malayan race to be closely connected with the Indo-

Chinese, although their language, which is not one of monosyllables, marked a

great present distinction. He had seen faces of natives from Java, on the one

hand, and of natives of Burmah and of the mountains on the eastern frontiers of

Bengal on the other, as near identity as human faces ever are ; whilst there are

many particulars common to the customs and peculiarities of the two regions

which seem to argue a close relationship. One of these common traits is the

aversion to the use of milk ; in Bali, where alone among the islands the Vedas
still exist, a preparation from the cocoa-nut is substituted for ghee in the Hindoo

rites. Another is the wilful staining of the teeth; and the singular custom of
covering the teeth entirely with a case of gold, noticed by Marco Polo among a

people of Western Yunnan, existed, at least recently, in Sumati'a, Timor, and at

Macaisar. The extravagant enlargement of the ear-lobe is also common to most

of the tribes of both regions. Another coincidence is an idiom of language of

remote origin, in which a term is added to a numeral in the enumeration of objects,

analogous to our word " head " in expressing a number of cattle, and of which

there are a large number of cases in the Malay language. Precisely the same

peculiarity is found in the Bm-mese, Siamese, and Chinese tongues ; and the pro-

pensity may be referred to a dislike to abstract numbers. The savage mania of

hunting for heads, generally by nocturnal ambuscade, and of treasuring them as

trophies, is found, with almost identical circumstances, among the wild Dayaks

and Kayans of Borneo and Celebes, and the wild Kukis, Nagas, and Garos of the
Aeastern frontier of Bengal.
                              superstitious abstinence from certain articles of

diet, which is hereditary and binding among certain families only, is foimd here

and there with remarkably coincident circumstances among the tribes of both

regions. Another very notable custom is the association of the whole of the

families of one village or community in one or in several great houses or barracks.

This appears to be general among some of the Dayak tribes of Borneo and among

the rude natives of the Pagi islands, oft' the west coast of Sumatra. The very

same practice is found among the Singphos, north of Burmah, and among the

Mekirs and Mishmis of the Assam border. The practice of ordeal by water is

found, with singular exactness of agreement in the circumstances, at intervals over

both the regions compared. No one can doubt the common origin of the music

and musical instruments of Burmah and Java, vastly superior as they are in spirit

and in melody to any thing called music in India proper ; there is also an extra-

ordinary similarity of dramatic entertainments in Burmah, Siam, and Java.

The author concluded by stating that these and many other coincidences which

he detailed were singly of no value as argumeiits for some originnl close bond of

kindred, as isolated coincidences occur between the practices of the most distant

tribes of the earth, but that their great number must be admitted to have great

weight, especially considering the contiguity of the two regions.

            ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

  Address hy Professor W. Stanley Jevons, M.A., President of the Section.

The field of knowledge which we cultivate in this Section is so wide, that it would

be impossible, in any introductory remarks, to notice more than a few of the im-
portant questions which claim our attention at the present time.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               179

The name Statistics, in its true meaning, denotes all knowledge relating to the

condition of the State or people. I am sorry to observe, indeed, that many persons

now use the word statistical as if it were synonymous with numerical ; but it is a
mere accident of the information with which we deal, that it is often expressed

in a numerical or tabular form. As other sciences prog:-ess, they become more a

matter of quantity and number, and so does our science ; but we must not suppose

that the occurrence of numerical statements is the mark of statistical infonnation.

In order, however, that any subject can be titly discussed by a Section of this As-

Wesociation, it should be capable of scientific treatment.  must not only have facts,

numerical or otherwise, but those facts must be analyzed, arranged, and explained

by inductive or deductive processes, as nearly as possible identical with those which

have led to undoubted success in other branches of science. 1 have always felt
great gratification that the foimders of this Association did not in any narrow
spirit restrict its inquiiies and discussions to the domain of physical science. The

existence of this Section is a standing recognition of the truth that the condition

of the people is governed by definite laws, however complicated and difficidt of

discovery they may be. It is no valid reproach against us that we cannot measure,

and explain, and predict vrith the accuracy of a chemist or an astronomer. Diffi-

cult as may be the problems presented to the experimentalist in his investigation
of material nature, they are easy compared with the problems of human nature,
of which we must attempt the solution. I allow that our knowledge of the causes

in action is seldom sure and accurate, so as to present the appearance of true

.science.

   There is no one who occupies a less enviable position than the political econo-

mist. Cultivating the frontier regions between certain knowledge and conjecture,

his efforts and advice are scorned and rejected on all hands. If he arrives at a sure

law of human nature, and points out the evils which arise from its neglect, he is
fallen upon by the large classes of people wlio think their own common sense suffi-

cient ; he is charged with being too abstract in his speculations, with overlooking

the windings of the human heart, and with undervaluing the afiections. However
humane his motives, he is lucky if he escape being set down on aU sides as a heart-
less misanthrope. Such was actually the fate of one of the most humane and ex-
cellent of men, the late Mr. Malthus. On the other hand, it is only the enlightened
and wide-minded scientific men who treat the political economist with any cor-
diality. I much fear that, as physical philosophers become more and more suc-

cessfiil, they tend to become, like other conquerors, arrogant and selfish ; they forget
the absurd theories, the incredible eri'ors, the long enduring debates out of which

their own knowledge has emerged, and look with scom upon our economic science,
our statistics, or our still more vague body of knowledge called social science, be-
cause we are still struggling to overcome difficulties far gi-eater than ever they

encountered. But, again, I regard the existence of this Section as a satisfactory

recognition of the absolute necessity of doing our best to cultivate economic sub-

jects in a scientific spirit.

The gi-eat and everlasting benefits which physical science has confeiTed upon the

human race are on every side acknowledged yet they are only the smaller half of
                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

what is wanted. It daily becomes more apparent that the highest successes in

the scientific arts and manufactures are compatible with deep and almost hopeless

Wepoverty in the mass of the people.  subdue material nature, we spin and

weave, and melt and forge with a minimum of labour and a maximum of result
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            j

but of what advantage is all this while human nature remains unsubdued, and a

large part of the population are too ignorant, careless, improvident, or vicious to

appreciate or accumulate the wealth which science brings. Chemistry cannot

analyze the heart ; it cannot show us how to temper the passions or moidd the

habits. The social sciences are the necessary complement to the physical sciences,
for by their aid alone can the main body of the population be rendered honest,

temperate, provident, and intelligent.

   In this kingdom dm-ing the last thirty or forty years we have tried a mighty
experiment, and to a great extent we have failed. The growth of the arts and

manufactures and the establishment of free trade have opened the vddest means
of employment and brought an accession of wealth previously unknown : the fi'e-

                                                                                                 12*

quent remission of taxes has left the working classes in fuller enjoyment of their

wages ; the poor laws have Ijeen reformed and administered with care, and the
emigi'ation of millions might well have been expected to leave room for those that

remain. Nevertheless within the last few years wo have seen pauperism almost as

prevalent as ever, and the slightest relapse of trade throws whole towns and classes

of people into a state of destitution little short of famine. Such a melancholy fact

is not to be charged to the pohtical economist ; it is rather a veriiication of his

unheeded warnings                                                                              it is precisely what Malthus would have predicted of a popu-
                                                                                            ;

lation which, while supplied with easily earned wealth, is deprived of education

and bribed by the mistaken benevolence of the richer classes into a neglect of the

future, what can we expect while many still believe the proverb that " Where
God sends mouths. He sends food," and while a great many more still act upon it?

   I am glad to say that, ic spite of all opponents, we have an education act. Three

centuries ago the State re ognized the principle that no person should be allowed

to perish for want of bread ; for three centuries the State has allowed the

people to perish for want of mind and knowledge. Let us hope much from this

tardy recognition of the greatest social need, but let us not withdraw our attention

from many other causes of evil which still exist in full force. I wish especially to-

point out that the wise precautions of the present poor law are to a great extent

counteracted by the mistaken humanity of charitable people. Could we sum up

the amount of aid which is, in one way or other, extended by the upper to the

lower classes, it would be almost of incredible amount, and woidd probably far

exceed the cost of poor-law relief. But I am sorry to believe that, however great

the good thus done, the evil results are probably greater. Nothing so surely as

indiscriminate charity tends to create and perpetuate a class living in hopeless

poverty. It is well known that those towns where charitable institutions and

charitable people most .abound are precisely those where the helpless poor are most

niunerous. It is even shown by Sir Charles Trevelyan, in a recent pamphlet, that

the casual paupers have their London season and their country season, following

the movements of those on whom they feed. Mr. Goschen and the poor-law au-

thorities have of late begun to perceive that all their care in the administration of

relief is frustrated by the over-abundant charity of private persons or religious so-

cieties. The same family often joins parish relief to the contributions of one or

more lady visitoi-s and missionaries. Not only improvidence but gross fraud is

thus promoted, and cases are known to occur where visitors of the poor are duped

into assisting those who are secretly in possession of sufficient means of livelihood.

Far worse, however, than private charity are the innumerable small charities

established by the bequests of mistaken testators. Almost every parish church has

its tables of benefactions, holding tip to everlasting gratitude those who have left a

small patch of land or an annual sum of money to be devoted to pauperizing the

population of the parish throughout all time. Blankets, coals, loaves, or money are

doled out once or twice a year, usually by the vicar and churchwardens. More or

less these parish charities act as a decoy to keep the most helpless part of the

population nominally within the fold of the Church. The Dissenters, where they

are strong enough, retaliate by competing for the possession of the poor by their

own missions, and thus the reproach of the Roman CathoHc Church, that it fos-

tered mendicancy, holds far too true of our present sects. With private charity

no law can interfere, and we can do nothing but appeal to the discretion of indi-

viduals. With testamentary charities it is otherwise.

  We are far yet from the time when so beneficial a measure will be possible, but

I trust that we are rapidly approaching the time when the whole of these pernicious

Wecharities will be swept awaj\                                                                have in this country carried respect to the

wishes of past generations to an extent simply irrational. The laws of property

are a purely human institution, and are just so far defensible as they conduce to

the good of society yet we maintain them to the extent of wasting and misusing
                                                                                           ;

no inconsiderable fraction of the land and wealth of the country. It would be

well worthy, I think, of Mr. Goschen's attention, whether all small parish charities

might not be transferred to the care of the guardians of the poor, so as to be

brought under the supervision of the Poor Law Board, and distributed in accord-

ance with sound principle, I should refuse to see in all such public endowments
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                     181

any rights of private property ; and the State which undertakes the ultimate sup-

port of the poor is bound to present its own efforts to reduce pauperism from being

frustrated, as they are at present.

  And while speaking of charities, it is impossible to avoid noticing the influence
of medical charities. No one could for a moment propose to abolish hospitals and

numerous institutions which are absolutely necessaiy for the relief of accidental

suffering. But there is a great difference between severe accidental disease or in-

jury and the ordinary illnesses which almost every one will suffer from at various

periods of his life. No working man is solvent unless he lay by so much of his
wages as will meet the average amount of sickness falling to the lot of the man or
his family. If it be not easy to determine this amount, there are, or may be, sick

clubs which will average the inequalities of life. In so far as trades unions favour

the formation of such clubs, they manifest that spirit of self-reliance which is the

true remedy of pauperism.

But the wealthy classes are, with the best motives, doing all they can to coun-

teract the healthy tendencies of the artisans. They are continually increasing the

number and resom-ces of the hospitals, which compete with each other in offering

the freest possible medical aid to all who come. The claims of each hospital for

public support is measured by the number of patients it has attracted, so that,

without some general arrangement, a more sound system is impossible. Hospitals

need not be self-supporting, and in cases of really severe and unforeseen suffering

they may give the most lavish aid ; but I conceive that they should not relieve
slight and ordinary disease without a contribution from those benehted. As

children are expected to bring their school pence, though it be insufficient to support

the school, and as Government has wisely refused to sanction the general establish-

ment of free schools, so I think that every medical institution should receive small

periodical contributions from the persons benefited. Arrangements of the kind are

far from uncommon, and there are many self-supporting dispensaries, but the com-

petition of free medical charities has, to a great extent, broken them down.

  The importance of the subject with which I am dealing can only be estimated

by those who have studied the statistics of London charities prepared by Mr. Hicks
and published in the 'Times' of 11th February, 18G9. It is much to be desired

tliat Mr. Hicks, or some other statistician, would extend a like inquiry to aU parts
of the United Kingdom, and give us some notion of the amoimt of money expended

in the free relief of the poor.

Closely connected with this subject is that of the poor-law medical service.

Admirable efforts are being made to improve the quality of the medical aid which

aU persons sufficiently poor can demand, and some imions have already erected

hospitals almost perfect in their comfort and salubrity. It will be conceded by

every one that those sick persons whose charge is undertaken by the public ought

to be treated with care and humanity. Where medical aid is given at all, it ought
to be good and sufficient. But the subject seems to me to be surrounded with dif-

ficulties, out of which I cannot find my way. The better we make the poor-law

medical service, the more we shall extend and deepen the conviction, already too

prevalent, that the poor may make merry with their wages when well and strong,
Webecause other people will take care of them when sick and old.
                                                                  thus tend to

increase and perpetuate that want of self-reliance and providence which is the

crowning defect of the poorer classes. In this and many other cases it seems as

necessary as ever that our humane impulses should be guided by a stern regard to

the real results of our actions.

I now turn to a subject which must come prominently before our Section. I
Wemean the futiu-e financial policy of the kingdom.
                                                     are now at a most peculiar

and happy epoch in our financial history. For thirty years or more a reform of the

tariff has been in progress, audit is only a year since the last relic of the protective

system was removed by Mr. Lowe's repeal of the small corn-duty. One great

scheme is thus worked out and completed ; henceforth, if duties are remitted, it

--must be on a wholly different ground as simple remission of revenue, not as the

removal of protective duties which benefit some to the injury of others. It might

weU be thought difficult to overlook the difference between a tax for revenue pur-
poses and one for protective purposes ; and yet there are not a few who seem not
                  ----

182 REPORT 1870.

Weto see tlie difference.  are still told that there is no such thing as free trade,

and that we shall not have it until all custom-houses are swept away. This doc-

trine rests, however, upon a new interpretation of the expression free trade, which

is quietly substituted for the old meaning. Cobden, however much he might be

in favom' of direct taxation, took care to define exactly what he meant by free

trade. He said :

" What is free trade ? Not the pulling down of all custom-houses, as some of

our opponents try to persuade the agricultural labourers. Our children, or their

offspring, may be wise enough to dispense with custom-house duties ; they may

think it prudent and economical to raise revenue by direct taxation ; we do not

propose to do that.

" By free trade we mean the abolition of all protective duties.

We" do not want to touch duties simply for revenue, but we want to prevent

certain parties from having a revenue which is to benefit themselves, but advantage

none else ; we seek the improvement of Her Majesty's revenue."

   Let us, then, candidly acknowledge that in Cobden's sense free trade is actually

achieved. Any one the least acquainted with our revenue system knows with what

skiU our tariff' has been adjusted by Peel, Gladstone, and Lowe, so that the articles

taxed should be of entirely foreign production, or else the customs duty should be

Weexactly balanced by an excise duty.      have now a very large revenue of about

forty millions, raised by customs or excise duty on a small number of articles, with

Athe least possible interference with the trade of the country.  very large part,

too, is raised upon spirituous liquors, the consumption of which we desire, on other

grounds, to reduce rather than encourage.

For the future, then, the remission of customs duties will be grounded on other

motives than it has often been in the past ; and it becomes an open question whether

there are not other branches of revenue far more deserving attention. It must not

be supposed that foreign trade is to be encouraged before everything else. The

internal trade and industry of the comitry is at least equally deserving of attention
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and it may be that there are stamp-duties, licence-duties, rates, or other taxes which,

in proportion to the revenue they return, do far more injury than any customs duties

now remaining. It is impossible, for instance, to defend the heavy stamp-duty

paid by the articled clerks of attorneys on their admission ; and, if I went into

detail, it would be easy to point out scores of cases where the attention of the

Chancellor of the Exchequer is needed.

I may point to local taxation especially as a subject requiring attention, even

more than any branch of the general revenue. Until within the last few years the

importance of the local rates was to a great extent overlooked, because there were

no adequate accounts of their amount. The returns recently obtained by the

Government are even now far from complete, but it becomes apparent that at least

one-fourth pai't of the whole revenue of the kingdom is raised by these neglected

rates and tolls. Their amount is more than equal to the whole of the customs

duties, upon the reform of which we have been engaged for thirty years. Never-

theless we continue to allow those rates to be levied substantially according to an

act passed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Whole classes of property which were

unrated three centm'ies ago are unrated now, and it vri.ll be a matter of great diffi-

culty to redress in an equitable manner inequalities which have been so long tole-

rated. The subject is of the more importance because there is sure to be a continuous

Weincrease of local taxation.  may hope for a reduction of the general expendi-

ture, and we shall expect rather to reduce than raise the weight of duties ; but all

the more immediate needs of society, boards of health, medical oflicers, public

schools, reformatories, free libraries, highway boards, main-drainage schemes, water-

supplies, purification of rivers, improved police, better poor-law medical service

these, and a score of other costly reforms, must be supported mainly out of the local

rates. Before the difficulties of the subject become even greater than they now

are, I think that the principles and machinery of local taxation should receive

thorough consideration. At present the complexity of the laws relatmg to poor

rates is something quite appalling, and it is the herculean nature of the reform

required which perhaps disinclines financial reformers from attacking it. Several

most able members of the Statistical Society have, however, treated the subject,
TBANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                        183

especially Mr. Frederick Purdy, Professor J. E. T. Rogers, and Mr. Dudley Baxter.

The recent partial inquiry by" a select committee has cliieiiy served to prove the

extent and difficulty of the reform which is needed.

  We have considerable opposition raised to customs and excise duties, because

they are indirect taxes but the fact is, that direct taxation is practically impossible.
                                                                                                          ;

Careful examination shows that it is difficult to draw any clear distinction between

taxes in this respect. There are few or no direct taxes borne only by those who

pay them. The incidence of the local rates, for instance, is an undecided question,
but I do not doubt that they fall to a considerable extent indirectly. The incidence
of the stamp-duties is almost wholly indirect, but defies investigation. The income-

tax no doubt approaches closely to the character of a direct tax, but it has the in-

superable inconvenience of being paid by the honest people and escaped by the

rogues. I am inclined to look upon schemes of imiversal direct taxation as affording

much scope for interesting speculation, but as being, in practice, simply impossible.

   I have another point to urge. Is not the time come when the remission of taxes,
whether of one kind or another, may properly cease to be a main object ? The

surplus revenue of future years will doubtless be more than sufficient to enable the

Chaucellor of the Exchequer to reform or abolish those small branches of internal

revenue which occasion far more inconvenience and injury than they are worth.
There will still, should war be happily avoided, remain a considerable surplus, and

the question presses upon us, Shall this revenue be relinquished, or shall it be

applied to the reduction of the national debt ?

   In considering this subject, I may first point out that there probably exists no

grievous pressure of taxation, and no considerable inequality as regards the several

Weclasses of the people.  are now able to estimate, with some approach to accu-

racy, the actual proportion of income which is paid by persons of different incomes.

The accounts now published by Government, and the labours of several eminent

statisticians, especially Professor Leone Levi and Mr. Dudley Baxter, permit us to

make this calculation. The most recent addition to our information is contained
in an elaborate paper read by Mr. Baxter before the Statistical Society in January
18(j9, and since published in the form of a volume. Mr. Baxter has, with great

industry and skill, collected a mass of information concerning the habits of persons

in different classes of society, which he combines with the published accounts of
the revenue and with the statistics of income previously estimated by himself and
Mr. Leone Levi. Both he and Professor Levi come to the conclusion that the
working classes, so long as they make a temperate use of spirituous liquors and
tobacco, pay a distinctly less proportion of their income to the State, and even in-
temperance does not make their contribution proportionally greater than those of

more wealthy persons.
   It happens" that, before I was aware of Mr. Baxter's elaborate inquiries, I under-

took a similar inquiiy on a much more limited scale, by investigating the taxes
Mypaid by average families spending £40, £85, and £500 a year.
                                                                     conclusions, as

might be expected, were not exactly coincident with those either of Mr. Baxter or

Professor Levi yet there was no great discrepancy. I conceive that families of
                                                                                 ;

the classes mentioned, consuming moderate quantities of tobacco and spirituous

liquors, all pay about 10 per cent, of their income in general or local taxation, al-
lowance being" made for the recent reduction of the sugar-duty and the repeal of
tbe corn-duty. But thete is this distinction to be noticed, that the taxation of the
middle classes is mostly imavoidable, whereas at least half the taxation of the poorer^
classes depends upon the amount of tobacco and spirituous liquors which they con-
sume. Families of artisans or labourers abstaining from the use of these stimu-

lants are taxed very lightly, probably not paying more than 4 or 5 per cent, of

their income. Now, while many men are total abstainers and many are intempe-
rate, I think we cannot regard the taxes upon stimulants as we do other taxes.
The payment of the tax is voluntaiy, and is, I believe, paid without reluctance.
The more we thus investigate the present incidence of taxation, the more it seems

inexpedient to proceed further in the reduction of the customs and excise duties.

The result would be to leave by far the larger mass of the people almost free from

any thing but local taxes, and to throw the whole cost of Government upon the

wealthier classes, and especially those who have tangible property.
                                                                                                           ;

184 REPOET-- 1870.

   But I venture to raise another question. I doubt whether the remission of tax-
ation does as much good at the present day as it would at a future time. There

are comparatively few signs that the wages of the working classes, even when suf-

ficient, are saved and applied really to advance the condition of the recipients. All
is expended in a higher scale of living, so that little permanent benetit results

and when bad trade comes again, there is as much distress as ever. It is only with

the increase of education and temperance that the increase of wages will prove a

solid advantage. Thus, when the really hurtful taxes are removed," it by no means

follows that the further remission of taxes leads to the proiitable expenditure of

income. The money may be spent in a way far more profitable to the whole nation

than it will be spent by those whose taxes" are remitted.

   I am glad, on this and many other accoimts, that the propriety of reducing the

national debt is begioning to be very generally recognized. The question was ably

raised by Mr. Lambert during the recent session, and, both in the House of Com-
mons and in the newspaper press, many strong opinions were expressed in favour

of reduction. In fact, there was almost a general feeling that Mr. Lowe's small

measure of reduction was altogether inconsiderable compared with our opportunities
and the greatness of the task before us. During every interval of peace we ought

to clear off the charges incurred during the previous war, otherwise we commit the

serious eiTor of charging to capital that which should be borne by income. If a
railway company needs periodically to renew its works, and charges all the cost to

capital, it must eventually become insolvent ; so if at intervals we require to main-

tain the safety and independence of this country or its possessions by war, and do

it all by borrowed money, we throw the whole cost of our advantage upon poste-

rity. If, indeed, one great war could fi-ee us from all future danger we might

capitalize the cost and leave it as a perpetual mortgage upon the property of the

country                                 but  if  the effect  of  any war wears out, and we are  liable to be involved
                                     ;

in new wars at intervals, then we cannot fairly or safely go adding perpe-

tually to the mortgage upon the national property. The wars at the commence-

ment of this century have secured for us fifty years or more of nearly unbroken

peace, and yet at the end of this period of ever-advancing wealth, the gi-eat debt

Westands almost at the same figm-e as at the commencement.                                      enjoy the peace and

leave our descendants to pay its cost.

   If it be said that this country is now far wealthier and more able to endure the

annual charge of the debt than ever before, I woidd point out that the expense of

war IS also gi-eatly increased. If we consider the cost of the Abyssinian Expedi-

tion, or the vast debts which other nations have lately or are now incun-ing, it is
evident that we may have in a great war to incur hundreds of millions of debt, or

else relmquish om- prominent position. Let us hope that such calamities will be

spared to us, but let us not suppose that we may avoid them by being negligent
and unprepared. It is not many months since Mr. Lowe declared that we must

                                                                                                ,,,,,, by  ,,..^,,.^

for the reduction of the debt worthy of his boldness and the sui-plus at hiscom-
mand. But the fact is, that little can be done in such a matter by any minister

unless he be supported by a strong public opinion.

   The remarks which I most wished to make are now completed, and there only
remam one or two mmor topics to which I will more briefly allude.

The excessive mortaUty in great towns seems to demand more close attention
than it has received. Por many years Livei-pool stood at or near the top of the

list as regards mortality, but by strenuous efforts it has been rendered more healthy.

mManchester, on the other hand, although often considered the best paved, best

watered, and some other respects the best managed town in the country, has lately

taken a very high or even the highest place as regards mortality. In Salford, too,

the death-rate has steadily gi-own in recent years. It would seem as if we were
entu-ely at fault, and that all our officers of health, sanitary commissioners, and the
improvements of science and civilization cannot prevent nearly twice as many
people from djnng as woidd die in a healthy and natm-al state of" things.

   Withm the last few months attention has been di-awn to this subject by a pro-
                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                         185

longed discussion in tlie 'Manchester Guardian.' It was occasioned by Mr.

Baxendell, who brought before the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society

certain statistics tending to show that the mortality of Manchester was not due to

any peculiar excess in the rate of infantile mortality. It was an old opinion that

in a manufacturing town like Manchester, the children are neglected while the

mothers are employed at the mills but Mr. Eaxendell showed that the deaths of
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

infants imder five years actually bear a less proportion to the whole number of

deaths than in any other of the large towns. This conclusion was somewhat

severely criticized by the Medical Officer of Health for Salford, and by Dr. Ran-

soms and Mr. Royston, of the Manchester Sanitary Association. The latter gen-

tlemen pointed out tliat the true mode of computation is to compare the deaths of

infants with the number of infants living, and the deaths of adults with the niun-

ber of adults. But even when calculations are made in this manner it still turns

out that the adult mortality of Manchester is as excessive as the infantile mortality,

Manchester mothers are thus exonerated from the charge of neglect, but at the

same time a most important and mysterious problem is left wholly unsolved.

Our perplexity must be increased when we consider that Liverpool and Man-

chester, though both very unhealthy towns, are quite contrasted as regards situa-

tion and the kinds of employment they present. If we compare Liverpool with

other sea-ports, such as Bristol, Hull, and Loudon, it is found to exceed them all

considerably in mortality. Bolton, Bmy, Preston, Stockport and other towns have
more women employed than Manchester, comparatively speaking, yet they are

more healthy. The size of the town, again, is not the chief cause, for London,
tliough many times more popidous than any other to^^'u, is decidedly healthy. The

sites of the towns do not give tmy better solution of the difficulty, Loudon having

probably as unhealthy a site as any of the other large towns.

  I am sm-prised that more attention has not been drawn to the probable in-

fluence of a poor Irish population in raising the death-rate. It occurred to me

that tlie great towns which are most unhealthy agree in containing a large propor-

tion of Irish, and agree in nothing else which I can discover. To test this notion

I have calculated, from the census returns of 1861, the ratio of the Irish-born adult

population in all the larger towns of Great Britain. It then becomes .apparent at

once that the unhealthy towns of Liverpool, Manchester, Salford, Glasgow, Dun-

dee, &c. are all distinguished by possessing a large population of Irish, whereas

the healthy towns of Londoji, Birmingham, Bristol, Hull, Aberdeen, &c. have less

than 7| per cent, of adult Irish residents. Sheffield is the only remarkable excep-

tion to this induction. It might seem that, in order to confirm this conclusion, I

should show the death-rate in Dublin to be very high. On turning to the accounts

of the Irish Registrar-General, we find the Dublin rate to be low, but then we find

that the Dublin birth-rate is even lower in proportion. In fact the registry sys-

tem in Ireland gives results so much lower in every respect than those of Great

Britain, that we must either conclude the state of population to be utterly dif-

ferent there from what it is here, or we must suppose the registration to be very

incomplete. If after fiu-ther investigation this suggestion should be found to ex-

;plain the high and mysterious mortality of many towns, it vdll, I think, relieve us

trom some perplexity, give us more confidence in sauitaiy measures, and point out

exactly where most attention is needed.

The next two or three years will be a time of great interest to statisticians, on

Weaccount of the approaching census of 1871.  shall soon possess data which will

assist us in many investigations, and enable us surely to estimate many of the

changes in progress.

There is only one suggestion concerning the census which it occurs to me to

make, namely, that it ought to be taken in as nearly as possible a 'uniform manner

in all the three parts of the Uuited Kingdom. It need hardly be pointed out that

the value of statistics almost entirely depends upon the accuracy and facility with

which comparisons can be made between different groups of facts, and a very slight

variation in the mode of making the enumerations of the census or tabidating the

results will lead to error, or else render comparison impossible.

Reasons, the force of which I cannot estimate, have led to the establishment of

distinct registry-offices in Edinbm-gh and Dublin. Not only are the ordinary re-
186 EEPORT--1870.

ports concerning births, deaths, and mamages drawn up independently in the seve-

ral offices for England, Scotland, and Ii-elaud, but even the census is performed by
the separate authorities in the three kingdoms. Consequently we have really three

censuses and three reports, and at least in 1861 the tables were constructed to a

great extent in different modes in these reports. Thus there is a total want of that

unity and uniformity which, in a scientific point of view, is indispensable. If

there is one thing more than another which demands perfect unity and centraliza-

tion, it is the work of the census and the Register Office ; but if we cannot have

one central office, let us hope that the several Ilegistrar-Grenerals will cooperate so

as to produce the nearest approach to uniformity in the census. The different ter-
ritorial divisions and arrangements may require some modifications in the mode of

enumeration, but except in this respect, there should be perfect identity.

   I should like to du-ect j^our attention for a moment to the very copious and ex-
cellent statistical publications with which we are now furnished by Government.

Owing partly to the prejudice against blue books, and partly probably to the in-

effective mode of publication, the public generally are not aware that for the sum

of 8d. any person can obtain the Statistical Abstract of the Board of Trade, con-

taining an admirable selection from the principal statistics of the country during

the preceding fifteen years. For a few shillings, again, may be had the ' Miscel-

laneous Statistics ' of the Board of Trade, furnishing a wonderful compilation of

facts concerning three recent years, ·though I wish that this information could be

brought more nearly up to the time of publication.

  By degrees a considerable amount of system has been introduced into our par-

--liamentary papers. They have always been sufficiently copious rather too copi-

ous in fact ; but until the last twenty years they consisted mainly of disconnected

and accidental accounts, which were exceedingly troublesome to statisticians, and

often of no use whatever. It is from regular annual publications, carried on in a

uniform manner, that we derive the most useful information, that which is capable

of comparison and digestion. The annual reports which have for some years been

issued from various Government departments are the best source of statistics ; and

I may suggest that there are several public departments (for instance the Mint)

which do not yet give any regular annual reports.

I would especially point, again, to the last report of the Inland Revenue Depart-

ment as a model of what we might desire from other departments. In addition to

the usual annual report, it contains an abstract of the previous reports for ten years

back, and, what is still more valuable, complete tables of all inland duties from

their first establishment, some of the tables going back to the beginning of last

Wecentury.  are thus provided with a complete history of the inland revenue. I

cannot but believe that in many other departments is much valuable information

which might be fiunished to the public in like manner at a very slight cost.

Under other circumstances I should have had something to say to you concern-

ing international money. Just before the present unhappy war broke out, a Com-

mission in Paris had reported in a manner greatly facilitating the adoption of an
international money in the British Empire and in America; at the same time

a conference was about to be held in Berlin, which would probably have resulted in

some important measures as regards Prussia. Everything, in short, was favourable
to the early adoption of a common money ; but it need hardly be said that all

hope of such a great reform must be defeiTed until peace is once again fu'mly esta-

blished.

Since this Association last met, the great experiment of transferring the tele-

graphs to Government control has been carried out. The result has been to some
extent disappointing. The proprietors of the telegraphs, when negotiating with

Government, discovered that their property was about twice as valuable as they

had before considered it. The enormous profits which they made out of the sale
seem to me to throw immense difficulty in the way of any similar transfer in the

future. It becomes, for instance, simply chimerical to suppose that the Govern-
ment can purchase the railways, which are about two hundred and fifty times as

valuable as the telegraphs, and which, if purchased in the same way, would cost

considerably more than the whole national debt. The working of the telegraphic

department; again, confirms the anticipation that we must not expect from it any
                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  187

such results as followed the establishment of the penny post. Many people already

look forward to the time when the imiform cost of a telegTam will be (kl., but I

believe that they will be disappointed. They overlook the essential diti'ereuce that

a great number of letters may be conveyed almost as cheaply as one letter, whereas

everj^ telegram occupies the wires for a definite time, and requires to be delivered,

generally speaking, by a special messenger. Thus, if we are to have the rapid de-

livery without which telegTams seem to me nearly valueless, the property and staftj

and, of course, the expenses of the department, must expand nearly proportionally

Ato the business.  reduction of the rate to Of/., by bringing a great increase of

work, would greatly augment the expenses of the department, and inflict a loss

upon the nation.

                On National Debts. By R. Dfdley Baxter, M.A.

   After enlarging on the importance of the subject, the author traced the history of

our National Debt, which was fairly started at tlie time of the llevolution in 1088,
when William III. brought over vsdth him that new scientific invention. In 17G3
it was £138,000,000. The American war raised it to £249,000,000, and the
French war to £801,000,000, from which point, with the interval of the Crimean

war, it was reduced, until now it stood at £749,000,000. He contrasted the cost

of a year's war with the veiy small reductions of a vear's peace, averaging
£2,500,000. The French Debt, originated by Louis XIV. (with the interval of
the Revolution, when a great debt was raised and destroyed in a short time), stood
at £245,000,000 at the commencement of the Empire in 1852, whence it had risen
to £518,000,000. Under the second Empire the increase was £15,000,000 a year,
and there had never been a period of reduction. It must be borne in mind, how-
ever, that in the middle of the next century the French railways, now valued at
£300,000,000, would become national property. In the United States the debt

rose from £18,000,000 sterling on July 1, 1861, during four years of civil war, to

£551,000,000 on July 1, 18(;5; but it has been reduced on July 1, 1870, to

£477,000,000, or by £15,000,000 a year. He hardly knew which to wonder at
most, the increase or the decrease. He believed that the rate of reduction would

be continued. Austria, like France, was an empire of uninterrupted deficits. Her
debt was now £300,000,000. Russia was one of the States which had run most
recklessly and rapidly into debt. The amount was now £300,000,000. The debt
of Spain was now £257,000,000. Italy had gone into debt in the most headlong
manner, showing an average increase since 1801 of £19,000,000 per annum.
Prussia's debt was the least of all the European nations. North Germany had
now a debt of £106,000,000, and South Gemiauy £46,000,000, or only £150,000,000
for aU Germany, including £15,000,000 on account of the present war ; and her
costs in the present war were to be paid by France. The Dutch debt in 1869 was
£80,000,000, having been reduced for many years at the rate of £1,000,000 per
annum, eqiuvalent to £10,000,000 in England. He argued from the whole, that
while the commercial countries had steadily reduced their debts, the non-commer-
cial nations had enormously increased theirs. England's position now, compared
with that of 1815, was greatly improved compared with other nations. In 1815
she owed £860,000,000 against £600,000,000 united debt of all other countries,
whilst in 1870 she owed £749,000,000 against over £2,300,000,000, the combined
debts of other countries. He also compared the burden per head of population of
the A-arious debts. Germany's debt was 2*'. 9f/. per head per annum against ours
(17s. M. per head per annum), and the United States debt per amium was much less
than ours ; and these two nations were our great competitors. He therefore urged

a great and speedy reduction of our national debt, in order to lighten the pressure
on industry. Holland's sinldng fund was worthy of attention. They might appro-
priate certain taxes sacredly to the reduction of the debt ; or they might adopt a

resolute taxation, like the United States, but without their protection errors. He

approved of temiinable annuities as one agent, but did not deem it sufficient. In
conclusion he addressed a word of warning to the nations which had so long and

so recklessly increased their national burdens.

             Middle-Class Schools as they are, and as they ought to he.

                             By C. H. W. Biggs, F.B.G.S.

   This paper contained a sketcli of some of tlie failings, witli suggestions for their

removal, which may be found in our so-caUed educational system. In reality we
have no middle class educational system, every man being at perfect liberty to
cany out his own ideas, whether they be good, bad, or inditferent. Many eminent
men of undoubted talent have advised the introduction into this country of sys-

tems similar to the most complete of those to be met with on the Continent. This
would never answer ; for the system to be adopted in England must be adapted
to native circumstances and insular peculiarities, must be capable of expanding

with the gro-n'th of education, and of incorporating aU that may hereafter be

proved beneficial.

   Man is necessaiy to man, and every man ought to fill a sphere wherein he should

by his acts benefit the whole community as well as himself. This he will never
do whilst imperfectly educated ; and although not able to attain perfection, we are
capable of aiming at it. One of the first objects of a community, of a nation,
should be to insist that the men engaged in educating the rising generation were
equal to their task. Whilst, however, the masters in our primary schools are
compelled to undergo a long and arduous training, both in the practical and theo-
retical parts of theii- profession, any one is allowed to become a teacher of the great
commercial class. Again, some means should be taken to ascertain whether the
instruction given was such as to fit the pupils for their futiu-e positions. This
coidd be best done by a system of Government supervision and examination, as no

other body would be equally imbiassed. An annual blue book could be issued,

containing the reports of such examinations, together with suggestions for better
achieving what is required. There ought to be some means provided whereby
talented students should not be compeUed to leave their studies just at the time

when most progress was made, but should be able to get the best education the
country could give. Briefly, then, we require a system to train and ensm-e the

competency of the masters, and to ascertain that theu' duties are efficiently per-
formed.

       On the Economy of Large and Small Farms. By William Botlt.

    First, as regarded the interest of the landed proprietor.
    Secondly, as to that of the tenant.
   Thirdly, vnXh reference to that of the labourer ; and
   Fourthly, as to which are the most advantageous ncdionully.
    After a tabular statement of the acreage, rent, buildings, capital, &c. of various
sized farms, with extracts from the survey of Belgium, by Dr. Voelcker and Mr.

H. M. Jenkins, F.G.S., also of Mr. Howard, M.P., and others, the author gave
his own, from personal observation in various parts of the United Kingdom,

France, &c.

   In conclusion, the author observed that he was of opinion (though he would by
no means have farms aU of one size) that large rather than small were most bene-
ficial to the landlord, tenant, labourer, and nation at large.

  On tlie Duties of the Government of India and of the 3ferchants of England
      in promoting Production in India. By Geoege Campbell, D.C.L.

   The writer said that he fully recognized that it was the duty of the Government
in India, and of the collectors and other officers, to promote the productions of the
soil in India by eveiy means in their power. The point to be aimed at was not so
much an increase in the area of production as in the productive powers of a given
area. In India the Government was the great head landlord, and the collectors
were the agents of the great State landlord, and ought to perform a landlord's
duties. They had created native landlords, but to suppose that they would per-
form the duties of a landlord was one of the anachronisms which we English were
apt to cling to in the face of fact. The farmers (the ryots) were, in truth, good

 farmers, but they were all on a small and himible scale, and they had not the

education or information to enable them to adopt scientific improvements. He

 believed it to be wholly and absolutely incon-ect to represent them as too conser-
vative to improve. Show tbem the means of raising better crops and they would

readily adopt them. It was, in his opinion, the duty of the collector of a district

to promote agi-icultural improvements in eveiy wav in his power. All that Govern-
ment had been able to do was to facilitate traffic. The secret of improving our
Indian cotton cultivation had not been discovered. Government had sent out

practical Scotch gardeners, but he doubted if they would have very rapid success.
In his opinion Government made a great mistake in ceasing to maintain a special

college for the education of the Indian civil servants. The present examinations
were a mistake ; the young men were crammed as for a literary examination, and

had very little practical knowledge. He especially referred to their ignorance of
arithmetic. India, too, was too much overridden by the legal system. It was not

enough to administer India by a rigid system of law. The Indian civil sen-ants
should be more trained for executive government, with a knowledge of agriculture

and other matters. He approved of a department of agriculture in India. He

wpuld also advocate security of tenure in India, especially in the new settled dis-
tricts, many of which were well suited for agriculture, and which would lead to
their development. As to the management of the natives, they were much more

easily led than driven.

                                                   On the Tobacco Trade of Liverpool. By J. S. Campbell.

The writer traced the history of the trade from its commencement, which was

in the year 1665, and stated that by the year 1700 the tobacco trade vdth Vii-giuia

had taken the lead of all the others, the principal merchants of the town being

then engaged in it. During 1770 the total imports of tobacco in Liverpool

amounted to 5447 hhds. In 1788 the first tobacco warehouse was built in Liver-

pool, on the east side of the King's Dock, and was calculated to hold 7000 hhds.
The steady gi'owth of the trade, however, soon rendered increased accommodation

necessary, and in 1814 a larger structure was built, which had since been enlarged

to twice its original size, and was calculated to contain 20,000 hhds. From

12,928 hhds. in 182.3 the imports rose to 16,58-3 hhds. in 1869 ; the largest stock in

warehouse at any one time being at the end of 1865, when it reached 27,820 hhds.

Of the total hogsheads imported in Liverpool, about one-fourth (perhaps a little

more) was cleared for manufacture in the to-^m, one-fourth was sent to Ireland,

one-fourth coastwise to various ports in England and Scotland, and the remainder

was 'exported to various foreign ports. The above figures refer only to American

tobaccos                                           of other growths there were imported in 1869, 3709 bales and packages.
                                                ;

Liverpool had fully one-half the stock of American tobacco in the United Kingdom,

and the business was at present in the hands of eight brokers and about seventy

importers.

He described the business as an exceedingly quiet and regular one, the brokers

and importers, as a rule, sticking to their fixed and antiquated practices, and ob-

stinately resisting any attempt at innovation.

The paper concluded with some remarks on the extent of tobacco manufacture

in Liverpool, and the desirability of a more extensive introduction of female labour

into this branch of industry.

     Proposition for a Census of Local Names. By Htde Claeke, I.S.S.

   The object was to enumerate in each enumeration district all known names of
towns, hamlets, farms, fields, rivers, hills, commons, &c., in extension of the ma-

terials in the Indexes to the Censuses of 1841, 1851, and 1861, so as to give better
information as to the distribution of English names (with their forms of Frisian,
Norse, &c.), and of Celtic, with their forms of Welsh, Cornish, L-ish, Erse, and
Manx.

190 REPORT--1870.

On the Decline of Small Farmers in Yorlshire and Lancashire, the Cause and

                            Effect. By J. Walter Ellis.

The decline in numbers may be traced to three causes, want of capital, high

rents, and dear labour. Farming, to be now successful, is a question of capital
and intelligence. Many farms in Yorkshire and Lancashire are now made into one,

three and four or five small farms being let as one fai-m, the buildings puUed down,

the fields made larger by removing many fences, so that machinery may be avail-

able                 then a man with intelligence and capital takes it, and it is better farmed, pro-
                  ;

duces more, and adds greater profit to the national weal by the use of machinery.

As land passes into commercial hands, the rents are in many cases nearly doubled,

as a commercial man expects higher interest for his money : often one of his

clerks or his cashier is appointed agent or steward over the estate, who has little

sympathy with the farmers ; and invariably the smallest farmer feels the eflects

fir.st, and the consequence is he removes to the large towns, where he is well

paid for his labour (.3s. 6c?. to 4.s. per day). Many labouring men liave made

this summer, in towns and works near town, at Gd. per hour, as much as £2 lOs.

per week. The author knows three, who were once small farmers, who have had

£2 per week in the neighbourhood of Bradford this summer, and whose families of

grown-up daughters make from 18s. to 25s. per week as weavers in the factories.

The small farmer is better off as a labourer in the town than the middle-size farmer

is in the country. The large towns are ready to absorb all the surplus labour

froni the country, by the centralizing of works, the use of steam-power, and the

continual increasing producing power of the English manufacturer : and the cry is

for more labourers from the country, as the town labom-ers are being fast used up

by imbibing the vices of the town they soon become as weak as the old residents

of the town.

                     Our Navy. By Frank P. Fellowes, F.8.A., F.S.S.

This paper pointed out that the supremacy of England on the sea was the means

of ensuring the freedom of all seas to all nations. Our holding Malta, Gibraltar,

and our numerous other foreign dockyards and stations, our fleets scattered through-

out the world, ensured the freedom of the Mediterranean, Black, and other inland

seas, and prevented their becoming the appanage of any great power; freed the

Indian archipelago, the Chinese, Japanese, and other seas from pirates; and, in

fact, caused aU seas to be open to the ships of evorj^ nation without passport or

toll legally or illegally levied. Our present maritime position was therefore as

great a benefit to other nations as to England itself. Mr. Fellowes stated that a

national dockyard, in his opinion, should be, as it were, a little kingdom in itself,

in which (shouJd it be cut oft' from the outer world) it could furnish men, materials,

and appliances to build, equip, repair, man, and provision ships.

The question as to where dockyards should be placed, and how many we should

have, was a political and national, rather than an economical question. These

points should he decided, therefore, on political and national gi-ounds, and not from

an economical point of view. The question of economy comes afterwards ; that is,
when we have already decided that it is wise and necessary to have a doclsyard in

a certain position, and it is established, the question of economy properly com-

mences in the management and conduct of the operations of such dockj'ard.

In speaking of our numerous foreign naval estabUshments, the author showed

that our keeping up Malta, Gibraltar, and other foreign stations was in reality

economical, as otherwise we should have to maintain a much larger fleet to be as

powerful on the sea.

This paper entered minutely into the question as to the proportionate distribu-

tion of money to the various naval services that would ensure the greatest efl'eetive
Weforce.
                     give an illustration. The annual expenditure in building new ships is

about £1,500,000 ; the annual total expenditure for all na^al services is about
K£10,000,000.
                     by doubling our expenditure of £1,500,000 for new ships we

could produce new first-rate irou-clad or other vessels, one of which in efl'eetive

power woidd be equal to two of the existing ships of similar tonnage and horse-

power, we practically double our naval efiective force ; that is, we are as eflicient
                       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                       191

and powerful as if we had expended an extra £1,500,000 in building similar ships

to those that exist, and £8,o(J0,000 for the remaining current expenses of the navy,

such as paying officers and men, provisions, repair and maintenance of ships,

&c. ; because if we double the effective power of each ship we double thereby the

effective power of each officer and sailor on board, and aU the other current expen-

diture, such as provisions, wear and tear of ship, &c., for it costs no more to repair,

man, and victual a good and efficient vessel than to do the same for a bad and

inefficient one. In the iirst case we double our effective power by an increased

expenditure of £1,500,000 annually ; in the other we only do it by an increased

annual expenditure of £10,000,000. The author then pointed out that the judi-

cious distribution of the money was of much more importance in obtaining great

results by a small expenditure than mere cheese-paring of aU the services without

regard to this important point. " It was with views similar to these that led Mr.

Seely and myself to devote our attention mainly to this element of expenditm'e

to make it effective, as otherwise aU else is ineffective. The weapon of war,

whether a ship or a gun, should be the best that human foresight and ingenuity

can devise ; aud expense on this head is, after all, but a secondary consideration."

In evidence before ]\L". Seely 's committee the author had given numerous in-

stances occuiTing in past years, in which the repairs of ships had cost as much or

more than similar new ships. Now it was a rough rule with shipbuilders, that an

old repaired ship when repaired was worth about half as much as a similar new

ship. Hence arose a veiy large and worse than useless expenditure. The plan

that is now adopted to ob-\-iate any such iiseless expenditure is, when a ship

requires repairs to have an estimate of the probable cost of such repairs, and it is

then decided whether it is wise to repair it at all ; if not, she is sold or broken up,

it being -n-isely considered that the Iirst loss is the least. Bj^ being careful on

these points the Admiralty has more money to expend on new and efficient ships

without coming to Parliament for a grant, and we get money's worth for the

money expended.

The paper then gave in detail an account of the working of Mr. Fellowes's new

scheme of Admiralty accounts, by which, for the first time, the unification of all

the Admiralty accounts had been efiected, so that the money as voted hj Parlia-

ment, and disbursed by the Treasury, could be clearly traced into its appropriation

to ships and services  and  manufactures                                                       so that the  given cost of  such ships and
                                                                                            ;

services and manufactures actually balanced tlie sums disbursed by the Treasury

from the votes as granted by the House of Commons.

The author then pointed out that fonnerly the whole of the dockyards at home

and abroad were ti-eated as one great Establishment, so that a ship costing really,

say, £80,000 at Devonport, and a similar ship built in the same year at Portsmouth

costing £120,000, would each be given as costing £100,000; so that the economy

of one yard was made to pay for aud to hide the exti-avagance of the other.

Under the author s system, each dockyard and each manufactory was now treated

in the Admiralty accoimts as if it were the only dockyard or manufactory the

Government possessed, and each had to accoimt strictly. By these means com-

parisons were instituted which led both to economy and efficiency.

By these and similar means tlie present Admiralty had been enabled greatly to

reduce the annual expenditure for the navy without at all decreasing our naval

effective power.

The author concluded by recognizing the great efforts of Mr. Seely and other

members of the committee on naval monies and accounts, and by acknowledging

the aid and support he had received from Mr. Childers, Mr. "Baxter, and Sir

Spencer Robinson in can-ying out his plans and views.

On the Ivjluence of Price upon the Cultivation and Consumption of Cotton
   durinff the past ten years, emhracinr/ the period of the American War and
   Cotton Famine. By TN'illiam B. Porwood, Vice-Pres. Liverpool Chamber

    of Commerce.

   The author first drew attention to the position of our cotton supply in 1860, the
year antecedent to the American war, when our chief som"ce of supply was America,
                                                                --

 193 REPORT--1870.

 whicli in that year produced a crop of 4,075,000 bales ; and of our import that

 year we derived from America 76 per cent., India 16 per cent., Egypt and Brazil
 each 3 per cent., West India and Tiu-key under ^ per cent.

    The breaking out of the American war in 1861 stopped the import of American
 cotton, and caused an advance of 1.50 per cent, in value ; and our import gradually
increased from som-ces other than America until, in 1865, it was 1,508,000 bales in

 excess of 1800, the proportionate supply from various sources being as follows :
 America 16-77 per cent., Western India 37-73 per cent., Egypt 12-11 per cent.,

Brazil 12-35 per cent., West Indies 4-767 per cent., China 5-14 per cent, Bengal
and Madras 11-28 per cent. From this it will be seen how quick and how potent
was the effect of price in stimulating into acti\-ity the inhabitants of almost every
tropical country to gain part of the prize that was to be obtained by growing cot-

ton and shipping it to this country.
    The author showed that the uncertainty in which the production of cotton in

America after the war was shrouded caused very high values to be maintained,

although our import in 1866 was only 181,802 bales of 400 lbs. less than in 1860. And
to this high range of prices he attributed the wonderful rapidity with which Ame-

rica has been able to overcome the great difficulties arising from the eflects of the

war, but above all from the abolition of slavery, so that she is now again our great
source of supply. He drew attention to the great success that had attended the

efforts of Government to extend and improve the cultivation of cotton in India,
and the rapid development of cotton-cultivation in Brazil ; he showed that as ex-
tremes beget extremes, so it is quite probable that three or four years of high

prices having recouped the fixed capital embarked in cotton-planting, we may

m ten years from the date of the cotton famine have a supply of cotton from 10

per cent, to 15 per cent, larger than we received in 1860, notwithstanding that in

the meantime the whole system of cotton-cultivation, both in America and in

India, has been transformed. He pointed out that the high prices of 1866, by ar-

resting consumption, enabled a stock to be accumulated in Europe and America,
which has pei-mitted the consimiption of cotton for three years since to exceed
the production by a yearly average of 270,000 bales without seriously advancing
values. In tm-ning to the question of the influence of price upon consumption, in
1860 every spindle in the country was fully employed ; in 1863 not more than
one-third were in work. After reviewing the phases of our cotton-manufacturing
industry during the memorable years 1862-05, and of the growth of our other
textile manufactures, such as linen, worsted, and woollen, he went on to show

the causes of the bad state of trade in Lancashire, which maj^ be summed up in

a consumptive power greatly in excess of the supply, wliile at the same time the
high price of cotton fabrics stopped their free consumption ; thus while the spindle-
power of this coimtry is equal to a consumption of 54,153 bales of 4001b. weight
per week, the actuaf consumption in 1868 was 47,378 bales, and in 1869 45,268
bales of 400 lb. ; it was this deficiency in the supply as compared with the con-
sumptive power, combined with high prices, tliat produced all the mischief.

   He took a very hopeful view of the future. He showed that whereas the spindle-

power of Europe and the Northern States of America in 1860 was equal to a
weekly consumption of 102,()76 bales of 400 lbs., the supply in that year was
equal to 113,814 bales of 4001b. ; in 1870 the spindle-power is equal to a consump-
tion of 109,639 bales, and our probable supply equal to 102,557 bales of 400 lb.,
so that we have at last brought the supply within 6-86 per cent, of the |spindle-
power, or 371,000 bales of 400 lb. ; and the prospects are very fair that this defi-

ciency will be made up during the course of the next twelve months, when we
may look for a much lower average in price and the return of a fuU tide of pros-

perity to this district.

   In conclusion the author drew attention to the value of the Cotton Statistics
Act, if the stock were once more adjusted and the quantity of cotton taken by
the trade was given weekly as well as the quantity exported and imported.

A Proposed Rearrangement of the Registration Districts of England and

    Wales, for the purpose of facilitating Scientific Inqtdry. By Alfred

     Haviland,

    The author commenced his paper by stating that the registration districts of
 England and Wales were fomied for the general purposes of the Poor-Law Admi-
 nistration, and therefore it could not be expected that they were planned with any
view of assisting science ; they had, however, done so when in their present crude
and artificial form, and it was generally believed among scientific men that if their
boundaries were determined on a natural system, the advantages to meteorology,
climatology, and other branches of science would be incalculable, and the expense
and confusion of constant alterations avoided. Messrs. Keith Johnston had lately
been engaged by him in the rectification and completion of the registration maps
of England and Wales, for the purpose of insuring extreme accuracy in his
basis map of the geographical distribution of disease in England and Wales. This
had involved him in a considerable outlay, but through the recommendation of the

Registrar-General, the Treasury, seeing the necessity of the work, had expressed

their approval of a grant being paid to the author for the expenses incurred. He

urged that the artificial system adopted in defining the boimdaries of the registration
districts had been the cause of all this extra work and expense, and that it had
nothing whatever to recommend its continuance; on the contrary, it was the
fruitful source of repeated alterations, and would continue to be so whilst it was

persevered in. On the other hand, the author showed that were a natural system
substituted for the present one, and our country divided into districts regulated by
its watershed and river system, we should then have in every district a focus of

scientific inquiry, whether it be as to the rainfall, temperatm'e, prevalence or strength
of wind, agricultural statistics, the produce of our fields, our mines, or our rivers, or

for the purpose of registering the occupations, the diseases, or the deaths of the people.

Moreover, sucli a system would form the best basis map for every future census,

and being once established upon a well-considered and natural plan, would do

away with the necessity of those eternal alterations which are now year by year

going on, to the utter confusion of the scientific student. In France the water-
shed system is adopted in defining and naming the departments ; it is vastly supe-
rior to our own, and although its deficiencies are numerous, yet they will act as

beacons to us. The author was well aware that such a revolution could not be
accomplished imder ten years, therefore he urged the necessity of commencing it at
once. Should the natural system be adopted before 1881, it would be ready for
the census of that yeai', by which time the Registrar-General will have completed
two more decades of mortuaiy records imder the present system, and these, with
the one (1851-60) which the author had geographized, will form a most important

foundation for all future inquiry.

       On the Aptitude of North-American Indians for Agriculture.
                      By James Hetwood, M.A., F.R.S.

   The wiiter commenced by explaining how the aboriginal Indians in Canada
were placed upon reservations, and how they were governed and controlled. He

--referred more particularly to the settlement of tlie Six Nations Indians in the

Tuscarora reserve on Grand River, in the province of Ontario, where the Indians

formed among themselves an agricultural societj-, supporting annual exhibitions of

stock and produce, which are assisted by grants from the New England Company,

an English corporation founded under Oliver Cromwell, and especially devoted at

the present day to the promotion of the welfare of Canadian Indians.

   Reports to the Congress of the United States describe the condition of numerous

Indian tribes, among whom the Indian inhabitants of reservations near the Pacific

Ocean particularly manifest the results of successful agriculture.

   On the Umatilla reservation in the north-eastern portion of Oregon, the Indians

paj' much attention to raising horses and cattle, and are comparatively wealthy.

Their crops in 1804 comprised wheat^ oats, Indian corn, potatoes, peas, and garden

vegetables.

--194 REPORT 1870.

    Similar proofs of farming industry were noticed in 1865 on the Yakama re-

servation, 70 miles north of the Colimibia river. About 5O0O Indians are located

in that neighbourhood, and 1200 acres of land are under Indian cultivation.

    The Government have erected for these Indians a good grist- and saw-mill.

    A farm is connected with the boys' school, upon which the boys labour a certain

portion of their time ; the proceeds of their labour are applied towards their sup-

port. Agent Willous, who has the charge of the Yakama reservation, neglects no

opportunity to give the Indians instruction of a practical character.

    Among the inquiries of the Committee of Congress in 1865 respecting Indians,

the following question was asked of Brigadier-General James H. Carletou, of the

Head Quarters department of New Mexico, at Santa Fe :

    " Is it best that the Indian lands should be held in common or in severalty ? "

    General Carleton in reply gave it as his opinion " that the Indian land should

be held in severalty."

    " Surveys should be carefully made, and each family or head of a family should

have a part allotted to him.

   " The human being, white, red, or black, who plants a tree or a vine, or builds

--a house, or makes a field or garden, identifies himself with it loves it; his

children are born there, and the associations connected with all these things con-

Westitute and give birth to what we caU home love and home feeling." "                                       have,"

observed General Carleton, "taken quite enough from the Indian. Let them

have and keep really a home."

               On the Statistics of the Contagioiis Diseases Acts.

                        By Berkeley Hill, M.B., F.B.C.S.

    --It was remarked that there are two chief points for statistical inquiry, the

prevalence of these diseases, and the amount of control sanitary regidations exercise

over their propagation. The three main varieties of contagious diseases were then

briefly described, and the following facts mentioned to show the prevalence of the
most important form of these diseases. At Eye hospitals one-fifth of diseases of

the eye are from constitutional contagious disease. At the Throat hospital about

1.5 per cent, have similar origin. Taking the estimate -of the medical officer of
the Privy Oomicil that 3a per cent, of the sickness relieved gratuitously in the

metropolis is due to the constitutional form of contagious disease, an estimate the

author showed to be insufficient, we have even then 28,000 of the working male

popidation of the metropolis alone constantly more or less incapacitated by the

constitutional form of disease. It was mentioned also that 16 out of every 1000

AAvho offer themselves as recruits to the army have this form of the disease.

comparison was then drawn between the number of persons who apply for relief

from these diseases at the general hospitals of London and that which is treated

at  the  same  institutions of  Paris                             being  G-6 per  cent,  of those  examined  by the

agents of the Medical Officer of the Privy Coimcil, even allowing a reduction

of one-fourth to be made for the proportion of sick persons relie-^ed by the Poor-

Law Medical Officers, who do not treat this kind of sickness out of the work-

house. In Paris, of the total sick persons relieved by the general hospitals, the

portion with contagious disease was 3-3 per cent. In the Navy and Army the

amount of loss from contagious disease has been estimated with approach to exac-

titude. This loss, for some reason, declined slowly and steadily year by year from

1860 to 1860-67. Since that date the diminution has continued more rapidly where

the Contagious Diseases Acts operate, while, where they do not operate, the decrease

has been replaced by increase, so that the level of 1860 has been regained at nearly

all stations unprotected by the Acts ; the entry at the stations protected by the
Acts being 68 per 1000 of mean strength of the soldiers, and at the unprotected

stations 111 per 1000 for the same form of disease. So, again, the average number

of soldiers constantly off' duty in 1864, the vear the first Contagious Diseases Act
was passed, was 19 per 1000 of strength ; in' 1869 it has fallen in the protected dis-

trict to 12-6. Still this is more than the loss in the French Army, where it is

11-11 per 1000; the whole loss from these kinds of sickness being equal to 7^
days of the English Army's time, 4 days of the French Army's, and slightly less

than three days of the Belgian Army's services every year. With respect to the
soldiers and sailors at Portsmouth, the number of fresh cases in a single week of
May 1870 was 17 ; in the corresponding week of 1864 it was GO. The number of
days of sickness in the crews of the home station from contagious disease averaged

99,058 every year between 1861 and 1865, in 1867 it fell to 72,132, reducing the
annual money cost from £21,867 to £15,898. To prove that in the general deduc-

tion of contagious disease the true constitutional disease has also been lessened, it
was narrated that the period of treatment of this form has been gi'eatly shortened

among the female patients from 125 to 66 days ; and that the form of ulcer,

almost always, if not invariably, the prelude of constitutional disease, has been
reduced to one half its previous amount in the protected stations, and to one half
its present amount at the unprotected stations. That the civil population reaps

considerable benefit from these Acts appears from the number of contagious pa-
tients admitted into the three workhouses of the Plymouth district, which has

been reduced from 151 males and 705 females to 55 males and 107 females in the

same length of time ; also the percentage of such patients in the Devouport jail

was reduced from 4'06 to 1*89 per annum.

   The effect of the Acts on the moral and social condition of the women subjected
to them was alluded to. The matron of the Portsmouth Home for abandoned
women stated that of 1114 such persons living in Portsmouth in 1869, 161 left the
district, 94 are now living with their friends, 43 have married, 30 have entered the

home, 10 are in service, 24 in the workhouses, 12 have died, 10 have returned to

their husbands, leaving 730 still in the town, or 384 less than last year. In the

report of the Commissioner of Meta-opolitan Police, it is stated that 7766 women
have been brought under the Acts in various towns, of whom only 3016 remain

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

hence, to quote from Dr. Lyon Playfair's speech in the House of Commons, "4750
no longer practise their vocation in these towns ; of the remainder, 107 have died,
385 have married, 451 have entered homes, and 1249 have been restored to their
friends. In short, 27 per cent, are known to have retiu'ned to a respectable life.
Thus 32 per cent, have left the stations, many doubtless to pursue their miserable
career elsewhere, but many also, as the police believe, and as in charity we are
bound to hope, to return to their own homes." The places of resort of these per-
sons had likewise diminished in the Plymouth district from 358 in 1864 to 131 in
December 1869.

 Intemperance, purely with reference to Liverpool, By the Rev. John Jones.

   This was simply a statistical paper showing the varied ravages made by strong

--drink iipon a communitjr, and contained the following facts : Liverpool did not

owe its intemperance to its being a seaport, as in the year 1869, out of a total of
apprehensions for drimkenness amounting to 24,614, there were but 1997 belonging
to the canal, the river, and the sea, leaving an excess of 18,017 for other avocations.

   The Hospitals and Dispensaries during the year 1869 had 72,278 cases, at an

expenditure of £22,088 7s. Id. Three Dispensaries during thirty years received a
total of 1,250,000 patients, at a cost of about £100,000. The main source of all

--this suffering is drunkenness engendering disease, accidents, and poverty. Thus

the great bulk of cases in the Hospitals are tolerated as " accidents ;" for example,
a Hospital with 3781 cases during the year had 2893 of these as accidents ; and it
has been computed that out of a total of accident cases amounting to 19,378, not
less than 12,030 of these were the result of intemperance.

   Pauperism was thus shown. In Liverpool there are three workhouses having
a total of 4714 inmates, while outdoor relief was given to 9998 persons in one
week in one of the Unions, and to 22,183 persons and 2537 families respectively
during the year in the two other Unions ; while medical relief was given in the
one Uniou at the rate of 100,000 cases per annum, and in the other Unions to 5864
cases and 1790 families respectively. In one of the Unions there were in a given
week 589 lunatics, 391 cases being admitted during the year. The expenditure
on behalf of all these paupers and lunatics amounts to upwards of £250,000 per
annum, which, but for intemperance, might nearly be altogether uncalled for. In
addition to parish relief, a Voluntary Society has, during the past six years, re-

                                                                                                 13*

lieved 120,038 cases of distress at a cost of £16,560 16s. 8d., together with nearly
1,000,000 quarts of soup ; wliile 7000 dinners have been provided weekly for
starving children in the several Kagged Schools.

   Criminal intemperance was thus shown. Dui-ing the past year 23,458 cases of
drunkenness passed through the hands of the police, the number having doubled

as compared with the year 1861 : 3343 men and 2300 women were tabulated as
"habitual drunkards; " some of whom were in custody during the year 15 and 18

times. Out of 2249 resident prostitutes there were 1867 cases of apprehension for
drunkenness, the "social evil" and "strong drink" going hand in hand. The
majority of drunkards are Irish. Thus, while there were natives of Scotland only

882, of Wales 645, of foreign lands 512, of Ireland there were 7947. Among the

--drunken there were 16,503 lodgers to 3166 householders, housekeeping and

 drunkenness unable to flourish together. In the town there were 1182 houses of
 bad character, while 20 murders, 15 manslaughters, 106 cases of stabbing, &c.,
took place during the year. Out of 17,529 cases of drunkenness, 10,934 were more
 or less educated. The year 1870 is the worst for drunkenness recorded in the
annals of the police. Out of 18,303 cases of drunkenness there are 8536 women.
 The Borough Gaol, erected at a cost of £100,000, is become too small. The annual
 cost to the Borough of intemperance is computed to be £375,000.

    During a period of 36 years 21,300 cases of death were investigated in the Coro-
 ners Court ; 85 per cent, or 18,105 of these were attributed by the late coroner to
 drink. The present average number is about 900 cases per annnm, .300 of which
 are children under 5 years, about 140 of these being annually suffocated by drunken

 parents.

     There are, as accounting for all the foregoing, 3579 alcoholic establishments of
 all sorts, to about 500 only of bakers' shops. Oat of 770 employes in one firm 499
 were Scottish. One drunken case per day to each public house amoimts to 195,000
 per annum.

    The paper advocated the rights of the people to put down all public houses by

 a sufficient majority so deciding.

On the Policy and Provisions of a Patent-law. By E. M. Pankhuest, LL.D.

After stating and defining at length the two classes of objections to the policy

of a patent-law (viz. that protection to inventions is vicious and wrong; secondly,

that though some protection may be desirable, it ought not to be in the nature of a

legal protection), tlic author went on to state the considerations of gain which should

induce the creation of a right of property in inventions. They were, that inventions

might be more largel_y and rapidly made, become sooner and more thoroughly per-

fected, be speedily made and fully disclosed, be more energetically and successfully

brought into general use, and finally, after the legal right in them had been dulj'' de-

termined, that they might become the common property of society. With regard

to definition of tcnns, an invention considered .as a subject of legal protection was

an application of Icnowledgc in general of the laws of nature, expressed in the form

Aof a new and useful process.  patent right in view of legal protection was tlio

creation of a limited right of property in a new and useful process. These, tlie

author submitted, were sufficient reasons. Upon the question of right, the whole

essence of the case lay here : Was it the best way to promote invention and improve

manufactures to give tlie inventor a limited right of property in his invention ? If

so, these objects were the reasons, the causes of the creation of the right of pro-

perty, but the source of the riglit itself was the act of the legislation. The objection

that a patent-law ^yas a monopoly the author met bj^ the argument that a patent-right

Awas not a monopoly. monopoly was a protection to an existing mode of manufac-

ture or industry, a means to keep in the possession of a few and to injuriously

limit existing- property ; while a patent-right related to something before unknown,

hut now called into existence and supplied for the use of man. The views of Mr.

Mactie and others, who hold that inventors were the creditors of tlie nation, and

deserved national compensation, were next noticed ; and he argued that such an

arrangement, though it might appropriately form a complement to a patent-law,

Acould never be fully regarded as a substitute for a patent-law.                                                                                    patent-law,

while giving an adequate stimulus to inventions, also secured, during the period

over which the right of property existed, that it should be so limited by the terms of

its creation as to give the minimum of interference with the freedom of manufac-
tures with a maximum of advantage to inventors and the public. The speci-

fication by means of which were determined the questions of utility, novelty, and

invasion, next came under notice. This point went to the root of the essential

difficulties of a patent-law. Issues in patent causes were principally questions of

construction, and it was obvious that the instrument upon the true construction of

which the decision of these issues depended should be framed with the utmost care

--and consideration. The practical evils of the present system were : (1) the indis-
                                                                                                                   want of accuracy in              the
criminate  granting of patents                                                                            (2) the                       describing       nature
                                                                                                       ;

and limits of the rights secured by the patent (3) the cost, vexation, and unsatis-
                                                                                                                   ;

factory character of the trials of patent causes. The remedies which he suggested
--were twofold, suggestions for the efficient working of the existing law, iiud the

introduction of additional provisions, both of constitution and administration. The

--proposed remedies might be thus classiiied : 1, conditions precedent to the grant-

ing of patents; 2, provisions to secure acciu'acy of description and definition;

3, conditions precedent to litigation ; 4, provisions in regard to the trial of patent

causes. With regard to the tirst point, the present function of the law officers of

the Crown should be either absolutelj' abolished or essentially modified. Next, the

grant of a patent sliould be precedecl by an examination by competent examining

officers. The result of that examination should be made in the form of a report,

and, if favourable, a grant should be at once made ; if unfavourable, there should be
the right of appeal. On the second point, the specification, which was the patentee's

charter, should be reported upon by competent officers. On the third point, prior

to the institution of proceedings for infringement, the report of an examiuing-officer

should be obtained, based upon the statement of the applicant as to the precise

nature and extent of the infringement. On the fourth point, the trial of patent
causes sliould be conducted before a judge sitting -with assessors. By such means

it was contended that the total amount of litigation would be lessened, and

simplicity and efficiency would be given to the administration of the patent-laws.

The creation of a limited right of property was expedient, for it was capable of pre-

cise  determination :  tlie  duty  of the public in regard to                                                         it was            clearly ascertainable
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

on the discharge of the duty it was the basis of further improvement, and the time

of the cessor of the right was fully shown. The giving to inventors a linuted right

of property in their inventions would aflbrd them the best security, while, with the

least practicable interference with free action, it would confer the greatest ad^'a^-

tage upon the public.

   Attention is first directed to the fact that accounts which might have been issued
in the spring of 1869 are not issued until after Parliament has risen this year,
and therefore fail in the object of supplying statistical guidance for legislation.
Nay, not even in the spring of 1870, but only in this week ; so that for two sessions

the' accounts are kept hidden, and the value of publicity is now more historical than

198 REPORT--1870.

The Eeportofthe Eoyal Commission on Railways has unhappily failed to receive

the consideration from Her Majesty's Government which might have been expected,

seeing it was prepared by such high authorities as the Duke of Devonshire, Lord

Stanley (Derby), JNIr. Lowe, Mr. Glynn, Captain Galton, Mr. M'Clean, and others.

It had a  large representation of the  railway interests                                                                  but,    not\\ithstanding-,  con-

tained many recommendations in the public interest, such as uniformity of classi-

fication of goods, definition of terminal charges, revision and reduction of charges

for parcels ; these reforms to be accompanied by a power of inspection and inter-

vention in the public interest by the Board of Trade, where railways used their

powers oppressively. But the recommendations remain a dead letter, and practi-

cally, as regards goods and parcels, the railway monopoly charge as they please,

competition being prevented by combination and legislation ineffectual from its

want of knowledge.

poured forth by the eloquent chairman at each railway-meeting.

   McturH-tichets form the main buffer interposed between the grinding exactions of
railway companies and the public impatience. Economy of issue is not one penny

each, as that charge wovdd amoimt to over £'1,000,000, the whole traffic charges

being less than half that sum.

Free passes stand self-condemned; they are either discounts upon traffic to favoured

customers and so unjust to the non-favoured, or are frauds upon the proprietors.

The remedy is a fairly calculated remunerative scale of charges proportioned to

the accommodation afforded, supplied regularly, and offering equal terms to all

k    Two companies dominating the Lancashire district carried 22J per cent, of the

   weight 251 per cent, of the distance, and received 29 j per cent, of the freight of goods
   and minerals. The conformation of Lancashire explains this : 2,782,582 persons

   only growing 41,535 acres of wheat, but although within an average distance of 25
   miles from Liverpool, charged as if 75 or 100 miles from the Scheldt, are obliged
   to pay the increased charge levied upon their food, nearly half the wheat imported
   into England and Wales in the last cereal year having entered the Mersej"- ; the
   monopoly reigns imchecked. For example, Bristol to Birmingham is 94 miles,
   wheat is charged 8s. lOd. ; Livei^pool to Sheffield, 76 miles, the rate is 15.s.

      The monopolj' power is argued for upon the ground of enabling railway com-

   panies to compensate districts labouring under natural disadvantages ; thus, by
   charging persons near to Bm'ton a higher rate on beer, they are enabled to send

   it long distances under cost. The terrestrial providence system may go with the
   paternal government theory. The second argument is that goods are now carried
   much more cheaply than before railways were made, to which the answer is

   obvious ; so they shovdd, the cost of transport being reduced.

       Again, the companies do not exceed then- tarifls, and it is open to the public, or
   was, to see they are reasonable. The answer is, the tarifts were formed in igno-
   rance, and although intended to protect the public, signally fail ; whilst Parlia-
   ment has reserved to itself a right of revision, and these quasi corporations have no
   other raison d'etre than public utility : already the courts of law will enforce the
   concession of uniform charges to all persons, and places should be similarly treated.

      The great argument for high rates is that the total capital shares and loans is
   £425,161,506, gross receipts £35,226,866, and net receipts £18,092,091 is only 4|
   per cent. To this it may be replied, much of this money is borrowed at 4 per cent.
   Secondly, no such amount of capital has been expended, fictitious shares, issues of
   stock at 50, 60, and 80 per cent., bonds granted at their face value, but for

          On Mechanics^ Institutions and the JEIementari/ Education Bill.

                                    By E. Eenals.

   Although Mechanics' Institutions had been established for more than a quarter
of a century, tlicy had failed to enlist the sympathj' of working men. This posi-
tion was maintained by the statistics which had been supplied to him from some of
the largest institutions in the kingdom.

   With elemeutarjf schools scattered over the country in sufficient numbers to

meet the educational wants of the population, one great hindrance to the useful-
ness of Mechanics' Institutions will be removed. To render these institutions cen-

--tres of education for working men four things were needed : 1, that the iScieuce

Classes which are promoted bj' the Committee of Council on Education should
always be connected with Mechanics' Institutions ; 2, that each institution should
provide a technical library for the use of workmen ; ?>, that youths, on leaving
school to learn a trade, should be gradually brought into union with an institution
by having free admission to a course of technical instruction bearing directly on the
employments which it is intended they should follow ; and 4, that a portion of
the managing body should be composed of working men. It was contended that, as
mitrained labour was constantly being superseded by mechanical contrivances and
inventions, the technical and scientific education thus afibrded by Mechanics' In-
stitutions would prepare a larger number of operatives for higher grades of industry

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

         On the Utilization of Fibrous Cottonseed. By Thomas Hose.

   The author said that in such a utilitarian age as this it would be matter for sur-
prise that a vegetable production which should be valuable, and could be supplied
by the million of tons, was now wasted. The waste product was fibrous cotton-
seed. In America alone more than a million and a half tons of this seed were yearly
wasted. This seed was composed of 50 per cent, kernel, M'hich yielded about one-
third oil and 50 per cent, husk (shell with fibre adhering), of which the fibre would
be one-third. From this he gathered that the now wasted seeds would produce
250,000 tons pure cotton, 250,000 tons oil, and 500,000 tons of cattle-cake, the
value of which he estimated at £20,000,000. The husks could be taken to the

material for paper. By a process which the speaker described at length, the cotton-

libre could be completely separated from the shell. Compared with esparto grass,
the cotton-fibre preseuted many advantages, chief amongst which was the unfail-

ing supply. He also referred to the value and use of the oil and cattle-cake which

the seed would yield.

On the Effect which a Mint Charge has upon the vcdue of Coins, to which is

   added a Proposition for securing at once some of the advantages of Inter-

  national Coinage. Bg G. Johicstgne Stonet, M.A., F.ll.S.

The value of a gold coin in no degree depends on the proportion of baser metals

which may be mixed with its gold ; aud in this communication when gold is spoken

of it is the fine gold which is to be imderstood, aud not those alloys, varying from

one country to another, which are called standard gold.

Omitting fractions, the British sovereign contains when new 732 centigrams of

fine gold ; whence it follows that each centigram of gold, each cent as it may be

called for brevity, represents about one-third of a penny, the exact equivalent

being that every 3'05 centigi'ams of the fine gold in a new sovereign are worth one

penny.

The 2o-franc piece contains 725 centigi-ams of gold, and it has been suggested

that our sovereign should be identified with this piece by issuing coins containing

only 725 cents of gold ; and it is alleged that the value of the new coins would be

maintained as high as the sovereign by imposing a mint charge of a little over two

pence as a substitute for the 7 cents of gold which are to be withheld. Tlie advo-

cates of the proposal urge in support of their view that, whenever the wants of the

country require that more gold shall be coined, it will be necessary to bring to the

Miut exactly the same quantity of bar gold as now, in order to procure ten thou-

sand sovereigns.

On the other hand, other financiers are of opinion that the coinage could not be

thus treated without depressing its value ; although, so far as the author of this

communication is aware, they have not pointed out wherein lies the fallacy of the

foregoing argiiment. An attempt is now made to supply this deficiency.

The fallacy seems to consist in regarding the upper limit of tlie value of a coin as
Athe same thing as the value of the coin.
                                           coin is not a commodity of perfectly

fixed value, but one whicli fluctuates between certain limits. The upper limit in
London* is sufficiently defined by the weight of bar gold which will procure a
sovereign at the Bankf ; and if there were no light gold in circulation, the lower

limit in Loudon would at present be defined by the weight of bar gold remaiuino-
in the sovereign when it just passes out of circulation through defect of weight.

It is convenient, though not quite exact in principle, to estimate the interval be-

tween these two limits in pence : and estimating it thus, we may say that if coins

did not wear, but retained through their whole existence the full weight they have

when issued from the Miut, they would have more purchasing power than at pre-
sent; and again, if they did not wear aud had all of them the weight of coins just

before they go out of lawful circulatiou, they would (if there were no liglit coin in
circulation) have less purchasing-power than at present ; and that three-halfpence

is about the difference between the purchasing-powers of two such hypothetical
sovereigns. The purchasing-power of real sovereigns (where no light coin is al-

  --* In London, because at otiier stations the problem becomes complicated by fresh con-

siderations such as the cost of the carriage of the coin from London, the cost of insuring
it during its transit, and the loss of interest for the time the transfer takes.

   t At the Bank, where coin can be procured for bar gold over the counter, rather than
at the Mint, where there would be a delay of about twelve days, the interest dm-ing which
woidd have to be taken into account.

lowed to remain in circulation) may be anywhere between these two limits, and in

fact diifers in different transactions.

   To make this clear, consider the case of a shopkeeper who receives a certain
quantity of light gold in the year. This occasions him a certain loss, which he

looks upon as one of the expenses of carrj'ing on his business, and he recoups him-

self for it by charging somewhere higher prices for his goods than would otherwise
be necessary. In other words, the pm'chasing-power of money has been lessened.

   The effect of taking the seven centigrams of gold out of the sovereign and im-
posing an equivalent mint charge will now be evident. It would leave the upper
limit of the value of a sovereign almost the same as it now is, but depress the lower

limit two-pence further down. It would thus produce two highly mischievous

effects : it would increase the range of fluctuation from three-halfpence to three-

pence halfj)enny ; and it would lower the averaf/e pm-chasing-power of a sovereign

by about one pennJ^ Neither of these effects could be tolerated : the increase of

the range of fluctuations of purchasing-power is one of the worst defects which

coidd be imparted to that commodity which is used to measm-e the values of other

commodities, and the decrease of the average pm'chasing-power of the sovereign

would cause it to cease to be a pound sterling.

 We --may learn two practical lessons from this discussion, 1st, that the practice

of the mints of Great Britain, Russia, and Spain, of coinrng gold without charge,

is very much to be preferred to the practice of other countries in which a mintage

is charged, since the imposition of a mint charge increases the range of fluctuation

of the purchasing-power of coins : 2nd, that a nation which aims at honesty ought

to take effectual means to prevent light gold remaining in circidation; for when

light coins circulate it is easy to see that the same two mischievous effects ensue

the range of fluctuation of the purchasing-power of coins is increased, and their

average purchasing-power is lowered.

   To keep our ideas clear, we should carefully distinguish between three different

values of fine gold : 1st, the value of each centigram of gold in uncoined bar gold;

2nd, the value of each centigram of gold in new sovereigns ; 3rd, the value of each

centigram of gold in the sovereign just before ceasing to be lawfully in circulation.

These values are in the ratio of the following sums of money, viz. Ist, £3 17s. Qd.,

which is the price the Bank gives for \^* oz. of gold in an ingot ; 2nd, £3 17s. lO^fZ.,

which is the sum into which                                                                                                                 oz. of  gold is  coined ;  3rd, £3 18s.  4j(/., which  is
                                                                                                                                     -J-J,

the sum into which \^ oz. of gold would coin if the coins were made of the lightest

weight which is legally current.

   Until lately the Bank gave only £3 17s. M. for ||^ oz. of fine gold in light coins.
Recently the price has been raised, and the Bank now gives £3 17s. Orf., the same
price as for bar gold. But there is no reason why the gold of light sovereigns

should be treated as uncoined gold. It would be barely just to the holders of light

coin that the State should purchase it at £3 17s. lOUl. ; audit would be consistent
with justice for the State to give for it any sum between this and £3 18s. 4:\d. It

is clearly for the interest of the community that as large a price as is practicable

should be offered, because this will tend both to withdraw light gold from circula-

tion, and to diminish that range of fluctuation of purchasing-power to which money

is subject even when no light gold is allowed to remain in circulation. It may

be objected that there is a practical impediment to carrying the price beyond

£3 17s. \Ohd., as to do so tends to render the practice of sweating gold profitable

but the oppoi-tunity for this nefarious business would not be much greater than

at present.

   Another consideration offers itself which is deserving of attention, since it points

out a way bj^ which foreign transactions may be facilitated. It will be apparent

from the foregoing discussion that one effect of the imposition of a mintage is to

increase the average purchasing-power of each centigi-am of gold in a coin. Hence

a centigram of gold in one of our corns has a somewhat less purchasing-power than

a centigram of gold in the coinage of a country which nuikes a mint charge.

Hence it woidd be a safe transaction for us to issue our own coins in exchange for

such of the coins of foreign covmtries as may be brought to England in the course

of trade, making the weights of fine gold thej' contain the basis of the exchange.

* In an ounce of the alloy called Standard gold there are \^ oz. of fine gold.

 unregistered births, and those of deaths among residents not natives of the counties
 in which the respective districts are situate.

    The number of births unregistered in 1851-60 has been estimated by the writer
 at 18,000 per annum, or nearly three to every 100 registered, on the groimds, (1)
 that by adopting such an estimate the population ascertained at the census of 1851,
plus natural increase and computed immigration, but minus emigrants of English
 birth, gives a result which agrees closely with the population actually enumerated
 in 1861 ; and (2) that by applying such a correction there is deduced from the
records of births and deaths in the years just preceding 1861, a number of children
 Avho should then haA"e been enumerated at ages xmder fii-e years, exceeding the
 number actually returned to as great an extent as could reasonably be expected,
having regard to the probability that many children in tJieir fifth year are errone-

 ously returned as full}^ five years of age.

    The annual ratio of deaths among persons not li-sing in their native coimties has
been assumed to range between 15 and 20 per thousand persons, except in the case
of the poorer class of Irish, who experience undoubtedly a much heavier rate of

mortality.

    Tables were appended to the paper, founded on these assumptions, showing not only

the numbers of persons who in the tenyears ( 1851-61)would appear to have removed

from the Registration Division in which they were born to either of the other ten
English divisions, but also the numbers of natives of other countries added to the
population of each division, and (as a final arithmetical result of considerable in-

terest) the numbers of natives of each of the eleven divisions respectively who must

have been included amongst the emigrants to America and elsewhere.
   In eveiy case the numbers thus represented as having emigrated or immigrated

are the balances resulting from setting arrivals against departm'es, and show the
final outcome rather than the steps by which it was attained.

   The net reduction of the natural increase of population in England and Wales
occasioned by migTations in the ten years (1851-61) appears to have been about
267,222 males and .35,098 females, such loss arising from an emigration of natives
of England and Wales amounting to 662,578, partly counterbalanced by an immi-
gration of Scotch, Irish, foreigners, &c., amounting to 360,258 ; net loss, 302,.320.

  We may infer, from the numbers of immigrants actually enumerated, that the

above figure, 360,258, was pretty equally divided between the sexes ; hence we

must conclude that the emigration was composed of about 457,000 males and

205,000 females.

   There is good reason for the belief that a vast proportion of the immigrants on
their arrival here were under twenty years of age. There are still stronger grounds
for coming to the same conclusion with reference to 1,013,451 natives of England
and Wales computed to have removed from theii- native division to one of the other
ten divisions during the same period of time.

   The imperfect returns* which we possess as to the numbers of English absent
from home in 1861, show that the total, embracing soldiers, sailors, and travellers
as well as residents abroad, was not far short of 1,350,000, viz. 900,000 males and

450,000 females.

   This shows the number of persons of English birth in existence at that time to
have been nearly such as would have resulted had the birth-rate in 1801-40 ave-
raged as high as 37 per thousand inhabitants, and had it in subsequent years been
such as is shown by the Ilegistrar-General's returns, ;;/(« six percent, for omissions
in 1841-50, and three per cent, for omissions in 1851-60, the death-rate being
assumed throughout to be the same as that shown in Dr. Farr's ' English Life
Table No. 3.' But the surviving females are decidedly more numerous than the
result of such a calculation would show. Consequently we are led to the conclu-
sion that the life-table in question does not represent female longevity as com-
pared with that of males in a sufliciently favourable light.

    It also appears that the census of ages taken in 1841 must needs have been very
inaccurate, and that, although the birth-rate in the first thirty years of the centmy

may have exceeded 37 per thousand, it was in 1831-40 somewhat lower than that

    * Eetiirns showing the age, sex, and county of birth of persons of British origin absent
from home on the Census day would be valuable.

figure. Wlien we take into consideration the fact that the corrected birth-rates in

subsequent years have been : in 1841-50 about 34^, in 1851-60 about 35, aud in

1861-70 about 36 per thousand, we are perhaps entitled to infer that an appreci-
able abatement in the rate was brought about through the operation of the new
Poor Law.

   Similar calculations with reference to the south-western counties, from whence
the emigration has been largest, show that the birth-rate in that division in 1801-40
was probably near 35 per thousand, against 32 per thousand in the succeeding
twenty years. The exodus from this division has been such that, for more than
700,000 natives aged 20-40 surviving in 1861, less than 500,000 persons were
enumerated as resident, of course inclusive of strangers.

   Other calculations show that the death-rate amongst natives of London is pro-
bably much higlier than the observed mortality amongst residents would lead us to

anticipate. It is desirable that returns shouli be obtained showing the place of
nativity of the dying, the effect of which would be to disturb very materially the

current ideas as to the significance of local death-rates.

   Finally, it may be useful to state summarily the following results of this

inquiry :

   1. Whilst the net loss by the emigration of natives of England and Wales
amounted in the twenty years 1841-1861 to about 1,130,000 persons, the net gain
by the immigration of persons born elsewhere amounted to about 740,000 persons,
so that the average annual loss of population caused by migrations in those twenty
years did not exceed 20,000 persons ; and the loss by the same cause in 1861-70

has probably not exceeded 40,000 persons annually.

   2. That more than 15 per cent, of the male natives of England and Wales aged
20-50 were absent in 1861 from their countiy.

   3. That the census of England and Wales about to be taken will probably show
the popidation to be nearly 22,500,000, and the excess of females to be nearly
700,000. The first of these figures is a quarter of a million larger, the second about
150,000 smaller, than the estimates published by the Registration Office would

indicate.

           On Decimal Money and a Common International Unit.
                               Bif William Westgarth.

1st. Our arithmetical basis is decimal; that is, we coimt by tens. Must that

therefore be the system in our monej', weights, and measures, in all that concerns

numbers, or are we free for any other counting ? 2nd. The greatest diversity of

natioual_ units, from the Spanish real of about 2^ f?. up to our own pound, shows

that accident first and habit afterwards must have largely shared in the creation of

such a family. Are some more suitable than others ? and how does this appear ?

--3rd. Is the international arrangement really important ?
   Decimal Money. Ten is not the best number, and probably never came into arith-

metical use by design                                                                                                   eight and twelve, as more divisible, are better.                 Cannot we
                                                                                                                     ;

therefore alter our basis? The reply at this time of day is, that in whatever way

ten-counting reached us, the world is now practically decimal, aud will remain so.
Then what is the eftect of nonconformity to our basis ? Try, for example, to con-

vert 1,527,643 farthings into poimds, shillings, pence, and farthings ; or to reduce

10,253 tons, 9 cwts., 3 qrs., 7 lbs., 8 oz., dwts., 5 grains, into gi-ains. With much

tinie and trouble to all, a large proportion would for certain commit one or more

mistakes in the process                                                                                                 and some might never                     get through at all, in the weights
                                                                                                              ;

and measures at least, unless they could refresh their memories as to some part or

other of the imsystematic medley. Such being our present nonconfoi-mity system,

how are these puzzles dealt with decimally ? Simply by pointing off the successive

grades, or conversely, by erasing the decimal points. The two questions are thus

instantaneously answered                                                                                                                     £1,527 .0.4.3, and  10,253,937,865 grains.  The answer

the disadvantage in all that relates to numbers in quitting our arithmetical basis is

manifest, continuous, and vmiversal. That basis stands as the common figure,

while money, weights, and measiu-es are, as it were, so many varieties of its

clothing. The latter must be adapted to the former and not left to other forms,

even if in the abstract superior, j^s well might a tailor cut his suits from some

model Apollo instead of his customer's own shape ; nor would the customer feel much

--more comfortable even if convinced that Apollo's figure was the better of the two.

  An International Unit. The grand test of suitability must be general use. Thus

tried, we find a middle region of fairly suitable uuits from a franc to a dollar.

Lower values, as the real and the piastre, provoke the substitution of a higher unit
when large amoimts are dealt with. The Tiu-ks, for instance, whose piastre is only

l^f/., tell up their revenues or debt by " purses," while a Frenchman is loyal to his
franc even up to " milliards," and an American to his dollar in thousand millions.

Our pound is of course the most convenient of all in such high-value regions, but

it entirely fails elsewhere. The trading classes ignore it to a very great extent, aa

their shops and stalls everywhere testify, by such ticketed prices as 25s., 50s., 100s.,

even 120s. upwards, instead of pounds. The vast mass of the poorer classes is still

further from the pound. Probably more than half the money dealings of all classes

together are for values under a pound. What does this mean, and what its dis-
advantage ? No less than this, that of all this everlasting business of society the

greater part is done in fractions instead of integers, which is much as though a

traveller took one part of his journey in the usual forward motion and the other

part backwards. The disadvantage is not felt in each individual step or even in a

hundred, it is in the huge collective total of the jovimey. It is like the minute frac-

tion of extra cost that seemed quite unworthy of attention, until we could realize

that even the hundredth of a penny was important in millions of yards.

The franc, then, seems the lowest, as the dollar seems the highest, value that

experience indicates as suitable by the test of general use. The other principal

units are all vmder the dollar, our solitary and anomalous pound excepted. Perhaps

the special well-being of America assists a rather high unit, thus confirming the

--view of its extreme position ; but the scale of modern finance requires the highest

value the dollar rather than the franc. But, again, authority and habit cannot be

ignored in this question, and the franc is backed by eighty millions of people com-

prised in the successfid International League of 1865. The choice is perhaps re-

stricted to one or other of these two units ; either of them is greatly more suitable

to us than the pound.

The Decimal Association has decided on a ten-franc unit. By the foregoing data

this is proved obviously too high. The countless users of a franc imit will not,

indeed cannot, rise to a ten-franc. The Association is a great authority; but another

no less, the Paris International Conference of 1807, preferred the five-franc, that is,

the dollar value. Our present moneys, the Association contend, could be readily

adapted to the ten-franc unit : true, but so they could to the five-franc, and even

more readily ; for with the small alteration suggested last year by Mr. Lowe, the
new coinage would be fifths of a pound (the new unit) and double pounds, or ten

times the unit. The subsidiary silver and copper money would, with their allow-

able margin of seigniorage, be as easily dealt with. Here he would remark that,

to carry out decimals in their integi-ity, there should be no intermediate coins ; most

countries, indeed all countries, decimal as well as non-decimal, are inveterate in

this practice, which violates all decimal simplicity.

  --Of what importance is the International Arranfiement ? Persons not imdistin-

guished have answered in effect, "None "                                                                                                                                                                                 little more than a convenience to excur-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

sionists. Such views seem incredible. There are certain gi-eat barriers to general

--intercourse the foreign element, the different language, and the different moneys

and measures. An international monetary .and metric system would entirely sweep

away the last, not perhaps the least, of these barriers.

     Statistics on Tobacco, its Use and Abuses. Bij E. WiLKmsoN, L.C.P.

   The main object of this paper was to show that the use of tobacco in its various
forms tended to weaken the vital functions of the body, to interrupt the uniform ily
                                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.       207

of their action, to rob' life of mucli of its natural enjoyment, and to shorten the

period of its duration.

   In commenting on the diversity of opinion amongst the most eminent surgeons
on this subject, the author argued that if pharmacy be really a science, its prin-
ciples should not be less definite, nor their operation less uniform in their results
than in ordinaiy sciences.

  By careful compilers it is ascertained that in Great Britain there is an annual

increase of consumption of tobacco of about 750,000 lbs. weight. In 18G1, the
quantity imported into this country was 34,828,441 lbs. The number of the male
population at that time, aged fifteen years and upwards, was eight millions ; and
supposing only half of them to be smokers, it would give more than eight poimda
to each smoker ! Cigars and snufl:' do not come into this calculation.

   With respect to the revenue fi-oni this som-ce, the following particulars may be

--relied on, as they are copied from Government returns : " In 1839, the duty "was

£3,587,663 ; 1847, £4,278,893 ; 1857, £5,272,470 ; 1859, £6,542,000."

   These figures do not give the actual cost of smoking, snufiing, and chewing ; we

must add^ the whole paraphernalia of snuff-boxes and pipes of all descriptions,
numberless and nameless, the construction of which has taxed the ingenuity of

craftsmen ; and by these additions we shall realize as much more as the duty, and

thus produce the startling fact that £13,000,000 sterling of national wealth, and

much industry that might have been better employed, are worse than wasted.

                                      On Local Taxation. By 0. Williams.

A report was presented to parliament last Session by a Committee of the House

of Commons recommending that a moiety of the local taxation now paid by tenants

should be transferred to owners of property. Mr. Williams maintains that this

change would be so very far short of the requirements of the case as not to be

worth the while to make it. He suggests that the area of payers should be veiy

much enlarged, and maintains that the reasons for collecting the local taxes upon

the same principle and by the same machinery as the income- and property-tax are

very much the same. In his paper he shows that the poor-rate is a personal and

not a property-tax ; that all other local taxation is based upon the poor-rate assess-

ments                                 and that, when the rent of property was originally fixed upon as the mea-
                                   ;

sm'e of the ability of each to pay according to his means, then the measure was

much more just than under present circumstances, because the great bulk of in-

come was derived from land, very little from foreign commerce. As immense

profits are now made from trade, the -RTiter urges that those profits shoidd con-

tribute, along with all kinds of house and other property, as for national taxation

in the property-tax. He shows that, at present, owners pay all local taxes in large

towns, where the gi'eat bulk of the population reside, upon property let at the net

yearly rent of £13 and under ; that if the recommendation of the Committee were

carried out, owners would still have to pay all taxes on this veiy large class of

property ; and that the change practically would reach houses rented above £13
per annum net, the gross rental of which would range between £18 and £20 per

aimum. Shift half of the taxation from tenants to owners of such houses, and the

owners will at once increase the rentals by the same amount. What matter to

the tenants whether they pay to the tax-collector or the landlord ? It is expanding

commerce which necessitates wide, long, and good roads, brings into existence

quite an army of police to protect its products, requires himdreds of thousands of

hands to work it, and, sm-ely, commerce should contribute directly towards all

local taxation. After the payment of the interest upon the national debt, the great

bulk of the remainder is expended upon the army and navy. And how are they

employed? Mainly in protecting the lives of Her Majesty's subjects. In times
of war those who have most property do not object to contribute most towards the

expense of protecting it, and why should they not do so in times of peace. The

army protects life and property, and so do the police force ; the navy is similarlv

engaged on the seas ; how are our river-police employed P the diflerence is not

gi-eat. Then a glance should be taken at the paving, improvement, and lighting

rates. All personalty should contribute towards them. Good Avide roads are

greatly for the convenience of commerce ; were roads narrow and in bad repair,
Avealth would not accumulate so very rapidty, nor would property or commercial

products be as safe in banks and warehouses if streets were badly lighted. And

the wear and tear of the roads, in the main arteries, is enormous by the grindino-,

crushing, and heavy loads drawn over them. Narrow streets have constantly to
be widened by the growing demands of commerce, and it should be compelled

to contribute towards the expense, which it would do through a property- and

income-tax.

Then commerce should contribute towards the expense of an abundant water-

supply, i. e. according to the value of products protected, as by insurance, not by a
Amere rate on a warehonse.
                                                                                  property- and income-tax would "be an approximation.

   Prevention is better than cure. Commerce should contribute towards the
Liln-ary, Museum, and Education Rates, because property is safer in the midst of

the educated. Mr. Williams shows that Id. in the pound for the Library and Mu-
seum or poor-rate yields about £6300 per annum within the parliamentary borough

  He advocates that national and local taxes should be collected by the same col-

lectors                            that on the face of the tax-bills              should be  printed in two Knes,  National
                                ;

Taxes and Local Taxes ; that the collectors should pay to the Government the

national and to the local authorities the local taxes collected. And he suggests

that the poor-rate authorities, the watch, education, sanitary, water, improvement,

indeed that all committees should send into the mayors of tlie several boroughs the
sums required by each for the next year ; that they, respectively, should be required

to send the amount required to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who, again, would

fix the rate to yield the amounts required and to be collected with, but separate

from, the Government taxes. In this way the same local authorities as at present

would have the expending of our taxation, maintaining the golden feature that those

who pay shall expend their money through their representatives. Exceptional

legislation is recommended, instead' of a national bill, as the writer believes that

it would be much easier to get a local bill than a general measure through the

House.

             On a New Beat-Engine. By A. W. Bickeeton, F.C.S.

   The engine is intended to be worked by the expansion of crude nitrogen or
common air, under the intiuence of heat. The air is heated in a serpentine sj'stem
of tubes passing up and down inside a flue which surrounds the fireplace : the fire
itself does not come in contact with the tubes ; but as they entirely surround the
fireplace, loss by radiation and conduction is prevented. The air to be heated is
compressed and forced into the tubes at the end most distant from the fire, and as

it travels forward, it is gradually heated ; so that the air to be heated is travelling

towards, and the products of combustion away from the fire : in this way the heat

is almost all abstracted from the products of combustion and given to the air, thus
preventing the loss that usually occurs by the hot gases passing up the chimney.
The air that has been expanded is allowed to pass out of the tubes from the end

her, and part of it is used for the blast of the fire, which is in a firebrick chamber

without bars, the ashes fusing and fiaming ofi" as slag : tlie remainder of the spent

air not used as a blast is mixed with the products of combustion immediately above

the fire and before they enter the fiue, thus diminishing the intensity of the heat

and preventing its injuring the tubes, and also using up the heat of the spent air in

helping to heat a fresh supply.

 --The complete cycle consists of the following steps : Air is compressed, is forced

into tub 3.?, is then heated, then acts upon a piston, and a part of the spent air, which

still retains considerable heat, is used as the blast and the rest in heating a fresh

supply ; thus the real work at our disposal is the ditt'erence between the compres-

sing and working cylinders.

   The above description applies to an engine where air is used ; when nitrogen is

used, the same gas is used over and over again, and slight modifications are neces-

sary, but the general principle is the same.

   By tliesa means it is hoped that a considerable amount of the loss of heat that
must accompany the use of steam may be avoided, especially that which passes

up the chimney and that which passes away with the water that becomes heated

in condensing the steam, an amount many times that which is converted into work

in the steam-engine.

Oil a New System of Testinj the Qml'dij of the Malleahh Metals and Alloys,
          with E.vjterimental Illustrations. By GtJSiAv Ui.scnoF, Jan.

Superior qualities of malleable metals and alloys are characterized by their being

able permanently to extend in all directions by rolling or hammering without rup-

ture, whilst inferior qualities break before reaching the maximum of extension

which the former can endure. The cause of this is the dilFerence of the cohesive

power in different qualities of the same metal or alloy. From this it must be con-

cluded that if different qualities of the same metal or alloy have been rolled in

exactly the same manner, the better their quality the oftener they can, after roll-

iug, hi bent in reverse directions at a certain angle without breaking. Upon this

myprinciple                                  te:^t is based.

The to-and-fro movements which, for instance, pure zinc, the best and the most

inferior quality of commercial zinc hitherto tested, withstood without breaking,

under the conditions presently described, wei-e respectively in the ratio of 100, 54,

and 19; for a good quality of steel, charcoal iron prepared by puddling, and ordi-

nary bar                               iron  the  ratio was 100, 43, and 26                                                                                                                     for ditterent qualities of                                      commercial
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

copper between 100 and 19 ; for different qualities of commercial tin between 100

and 10, &c. It is obvious that once having such figures as standards, auj' other

figure obtained in testing metals or alloys will indicate their quality in reference to

the quality of the standard, the metliod being the more reliable, as properties

which are essential for practical purposes form the criterion.

The accuracy and saving of time and labour through this test will be estimated

from the fact, that, for instance, the deteriorating effect of as little as 1 part of tin

upon 10 million parts of pure zinc, or of 1 part of cadmium upon 2o0,000 parts of

pure zinc, can be detected with certainty in less than one hour, whilst such traces

would probabl}'' escape the notice of a chemist if he spent a fortnight in analvzing.

As the rolling of samples for comparative tests must always be efl'ected "under

the same circumstances, the shape of the different samples must be alike before

the rolling is commenced. Metals which do not, or not materially, alter in quality

through fusion, are melted and poured into iron moulds of the required size, whilst

metals whicli alter in quality through fusion are cut into bars of the required size.

Tlieso bars are then, with or without annealing, according to the nature of tlie

uijtal or alloj', rolled in a test rolling-mill until they have a standard weight.

To the central screw of the rolling-mill which actuates the two screws which

press upon the upper roller a dial-plate with pointer is attached, enablinf one to

1S70.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           14

regulate the gradual pressure. The aimealiiig, if required, is effected in tubes of

fireclay heated externally.

As metals sometimes heeome jagged through rolling, strips 7 millims. wide are

cut out of the middle of the samples after they have heeu rolled to nearly the re-

quired thiclmess, after which the rolling is continued until they have the standard

weight.

 --The apparatus for bending the test-strips, which is termed a '' metallometer,"

contains two essential points, one or more vices a

for fixing the test-strips, m, and a guide, h, through

which the strips pass. The guide is capable of

oscillating upon two axles, c, c, which rest in bear-

ings fixed to the vice. The weights, d, d, which are

connected with the guide by means of rods, r, r,

always keep the guide in a vertical position when

an oscillating motion to the right or left is imparted

to the_ vice. Thus the guide forms an angle with

the vice at each to-and-fro movement, and the

test-strips, which are passed through the guide and

fixed by the vices, are also bent alternatively to the

right and left, by preference to an angle of "G7§ de-

grees to the vertical line, until they break, where-

upon the parts severed are caused to fall off by

means of the small weights ([/,[/) attached to them.
The motive power (by preference clock-work)

which actuates the metallometer has a dial-plate

with pointer which marks the number of to-and-

fro movements which the sample withstood before

breaking off.

   As no metal or alloy is quite homogeneous, it is
necessary to make a series of tests in order to ar-

rive at an average result.

 The     metallometer  which  was  exhibited   had    five

_

vices, each for two test-strips. Its working was

illusti-ated by testing copper. The test-mark (or

figure indicated on the dial of the clock-work) of

a sample of commercial copper, which had been

Atested_ previously, was stated to be 51.      corre-

sponding sample of the same copper, which was tested in the presence of the Meet-
ing, gave on the average 52'0, showing that the scnuc quality is indicated by the

sume, or at least closely the same, test-mark.

mNext, a sample of the same copper as above, which, however, had been heated a
short time     a current of hydrogen, was tested. It is evident that the latter

treatment must impair the toughness. The test-mark obtained in this experiment,

being only about i- of that obtained in tlie former, proved how extremely sensitive
the metallometric indications are.

   Other samples of brass, steel, iron,  tin,  zinc,  and   lead,  which  had  been rpreptrared,
could not be tested for want of time.                                                                                      }

  A machine for manufacturing iron or steel bars at one operation into axles,

liiese axles will be of a superior quality, more uniform in size, and cheaper and
more quickly produced than those generally in use.

   Under the present system of manufacturing axles, a bar or billet of iron or

waj-ds snmlariy heated and sliaped at the other end, an operation of some time.

 hodih/, and placed iu the machine, which reduces it at one operation to the required
 size and shape. The rolls of the machine ai-e geared together so as to rotate iu the
same direction ; the iron is placed between the worlring rolls, which are brought to
bear upon the bar hj po^Yerful screws gradually pressing the rolls nearer together
and reducing the bar to tlie required dimensions. The part of the rolls which fomi
the tom-nals press upon the bar, reduciaig its diameter at that point, afterward bear-
ing upon the middle of the bar, and by degrees along its whole length. As the bar
becomes reduced in diameter it becomes extended in length 14 to 18 inches ; to
allow for this elongation, those parts of the rolls which form the tournals are ar-
ranged to slide laterally with the axle, while the rolls are screwed closer together
until the finished axle is produced, and which, by the greater uniformity of the

Tolling pressure, gives the direction to the fibre best calculated to increase the

strength of the axle.

  Hydraulic Machinery for Steering, Slopping, and Working Heavy Steam-

             engines discharging Cargo. By Andrew Betts BROA^if.

   The chief feature of novelty in the invention, as set forth in this paper, is in an
apparatus called a "steam-accumulator," by which a reservoir of water at a pres-
sure of 1000 lbs. per square inch and upwards is obtained on board ship. Having
this pressure, a steering-gear of light construction and great power is made use of
possessing certain relief valves, or other expedients b}' which perfect elasticity in
the rudder may be obtained.

   In a similar manner, by the use of hydraulic cylinders and rams, the same pump-
ing-machineiy and "steam-accumulator" which works the rudder at sea is made

available in port for the discharge of a ship's cargo, as well as, on entering a port,

to start, stop, and reverse heavy marine engines.

                  On the Efficiency of Furnaces and Mechanical Firing.

                               By George F. Deacon, G.E.

    In opening this subject, the author refen-ed to one of the veiy numerous expe-

riments of the late Mr. C. Wye Williams, in which air was admitted to the vola-

tile products of combustion of the carbon through holes in an arched plate, divid-

ing the fuel from end to end of the furnace. 5lr. WiUiams firmly believed that
such a system was capable of producing perfect combustion, and he strenuously
opposed the idea that any advantage was to be gained by making use of air for the

mcombustion of the inflammable gases which had been raised temperature by

heat abstracted from the furnace in which they were produced. The well-known
experiments of Professor Tyndall and Dr. Frankland, by which it was clearly shown
that, owing to the gi-eater inability of the atoms of rarefied air, the energy of
combustion was mthin wide limits independent of the density of the air, went far
to overturn the arguments with which Mr. Williams upheld his opinions.

   Arrangements similar in form to the perforated arched plate had been tried by
the author ; but in a series of careful experiments on a large scale only those which
had included means for heating the inflowing air had been foimd efficient in pro-

ducing perfect combustion of the gases. Transverse arched bars 7 or 8 inches
high, presenting to the rising air extensive heating-surfaces, had been substituted
for the bent plate, the heat for raising the temperature of the air having been ob-

tained, both by radiation and conduction, from the incandescent fuel.
                                                                                              14*

   The results of the aulhor's experiments may be summed up as follows:
   1st. The admission of cold air above the fuel in quantities sutKci(.^nt for the com-

plete combustion of the iutlammable gases is in most cases attended with loss of
etliciency, even if such admission takes place in jets over the whole surface of the

fuel. Smoke, however, is considerably reduced.

   2nd. By the motion of the air over heated surfaces, and its consequent rarefac-
tion and increase of velocity when issuing from orifices in the arched bars, much

more perfect chemical union with the iuilammable gases is insured ; the flame is
rendered less luminous, but its temperature is increased ; the radiation of heat is
diminished, and the furnace door becomes less hot. Smoke is almost entirely

prevented, and a higher rate of efliciency is attained.

   The author then proceeded to explain the great diHiculties in the way of work-
inf furnaces economically by hand tiring, and stated that Stanley's patent machine
for supplying coal to furnaces by means of horizontal fans, well known twenty
or thirty years ago, but now limited in its application to a few manufactories in
Yorksh'u-e, was probably the first apparatus for mechanical firin"- e^er made. It
was difficult to understand why this machine, which with all its imperfections had
been used in almost every mill in Lancashire until the new system of boilers was
introduced, should be found in Leeds still at work in the crude form in which the
ori"inal inventor had left it. This being the only feeder which rained down the
fuel evenly on every part of the furnace, involved a principle which was clearly cor-
rect ; but to render it efficient it required provision to be made for the combustion
of the gases thus uniformly set free. Such desideratum the author stated had been

supplied by combining with it the central arched bars. This arrangement, and
the improvements made upon the machine itself, had given the following satisfactory
results. The entire apparatus, consisting of a self-feeding furnace emitting no

smoke, comprised considerably fewer woi'king parts than any of the old machines.

It had now assumed a form capal)le of being manufactured at less than one-half

the cost of those mechanical stokers in which the fuel had a progressive motion
towards the back, and the imperfections of which were principally attributable to

the difficulty of regulating the admission of air through the bars at the back of the

furnace.

   The efficiency of the combined apparatus above that of the arched bar furnace
when fired by hand had been found by careful evaporative trials to be 9G90 per cent.

    In conclusion the author stated that a feeder and furnace constructed on the
principles advocated had been in successful operation day and night for nearly five
months at the works of Messrs. Earles and King in Liverpool.

So7ne Hemcirls on ilie extent to xvlt'u-h e-vht'inc/ Worls and Pi-actlce militufe

   against the Profttahle Utilization of Sewage. Bn Jonx Lailky Dkntox,

    lil. Inst. C.E., F.G.S.

   This paper points out that although the sewers of towns were not designedly
made leaky, thev were not constructed of a material and in a manner to secure

their being" water-tight, while in many cases the subsoil-water was intentionally
admitted. The original "(Tcneral Board of Health " recommended that all sewers

should be water-tight, and that there should be a separate system of pervious
channels for the removal of subsoil-water, which, it was stated, could be readily

made to discharge their contents into the sewers when required for flushing or
dilution. The consideration of these very important points is of little avail in

those numerous towns where a complete system of sewerage woi'ks have been
carried out, as the difficulty and expense of altering them would negative any such
proposition; but it will be of gieat value iji infiuencing the character of works yet
to be performed in small towns and villages where no systematic provision exists,
and in places where an alteration of existing sewers is practicable at a moderate

cost.

   To show to what extent existing leaky sewers, admitting subsoil-water, will
allow of the passage of sewage out of them into the surrounding soil is most diffi-
cult j but the fact must commend itself to all, that, under certain conditions, a
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                        213

fluid existing inside a sewer may pass as vapidly out of it into tlie surrounding'
{ground as the subsoil-water may pass from that g-round into the sewer. This eftect
will be conceded when the height and pressure of the one exceeds the height and

pressure of the other. Though the dilhculty of ascertaining- the quantity of sewage
which escapes is great, and the facts will only become apparent when disease

becomes localized in the neighbourhood of leaky sewers, there exists no difficulty

in determining the extent to which the influx of subsoil-water takes place. The
greatest increase from the infiltration of subsoil-water known to the writer is at

Tring and Hertford. In the first case, although the sewers are only connected

with 30 houses, and the whole influx of sewage does not amount to 1000 galls, per

diem, the dry-weather discharge from the main sewer amounts to upwards of

1,000,000 galis. per diem. The eftect of this abstraction of water from the subsoil

has been to lower all the springs in the neighbourhood, and to lay nearly dry the

head of the silk-mill in the town, from whence the Grand Junction Canal Com-

pany obtained a supply of water at a summit level. In the case of Hertford, the
discharge from the sewers is more than nine times the water-supply. At Black-

pool, for instance, with a standing population of 7000, the water-supply is about

a quarter of a million gallons daily, and the discharge from the sewers about

1,000,000 gallons. There is, therefore, an infiltration of water from some source of
three-quarters of a million gallons, and no effort is made to keep the sewage ou
the flow when the tides rise above the sewers. In the town of Dover, with a
standing population of about 25,000, where the water-supply is upwards of
1,000,0110 galls, daily, the ordinary dry-weather discharge from the sewers amounts
to nearly i3,600,000. Here, in order to keep the sewage "on the flow," pumping

is resoi-ted to for two hours before and two  hours  after  each  high  tide                       and it is
                                                                                                ;

possible that by such means the escape of sewage is in some measure reduced by

avoiding the extreme pressure of maximum accumulation. Vnder any circum-

stances it will be observed that the expense of pumping is increased by the influx

of subterranean water in the proportion of 1 to 85, and, as a natural consequence,

that £S')0 is spent when about £'100 would suffice if the sewage alone was dealt

Avith. If the returns of mortality in these places could be brought to bear, it
woidd doubtless be found that certain epidemics are localized in the low parts of

the town, while other diseases prevail in the higher parts, cau?ed by the pent-up

gases generated by detention finding their way upwards. This periodical condi-

tion of surcharged sewers is not confined to seaboard towns. In cases where the

sewage is lifted, the sewer authorities may allow the sewage to accumulate in the
sewers in order to avoid the expense of pumping at night, when precisely the
same eftect is produced as in seaboard towns under tidal influence. In many of

the Lancashire towns, such as Bolton, Livei-pool, Oldham, and "^^'arrington, the

aggregate daily excess due to subsoil-waler in these four towns alone reaches, I

have reason to believe, something between 20 and 25 millions of gallons, which, if
lifted 100 feet, would cost, at 20-?. per million gallons, upwards of £8000 a year.

At Cardift" in South AVales, the increase is 1,500,000, without any advantage in
the way of flushing and cleansing (which, it has been stated, always accompanies

the influx of water), for there the inflowing subsoil-water brings in with it a share
of the sand, which deposits itself in the sewers, and is likely to become an in-

creasing source of impediment and difficulty. In many instances of both seaboard

and inland towns the sewage has been more than doubled : and wherever it
becomes necessary, on the groimd of health and economy, to lift the sewage by

mechanical power (as we may safely assume will be the case in all towns, without

exception, where the sewers have not a free flow), the difficulty and cost of dealing
with such an increased quantity will become proportionately greater. These
observations are made with a full recognition of the difllculty, almost amounting
to an impossibility, of making ordinary sewers completely water-tight, and of the

truth that water finding its way into sewers sometimes acts beneficially in flushing

dilution, to wliicli attention should be called with a view to dctLimiue future

proceedings.

214 REPORT--1870.

   Tuming- from sewage works to the utilization of sewage by irrigation, which
the Rivers Pollution Commissioners have recommended as the only plan of dealing
with the sewage difficulty at present known, a very strong opinion has prevailed,
and has been acted upon up to the present time, that it is only necessary to run
the sewage over a surface of land covered with growing vegetation to extract from
it all that is fertilizing, and to render the effluent liquid perfectly harmless. It has
not been considered necessai-y that sewage shoidd pass through, as well as over,
the soil. The Rivers Pollution Commissioners themselves appear to have con-
sidered filtration, both downward and upward, separately from irrigation, and to
have reported upon each as distinct operations ; for, after advising a trial of inter-
mittent downward filtration on a large scale, they add that in all practicable cases
they would strongly recommend " the adoption of irrigation in preference to filtra-
tion," evidently considering that irrigation can be properly adopted without filtra-
tion. It is to this very important recommendation, as one likely to mislead if

not at once set right, that attention is called ; for by those who have made agricul-

ture a study, and have traced the effects of irrigation in England, Lombardy, and
elsewhere, it is considered that no irrigation is perfect unless it be accompanied by
filtration, and that if purification of the sewage is to accompany its profitable
application to land, it is absolutely necessary that no liquid whatever should pass
 ort' the surface, but that the whole should go through the soil as well as over it.
In no case where the sewage has uniformly filtered through a sufficient depth of

soil has failure occurred. In one case (Walton Convalescent Hospital) within my

 own practice, the effluent water from a small area of land receiving the sewage of
iipwards of 300 people, having been subjected last year to a properly devised mode
 of natural filtration, in conjunction with irrigation, was analyzed by Dr. Odling,

 and declared to be " unexceptionable potable water." In this case the soil is free
 and porous, though it was excessively wet before it was drained. The sewage
 having satisfied the growing vegetation is absorbed by the soil, and passing down-
 wards by filtration (naturally incident to under-draiuage) is mixed with a constant
 and copious flow of subsoil-water, the level of which is maintained by the imder

 drains. At Briton's Farm, near Romford, Mr. William Ilope, A^.C, has dealt

 with a somewhat different description of land, though of similar porosity. Ho
 has had the whole drained at a minimum depth of 5 feet, and the effluent water

 from the imder drains, though not equal in purity to that just referred to, shows
 very distinctly the supei-iority of irrigation in connexion with filtration over irri-
 gation simply. At Briton's (as at Walton) not a drop of water passes oft' the land.

    Though the instances are few in which irrigation and natural filtration have
 been associated in executed works of sewage utilization, they are sufficient to sup-
 port the conclusion that no irrigation should be adopted in which filtration docs
 not form a part of the system. At Penrith, Carlisle, and Bedford, the whole of
 the sewage is absorbed at the sm-face and discharged in diftcrent ways from the
 subsoil, and the amount of nitrogen and ammonia existing in the effluent water is
 stated, in the report of the Rivers Pollution Commission, to be as follows :

On certain Economical Improvements in ohtaining Motive Power,
                                Bij Richard Eaton.

Tlie paper recalled to mind tlie description given at Exeter of the Warsop aero-

steam-engine, and tlie promise to communicate results of further trials of the

Asystem, which have now been made in several places.  well-lmowu Lancashire

firm had built one of the engines for use in their own works, and had found a fuel-

consumption of CO cwt. per week with the air, as against 86 cwt. per week when

the air was shut oft'. Without the air-injection an average pressure of 33i lbs.

was shown, whilst with it a pressure of 47 lbs. was kept up. An engine of the

best construction, built for himself in Loudon, showed, with the air-injection, a

gain of 24| per cent, in worlc done at ordinary speed, and of 33^ per cent, at a

higher speed. The consumption of ordinary Welsh engine-coal was, with steam

--only, 5'88 lbs. per actual horse-power per hour ; with steam and air 4-72 lbs., or a

gain of 1'16 lb. per horse-power per hour a ^'ery valualjle economy. Experiments

with locomotive-engines were referred to, and experiments with condensing-engines,

made at the suggestion of Professor liankine, showed the vacuum to be very

slightly interfered with, contrary to expectation, a7id that the extra steam generated

counterbalanced the loss of vacuum, while the fuel-consumption was alike under

the two principles. The inventor has improved and simplified the coudensing-

englne proper to an extent that will prove an invaluable boon to all OAvners of

steam-vessels.

Repeated and varied experiments proved that the air-injection prevented scaling

in stationary and locomotive-boilers, and saline incrustation in marine boilers, and

thus added to their durability and diminished the risk of explosion, whilst priming

was prevented in all cases.

     On the Gauge for Eailwcti/s of the Future. By R. P. Fairlie, CLE.

   The object of this paper was to advance a new argument in favour of the use of

a narrow gauge in the construction of railwa3^s, founded upon a comparison of
the amount of weight hauled for the same amount of paying traffic over a railway
of 3-ft. gaiige and a railway of the English " narrow " or 4-ft. 83-in. gauge.
Although maintaining that the principle of his argument applied to passenger-tratfic,
and that the cost of working a railway, or, in other words, the proportion of
non-paj'ing to paying weight (as far as this is independant of management), is

increased exactly in proportion as the rails are fiurther apart, because a ton of
materials disposed upon a narrow gauge is stronger as regards its carrjdng-power

than the same weight when spread over a wider basis, the author on the present
occasion went into detail only with regard to the conveyance of goods ; and he
selected the London and North-Western Railway as his illustration of the ettects
of the 4-ft. 85-in. gauge, on the ground tliat its management is so good that the
defects in its working must be wholly traceable to its construction. He undertook
to show that this line, if made on a o-ft. gauge, would accommodate the whole of
its present goods-traffic as well as at present, and would do so at half the present
cost with half the present tonnage and motive power, and with half the present
wear and tear of rails, so that the expense now being incuiTcd for the construction
of a third line would be rendered unnecessary. Assuming that the present goods-
traffic, independently of minerals, amounts to ten millions of tons per annimi, and
that the non-paying weight of trucks by which these goods are liaulcd amounts to
the low estimate of 40 millions of tons more (70 millions being nearer the truth),
there results a total gross weight hauled by the locomotives of 50 millions of
tons, at an average speed of 25 miles an hour. The earnings for the goods-traffic

on this line are 6s. 2>d. per train mile, which, at an average rate all round of \\d.
per ton per mile, would give about 50 tons as the paying weight, and 250 tons as
the gross weight hauled per train mile ; dividing this 250 tons into the 50 millions
gives 200,000 trains, which, being divided over the 313 working days of a year,
gives 630 merchandize trains over all parts of the North-Western Railway in the

24 hours. The Company's balance-sheet shows that each net ton produces about
4s. 8d, which, at lh,d. per ton per mile, makes the a,verage distance by each ton
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

--216 REPORT 1870.

 to be about 38 miles ; so that as each ton of the total -weight hauled ruus 38 miles,
 and the entire length of line worked is 1432 miles, it follows that there must be
 on an averap-e 37 merchandize trains distributed over the total Icnutli. This
 number, divided into tlie total number of trains per day of 24 hours, pives an
 average of over 17 trains per day running- on each mile of the line. Having
 reached this conclusion, it becomes possible to see ho-w it "would affect the question
 if the gauge of the line -were 3 ft. instead of 4 ft. 8^ in. In the first place, the
 same or a greater speed could be maintained, say, up to 35 or 40 miles an hour.

On the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge the proportion of paying to non-paying has been taken at

 1 to 4, although it has proved largely in excess of this. The -waggons employed

 average 4 tons in -weight, so that on this reckoning each -waggon carries 1 ton for

 every mile it runs. The waggons for a line of 3-tt. gauge weigh each 1 ton, and

 carry a maximum load of 3 tons. Supposing that the same number of waggons

 and trains were run on the narrow gauge as on the broad, it follows that the

 average one ton of merchandize now taken coukl easily be taken in a waggon

 weighing 1 ton instead of 4 tons, and that the gross load passing over the line for
 one year would be only 25,000,000 of tons instead of 50,000,000, while the same
 amount of paying weight would be carried in either cnse ; that is, the small waggons,

which are capable of carrying three times the weight of goods now actually carried

in a 4-ton waggon, would only have to carry one-third of that quantity, and would
 produce the same paying load as the heavier waggons ; and as the haulage is pre-
 cisely the same whether the tons hauled consist of paying or non-paying load, it

follows that tliis expense would be reduced to two-iifths of what it now is. If
the same number of trains were to run per day, the weight of each would bo
reduced from 250 tons to 102 tons; or if the same gross weight of train was em-
ployed, the number of trains per day would be reduced from 639 to 250. If there
should be sufficient traffic to load the narrow-gauo-e waggons in such a way as to
require the same number and weight of trains that are no-«' worked, the result
would be that, without increasing by one penny the cost of haulage and the per-
manent way expens?s, the 3-ft. gauge would carry a paying of 25 millions of tons
as against the 10 millions now carried. Here, then, we have established the fact,

that, so far as capacity goes, the narrow gauge is superior to the broad one; the
former can produce 25 millions net out of a gross tonnage of 50 millions, while
the latter, to produce the same result, if continued to be woi'ked as it no-w is,
would require that 125 million tons should be hauled, and that at an increased
cost in the same proportion of 125 millions to 50 millions. The rest of the paper
was devoted to an application of these iigures to Ihe question of the best gauge
for Indian and Colonial railways, and to the argument that such railways might
be made cheaply and efficiently on a 3-ft. gauge, so as to chaige a reasonable tarilF
and to ajlbrd a satisfactory^ return.

On the Apijlicafion of the Centre-Bail System to a Raihuay in Brcizll and to
    other Mountain Lines ; a. so on ihe Advantages of Narrow- Gatiye liuilways.

   By J. B. Fell, C.E.

   The author said that since the opening of the Mont-Cenis Railway in June 18C8,
other mountain lines on the centre-rail system have been under consideration in
different parts of the world. One of tliese lines now being constructed is in Brazil
it commences at the terminus of tlie Canta-Gallo Railway, crosses the Scrra at an
elevation of 3000 feet above the Canta-CTallo line, and terminates at the town of
Novo Friburgo, a distance of 20 miles. In some of its principal features this rail-
way resembles the summit line of the 3Iont-Cenis, the gradients for the passage of
the Serra, over a distance of ten miles, being principally from 1 in 20 to 1 in 12,
and the curves by which the line -winds round the spurs or counter forts of the
mountain being, for a considerable portion of it, from 40 to 100 metres radius.
The narrow gauge of 1-10 metre has also been adopted. In other features, how-
ever, tliere is an important difference between these two centre-rail lines. The
concession for the Mont-Cenis was but teinporary, terminating at the completion
of the great tunnel, and the rfiilway is laid on the existing public road, whereas

the Car.ta-Gallo line will be permanent, and the works will be so constructed as

to be spoeially adapted to its requirements. It will not haTO to contend with the

difficulties of an Alpine climate, and, profiting by the experience of two years'

working- on the Mont-Cenis, it will have the advantage of important improvements

which have been made in the engines, carriages, and permanent way during that

period. Consequently the Canta-Gallo and other similar lines now being or about

to be commenced ha^e the interest of marking an important development of the

capabilities and ad-^antages of the centre-rail system as applied to the construc-

tion and working of mountain railways. It may be useful here to record what

has already been accomplished in the task of carrying railways over mountain-

passes hitherto inaccessible to the locomotive, and of giving it the power of safely

carrying trains of passengers and goods upon gradients and curves which would

previously have been considered most perilous, and, indeed, impracticable. The

Mont-Ceuis Railway has now been open for traffic two years and three months,

and during that period the trains have run a distance of more than 200,000 miles,

have carried between France and Italy over 100,000 passengers without injury to

any one of them, and has effected the transport of a considerable quantity of mer-

chandize. Since the month of September last it has carried the accelerated Indian

mail, and by the service thus established the delivery of the Indian mail in London

rid Marseilles has been anticipated by the Brindisi and Mont-Cenis route by about

thirty hours. The ordinary mails between France and Italy have been carried by

the Mont-Cenis Railway since its opening, and one night of travelling has been

cut oft' the journey between Paris and Turin. Although the Mont-Cenis Eailway

cannot be taken as a type of the best or most approved application of the centre-

rail system, it has had the effect of proving its mechanical practicability and safety

when put to the most crucial test to which any new principle could be submitted.

There have been mechanical defects in the construction of the engines Avhicli have

added unnecessarily to the cost of traction, and these defects can and will be

removed in the engines about to be built for the Brazilian and for future centre-

rail lines. The cost of traction, as might be expected imder the circumstances,

has hitherto been high (about 3 f. per train kilometre) ; but there can be no doubt

that with improved engines and good management the cost of traction may be

reduced to If. 50 c. per train kilometre. The Semuiering incline in Austria fur-
nishes an example of the economy that may be effected by impro^Ned machinery

and management, the cost of locomotive-power having been reduced from 2-85 i.

in 1860 to 2-15 f. in 18G3, 1-70 f. in 1805, and 1-49 f. in 18G6. In the fournew

engines last built for the Mont-Cenis a considerable saving has been made in

the cost of repairs by using four cylinders in place of two. By this arrano-e-

ment the inside and outside mechanisms are disconnected, and any contention

between the two is avoided. The adhesion, however, is not equal to the two-

cylinder engines, and the power is transmitted from the inside cylinders to the

vertical axles by means of a train of toothed wheels. In the new engines for the

Canta-Gallo line it is proposed to dispense with the toothed wheels and substitute

for them a system of direct driving by connecting-rods. The power of adhesion
will also be considerably increased. These new engines will have the advantage

of being able to run at a speed of from 20 to 30 miles an hour upon the ordinary

gradients of the line, and of taking their loads up the mountain-section at a

diminished speed of from eight to ten miles an hour. In an economic point of

view the result of the application of the centre-rail system to the Canta-Gallo

Railway will be as follows. The cost of construction, assuming it to be, as esti-
mated, about £300,000, woidd be at least doubled if made on gradients upon

which ordinary engines could work. In this case the costs of traction and main-

tenance for a centre-rail line will not be greater than for a liue with ordinary
gradients passing over the same country. The clear saving, therefore, effected by

employing the centre-rail system is at least £300,000, and the construction of a

valuable line of railway has been rendered possible, which woidd otherwise have
Abeen commercially and financially impracticable.
                                                   somewhat similar line of

railway is under consideration by the Indian Government, from the port of

Karwar to Ilooblc, in the Southern Mahratta country, both by way of the Arbyle

and the Kyga Ghats. The distance is 90 miles, and it is proposed to employ
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the centre vaW for a length of about 10 miles upon gradients of 1 in 20 for the pas-

sage of the Ghat, by "which a saving -would be effected of about £500,000. Tlie

cost at the present time of the transport of cotton and other produce over the 90

miles is stated to be £235,000 per annum, and there is, in addition, the disad-

vantage of not being able to convej' the ·whole crop to the port of shipment before

the raiuA^ season sets in ; a large portion of it has consequently to be housed and

kept until that is over. Negotiations are going on with the Government local

authorities and people interested for the construction of centre-rail lines in Italy

from the Adriatic to Macerata and crossing the Apennines to Foligno from Florence

to Faenza, and for three branch railways in the Neapolitan States ; in France, from

Chambery to St. Andre du Gaz and Lj^ons direct, crossing the Col de I'Epine

in Switzerland, for the passage of the Simplon                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and in Spain, for lines from  Leon
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

to Corunna and Gion. The concession for the Mont-Cenis Eailway expires on the

opening of the tunnel line ; and when that period arrives, it has been proposed to

remove it to one of the neighbouring mountain-passes, where it would have a per-

manent life. At the time the concessions were granted it was considered that the

line would be worked for ten, or at least seven years ; the progress of the gi'eat

tunnel has, however, been so much accelerated, that it is stated the tunnel line
may possibly be opened for traffic by the end of 1871. In that case, and taking

into account the difficulties of all kinds with which the enterprise has had to con-

tend, the ilont-Cenis Railway can only be regarded as an experimental line, and

the pioneer of a svstem destined to confer the benefits of cheap and safe communi-

cation between many countries separated by mountain-ranges hitherto impassable

by railways and locomotive-engines, and the promoters must look to the future for

the reward of their labours and the anxieties of the past. Drawings were exhi-

bited of a new system of narrow-gauge or suspension railways, an example of

which has recently been constructed as a branch line for carrying iron-ore from

the Park-house Mines to the Furuess Eailway in North Lancashire. The gauge

of this line is eight inches, and the length about one mile. It is carried at various

elevations, from 3 to 20 feet, over an vmdulating country, passing over the fences,

roads, and watercourses without requiring the construction of earthworks or

masonry. The structure consists of a double beam of wood, supported at intervals

on a single row of pillars. The narrow gauge is practically made equivalent to a

broader one by the steadying-power of guide-rails fixed on the sides of the beam

and below the carri'ing-rails. The bodies of the waggons are suspended from the

axles, and by this means the centre of gravity is brought low. They are also fur-

nished with horizontal wheels, which run upon the guide-bars, and thus maintain

the equilibrium of the carriages, and render it almost impossible for them to leave

the rails. The Park-house line will have a traffic of 50,000 tons per annum. The

cost has been £1000 per mile without stations or rolling stock. It was worked by

a stationary engine and endless wire rope. The saving effected in the cost of

transport will be at least Gd. per ton upon the distance of one mile. In Switzer-

land, applicntion has been made to the Government of the Canton "S^aud fo)- a

passenger Ihie on this principle, from the towai of Lausanne to the Lake of Geneva.

Plans have also been laid before the AVar Office for accelerating military transport

in foreign countries, and before the GoA'ernor-General of India for the constniction

of cheap branches from the trunk lines in that country. The gauge of these rail-

ways may be from 6 to 18 inches. They may be made of wood or iron, or of the

two combined, and may be worked by either stationary engines or by locomotives

of a form specially designed for the purpose. They have the advantages of being

economical in both construction and working; they occupy but little land and

cause no severance ; they may be erected with great rapidity, and, being portable,
miy be removed when no longer required and reerected in another locality. Before

the war commenced an offer was made to the French Government to construct one

of these portable railways to snpplj' their army -u-itli from 1000 to 3000 tons of

ammunition and pro\'isions per day. Tlie work would ha-^e been undertaken by a

gentleman in Paris, who, with a force of 2500 men, would have constructed from

four to five miles of railway per day, following the advance of the army into

Germany. The result has, however, shown how little such a provision was

needed.

   Livei"pool, the second commercial port in Great Britain, is at tliis time totally

undefended, and cannot be protected by shore-forts. The proposed new forts and
the proposed fleet of small unarmed one-gun boats might defend, but could not
protect, either the town or the docks from injuiy by an enemy's fire. There is
only one way of effectuall}' securing for the ports and shipping of the Mersey im-
munity from bombardment, namely, the closing of the two great shipways, the

(Queen's and the Horse channels, and thus keeping the hostile guns beyond their
range, the carrying, in fact, the sea-tight ten or twelye miles awaj' from the mouth
of the riyer. bhips and shore-forts cannot accomplish this ; and it can be eft'ected
only by floating forts of proper and suitable construction. One broadside-ship is
at best only good against two others one turret-ship could only fight one other.

                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

The defences of Liyerpool must be prepared to meet a fleet. Any number of un-

armoured yessels could not eifect this yital end. Unprotected vessels carrying
single guns would be certain, sooner or later, to be hit and sunk. Our heaviest
guns, the 600-pounders, would just pierce the battery-armour of the ' Hercules,'
but woidd not penetrate her water-line belt at 150 yards. Our first-class iron-
clads would be perfectly safe at two miles; but any one of the projectiles from
their armaments woidd sink an unarmoured gun-boat at five miles, indeed where-
ever it could hit her. The unarmoured vessel, however, could not Iceep out of

harm's way : she must come within 3000 yards to attack any iron-clad, for her guns

must punch the armour of her adversary to do any injury at all ; and there would
be no chance of sinking the iron-clad until her belt was ruptured. It is not right
to assume that gun-boats would not be hit, small and active tliough they be. In
practice made at Shoebniyness in 1868 the bull's-ej-e of a target painted to repre-
sent the port-hole of a ship had three shots put into it by a 2o0-pounder gun out
of nine rounds, all the rest being- within 2 feet of the mark. The running-target,
6 feet by feet, is repeatedly hit by the ofiieers and men of the School of Gunnery.
The smallest vessels being then so much larger tlian these objects, there are no sub-
stantial gi'ounds for the idea that they should be able to attack with impunity iron-;
clad men-of-war.

   What is really wanted for the protection of Liverpool is at least two impregnable

iron floating forts, capable, even if by any disaster or by design they should be sunk,
of fighting some of their gmis above water. Such forts can be made, and the piin-
ciple of construction advocated has already passed the bounds of mere hypothesis.

Any fort, however strongly built, must get injured by the terrific blows of modern

projectiles ; and as water finds access only too readily through cracks and fissures,
It is right to provide a resource against the last emergency. Another consideration
is that the battery afloat might be in danger of being overpowered by ramming,
which could be avoided by voluntaiy submergence on a shoal or on the sea-bed in
 sufficientlj' shallow water. Eifled guns (in other words, weapons of precision) re-
 quire, above all things, a perfectly steady and stable platform. Accm-ate aim is the
 primary consideration in their use. Ships are adapted for sailing, not for gun-
 cari-iages. The proper lively motion of a ship is absolutely antagonistic to

 steadiness of platform, blasts are not required in a floating fort; steam-power
 applied as hydraulic propulsion can give all the propulsion required.

    The four-rayed forts proposed by Mr. Moody, an able and most experienced
 captain in the merchant-service, have perfectly all the qualities required. In prin-

ciple they are double pendulums, the swing of whicli is absolute in two direc-

tions at right angles to each other. The centre of gravity is vertically over or

coincident with tlie centre of the mass. The oscillation is reduced to a minimum
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the draught of water is light. In turret-ships tlie longitudinal o.-cillation limits

the sites of the turrets to two points at such distances from the middle of the vessel

as -within Avhicli the motion is not too extensive to permit of the training of the guns.

In the four-rayed forts guns can be mounted all round the circumference of a

circle dra\^ai continuously at the same distance from the central point of least or no

motion. Thus the pnxctical arming of the floating fort, as compared to that of a

ship, could he as 8 to 4. The fort is flat -bottomed and buoyant throughout ; sta-

bility and steadiness are essential qualities. If sunk it would not heel over, and

when grounded it would remain n]3right, and in the shoal water of Liverpool

Bay would still keep its port-cills above water, so that the guns in its batteries

Acould be worked effectively.                                                                  model ves.sel of this form, 40 feet across, has

been built, and sailed with tlio gi-eatest success and under circumstances proving

the value and the safety of the invention, details and illustrations of which were
given. The class of Moody floating forts proposed would be not less than 200 feet

from ray to ray, plated over the central battery with 9-inch armour backed by

hollow stringers of not less than 10 inches in depth, and infilled with teak. The

guns should be protected by a low vertical parapet with 14 or 15-inch plating.

The main battery .should contain at least eight GOO-pounders, and it might be

well to have a turret above this containing four .3.5-ton guns or TOO-pounders to

ensure gun-power above water if the battery should be submerged, even at the top

of .spring-tides. The height of the port-cills of the ' Hercules,' which are very

lofty, is 11 feet above the water. The height of the port-cills of the proposed
battery, when afloat, would be 12 feet, whilst the height of the tui-ret-guns would

be 26 feet ; so that tliose guns would sweep and Arc dovrn upon the decks of the

finest turret-ships and iron-clads.

Against ramming, these forts would be absolutely .secure, the strength of their

stracture  being  enormous                                                            and  as  all  the  beams  and  girders  radiate  from  the
                                                                                   ;

centre, they give direct resistance in every direction to the blow. From the splay

over of the horizontal rim of the battery it would not be possible for any attack-

ing ship to get upon a ray to upset the fort, as has been most absurdly suggested;

the real tendencj' of the battery- when struck would be to gyrate out of the way.

Taking the proposed fort as fighting against a .ship of the ' Hercules ' cla.ss, wo

.should Imve for it a superiority of armour, and this superiority further increased

--by the angle at which the armour is inclined an angle calculated to deflect tlie

shot and not to permit its penetration ; a superiority in guns ; in stability and

steadiness of platform ; with no difficulty of opening ports and firing in any" wea-

ther: and, finally, the advantage of being able to fight as a fixed fort after being-

sunk. The ship in action would be encumbered wdth fallen masts and spars an(l

ropes entangling her screws, whilst the fort, moved by hydraulic power, would

be completely free from those most serious troubles. Moreover, such deep-draught

vessels as the '.Hercules' and our iron-clads generally could not follow an

enemy's gun-boats over the shoals ; but the batter}', if necessary, could, whilst,

on the other hand, if itself pressed haid, it could retire into shoal water.

The best means of protecting Livei-pool and .securing the immunity of its

wealth are the placing of one of these powerful floating forts on or nearTaylor's

bank to command tlie junction of the Crosby and Formby channels loading into

the long deep pool the Mersey makes at low water in Liverpool Bay; and another

floating battery on or near the extremity of the East Iloyle Bank, to command

the entrance to the Horse channel. By this disposition of the floating batteries

the fight with an hostile fleet would be forced on at nine miles away from the

town and docks, or, in other words, Liverpool and Birkenhead with their ware-

houses and .shipping would be preserved from the reach of the heaviest guns.

The waterways of the Victoria and Queen's and Old and New Formby chan-

nels could be planted with torpedoes, which would be protected by the "guns of

the floating forts ; and the like could be done with the long pool of the Mersey

meandering through the shoals in the bay, as also along the Horse and Rock

channels imder similar protection. Some few swift little steamers with Com-

On the Martini-Ifenri/ and WcstJei/-IiicJiards Itijles.
            By WiLLiAii P. Maksiiall, C.E.

The author stated that more than five years had elapsed since a Government

Commission reported unanimously in favour of arming the whole British infantry

with breech-loading guns ; and in 18G5 a Government advertisement invited pat-

Aterns for the proposed arm.  committee of investigation examined the patterns

sent in, and at the end of 1868 they recommended the adoption of the Martini

breech mechanism, with the Henry rifling and the Boxer ammunition. The breech-

closing arrangements in this combination were considered by practical men to be

mechanically defective, but the bore of the barrel, the turn of the rifling, and the

weight of the projectile gave excellent results as regards accuracy, trajectory, pe-

netration, and rapidity of fire. In the breech-action the principle of the falling-

block for opening the breech when loading, which was a previous x\merican inven-

tion, was generally admitted to be the best that had been suggested, and so far the

ai-ni justified the decision of the committee; but the faults said to exist in it were

in the striking-spring, the mode of lifting the falling-block, the arrangement of the

trigger and locking-bolt, and the mode of attachment to the stock. All these were

said to be so defective in principle, that they could not answer when made in large

quantities, although a few rifles might be so made that no great fault should be

detected in a limited trial, while the arms were new ; and it was urged, conse-

quently, that to adopt such a rifle would not be a mechanical credit to the country.

Since the end of 1808 the committee has been endeavouring to perfect the arm, and

several different patterns of it have been made at Enfield ; but it still retains its in-

herent defects and objectionable features. In the Westley- Richards rifle, however,

while all the approved points of the Martini-Henry rifle were retained, these defects

in the lock mechanism had been removed by a very ingenious and simple applica-

tion of the ordinary principles of construction of a gun-lock that have been con-

firmed by the long experience of previous arms. The barrel of both being satis-

factory, the question was as to the lock ; and the author considered that it was very

desirable that further investigation should be made before the Government finally

adopted auj' rifle for our army. In the ISIartini-IIenry the most important defect

was, that the falling-block was lifted bj' a lever acting near the centre of motion,

which was mechanically objectionable, whereas in the Westloy-Richards the

falling-block was lifted by a longer lever acting at the extremity' of the block,

at the greatest distance from the centre of motion. In the Westley-Iiichards

the stiilter for firing the cartridge was actuated by a long flat spring, and had

li inch length of stroke, giving a sharp blow on tlie rear of the cartridge ; but

in the Martiui-IIenry a short stiff spiral spring was employed, giving only

3| inch length of stroke to tlie striker, which was objectionable mechanically,

and not so certain in firing, nor so durable as the other arrangement. The above

views of the respective merits of the two rifles were confirmed by some of our

most eminent mechanical engineers, Messrs. Hick, Ponn, Barlow, and Greenwood.

Having stated these facts, the author went on to argue that, as the two kinds of

rifle appeared to admit of equally safe and expeditious handling, and to be of equal

shooting-power, the question between them resolved itself into one of mechanical

construction. The military members of the committee had done their work well
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the distinctive military requirements were satisfied by either weapon, and accuracy

of shooting had probably reached its limit, as the results of the prize-shooting had

not improved in the recent jear's competitions. What was wanted was a fresh

and independent committee, containing some experienced mechanical engineers, for

the purpose of determining points of mechanism on\j. There was, however, an-

oth(!r question of almost equal importance, and that was the ammunition. The

first pattern of Boxer cartridge recommended by the committee had been with-

drawn, and another, that was as defective, had been substituted for it. This had

a case larger than was required to contain the proper charge, and consequently re-

quired an imuecessary enlargement of the breech-cliamber ; and tlie common solid
brass cartridge-case now in general nse in America and other countries would in
many respects be preferable to it, especially because it can be readily obtained in

large quantities, because its adoption would leave the chamber of the rifie of a

minimum size, capable of being made larger if need should ever aiise, and because

the case was not destroyed in firing, and can be filled over and over again, and its
use would thus be a source of great pecuniary saving to volunteers in their practice.

                  On BoUer-Exj)losions. By E. B. Maetek, C.E.

   At the Exeter Meeting it was suggested, in a report of a select committee, that
inquests on boiler-explosions should be improved by making it compulsory that

coroners should have scientific witnesses to assist the juries to aScertain the causes

of explosions. From considerable experience in such investigations, the writer
concluded that much more good would result from publishing independent reports
to the Government by competent engineers, without interference with the ancient
and useful coroner's inquest ; and that the public would benefit more by the reports
themselves than by the verdicts founded on them b}^ juries, who, although well

able to decide whether any one was criminally liable for a death, would be quite
incompetent to discriminate between conflicting scientific opinion as to the causes

of boiler-explosions.

                On the Construction of Seiuers in Running Sand.
               Bij Messrs. Eeade and GoomsoK, C.E., Liverpool.

The authors related their experience in the construction of sewers at various

places lying on the coast between Liverpool and Southport, a district mostly con-

sisting of sand from 10 to 20 feet deep, thoroughly permeated with water and rest-

ing on a bed of moss and marl. In some places in the driest seasons the water-

level is only a few feet below the surface. The difficulty of laying the inverts of

the sewer true is innnensely increased by the low gradients demanded by the

general flatness of the coimtry. They generally use fireclay pipe-sewers, from

motives of economy and other reasons ; and the jointing of these is very difficult in
reaming sand, in consequence of the cement, even when covered with a clay lute,

getting washed into the sewers before it has time to set. To overcome these

difficulties they have introduced a subsoil-drain and pipe-rest (manufactured by

Messrs. Brooke and Sons of Huddersfield) of tlie form of the letter ca, which is

laid first in the bottom of the trench and jointed with clay like an ordinary pipe-

sewer. This has the efiect of lowering the subsoil-water, so that the sewer proper

can be laid upon the moveable saddles or rests (fitting the curvature of the drains

and the sewers) undistm'bed by water or reaming sand. By these means the

cement joints can be made perfect all round, and ha^'e time to set before the trench

is filled up.  True  gradients are  insured,  as the  pipes can  be leisurely laid                                                                           and as
                                                                                                                                                          ;

the pipes are jointed over the middle of the subdrain a continuous foundation is

Asecured.      more perfect drainage of the subsoil is also found to result, the gene-

ral level of the water being reduced to nearly the level of the invert of the sewer.

They have begim to use the subsoil-drains in the sewerage works they are carrying

out at Birkdale, which includes a length of 10,000 yards of pipe-sewers. Methods

for flushing the sewers with the subsoil-water were also described, and all the ap-

paratus used by the authors in similar sanitary works.

          On an OUiqiie Proj^elhr. By Professor Osborne Reynolds.

   Paddles for propelling ocean-steamers have been displaced by the screw ; the
gi'eat advantage of which is that it does not interfere with the saihng-qualities of

the ship to the same extent as paddles do. It has, however, many disadvantages,

as is shoAvn by the frequent accidents which hai^pen to screw-steamers. These are
all due to its position at the end of the boat. Thus, it interferes with the action of
the rudder, it makes the ship vibrate, it will not act when the ship is pitching.

           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                 223

and tlie long' shaft is a soiu-co of endless trouljle. It is with the hope to obviate
these evils that the new propeller is proposed. This propeller is, in fact, an attempt
to transfer the action of the screw to the middle of the ship. Prior attempts have
been made to do this and have failed, not on their intrinsic merits, but inciden-
tally through weakening the ship or requiring special and peculiar forms of ships.

   Whatever demerits the proposed propeller may have, it must necessarily have

the following merits :

   1. It is in the middle of the ship, and its action is not affected by pitching.
   2. Its action cannot be affected by the rolling of the ship.

    3. It will not interfere with the action of the rudder.
   4. It will not interfere with the sailing-qualities of the ship.
    5. It can be applied to ships of any form of section.

   G. Its immersion will not be much altered by the lading of the ship.

    7. For sailing, the propeller or the blades can be easily removed.
    8. If applied to rams, they could strike with either end.
   The experiments which have been made with tlie model, which is 5 feet long,
have been very successful. It vv-ill steam at about two miles an hour, and it appears
to go quite as well in rough Vv'ater as it does in smooth. It goes quite straight

--without any rudder, and does not heel over from the effect of the propeller.
    Description of the Propeller. The plates which act on the water are fastened
obliquely on to a flat endless chain, which is made so that it cannot be twisted. This
chain passes round the middle of the ship, or it may pass across under the deck
and then through the sides and down outside, and so mider the bottom. In this
way the chain wUl uuder-gird the ship in her middle, and the blades will act on all
the water which comes within their length of the bottom or sides amidship. The
 draft of the ship will be increased by the length of the blades, which will be about
 one-seventh the entire draft. The chain is kept in its position by drums, which
 project a short distance beyond the skia of the ship. These drums must be so
 incased as to keep the water from getting into the ship. The chain is connected
 with the engines by means of one of these di'ums. Flanges on the di'ums prevent
 the chain working off them. In order to ascertain as far as possible the compara-
 tive merits of this propeller and the screw, one was designed for a large ship, the
 drawings of which are given in Scott Eussell's ' Naval Architecture,' the size of all
 the parts being very carefidly calculated, and then it was compared with the screw.
 The residts of the comparison are given in the adjoining Table.

     On Ocean Tehgraph)j. By Captain Rowett.

       On ihe Ash-pit Si/stem of Manchester. By Alderman R. RrjrxEY.

   What is the best method of dealing with the excromentitious matters of large

towns is a question of difficult solution. It has been discussed annually at the
British Association, not sm-ely without beneht, but certainly without arriving at

any general agi-eement.

   As a contribution towards a solution of this question, a brief description of the
method adopted in Manchester may not be without interest, and may serve either

as an example or warning to other large towns similarly situated. When attention

was first directed to the sanitary condition of towns, Manchester had scarcely any
water-closets, but to every large house, and in every street, serving one family or
many, were privies and open ash-pits of large dimensions situated at the back of
the house, the privy-door opening into a yard very near the back door of the house,
an ash-pit opening'immediately behind, with a door opening into a passage forming
the boundary between the streets or rows of houses, and through which door the
refuse or contents of the ash-pit were from time to time emptied. These ash-pit.s
received the rainfall and all the refuse of the house. The gases eliminated from
the decomposing materials passed ofi" at a low altitude, and might enter the yard
or upper rooms of the house without difficulty.

   The authorities of Manchester have at all times objected to the general use of

water-closets in cottage-dwellings. In the first place, because they believed that
in the limited space available in houses occupied by the working classes they would
prove a greater nuisance than the privy and ash-pit outside ; secondly, because of
the loss of valuable manure which would be occasioned ; and thirdly, because,

looking at the rapid increase of population in the district and the limited area of

the watershed, the time would come when all the water available would be re-

quired for domestic and manufacturing purposes, and could not be wasted in water-
closets. Adhering, then, to the dry in oppo.sitiou to the wet system, the corpora-

tion has for some time been engaged in the attempt to improve the existing

privies and ash-pits, and to discover the best form to oe adopted in all new pro-

Under the superintendence of this committee. At the same time the Artisans'

Dwellings Act came into operation, and the provisions of this Act, with powers

possessed by local Acts, hare furnished the committee with the necessary autho-

rity for altering the old ash-pit and enforcing the construction of new ones ac-

cording to the plans which have been adopted. In the construction of ash-pits the

object of the committee was to prevent as far as possible the decomposition of

the excreta, and consequent generation of gases passing oft" into the surrounding

atmosphere ; and as decomposition is accelerated by moisture, they determined

that all ash-pits should be made dry, excluding the rainfall by covering them over,
and the dramage from the yard by requii-ing the floor and walls to be made

water-tight                                                         they required also  that the ashes from the pit shoidd be placed daily
                                                                 ;

in the ash-pit for the purpose of condensing, as far as possible, the ammoniacal

and other gases, and preventing organic matter impregnating the air in the im-

mediate vicinity. In addition to these arrangements it was foreseen that in summer
time, when decomposition is most vigorous and the supply of neutralizing ashes

most scanty, a closed ash-pit might become a greater nuisance than an open one;

and a ventilating-shaft or chimney was determined upon, to be carried from

the top of the ash-pit up to the side of, and a little above, the eaves of the

house for the purpose of canying oft" all the gases and light vapours and allow-
ing them to mix with the surrounding atmosphere at an elevation which would

not injuriously aftect the inmates of the dwelling.

 --In attempting these improvements the committee met with considerable im-

pediments the covered ash-pit and flue had a hard straggle for existence ; the

council was sceptical, especially on the efficacy of the flue. It was to little pur-
pose to assure the members that as the emanations from the ash-pit would, from

the warm ashes of the kitchen and the faical matter, be of a higher tempera-

ture than the sm-rounding air, they must necessarily ascend and pass oft" at the

highest point of egress, and, if there was no opening but the flue, then up the flue.

AThe replj' was, they might not do so.                                                  flue had been connected with a covered

ash-pit for a considerable time, and was found to be most effective ; and it was

urged that all other flues under similar circumstances would also be efficient, just

as surely as heated air ascending one chimney would ascend all chimneys. The

evidence was not deemed sufficient. The committee was authorized and "required

to have a number erected, and meanwhile the enforcement of the regulation was

suspended. "When at length the council, satisfied by the evidence adduced, autho-

rized the committee to proceed, another obstacle presented itself The property

owners (that is, the owners of cottage property), having chiefly formed themselves

into an association, rose in arms against the change ; they declared that the cost of

making the alteration would be £8 to £10, and that the rents must be advanced 1.?,

per week to carry out this new plan of the committee. They declared that, in the

opinion of practical and scientific men, the ventilating-flue would be perfectly use-

less, that the noxious gases would not escape through the flue, but would overflow

into the back yard, producing greater evils than any it was intended to remedy
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and in a report of the executive committee of the "Associated Property Owners'

Association," issued in December last, it is declared that, after nearly twelve months'

experience and from consultations with gentlemen well able to form an opinion,

they are more than ever convinced of its uselessness ; and they promise at an early

date to have the opinion of scientific men put in an official form iu the nature of a

report, which would be submitted to the health committee. "What the opinion of

these scientific men, upon which the property owners rest their case, may be can-

not be ascertained, as no report has ever been presented ; but it is worthj^ of re -

mark, as illustrating the complexity of our legal procedure, that with all the powers

possessed by the corporation in its many local Acts, and the stringent clauses of the

Artisans' Dwellings Act, some of these property owners have succeeded iu delay-

ing the reconstruction of privies and ash-pits in connexion with dwellings de-

clared by the officer of health to be unfit for human habitation for a period of

nearly twelve months. Notwithstanding these obstructions, the committee has

continued its operations. Every new house erected in the city is required to pro-

vide a water-tight covered ash-pit with ventilating-flue ; and, taking the worst of

the old ones, just about 270 have been recDustructed on the new plan, or as near

1870.                                                                                              15

it as practicable. The results have been most satisfactory. I quote from a report

--of the health committee, giving to the council the result of an inspection of a num-

ber erected as a trial by the committee : ''It was found that the yards at the back

of the houses, and the privies themselves, were entirely free from any offensive

odom-s."

   Th^ contents of the ash-pits were dry ; the surfaces of the yards were clean.
When the hand was placed in the opening of the seat a cm-rent of air was percep-

tible ; when a piece of brown paper was lighted and then blown out, so as to pro-

duce considerable smoke, and the paper then held over the grid in the wall of the

privy, the smoke was strongly drawn down into the ash-pit ; the same when ap-
plied to the seat of the privy. No smoke escaped at the opening of the seat, but

all passed up the flue and mixed with the atmosphere above the roof of the house.

The information from the occupants of the houses was most interesting. Some of

them stated that whereas before the alterations were made they neA^er opened

the windows of the back bedroom in consequence of the stench that came into the

room from the privies and ash-pits below, they now opened them daily, and got

the rooms ventilated, and that, although foiiuerly they were scarcely conscious of

the disagreeable stench from their neighbours' premises, now their own were cleaner

these faecal smells affected them. The officer of health in his report, and as the
result of careful inquiries, states that where the new form of ash-pit has been

adopted, whether in old or new houses, there was not last summer a single case of

diarrhoea or fever in the families of any of the occupants, although the former

disease prevailed to a considerable extent in neighbouring families ; the testimony

of many house-owners is to the same effect. It is found that in new dwellings the

cost of the new privy amd ash-pit is less than the old one ; while in the recon-
struction in old property it is much less than, in their fears, they had anticipated.

In the appendix to the report of the medical officer of the Privy Council just

-- Weprinted. Dr. Buchanan and Mr. Eadcliffe made the following remarks on the
Manchester system : "  inspected a midden-closet an-anged on this plan in

a' position where the advantage of careful superintendence was secured for it,

--built according to the requirements of the corporation roofed, drained, and'

ventilated by a shaft canied up above the eaves of the adjoining building. The

closet or privy used by a single family onlj' opens into a small yard, 8 ft. 2 in.

across at tne widest part, and faces the living room of the cottage occupied by the

family. A mine catch-pan was fixed beneath the privy-seat ; the midden was two-

thirds full of ashes and refuse, the latter cast in beneath the hinged seat, and no

excrement was exposed to sight. As it contained fifteen months' accumulation of

excrement, ashes, and house-refuse, its condition might not unfairly be regai'ded as

similar to that of a closet emptied more frequently, but used by several fiimilies.

There was no smell of excrement, nor, indeed, any marked odour about the privy,

though on the same day (during a frost) in unimproved privies about the town there

Awas notable stink.  current of air, as we determined by experiment, passed down

through the aperture of the seat and upwards through the ventilating-shaft. The

occupants of the house averred that no foul smell was at any time experienced by
them from the closet. The removal of the contents of the ash-pits has been

managed by the corporation since 184-5. There are about .38,000 ash-pits of all

sizes in the city, some large ones requiring to be emptied only once or twice a

year ; on an average, the contents will not be removed oftener than from two to

three times in the course of a year. In the newly constructed ones, the size being

so much reduced, the contents require to be removed more frequently ; but the

health-committee, regarding the matter in a sanitary point of view, not in an eco-

nomical one, consider even the size of the new ones too large, and are gi-aduaUy

aiming at a size that will necessitate the removal of the contents every two or three

weeks ; but it is difficult to effect great changes all at once. jNIany people object

to the emptying of the ash-pits fi-equently, or until they are filled with ashes, ex-

crement, and refuse, and frequent removal can only be eftected by limiting the

space in which this refuse matter is contained. The ultimate aim, then, of the

health-committee is to provide for every cottage a privy and small ash-pit, not

sunk deep in the ground and perfectly water-tight, excluding the water from the yard

--and slops from the house, and covered over to exclude the rainfall excluding alsoj

if possible, all refuse matter except the smdl ashes from the fire, and securing that

these ashes shall be placed upon the excrement daily. In every case the ash-pit is

Elaced as far from the entrance-door of the house as possible ; and as in all new

  ouses a yard-space of considerable size is required, generally the privy and ash-pit

Avill not join up to the walls of the house, and in every case where it does so a

strong flag is placed between the wall and the privy ; and as the floor is sunk be-

neath the level of the floor of the dwelling, percolation wiU be entirely prevented.

In addition, a ventilating-shaft must be carried up to the eaves of the house, the

horizontal portion of which may form the coping of the separating wall between

the two houses, and the area of this shaft must not be less than eighty-one square

--Pneumatic Disjmkli. On Pneumatic Transmission tlirough Tunnels andPipes*.

                                   By Egbert Sabine.

The author, after giving the residt of investigations into the motions of bodies

through tubes for this purpose, and the formulas which he had arrived at, said that

these would show that small pneumatic tubes could be worked more advantage-

ously than large ones. The great convenience of and practical facilities for work-

ing small letter-carrying tubes have been amply proved by the extensive systems

already laid down, in Paris, Berlin, London, and in other towns, as adjuncts to

the telegTaph services. Tubes of somewhat larger diameter, such as those pro-

posed some years ago "by Mr. A. E. Cowper for the more speedy distribution of

metropolitan letters to the branch post-ofiices, would undoubtedly work satisfac-

torily. Even still larger tubes, if of moderate lengths, might also be found useful

for a variety of special applications ; for instance, in the transport of light materials

between the different parts of a factory supplied with steam-power. lie did not

believe that a pneumatic line working through a long tunnel could, for passenger-

Atraffic, ever compete in point of economy with locomotive railways.                                                                                                                                                                                  pneumatic

railway is essentially a rope railway. Its rope is elastic, it is true, but it is not

light. Every yard run of it, in a tunnel large enough to carry passengers, would

weigh more than J cwt. And a rope, too, which has to be moved against con-

siderable friction, in being compressed and moved wastes power by its liberation

of heat._ In a pneumatic tunnel, such as that proposed between England and

France, in_ order to move a goods-train of 250 tons through at the rate of 25 miles

an hour, it would be necessary to employ simultaneously a pressure of 1^ lb. per

square inch at one end, and a vacuum of I a lb. per square inch at the other. The

mechanical effect obtained with these combined (pressure and vacuum) would be

consumed as foUows :

from an engineering point of view, that the merits and demerits of pneumatic par-

cels-lines and poemnatic passenger-lines, which have been repeatedly suggested

during the past half century, should be thoroughly investigated. The works of

                                                           By James N. Shoolbeed, C.E.

Liverpool at present contains about 520,000 inhabitants, and the subui-ban dis-

tricts round it about 80,000 more ; in all 600,000.

Of these by far the greatest number reside on a strip of land of no great breadth,

lunning along the river Mersey and its estuary, and sloping gently down to them.

The close proximity of this rapid tidal stream, as well as the great facility af-

forded by it for the ready disposal of sewage and other refuse, will account for the

pi'edilection already shown for the water-closet over the privy system ; and which
predilection is annually becoming still more manifest. There are at present about

40,000 water-closets against 30,000 privies in the district.

The borough of Liverpool has expended about £900,000 in drainage and sewer-

age works. Of this, £300,000 may be set down as necessary for the conveyance of

the contents of the water-closets. If this sum is capitalized, and a large allowance

made for deterioration, then an annual amount of £60,000, or about 2s. M. per head

of the population, may be taken as the cost of getting rid of the wet sewage of the

town.

The midden, or dry sewage, together with the contents of the ash-pits attached

to the houses having water-closets, amounts within the borough to about 140,000

tons in the year. 'J'his is removed by rail and by canal, and disposed of at a cost of

about £21,000, while the amount realized by the sale of the refuse is only £8000
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

thus causing an annual loss to Liverjjool of £13,000, or about ijd. per head of the

population, in order to dispose of its dry sewage.

Several propositions have from time to time been made, especially since 1806, to

iitilize the wet sewage of the town by irrigation over some light soil about 10 miles

distant to the northward, and near to the sea-coast; the land is of very considerable

extent, and fiivourably situated for the purpose.

However, nothing as yet, beyond a trial experiment, so far successful, has been

effected, and tliat upon a very small scale. Further steps with the same object,

but in a different suburban district, are, it is understood, about to be taken.

The ready market wliich Liverpool in itself affords for the sale of the vegetable

proceeds of this irrigation, and consequently for its success, is a further stimulus

to reduce by this means the present annual cost to Liverpool in getting rid of its

sewage and refuse.

Liverpool may, however, be said even now to be much favoured by nature in this

matter                                    inasmuch as  the burden falls much more lightly upon                                                                                 it  than upon many
                                       ;

other large towns, which have enforced against them by the arm of the law the

unpleasant consequences this question may sometimes bring with it.

Bescnjption of the Hydraulic Bucletting -engine for the Ilerculaneuni

       Gi'aving-docl; Liverpool. By Percy Westmacott, C.E,

   The application of hj'draulic power to gates and capstans &c. having already been
decided upon for these docks, it was considered expedient to contrive the emptying of
the graving-docks in conjunction with this same system, and thus save the erection
of another steam-engine and plant for this special service, and at the same time secure
a ready means of applying power at all times, especially to severe leaks. Some ar-
rangement, too, was required that would overcome the inconveniences experienced
in dealing with water charged with rubbish from graving-docks. The result was tho
construction of a machine upon a principle of buckettiug large quantities of water

--at a time devoid of clack-valves, gi-atings, or other parts liable to choking or in-

juiy by floating matter, and that could be lifted clean out of the water to give free

access to all parts when required. By this principle the same weight of water is

discharged at each stroke, and thus no undue loss arises from the application of a

constant hydraulic pressure ; nor does the strain upon the parts or the conditions in
Aworking varj^ with the fall of water in tlie dock.
                                                     scooped-shaped bucket at-

tached to a piston-rod is plunged at an angle of slight resistance into the water, and

by a self-acting arrangement is turned round at the 'proper level, filled, raised, and

discharged over an apron. The bucket holds 14^ tons ot water. Two discharging-

levels are provided.

   It will be seen that when the bucket is up all essential working parts are out

of the water, and therefore quite free of access.

   The minimum lift at the high-level discharge is 7 ft., and the maximtim 23 ft.

The usual average speed of the bucket in plunging or lifting is about 3 ft. per

second.

 --The coefficient of effect obtained by this engine is as follows : At 7 ft. (mini-

mum) lift -4 ; at 23 ft. (maxinnmi) lift '6 ; average -54. Tlie loss occasioned by

the choking of passages and gagging of valves or paddles is altogether avoided by

this system, which, for this reason, is peculiarly Avell adapted for sewerage purposes.

                      On the Ver/etahle Products of Central Africa.

                 By Lieiit.-Colonel J. A. Geant, C.B., F.L.S.

   The country embraced in the remarks made by the author comprises that tra-
versed by the late Captain Speke in his journey to the sources of the Nile, 18C0-()3.
The plants collected were made over to the Royal Herbarium, Kew, and were
classified there by Dr. T. Thomson. They are to be described in the 'African
Flora ' by Professors Oliver, Lawson, ^Masters, and others. Notes and drawings
of the majority of tho specimens were made on the spot, and from these notes the

author had compiled this paper. He described, in the first place, the forests of

the low lands, which consist of trees which are commercially of small importance.
The species are numerous, and for nearly all of them tlie natives seem to hti\o
names. The author then described at considerable leugtli the uses made by the
natives of the roots, bark, leaves, fruits, seeds, and grains of numerous trees, shrubs,
and plants as medicines, foods, houseliold utensils, fishing-implements, and tho

like.

LIST OF WORKS NOW READY.

THE WORKS OF ALEXANDER POPE.

A NEW EDITION, COLLECTED IN PART BY THE LATE

    EIGHT HON. J. W. CROKER.

            WITH INTRODUCTIONS AND NOTES.

   By REV. WHITWELL ELWIN.

With Portraits. Vols. I. to III. 8vo. 10s. 6d. each.

" There is not, we think, a poet in the language whose works are so difficult to edit as the

works of Pope. They demand such a profound knowledge of the times, and of the man,

they contain so many enigmas, they exact so much critical sagacity, they so often lead one off

the main thoroughfares into by-paths and intricate labyrinths, out of which it is hard to find

the way, that the editor who can do justice to them must be blessed with consummate patience,

and endowed with no ordinary qualifications. It would be premature perhaps to judge

decisively of Mr. Elwin's editorial capacity from a single volume of an extensive publication
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

but since in this preliminary volume the mystery of the correspondence, which is by far the

most difficult of all the Pope mysteries, is elaborately discussed, and, to our thinking, satis-

factorily explained, we are justified in anticipating that the work as it progresses will fulfil

the promise of its opening pages  The best notes of former editors are retained, and

Mr. Elwiu adds his own, which strike us as lucid and judicious." Athencetwi.

     " One of the most valuable contributions to English literary history which has ever
appeared, and we predict a wide circulation and an extensive popularity for it. The materials
were collected in the first instance by the late Mr. Croker, whose habit it was to write out his

notes in full as he prepared them, and the present editor has thus at his disposal a rich mine

of most valuable information. He has also had access to Lord Oxford's papers, preserved at
Longleat, which throw much light on Pope's character and conduct. The Caryll papers now

presented to the British Museum, have also been most useful ; and the services wbich the late
Mr. Dilke has rendered to the editor, not only in reference to these papers, which he had so
carefully annotated, but also by the advice and assistance which he has privately afforded, are
gratefully acknowledged. From these and other sources have accumulated a mass of un-
published letters more numerous than those collected by Warburton, Wai'ton, Bowles, and

lioscoe combined." John Bull.

   We" congratulate the admirers of Pope on the appearance of this first volume of a new

edition of his works, which will do justice to the poet and credit to English scholarship

We cannot follow Mr. Elwin in his judicious exposure of the errors and defects of his pre-

decessors. It was doubtless the recognition of these that prompted Mr. Croker to undertake

the task of purging the dross from the existing commentaries and to employ his extraordinary

power of penetrating the mysteries of our personal, political, and social history to the

elucidation of the many obscure allusions scattered thi'ough the poet's writings, and the result

was a vast accumulation of curious materials." Notes und Querus.

A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD WITH THE

                   ORLEANIST PRINCES.

    TOUCHING AT AUSTRALIA, JAVA, SIAM, CANTON, &c.

         By the marquis DE BEAUYOIR.

Translated from the French under the superintendence of the Author.

                                                                                                      2 Vols. Post 8vo. 18s.

" This voj'age round the world is almost a model book of travels for the million : not

foultless certainly either in style or matter, but singularly free from the faults that are apt to

irritate or mislead. The book is light and Lively. The traveller touches in his flight on just

those salient points where most men care to settle. He docs not commit the folly of assuming

that we have all of us marked and inwardly digested the numerous books of travel we may

have read before                                                                   yet he  does  not  dwell  at wearisome  length  on  subjects  he  may reasonably
                                                                                ;

presume to be hackneyed. He has a Frenchman's grace of style, a Frenchman's eye for

sc^enic effect, and perhaps a Frenchman's weakness for dramatic exaggeration.

   "We trust we have said enough to send our readers to one of the mostJ liveely books of travel

it has ever been our fortune to meet with."--Pa/; Moll Oazctlc.

                                                                                                                                                                     i

LIFE IN THE LIGHT OF GOD'S WORD,
 By the lord ARCHBISHOP OF YORK.

                New and enlarged Edition. Post 8vo. 5s.

                                                                                           SOME ACCOUNT OF THE                                                       4

MUTINEERS of the BOUNTY, & THEIR DESCENDANTS;

        IN PITCAIRN AND NORFOLK ISLANDS, DOWN TO 1870.

                      By lady BELCHER.

                                    With Illustrations. Post 8vo. 12s.

       The tale of the mutiny of the Bounty has been told in various forms, and yet, old as it

          I'

is, it gains in interest the more frequently it is repeated and the better its details become
kno^\ni. Taken as a whole, there is probably no chain of occurrences in history more replete
with romance. . . . Lady Belcher possesses pecuUar advantages for her task, as the step-

daughter of the late Capt. Heywood, one of the midshipmen in the Bounty. Hence many

details have come to her knowledge from personal sources and from family manuscripts, and in
particular the very important Diaiy of James Morrison, a petty ofliccr of the Bounty. The
work contains also the history of the descendants of the mutineers during the later years of
their residence in Pitcau-n Island, and since their removal to Norfolk Island, do\vn to the
present year." Athenaum.

                   A RIDE THROUGH THE

     DISTURBED DISTRICTS OF NEW ZEALAND

                 AT THE TIME OF THE REBELLION;

   WITH NOTES OF A CRUISE AMONG THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS.

                                    FROM THE JOURNALS OF THE LATE

              HON. HERBERT MEADE, Lt. R.N.

                                        EDITED BY HIS BROTHER.

                         With Maps and Illustrations. Medium 8vo. 14s.

     " The modest title chosen by the editor scarcely describes the work. Lieut. Meade was
riding through one of the loveliest countries of the earth, one scarcely known to white men
he was beholdiug such strange and incredible developments and outburstings of volcanic action
as are nowhere else to be beheld ; he was living with a brave, honest race of savages, intelli-
gent and clever beyond all others ; and what he saw and heard he tells in simple, hearty
fashion. Tlie most striking part of his book treats of the great ffcj/sers, or boiling fountains,
which abound in the lake district of the southern island. Never were such lovely scenes
imagined by fairy-tale teller as he saw. Fountains of boiling water, blue, and emerald-green,
and scarlet, and brightest yellow, throwing up their volume of spray a hundred feet into the
air, and poui-ing their surplus waters over giant terraces regularly posed one above another, as
if in scorn of man's feebler work." Observer.

I have endeavoured to abridge the work, so as to place it within the i-each of many to whom it

     " Mrs. Bray has given in this little volume, a very full and interesting account of the civil

war in the Ccvennes, popularly known as the Camisard revolt. The book is agreeably written.
The revolt of the Cevennes, tliough unimportant in its efl'ects on the general course of histoi-j-,
has a dramatic unity which gives it an interest of its own. It is a singularly representative

By PHILIP SMITH, B.A.,

    Author of the " History of the World."

"With Woodcuts. Post 8vo. 7s. 6d.

    " The work is based on an independent study of the ancient writers, and a careful use of

the best modem authorities. The object has not been to draw up a mere skeleton or epitome,

but a narrative full and circumstantial enough to possess life and interest, and to leave that

impression on the memory which mere outlines can never pi'oduce. In fine, an earnest effort

has been made to produce a mannal, both for the student and the general reader, of the present

state of om' knowledge on a subject the interest of which is daily growing, its bounds enlarging,

and its details becoming more definite and certain by the progress of inquiry." Preface.

     " It was a happy thought on the part of the author to remodel his great work, aud eliminat-
ing the mere historical portion to reproduce the Biographies of the Judges, abridged iu a few
eases, and with all necessary corrections, and instead of the chi'onologieal aiTangement, that
somewhat interferes with felicity of reference, throwing them into alphabetical order and
printing them in one volume of convenient size as a ' Biographical Dictionary of the Judges of
England.' Our readers will probably be surpinsed to find that these Lives are sixteen hundred
in number, so that the work is one calculated not only to give completeness to every legal

--library, but to form a necessari/ supplement to all our other Biogeaphical Dictionaries."

     " The reader who is not already familiar with these channing ballads should make their
acquaintance in the present fonii. They arc full of that blended romance of the East and
of the West which forms the special attraction of old Spanish history, literature, and legend.

With an Explanatory and Critical Commentary and a Revision of the

                                                         Translation,

Vol. I.--THE PENTATEUCH (in Two Parts), Medium 8vo. 30s.

THE want of a plain Explanatory Gommentarij on the Bible more com-
        plete and accurate than any now accessible to English readers has been long felt
by men of education. In 1863 the Speaker of the House of Commons consulted some of
the Bishops as to the best way of supplying the deficiency ; and the Archbishop of York

undertook to organise a plan for producing such a work, by the co-operation of several

Scholars selected for their Biblical learning.

   The great object of such a Commentary must be to put the general reader in full
possession of whatever information may be requisite to enable him to understand the

Holy Scriptures, to give him, as far as possible, the same advantages as the Scholar,
and to sup]ily him with satisfactory answers to objections resting upon misrepresenta-

tion of the Text.

Special care is taken to furnish in all cases amended translations of passages proved to

be incorrect  in  our Version                                                       but  the  Comment will  be  chiefly explanatory,  presenting,
                                                                                 ;

in a concise and readable form, the results of learned investigations, carried on in this

and other countries during the last half century.

   --" Professor Rawlinson has now completed his great literary task, It will take its place as

a standard work iu English literature indeed, in the historical literature of Europe, as well as
of that new Europe which is springing into gigantic life, on the other side of the Atlantic. It
is the most thorough work in ancient history that has ever been given to the world. Owing to
the remote antiquity of the empires of which it treats, the number of works bearing on the
subject are few in number, considering the long period in the world's history (nearly 2000
years) which it embraces; but never yet have the materials of history been so patiently
studied and so carefully used. Every page of Professor Rawlinson's work bristles with

--authorities, every statement--even those relating to matters of minor detail is supported by a

reference to the work or works upon which it is founded." British Quarterly Review.
