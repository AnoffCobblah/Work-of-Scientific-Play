     From the time of their nomination they constitute Organizing Com-
mittees for the purpose of obtaining information upon the Memoirs and

Reports likely to be submitted to the Sections,* and of preparing Reports
thereon, and on the order in which it is desirable that they should be
read, to be presented to the Committees of the Sections at their first

meeting.

    An Organizing Committee may also hold such preliminary meetings as

the President of the Committee thinks expedient, but shall, under any
circumstances, meet on the first Wednesday of the Annual Meeting, at
11 a.m., to settle the terms of their Report, after which their functions as

an Organizing Committee shall cease.

                     Constitution of the Sectional Committees.]

    On the first day of the Annual Meeting, the President, Vice-Presi-

dents, and Secretaries of each Section having been appointed by the
General Committee, these Officers, and those previous Presidents and

Vice-Presidents of the Section who may desire to attend, are to meet, at

2 p.m. in their Committee Rooms, and enlarge the Sectional Committees
by selecting individuals from among the Members (not Associates) present

at the Meeting whose assistance they may particularly desire. The Sec-

tional Committees thus constituted shall have power to add to their

number from day to day.
     The List thus formed is to be entered daily in the Sectional Minute-

Book, and a copy forwarded without delay to the Printer, who is charged
with publishing the same before 8 a.m. on the next day, in the Journal of

the Sectional Proceedings.

              Business of the Sectional Committees.

     Committee Meetings are to be held on the Wednesday at 2 p.m., on the
following Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday, from 10 to

              Committees.

  --* Notice to Contributors of Memoirs. Authors are reminded that, under an

arrangement dating from 1871, the acceptance of Memoirs, and the days on which

they are to be read, are now as far as possible determined by Organizing Committees
for the several Sections before the beginning of the Meeting. It has therefore become

necessary, in order to give an opportunity to the Committees of doing justice to the

several Communications, that each Author should prepare an Abstract, of his Memoir,

of a length suitable for insertion in the published Transactions of the Association,

--and that he should send it, together with the original Memoir, by book-post, on or
before    -.             , addressed thus "General Secretaries, British Associa-

tion, 22 Albemarle Street, London, W. For Section     " If it should be incon-

venient to the Author that his paper should be read on any particular days, he is

requested to send information thereof to the Secretaries in a separate note.

     At the first meeting, one o£ the Secretaries will read the Minutes of

last year's proceedings, as recorded in the Minnte-Book, and the Synopsis
of Recommendations adopted at the last Meeting of tne Association and

printed in the last volume of the Transactions. He will next proceed to

read the Report of the Organizing Committee.* The list of Communi-
 cations to be read on Thursday shall be then arranged, and the general

distribution of business throughout the week shall be provisionally ap-
pointed, At the close of the Committee Meeting the Secretaries shall
forward to the Printer a List of the Papers appointed to be read. The
Printer is charged with publishing the same before 8 a.m. on Thursday in

the Journal.

     On the second day of the Annual Meeting, and the following days,

the Secretaries are to correct, on a copy of the Journal, the list of papers
which have been read on that day, to add to it a list of those appointed
to be read on the next day, and to send this copy of the Journal as early

in the day as possible to the Printer, who is charged with printing the

same before 8 a.m. next morning in the Journal. It is necessary that one
of the Secretaries of each Section should call at the Printing Office and
revise the proof each evening.

     Minutes of the proceedings of every Committee are to be entered daily
in the Minute- Book, which should be confirmed at the next meeting of
the Committee.

Lists of the Reports and Memoirs read in the Sections are to be entei-ed

in the Minute-Book daily, which, with all Memoirs and Copies or Abstracts

of Memoirs furnished by Authors, are to be forwarded, at the close of the Sec-

tional Meetings, to the Assistant Secretary.

     The Vice-Presidents and Secretaries of Sections become ex officio tem-
porary Members of the General Committee (vide p. xix), and will receive,
on application to the Treasurer in the Reception Room, Tickets entitling
them to attend its Meetings.

The Committees will take into consideration any suggestions which may

be offered by their Members for the advancement of Science. They are

specially requested to review the recommendations adopted at preceding

Meetings, as published in the volumes of the Association and the com-
munications made to the Sections at this Meeting, for the purposes of

selecting definite points of research to which individual or combined

exertion may be usefully directed, and branches of knowledge on the state
and progress of which Reports are wanted ; to name individuals or Com-

mittees for the  execution  of such  Reports  or researches                                                                and  to  state
                                                                                                                        ;

whether, and to what degree, these objects may be usefully advanced by

the appropriation of the funds of the Association, by application to
Government, Philosophical Institutions, or Local Authorities.

In case of appointment of Committees for special objects of Science,

it is expedient that all Members of the Committee should be named, and
one of them appointed to act as Secretary, for insuring attention to business.

     Committees have power to add to their number persons whose assist-
ance they may require.

     The recommendations adopted by the Committees of Sections are to
be registered in the Forms furnished to their Secretaries, and one Copy of

each is to be forwarded, without delay, to the Assistant Secretary for pre-

sentation to the Committee of Becommendations. Unless this be done, the

Recommendations cannot receive the sanction of the Association,

                Notices regarding Grants of Money.

    Committees and individuals, to whom grants of money have been

entrusted by the Association for the prosecution of particular researches

in science, are required to present to each following Meeting of the

Association  a  Report  of the  progress  which  has  been  made                              and  the
                                                                                           ;

Individual or the Member first named of a Committee to whom a money

grant has been made must (previously to the next Meeting of the Associa-

tion) forward to the General Secretaries or Treasurer a statement of the

sums which have been expended, and the balance which remains dispos-

able on each grant.

     Grants of money sanctioned at any one Meeting of the Association

expire a week before the opening of the ensuing Meeting ; nor is the
Treasurer authorized, after that date, to allow any claims on account of

such gra.nts, unless they be renewed in the original or a modified form by

the General Committee.

    No Committee shall raise money in the name or under the auspices of

the British Association without special permission from the General Com-
mittee to do so ; and no money so raised shall be expended except in

accordance with the rules of tbe Association.

     In each Committee, the Member first named is the only person entitled
to call on the Treasurer, Professor A. W. Williamson, University College,
London, W.C., for such portion of the sums granted as may from time to

time be required.

In grants of money to Committees, the Association does not contem-

plate the payment of personal expenses to the members.
     In all cases where additional grants of money are made for the con-

tinuation of Researches at the cost of tbe Association, the sum named is
deemed to include, as a part of the amount, whatever balance may remain

unpaid on the former grant for the same object.

All Instruments, Papers, Drawings, and other property of the Associa-

tion are to be deposited at the Office of the Association, 22 Albemarle

Street, Piccadilly, London, W., when not employed in carrying on scien-

tific inquiries for the Association.

    The Meeting Room of each Section is opened for conversation from

10 to 11 daily. The Section Rooms and approaches thereto can be used for

no notices, exhibitions, or other p>urposes than those of the Association.

    At 11 precisely tbe Chair will be taken, and the reading of communi-
cations, in the order previously made public, commenced. At 3 p.m. the

Sections will close.

     Sections may, by the desire of the Committees, divide themselves into
Departments, as often as the number and nature of the communications

delivered in may render such divisions desirable.

    A Report presented to the Association, and read to the Section which

originally called for it, may be read in another Section, at the request of

the Officers of that Section, with the consent of the Author.

--lvi REPORT 1878.

Report of the Council for the Year 1877-78, presented to the General
                 Committee at Dublin on Wednesday, August 14, 1878.

     The Council have received Reports during the past year from the
General Treasurer, and his account for the year will be laid before the
General Committee this day.

     The following Resolution was referred by the General Committee at
Plymouth to the Council for consideration, and for action, if it should seem

desirable, viz. :

" That the question of the appointment of a Committee, consisting of

Mr. P. J. Bramwell, Mr. J. F. Bateman, Mr. G. F. Deacon, Mr.

Rogers Field, Captain Douglas Galton, Mr. R. B. Grantham, Mr.

Baldwin Latham, Mr. C. W. Merrifield, and Mr. G. J. Symons,

for carrying on Observations on the'Rainfall of the British Isles, be

referred to the Council for consideration, and action, if it seem

desirable                                          and that  the  sum  of 150L                                      be  placed  at the  disposal  of the
                                                ;

Council for the purpose."

     The Council having considered the Resolution, and having placed
themselves in communication with Mr. Symons, decided that it would not
be desirable to appoint the proposed Committee, as, under the system or-
ganised by Mr. Symons, the grant which had been made in former years
by the Association could be discontinued without detriment to science.

     The General Committee adopted last year certain modifications of the
Rules of the Association, which bad for their object the exclusion of un-
scientific or other unsuitable papers and discussions from the sectional
proceedings of the Association : and the Council have, during the past year,

further considered this question.

     The Council are of opinion that the existing Rules of the Association,

with the additions hereto subjoined, will afford, if carried out in their in-
tegrity, a sufficient guarantee for the exclusion of unscientific and un-
suitable papers :

   --1. That the appointment of Sectional Presidents, Vice-Presidents,

          and Secretaries be made either a year in advance or at such early

     --period as the Council may find practicable:

       2. That no paper received after the commencement of the Meeting
          shall be read, unless recommended by the Committee of the Section,
          after it has been referred and reported upon.

At the Meeting of the Association held at Plymouth, invitations were

laid before the General Committee, for the year 1879, from Swansea and

from Nottingham.

The invitation from the Mayor and Town Council of Nottingham to

meet in that  town                                 in  1879  was  accepted                                          and it  was understood  that it
                                                                                                                 ;

would be preferable to defer the meeting at Swansea until 1880.
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                                          lvii

    In the course of the Autumn the Council received a communication
from the Town Council of Nottingham, to the effect that it would not be

convenient for them to receive the Association in 1879.

    The Mayor and Town Council of Sheffield have intimated to the

Council that they are desirous of receiving the Association in 1879; and

invitations from the Mayor and Town Council of Sheffield, and from the

Scientific Bodies in that town, will be laid before the General Committee
in due course.

     The invitation from Swansea for 1880, received last year, will be re-
newed on the present occasion ; and it will be in the recollection of the
General Committee that an invitation was received last year from York,

proposing that the fiftieth anniversary of the Association be held in that

city in 1881.

     In accordance with a recommendation made by the Committee of
Section D. at Plymouth, and adopted by the General Committee, the
"Rules for Zoological Nomenclature," drawn up in 1842 at the instance
of the Association, have been reprinted and published.

     The following men of science, who have attended meetings of the
Association, have been elected Corresponding Members :

Professor H. L. F. Helmholtz,      Dr. Lindeman, Bremen.

    Berlin.                        Professor Moissonet, Paris.

Dr. H. Kronecker, Berlin.
M. Akin Karoly, Pesth.

    The Council have nominated the Duke of Abercorn, K.G., and the

Earl of Enniskillen, F.R.S., as Vice-Presidents of the present Meeting
and they submit these nominations for confirmation by the General
Committee.

     The following are the names of the Members of Council for the past

year, who, in accordance with the regulations, are not eligible for re-elec-

tion this year, viz. :

Mr. De La Rue.                     Lord Houghton.

Professor Maxwell.                 Colonel Grant.
Professor H. J. S. Smith.

tinguished by an asterisk in the following list :-

lviii  --report 1878.

     The Council regret that pressing engagements compel Mr. Griffith to
withdraw finally from the position of Assistant-General Secretary after
the present meeting of the Association, and take this opportunity of ex-
pressing their high estimation of the value of the services which Mr.

Griffith has rendered to the Association during a period of sixteen years,
and of the serious loss which his retirement will occasion to the Council

and to the Association. Mr. Griffith remains an ex-officio Member of
Council, as a former general officer, so that the Council trust they may

still retain the benefit of his experience.
     In accordance with the Report of last year, the Council will propose to

the General Committee that the post of Assistant Secretary be filled by
the election of Mr. J. B. H. Gordon.

                     ADDRESS

                                                      OF

     WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE, Esq.,

M.A., D.C.L., LL.D., F.P.S., F.R.A.S., F.R.G.S.,

                            PRESIDENT.

On looking back at the long array of distinguished men who both in this

and in the sister countries have filled the chair of the British Association
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

on considering also the increased pains which have been bestowed upon,

and the increased importance attaching to, the Presidential Address ; it

may well happen when, as on this occasion, your choice has fallen upon

one outside the sphere of professional Science, that your nominee should

feel unusual diffidence in accepting the post. Two considerations have
however in my own case outweighed all reasons for hesitation : First, the

uniform kindness which I received at the hands of the Association

throughout the eight years during which I had the honour of holding

another office ; and, secondly, the conviction that the same goodwill
which was accorded to your Treasurer would be extended to your Presi-

dent.

    These considerations have led me to arrange my observations under

two heads, viz., I propose first to offer some remarks upon the purposes

and prospects of the Association with which, through your suffrages, I

have been so long and so agreeably connected ; and, secondly, to indulge
in a few reflexions, not indeed upon the details or technical progress, but
upon the external aspects and tendencies of the Science which on this

occasion I have the honour to represent. The former of these subjects is

perhaps trite ; but as an old man is allowed to become garrulous on his
own hobby, so an old officer may be pardoned for lingering about a
favourite theme. And although the latter may appear somewhat un-
promising, I have decided to make it one of the topics of my discourse,

from the consideration that the holder of this office will generally do
better by giving utterance to what has already become part of his

own thought, than by gathering matter outside of its habitual range for

the special occasion. For, as it seems to me, the interest (if any) of an

1878.  a
2 REPORT 1878.

address consists, not so much in the multitude of things therein brought

forward, as in the individuality of the mode in -which they are treated.

The British Association has already entered its fifth decade. It has

held its meetings, this the 48th, in twenty-eight different towns. In six

cities of note, viz., York, Bristol, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Plymouth, Man-
chester, and Belfast, its curve of progress may be said to have a node, or

point  through  which  it  has  twice  passed                                 in  the  five  Universities                     of
                                                                           ;

Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, Edinburgh, and Glasgow, and in the two

great commercial centres, Liverpool and Birmingham, it may similarly

be said to have a triple point, or one through which it has three times

passed. Of our forty-six Presidents more than half (twenty-six, in fact) have

passed away ; while the remainder hold important posts in Science, and in

the Public Service, or in other avocations not less honourable in themselves,

nor less useful to the commonwealth. And whether it be due to the salu-

brity of the climate or to the calm and dispassionate spirit in which Science

is pursued by its votaries here, I do not pretend to say ; but it is a fact

that the earliest of our ex- Presidents still living, himself one of the original

members of the Association, is a native of and resident in this country.
     At both of our former meetings held in Dublin, in 1835 and 1857

respectively, while greatly indebted to the liberal hospitality of the citi-

zens at large, we were, as we now are, under especial obligations to the

authorities of Trinity College for placing at our disposal buildings, not

only unusually spacious and convenient in themselves, but full of remini-

scences calculated to awake the scientific sympathies of all who may be

gathered in them. At both of those former Dublin meetings the vene-

rable name of Lloyd figured at our head ; and if long-established custom
had not seemed to preclude it, I could on many accounts have wished
that we had met for a third time under the same name. And although
other distinguished men, such as Dr. Robinson, Professors Stokes, Tyn-

dall, and Andrews, are similarly disqualified by having already passed the

Presidential chair, while others again, such as Sir W. R. Hamilton, Dr.

M'Cullagh,  and Professor Jukes,  are permanently lost                                 to our  ranks                          still
                                                                                                                           ;

we should not have had far to seek, had we looked for a President in this

fertile island itself. But as every one connected with the place of meet-

ing partakes of the character of host towards ourselves as guests, it has

been thought by our oldest and most experienced members that we

should better respond to an invitation by bringing with us a President to

speak as our representative than by seeking one on the spot ; and we

may always hope on subsequent occasions that some of our present hosts

may respond to a similar call.

       But leaving our past history, which will form a theme more appro-

priate to our jubilee meeting in 1881, at the ancient city of York, I will

ask your attention to a few particulars of our actual operations.

       Time was when the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh and

the Royal Irish Academy were the only representative bodies of
                                                                                            ADDRESS.                                                                                                             3

British Science and the only receptacles of memoirs relating thereto.

Bat latterly, the division of labour, so general in industrial life, has

operated in giving rise to special Societies, such as the Astronomical, the

Linnsean, the Chemical, the Geological, the Geographical, the Statistical,

the Mathematical, the Physical, and many others. To both the earlier, or

more general, and the later or more special societies alike, the British

WeAssociation shows resemblance and affinity.                                                         are general in our com-

prehensiveness                                                                     we are special in our sectional arrangement ;                                                                                 and in this
                                                                                ;

respect we offer not only a counterpart, but to some extent a counterpoise,

to the general tendency to sub -division in Science. Further still, while

maintaining in their integrity all the elements of a strictly scientific body,

we also include, in our character of a microcosm, and under our more

social aspect, a certain freedom of treatment, and interaction of our

various branches, which is scarcely possible among separate and inde-

pendent societies.

The general business of our meetings consists, first, in receiving and

discussing communications upon scientific subjects at the various sections

into which our body is divided, with discussions thereon ; secondly, in

distributing, under the advice of our Committee of Recommendations,

the funds arising from the subscriptions of members and associates and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

thirdly, in electing a Council upon whom devolves the conduct of our

affairs until the next meeting.

The communications to the sections are of two kinds, viz., papers

from individuals, and reports from Committees.

As to the subject-matter of the papers, nothing which falls within the

range of Natural Knowledge, as partitioned among our sections, can be

considered    foreign                                                              to  the  purposes  of the Association                                                                                    and  even many
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

applications of Science, when viewed in reference to their scientific basis,

may properly find a place in our proceedings. So numerous, however,

are the topics herein comprised, so easy the transition beyond these limits,

that it has been thought necessary to confine ourselves strictly within this

range, lest the introduction of other matters, however interesting to indivi-

dual members, should lead to the sacrifice of more important subjects. As to

the form of the communications, while it is quite true that every scientific

conclusion should be based upon substantial evidence, every theory com-

plete before being submitted for final adoption, it is not the less desirable

that even tentative conclusions and hypothetical principles when supported

by sufficient prima facie evidence, and enunciated in such a manner as to
be clearly apprehended, should find room for discussion at our sectional

meetings. Considering, however, our limitations of time, aud the varied

nature of our audience, it would seem not inappropriate to suspend,

mentally if not materially, over the doors of our section rooms, the

Frenchman's dictum, that no scientific theory ' can be considered complete

until it is so clear that it can be explained to the first man you meet in

the street.'

                                                                                            A2
--4 REPORT 1878.

Among the communications to the Sections, undoubtedly the most

important, as a rule, are the Reports ; that is to say, documents issuing
from specially appointed committees, some of which have been recipients

of the grants mentioned above. These Reports are in the main of two

kinds, first, accounts of observations carried on for a series of years, and

intended as records of information on the special subjects ; such for

instance have been those made by the Kew Committee, by the committees

on Luminous Meteors, on British Rainfall, on the Sneed of Steamships,

on Underground Temperature, on the Exploration of certain Geological

Caverns, (fee. These investigations, frequently originating in the energy

and special qualifications of an individual, but conducted under the con-

trol of a Committee, have in many cases been continued from year to

year, until either the object has been fully attained, or the matter has

passed into the hands of other bodies, which have thus been led to

recognise an inquiry into these subjects as part and parcel of their appro-
priate functions. The second class is one which is perhaps even more

peculiar to the Association                                                                                                                    viz., the Reports on the progress and present
                                                                                                                                            ;

state of some main topics of Science. Among these may be instanced

the early Reports on Astronomy, on Optics, on the Progress of Analysis

and later, those on Electrical Resistance, and on Tides ; that of Professor

G. G. Stokes on Double Refraction ; that of Professor H. J. Smith on the

Theory of "Numbers                                                                                                          that of Mr. Russell on Hyperelliptic Transcendents
                                                                                                                         ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and others. On this head Professor Carey Poster, in his address to the

Mathematical and Physical Section at our meeting last year, made some

excellent recommendations, to which< however. I need not at present more

particularly refer, as the result of them will be duly laid before the section

in the form of the report from a Committee to whom they were referred.

It will be sufficient here to add that the wide extension of the Sciences

in almost every branch, and the consequent specialisation of the studies

of each individual, have rendered the need for such reports more than
ever pressing ; and if the course of true Science should still run smooth
it is probable that the need will increase rather than diminish.

If time and space had permitted, I should have further particularised

the Committees, occasionally appointed, on subjects connected with edu-
cation. But T must leave this theme for some future President, and

content myself with pointing out that the British Association alone among

scientific societies concerns itself directly with these questions, and is
open to appeals for counsel and support from the great teaching body of

the country.

     One of the principal methods by which this Association materially
promotes the advancement of Science, and consequently one of its most
important functions, cotisists in grants of money from its own income in
aid of special scientific researches. The total amount so laid out during
the forty-seven years of our existence has been no less than 44,0007. ; and
the average during the last ten years has been 1,4507. per aniram. These

sums have not only been in the main wisely voted and usefully expended
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but they have been themselves productive ot much additional voluntary

expenditure of both time and money on the part of those to whom the

grants have been entrusted. The results have come back to the Associa-

tion in the form of papers and reports, many of which have been printed
in our volumes. By this appropriation of a large portion of its funds,
the Association has to some extent anticipated, nay even it may have
partly inspired the ideas, now so much discussed, ot the Endowment of
Research. And whether the aspirations of those who advocate such

endowment be ever fully realised or not, there can 1 think be no doubt

whatever that the Association in the matter of these grants has afforded

a most powerful stimulus to original research and discovery.

Regarded from another point of view these grants, together with

others to be hereafter mentioned, present a strong similarity to that use-

ful institution, the Professoriate Extraordinary of Germany, to which

there are no foundations exactly corresponding in this country. For,

beside their more direct educational purpose, these Professorships are

intended, like our own grants, to afford, to special individuals an oppor-

tunity of following out the special work for which they have previously

proved themselves competent. And in this respect the British Associa-

tion may be regarded as supplying, to the extent of its means, an elasticity

which is wanting in our own Universities.

Besides the funds which through your support are at the disposal of

the British Association there are, as is well known to many here present,

other funds of more or less similar character, at the disposal or subject

to the recommendations of the Royal Society. There is the Donation

Fund,  the  property  of  the  Society                                     the  Government Grant of  1,000£.  per
                                                                        ;

annum, administered by the Society ; and the Government Fund of 4,000Z.

per annum (an experiment for five years) to be distributed by the Science

and Ait Department, both lor research itself, and for the support of

those engaged thereon, according to the recommendations of a Committee

consisting mainly of Fellows of the Royal Society. To these might be

added other funds in the hands of different Scientific Societies.
    But although it must be admitted that the purposes of these various

funds are not to be distinguished by any very simple line of demarcation,

and that they may therefore occasionally appear to overlap one another,

mayit still, 1 think, be fairly maintainea that this fact does not furnish
any sufficient reason against their co- existence. There are many topics

of research too minute in their range, too tentative in their present con-

dition, to come fairly within the scope of the funds administered by the

Royal Society. There are others, ample enough in their extent, and long

enough in their necessary duration, to claim for their support a national

grant, but which need to be actually set on foot or tried before they can

iairly expect the recognition either of the public or of the Government.

To these categories others might be added ; but the above-mentioned

instances will perhaps suffice to show that even if larger and more perma-

nent funds were devoted to the promotion of research than is the case at
present, there would still be a field of activity open to the British Asso-

ciation as well as to other scientific bodies which may have funds at their

disposal.

    On the general question it is not difficult to offer strong arguments in

favour of permanent national Scientific Institutions ; nor is it difficult to

picture to the mind an ideal future when Science and Art shall walk hand

in hand together, led by a willing minister into the green pastures of the
Endowment of Research. But while allowing this to be no impossible
a future, we must still admit that there are other and less promising possi-
bilities, which under existing circumstances cannot be altogether left out

of our calculations. I am therefore on the whole inclined to think that,

while not losing sight of larger schemes, the wisest policy, for the present

at all events, and pending the experiment of the Government fund, will be

to confine our efforts to a careful selection of definite persons to carry out de-

finite pieces of work ; leaving to them the honour (or the onus if they so think
it) of justifying from time to time a continuation of the confidence which
the Government or other supporting body may have once placed in them.

    Passing from the proceedings to other features and functions of our

body, it should be remembered that the continued existence of the Asso-

ciation must depend largely upon the support which it receives from its

members and associates. Stinted in the funds so arising, its scientific effec-

tiveness would be materially impaired                                                                                                                                                                                                  and  deprived of  them,  its  existence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

would be precarious. The amount at our disposal in each year will naturally

vary with the population, with the accessibility, and with other circum-

stances of the place of meeting ; there will be financially, as well as

scientifically, good years and bad years. But we have in our invested

capital a sum sufficient to tide over all probable fluctuations, and even to

carry us efficiently through several years of financial famine, if ever such

should occur. This seems to me sufficient ; and we have therefore, I

think, no need to increase our reserve, beyond perhaps the moderate

addition which a prudent treasurer will always try to secure, against

expenditure which often increases and rarely diminishes.

    But however important this material support may be to our existence

and well being, it is by no means all that is required. There is another

factor which enters into the product, namely, the personal scientific

support of our best men. It is, I think, not too much to say, that without

their presence our meetings would fail in their chief and most important

Weelement, and had best be discontinued altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                                      make, it must be

admitted, a demand of sensible magnitude in calling upon men who have

been actively engaged during a great portion of the year, at a season

when they may fairly look for relaxation, to attend a busy meeting, and

to  contribute  to  its  proceedings                                                        but                                                                                                                                        unless  a  fair quota at least of  our

our gatherings will be to little purpose. There was a period within my

own recollection when it was uncertain whether the then younger members

of our scientific growth would cast in their lot with us or not, and when
the fate of the Association depended very much upon their decision. They

decided in our favour                                                                                                 they have                                           since  become Presidents,  Lecturers,  and

Of the advantages which may possibly accrue to the locality in which

our meetings are held, it is not for us to speak ; but it is always a ground
for sincere satisfaction to learn that our presence has been of any use in

stimulatiug an interest, or in promoting local efforts, in the direction of

Science.

The functions of the British Association do not, however, terminate

with the meeting itself. Beside the special committees already mentioned,

there remains a very important body, elected by the General Committee,

viz., the Council, which assembles at the office in London from time to

time as occasion requires. To this body belongs the duty of proposing a

President, of preparing for the approval of the General Committee the list

of Vice-Presidents and sectional officers, the selection of evening lecturers,

and other arrangements for the coming meeting.

At the present time another class of questions occupies a good deal of

the attention of the Council. In the first generation of the Association,

and during the period of unwritten, but not yet traditional, law, questions

relating to our own organisation or procedure either " settled themselves,"

or were wisely left to the discretionary powers of those who had taken

part in our proceedings during the early years of our existence. These

and other kindred subjects now require more careful formularisation and
more deliberate sanction. And it is on the shoulders of the Council that the

weight of these matters in general falls. These facts deserve especial men-

tion on the present occasion, because one part of our business at the close of

this meeting will be to bid farewell officially to one who has served us as

Assistant Secretary so long and so assiduously that he has latterly become

our main repertory of information, and our mentor upon questions of prece-

dent and procedure. The post hitherto held by Mr. Griffith (for it is to

him that I allude) will doubtless be well filled by the able and energetic

member who has been nominated in his place ; but I doubt not that even
he will be glad for some time to come to draw largely upon the knowledge

and experience of his predecessor.

But, beside matters of internal arrangement and organisation, the

duties of the Council comprise a variety of scientific subjects referred to

them by the General Committee, at the instance of the Committee of Re-

commendations, for deliberation and occasionally for action. With the

increasing activity of our body in general, and more particularly with that

of our various officers, these duties have of late years become more varied

and  onerous  than  formerly                                                                                          nor is it to                                                  be  wished  that they  should

diminish in either variety or extent.
--8 REPORT 1878.

    Once more, questions beyond our own constitution, and even beyond
the scope of our own immediate action, such as education, legislation

affecting either the promotion or the applications of science to industrial
and social life, which have suggested themselves at our meetings, and
received the preliminary sanction of our Committee of Recommendations,
are frequently referred to our Council. These, and others which it is
unnecessary to particularise, whether discussed in full Council or in com-
mittees specially appointed by that body, render the duties of our coun-

cillors as onerous as they are impoi'tant.

     While the Government has at all times, but in a more marked manner
of late years, recognised the Royal Society of London, with representa-
tives from the sister societies of Dublin and of Edinburgh, as the body
to which it should look for counsel and advice upon scientific questions,
it has still never shown itself indisposed to receive and entertain any

well-considered recommendation from the British Association. Two

special causes have in all probability contributed largely to this result.
First, the variety of elements comprised by the Association, on account
of which its recommendations imply a more general concurrence of scien-
tific opinion than those of any other scientific body. Secondly, the pecu-

liar fact, that our period of maximum activity coincides with that of
minimum activity of other scientific bodies, is often of the highest import-
ance. At the very time when the other bodies are least able, we are

most able, to give deliberate consideration, and formal sanction, to recom-
mendations whether in the form of applications to Government or other-

wise which may arise. In many of these, time is an element so essential,
that it is not too much to say, that without the intervention of the British
Association many opportunities for the advancement of Science, especially

 at the seasons in question, might have been lost. The Government has
moreover formally recognised our scientific existence by appointing our
President for the time being a member of the Government Fund Com-
mittee and the public has added its testimony to our importance and

                                      ;

utility by imposing upon our President and officers a variety of duties,
among which are conspicuous those which arise out of its very liberal

exercise of civic and other hospitality.
      Of the nature and functions of the Presidential address this is perhaps

neither the time nor the place to speak ; but if I might for a moment for-
get the purpose for which we are now assembled, I would take the oppor-
tunity of reminding those who have not attended many of our former

meetings that our annual volumes contain a long series of addresses on
the progress of Science, from a number of our most eminent men, to
which there is perhaps no parallel elsewhere. These addresses are per-
haps as remarkable for their variety in mode of treatment as for the value

 of their subject-matter. Some of our Presidents, and especially those
 who officiated in the earlier days of our existence, have passed in review
the various branches of Science, and have noted the progress made in
                                                                                                                           ADDRESS.                              9

each during the current year. But, as the various Sciences have demanded
more and more special treatment on the part of those who seriously pursue
them, so have the cases of individuals who can of their own knowledge
give anything approaching to a general review become more and more

rare. To this may be added the fact that although no year is so barren

as to fail in affording sufficient crop for a strictly scientific budget, or for

a detailed report of progress in research, yet one year is more fertile than

another in growths of sufficient prominence to arrest the attention of the

general public, and to supply topics suitable for the address. On these

accounts apparently such a Presidential survey has ceased to be annual,

and has dropped into an intermittence of longer period. Some Presi-

dents have made a scientific principle, such as the Time-element in natural

phenomena, or Continuity, or Natural Selection, the theme of their dis-
course, and have gathered illustrations from various branches of know-

ledge. Others again, taking their own special subject as a fundamental

note, and thence modulating into other kindred keys, have borne testi-

mony to the fact that no subject is so special as to be devoid of bearing
or of influence on many others. Some have described the successive stages

of even a single but important investigation ; and while tracing the growth
of that particular item, and of the ideas involved in it, have incidentally

shown to the outer world what manner of business a serious investigation

is. But there is happily no pattern or precedent which the President
is bound to follow ; both in range of subject-matter and in mode of treat-
ment each has exercised his undoubted right of taking an independent

line. And it can hardly be doubted that a judicious exercise of this free-
dom has contributed more than anything else to sustain the interest of a

series of annual discourses extending now over nearly half a century

The nature of the subjects which may fairly come within the scope of

such a discourse has of late been much discussed ; and the question is one

upon which everyone of course is entitled to form his own judgment ; but

lest there should be any misapprehension as to how far it concerns us in our

mycorporate capacity, it will be well to remind                                                                                      hearers that as, on the one

hand, there is no discussion on the Presidential address, and the members

as a body express no formal opinion upon it, so, on the other, the Association

cannot fairly be considered as in any way committed to its tenour or con-

clusions. Whether this immunity from comment and reply be really on

the whole so advantageous to the President as might be supposed need

not here be discussed                                                                                                 but  suffice it to say, that  the case of  an audience
                                                                                                                   ;

assembled to listen without discussion finds a parallel elsewhere, and in

the parallel case it is not generally considered that the result is altogether

either advantageous to the speaker or conducive to excellence in the

discourse.

     But, apart from this, the question of a limitation of range in the

subject-matter for the Presidential address is not quite so simple as may
at first sight appear. It must, in fact, be borne in mind that, while on
10 REPORT-- 1878.

the one hand knowledge is distinct from opinion, from feeling, and from

all other modes of subjective impression, still the limits of knowledge are

at all times expanding, and the boundaries of the known and the unknown

are never rigid or permanently fixed. That which in time past or present

has belonged to one category may in time future belong to the other.

Our ignorance consists partly in ignorance of actual facts, and partly also

in ignorance of the possible range of ascertainable fact. If we could lay

down beforehand precise limits of possible knowledge, the problem of

Physical Science would be already half solved. But the question to which

the scientific explorer has often to address himself is not merely whether

he is able to solve this or that problem, but whether he can so far unravel

the tangled threads of the matter with which he has to deal as to weave

them into a definite problem at all. He is not like a candidate at an

examination with a precise set of questions placed before him ; he must

first himself act the part of the examiner and select questions from the

repertory of nature, and upon them found others, which in some sense

are capable of definite solution. If his eye seem dim, he must look stead-

fastly and with hope into the misty vision, until the very clouds wreath

themselves into definite forms. If his ear seem dull, he must listen

patiently and with sympathetic trust to the intricate whisperings of

-- --nature, the goddess, as she has been called, of a hundred voices until

here and there he can pick out a few simple notes to which his own

powers can resound. If, then, at a moment when he finds himself placed

on a pinnacle from which he is called upon to take a perspective survey

of the range of science, and to tell us what he can see from his vantage

ground                                     if, at such a  moment,  after straining  his  gaze to the very verge

of the horizon, and after describing the most distant of well-defined

objects, he should give utterance also to some of the subjective impres-

sions  which                               he  is  conscious       of receiving from     regions  beyond                                     if he
                                                                                                                                          ;

should depict                                  possibilities which  seem  opening        to  his  view                                       if he
                                                                                                                              ;

should explain why he thinks this a mere blind alley and that an open

path ; then the fault and the loss would be alike ours if we refused to
listen calmly, and temperately to form our own judgment on what we

hear then assuredly it is we who would be committing the error of con-
                          ;

founding matters of fact and matters of opinion if we failed to discriminate

between the various elements contained in such a discourse, and assumed

that they had all been put on the same footing.

But to whatever decision we may each come on these controverted

points, one thing appears clear from a retrospect of past experience, viz.,

that first or last, either at the outset in his choice of subject or in the

conclusions ultimately drawn therefrom, the President, according to his

own account at least, finds himself on every occasion in a position of

" exceptional or more than usual difficulty." And your present repre-

sentative, like his predecessors, feels himself this moment in a similar

predicament. The reason which he now offers is that the branch of
ADDRESS.  11

science which he represents is one whose lines of advance, viewed from a

mathematician's own point of view, offer so few points of contact with
the ordinary experiences of life or modes of thought, that any account of
its actual progress which he might have attempted must have failed in

the first requisite of an address, namely, that of being intelligible.

    Now if this esoteric view had been the only aspect of the subject

which he could present to his hearers, he might well have given up the
attempt in despair. But although in its technical character Mathematical

Science suffers the inconveniences, while it enjoys the dignity, of its

Olympian position, still in a less formal garb, or in disguise, if you are

pleased so to call it, it is found present at many an unexpected turn
and although some of us may never have learnt its special language, not

a few have, all through our scientific life, and even in almost every

accurate utterance, like Moliere's well known character, been talking
mathematics without knowing it. It is, moreover, a fact not to be over-

looked that the appearance of isolation, so conspicuous in mathematics,
appertains in a greater or less degree to all other sciences, and perhaps
also to all pursuits in life. In its highest flight each soars to a distance

from its fellows. Each is pursued alone for its own sake, and without

reference to its connection with, or its application to, any other subject.
The pioneer and the advanced guard are of necessity separated from the
main body, and in this respect mathematics does not materially differ
from its neighbours. And, therefore, as the solitariness of mathematics

has been a frequent theme of discourse, it may be not altogether unpro-

fitable to dwell for a short time upon the other side of the question, and
to inquire whether there be not points of contact in method or in subject-
matter between mathematics and the outer world which have been
frequently overlooked ; whether its lines do not in some cases run parallel
to those of other occupations and purposes of life ; and lastly, whether we

may not hope for some change in the attitude too often assumed towards

it by the representatives of other branches of knowledge and of mental

activity.

     In his Preface to the ' Principia ' Newton gives expression to some
general ideas which may well serve as the key-note for all future utter-

ances on the relation of mathematics to natural, including also therein
what are commonly called artificial, phenomena.

     " The ancients divided mechanics into two parts, rational and prac-
tical ; and since artizans often work inaccurately, it came to pass that
mechanics and geometry were distinguished in this way, that everything
accurate was referred to geometry, and everything inaccurate to
mechanics. But the inaccuracies appertain to the artizan and not to the
art, and geometry itself has its foundation in mechanical practice, and is
in fact nothing else than that part of universal mechanics which accu-

rately lays down and demonstrates the art of measuring." He next

explains that rational mechanics is the science of motion resulting from
12 REPOBT-- 1878.

forces, and adds, " The whole difficulty of philosophy seems to me to lie

in investigating the forces of nature from the phenomena of motion, and
in demonstrating that from these forces other phenomena will ensue."
Then, after stating the problems of which he has treated in the work
itself, he says, " I would that all other natural phenomena might simdarly

be deduced from mechanical principles. For many things move me to

suspect that everything depends upon certain forces in virtue of which
the particles of bodies, through forces not yet understood, are either
impelled together so as to cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and

recede from one another."

    Newton's views, then, are clear. He regards mathematics, not as a

method independent of, though applicable to, various subjects, but as
itself the higher side or aspect of the subjects themselves ; and it would
be little more than a translation of his notions into other language, little
more than a paraphrase of his own words, if we were to describe the
mathematical as one aspect of the material world itself, apart from which
all other aspects are but incomplete sketches, and, however accurate
after their own kind, are still liable to the imperfections of the inaccu-
rate artificer. Mr. Burrowes, in his Preface to the first volume of the
' Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy,' has carried out the same

argument, approaching it from the other side. " No one science," he says,
" is so little connected with the rest as not to afford many principles
whose use may extend considerably beyond the science to which they

primarily belong, and no proposition is so purely theoretical as to be in-
capable of being applied to practical purposes. There is no apparent
connexion between duration and the cycloidal arch, the properties of
which have furnished us with the best method of measuring time ; and
he who has made himself master of the nature and affections of the loga-
rithmic curve has advanced considerably towards ascertaining the propor-
tionable density of the air at various distances from the earth. The

researches of the mathematician are the only sure ground on which we
can reason from experiments ; and how far experimental science may

assist commercial interests is evinced by the success of manufactures in
countries where the hand of the artificer has taken its direction from

the philosopher. Every manufacture is in reality but a chemical process,
and the machinery requisite for carrying it on but the right application
of certain propositions in rational mechanics." So far your Academician.

Every subject, therefore, whether in its usual acceptation scientific or

otherwise, may have a mathematical aspect ; as soon, in fact, as it

becomes a matter of strict measurement, or of numerical statement, so
soon does it enter upon a mathematical phase. This phase may, or it

may not, be a prelude to another in which the laws of the subject are

 expressed in algebraical formulae or represented by geometrical figures.

But the real gist of the business does not always lie in the mode of
 expression, and the fascination of the formulas or other mathematical
                         ADDRESS.                                                                                                                                                 1

paraphernalia may after all be little more than that of a theatrical trans-

formation scene. The process of reducing to formula? is really one of

abstraction, the restilts of which are not always wholly on the side of

gain ; in fact, through the process itself the subject may lose in one
respect even more than it gains in another. But long before such

abstraction is completely attained, and even in cases where it is never

attained at all, a subject may to all intents and purposes become mathe-

matical. It is not so much elaborate calculations or abstruse processes

which characterise this phase as the principles of precision, of exactness,

and of proportion. But these are principles with which no true know-

ledge can entirely dispense. If it be the general scientific spirit which

at the outset moves upon the face of the waters, and out of the unknown

depth brings forth light and living forms, it is no less the mathematical

spirit which breathes the breath of life into what would otherwise have

ever remained mere dry bones of fact, which reunites the scattered limbs

and re-creates from them a new and organic whole.

    And as a matter of fact, in the words used by Professor Jellett at our
meeting at Belfast, viz., " Not only are we applying our methods to many

sciences already recognised as belonging to the legitimate province of

mathematics, but we are learning to apply the same instrument to sciences

hitherto wholly or partially independent of its authority. Physical

Science is learning more and more every day to see in the phenomena of

Nature modifications of that one phenomenon (namely, Motion) which is

peculiarly under the power of mathematics." Echoes are these, far off

and faint perhaps, but still true echoes, in answer to Newton's wish that

all these phenomena may some day " be deduced from mechanical prin-

ciples."

myIf, turning from this aspect of the subject, it were                                                                                                                            purpose to

enumerate how the same tendency has evinced itself in the Arts, un-

consciously it may be to the artists themselves, I might call as witnesses

each one in turn with full reliance on the testimony wbich they would

bear. And, having more special reference to mathematics, I might con-

fidently point to the accuracy of measurement, to the truth of curve,
which according to modern investigation is the key to the perfection of

classic art. I might triumphantly cite not only the architects of all ages,
whose art so manifestly rests upon mathematical principles ; but I might

cite also the literary as well as the artistic remains of the great artists of
Cinqueceuto, both painters and sculptors, in evidence of the geometry
and the mechanics which, having been laid at the foundation, appear to

have found their way upwards through the superstructure of their works.
And in a less ambitious sphere, but nearer to ourselves in both time and
place, I might point with satisfaction to the great school of English con-

structors  of the  18th  century in the domestic arts                                                                                                                             and remind you^that

whereby solid figures may be delineated on paper, or what is now termed

descriptive geometry.

     Nor perhaps wonld the sciences which concern themselves with
reasoning and speech, nor the kindred art of Music, nor even Literature
itself, if thoroughly probed, offer fewer points of dependence upon the

science of which I am speaking. What, in fact, is Logic but that part
of universal reasoning ; Grammar but that part of universal speech
Harmony and Counterpoint but that part of universal music, " which accu-

rately lays down," and demonstrates (so far as demonstration is possible)

precise methods appertaining to each of these Arts ? And I might even
appeal to the common consent which speaks of the mathematical as the

pattern form of reasoning and model of a precise style.
     Taking, then, precision and exactness as the characteristics which

distinguish the mathematical phase of a subject, we are naturally led to
expect that the approach to such a phase will be indicated by increasing
application of the principle of measurement, and by the importance
which is attached to numerical results. And this very necessary condition
for progress may, I think, be fairly described as one of the main features

of scientific advance in the present day.

    If it were my purpose, by descending into the arena of special sciences,

to show how the most various investigations alike tend to issue in

measurement, and to that extent to assume a mathematical phase, I should
be embarrassed by the abundance of instances which might be adduced.
I will therefore confine myself to a passing notice of a very few, selecting
those which exemplify not only the general tendency, but also the special

character of the measurements now particularly required, viz., that of
minuteness, and the indirect method by which alone we can at present
hope to approach them. An object having a diameter of an 80,000th of

an inch is perhaps the smallest of which the microscope could give any
well-defined representation ; and it is improbable that one of 120,000th of
an inch could be singly discerned with the highest powers at our com-
mand. But the solar beams and the electric light reveal to us the presence
of bodies far smaller than these. And, in the absence of any means of
observing them singly, Professor Tyndall has suggested a scale of these
minute objects in terms of the lengths of luminiferous waves. To this
he was led, not by any attempt at individual measurement, but by taking
account of them in the aggregate, and observing the tints which they
scatter laterally when clustered in the form of actinic clouds. The small
bodies with which experimental Science has recently come into contact
are not confined to gaseous molecules, but comprise also complete organisms
and the same philosopher has made a profound study of the momentous

influence exerted by these minute organisms in the economy of life. And if,
in view of their specific effects, whether deleterious or other, on human life,

any qualitative classification, or quantitative estimate be ever possible, it
seems that it must be effected by some such method as that indicated above.
ADDBESS.  1

     Again, to enumerate a few more instances of the measurement of
minute quantities, there are the average distances of molecules from
one another in various gases and at various pressures ; the length of their
free path, or range open for their motion without coming into collision

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

there are movements causing the pressures and differences of pressure
under which Mr. Crookes' radiometers execute their wonderful revolutions.

There are the excursions of the air while transmitting notes of high pitch,
which through the researches of Lord Rayleigh appear to be of a diminu-

tiveness altogether unexpected. There are the molecular actions brought

into play in the remarkable experiments by Dr. Kerr, who has succeeded,

where even Faraday failed, in effecting a visible rotation of the plane of
polarisation of light in its passage through electrified dielectrics, and on
its reflexion at the surface of a magnet. To take one more instance, which
must be present to the minds of us all, there are the infinitesimal ripples

of the vibrating plate in Mr. Graham Bell's most marvellous invention.
Of the nodes and ventral segments in the plate of the telephone which
actually converts sound into electricity and electricity into sound, we can
at present form no conception. All that can now be said is that the most

perfect specimens of Chladni's sand figures on a vibrating plate, or of
Kundt's lycopodium heaps in a musical tube, or even Mr. Sedley Taylor's
more delicate vortices in the films of the Phoneidoscope, are rough and
sketchy compared with these. For notwithstanding the fact that in the

movements of the Telephone-plate we have actually in our hand the solu-

tion of that old world problem, the construction of a speaking machine
yet the characters in which that solution is expressed are too small for our

powers of decipherment. In movements such as these we seem to lose
sight of the distinction, or perhaps we have unconsciously passed the

boundary between massive and molecular motion.

     Through the Phonograph we have not only a transformation but a per-
manent and tangible record of the mechanism of speech. But the differ-
ences upon which articulation (apart from loudness, pitch, and quality)
depends, appear from the experiments of Fleeming Jenkin and of others
to be of microscopic size. The Microphone affords another instance of the

--unexpected value of minute variations, in this case of electric currents
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and it is remarkable that the gist of the instrument seems to lie in obtain-
ing and perfecting that which electricians have hitherto most scrupulously

avoided, viz., loose contact.

     Once more, Mr. De La Rue has brought forward as one of the results

derived from his stupendous battery of 10,000 cells, strong evidence for

supposing that a voltaic discharge, even when apparently continuous, may
still be an intermittent phenomenon ; but all that is known of the period

of such intermittence is, that it must recur at exceedingly short intervals.

And in connexion with this subject, it may be added that, whatever be

the ultimate explanation of the strange stratification which the voltaic
discharge undergoes in rarefied gases, it is clear that the alternate disposi-

tion of light and darkness must be dependent on some periodic distribution

in space or sequence in time which can at present be dealt with only in a

very general way. In the exhausted column we have a vehicle for elec-

tricity not constant like an ordinary conductor, but itself modified by the

passage of the discharge, and perhaps subject to laws differing materially

from those which it obeys at atmospheric pressure. It may also be that

some of the features accompanying stratification form a magnified image

of phenomena   belonging  to   disruptive  discharges                                                            in   general                                    and  that

consequently, so far from expecting among the known facts of the latter

any clue to an explanation of the former, we must hope ultimately to find

Ain the former an elucidation of what is at present obscure in the latter.

prudent philosopher usually avoids hazarding any forecast of the practical

application of a purely scientific research. But it would seem that the

configuration of these striae might some day prove a very delicate means

of estimating low pressures, and perhaps also for effecting some electrical

measurements.

Now it is a curious fact that almost the only small quantities of which

we have as yet any actual measurements are the wave lengths of light

and that all others, excepting so far as they can be deduced from these,

await future determination. In the meantime, when unable to approach

these small quantities individually, the method to which we are obliged

to have recourse is, as indicated above, that of averages, whereby, disre-

garding the circumstances of each particular case, we calculate the average

size, the average velocity, the average direction, &c, of a large number of
instances. But although this method is based upon experience, and leads

to results which may be accepted as substantially true; although it

may be applicable to any finite interval of time, or over any finite area of

space (that is, for all practical purposes of life), there is no evidence to

show that it is so when the dimensions of interval or of area are indefinitely

diminished. The truth is that the simplicity of nature which we at present

grasp is really the result of  infinite  complexity                                                              and  that  below the uni-
                                                                                                              ;

formity there underlies a diversity whose depths we have not yet probed,

and whose secret places are still beyond our reach.

The present is not an occasion for multiplying illustrations, but I can

hardly omit a passing allusion to one all-important instance of the appli-

cation of the statistical method. Without its aid social life, or the History

of Life and Death, could not be conceived at all, or only in the most super-

ficial manner. Without it we could never attain to any clear ideas of the

condition of the Poor, we could never hope for any solid amelioration of

their condition or prospects. Without its aid, sanitary measures, and even

medicine would be powerless. Without it, the politician and the philan-

thropist would alike be wandering over a trackless desert.

It is, however, not so much from the side of Science at large as from

that of Mathematics itself, that I desire to speak. I wish from the latter

point of view to indicate connexions between Mathematics and other sub-
                                                                                                                           ADDRESS.                                       17

l'ects, to prove that hers is not after all such a far-off region, nor so unde-

cipherable an alphabet, and to show that eveu at unlikely spots we may

trace under-currents of thought which having issued from a common source

fertilise alike the mathematical and the non-mathematical world.
     Having this in view, I propose to make the subject of special remark

some processes peculiar to modern Mathematics ; and, partly with the
object of incidentally removing some current misapprehensions, I have
selected for examination three methods in respect of which mathematicians

are often thought to have exceeded all reasonable limits of speculation,

and to have adopted for unknown purposes an unknown tongue. And it
will be my endeavour to show not only that in these very cases our science
has not outstepped its own legitimate range, but that even art and litera-

ture have unconsciously employed methods similar in principle. The
three methods in question are, first, that of Imaginary Quantities ; secondly,
that of Manifold Space ; and thirdly, that of Geometry not according to

Euclid.

     First it is objected that, abandoning the more cautious methods of
ancient mathematicians, we have admitted into our formulas quantities
which by our own showing, and even in our own nomenclature, are
imaginary or impossible ; nay, more, that out of them we have formed a
variety of new algebras to which there is no counterpart whatever in
reality ; but from which we claim to arrive at possible and certain results.

    On this head it is in Dublin, if anywhere, that I may be permitted to

speak. For to the fertile imagination of the late Astronomer Royal for

Ireland we are indebted for that marvellous Calculus of Quaternions, which
is only now beginning to be fully understood, and which has not yet
received all the applications of which it is doubtless capable. And even

although this calculus be not coextensive with another which almost simul-

taneously germinated on the Continent, nor with ideas more recently

developed in America                                                                                                   yet it must    always  hold its  position as an original
                                                                                                                    ;

discovery, and as a representative of one of the two great groups of gene-

ralised algebras (viz., those the squares of whose units are respectively

negative unity and zero), the common origin of which must still be
marked on our intellectual map as an unknown region. Well do I re-
collect how in its early days we used to handle the method as a magician's

page might try to wield his master's wand, trembling as it were between

hope and fear, and hardly knowing whether to trust our own results

until they had been submitted to the present and ever-ready counsel of

Sir W. R. Hamilton himself.

To fix our ideas, consider the measurement of a line, or the reckoning

Aof time, or the performance of any mathematical operation.                                                                                             Hue may

be measured in one direction or in the opposite ; time may be reckoned

back to the original direction of measurement or of reckoning, or to the
 original kind of operation.

      Suppose, however, that at some stage of a calculation our formulas
indicate an alteration in the mode of measurement such that, if the
alteration be repeated, a condition of things, not the same as, but the
reverse of the original, will be produced. Or suppose that, at a certain
stage, our transformations indicate that time is to be reckoned in some
manner different from future or past, but still in a way having definite
algebraical connexion with time which is gone and time which is to come.
It is clear that in actual experience there is no process to which such
measurements correspond. Time has no meaning except as future or past
and the present is but the meeting point of the two. Or, once more,
suppose that we are gravely told that all circles pass through the same
two imaginary points at an infinite distance, and that every line drawn

through one of these points is perpendicular to itself. On hearing the
statement, we shall probably whisper, with a smile or a sigh, that we hope
it is not true ; but that in any case it is a long way off, and perhaps, after
all, it does not very much signify. If, however, as mathematicians we are
not satisfied to dismiss the question on these terms, we ourselves must
admit that we have here reached a definite point of issue. Our science

must either give a rational account of the dilemma, or yield the position
as no longer tenable.

     Special modes of explaining this anomalous state of things have

occurred to mathematicians. But, omitting details as unsuited to the
present occasion, it will, I think, be sufficient to point out in general terms
that a solution of the difficulty is to be found in the fact that the formula?

which give rise to these results are more comprehensive than the significa-
tion assigned to them ; and when we pass out of the condition of things
first contemplated they cannot (as it is obvious they ought not) give us
any results intelligible on that basis. But it does not therefore by any
means follow that upon a more enlarged basis the formulae are incapable
of interpretation ; on the contrary, the difficulty at which we have
arrived indicates that there must be some more comprehensive state-
ment of the problem which will include cases impossible in the more
limited, but possible in the wider view of the subject.

   A very simple instance will illustrate the matter. If from a point out-

side a circle we draw a straight line to touch the curve, the distance
between the starting point and the point of contact has certain geometrical

properties. If the starting point be shifted nearer and nearer to the circle
the distance in question becomes shorter, and ultimately vanishes. But
as soon as the point passes to the interior of the circle the notion of a
tangent and distance to the point of contact cease to have any meaning

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and the same anomalous condition of things prevails as long as the point
remains in the interior. But if the point be shifted still further until it
emerges on the other side, the tangent and its properties resume their
                                                               ADDRESS.                                                                                                                                                                                1

Nowreality, and are as intelligible as before.                           tlie process whereby we

have passed from the possible to the impossible, and again repassed to the

possible (namely, the shifting of the starting point) is a perfectly con-

tinuons one, while the conditions of the problem as stated above have

abruptly changed. If, however, we replace the idea of a line touching by

  that of a line cutting the circle, and the distance of the point of contact
. by the distances at which the line is intercepted by the curve, it will easily

be seen that the latter includes the former as a limiting case, when the cut-

ting line is turned about the starting point until it coincides vith the tangent

itself. And further, that the two intercepts have a perfectly distinct and

intelligible meaning whether the point be outside or inside the area. The

only difference is that in the first case the intercepts are measured in the

same direction ; in the latter in opposite directions.

     The foregoing instance has shown one purpose which these imaginaries
may serve, viz., as marks indicating a limit to a particular condition of

things, to the application of a particular law, or pointing out a stage

where a more comprehensive law is required. To attain to such a law we

must, as in the instance of the circle and tangent, reconsider our statement

of  the problem                                                we must go back to the principle from which we set out,
                                                            ;

and ascertain whether it may not be modified or enlarged. And even if

in any particular investigation, wherein imaginaries have occurred, the

most comprehensive statement of the problem of which we are at present

capable fails to give an actual representation of these quantities ; if they
must for the present be relegated to the category of imaginaries ; it still

does not follow that we may not at some future time find a law which will
endow them with reality, nor that in the meantime we need hesitate to

employ them, in accordance with the great principle of continuity, for

bringing out correct results.

    If, moreover, both in Geometry and in Algebra we occasionally make

use of points or of quantities, which from our present outlook have no

real existence, which can neither be delineated in space of which we have

experience, nor measured by scale as we count measurement ; if these

imaginaries, as they are termed, are called up by legitimate processes of

our science                                                    if they serve the purpose not merely of suggesting ideas, but

abstract science, I may perhaps be allowed to point out, in illustration
of my argument, that in Art unreal forms are frequently used for suggesting

ideas, for conveying a meaning for which no others seem to be suitable or

adequate. Are not forms unknown to Biology, situations incompatible

with gravitation, positions which challenge not merely the stability but

even the possibility of equilibrium,--are not these the very means to which

the artist often has recourse in order to convey his meaning and to fulfil

Whohis mission ?                                               that has ever revelled in the ornamentation of the

purely geometric curves, who lias not felt that these imaginaries have

a claim to recognition very similar to that of their congeners in mathe-

Howmatics ?  is it that the grotesque paintings of the Middle Ages, the

fantastic sculpture of remote nations, and even the rude art of the pre-

historic past, still impress us, and have an interest over and above their

antiquarian value; unless it be that they are symbols which, although

hard of interpretation when taken alone, are yet capable from a more com-

prehensive point of view of leading us mentally to something beyond

themselves, and to truths which, although reached through them, have a

reality scarcely to be attributed to their outward forms ?

Ao-ain if we turn from Art to Letters, truth to nature and to fact is un-

doubtedly a characteristic of  sterling  literature                                               and yet in  the  delinea-
                                                                                               ;

tion of outward nature itself, still more in that of feelings and affections,

of the secret parts of character and motives of conduct, it frequently

happens that the writer is driven to imagery, to an analogy, or even to

a paradox, in order to give utterance to that of which there is no direct

counterpart in recognised speech. And yet which of us cannot find

a meaning for these literary figures, an inward response to imaginative

poetry, to social fiction, or even to those tales of giant and fairyland

written, it is supposed, only for the nursery or schoolroom ? But in order

thus to reanimate these things with a meaning beyond that of the mere

words, have we not to reconsider our first position, to enlarge the ideas with

which we started ; have we not to cast about for some thing which is

common to the idea conveyed and to the subject actually described, and

to seek for the sympathetic spring which underlies both ; have we not,

like the mathematician, to go back as it were to some first principles, or,

as it is pleasanter to describe it, to become again as a little child ?

Passing to the second of the three methods, viz., that of Manifold

Space, it may first be remarked that our whole experience of space is in

three dimensions, viz., of that which has length, breadth, and thickness;

and if for certain purposes we restrict our ideas to two dimensions as in

plane geometry, or to one dimension as in the division of a straight line,

we do this only by consciously and of deliberate purpose setting aside,

but not annihilating, the remaining one or two dimensions. Negation, as

Hecel has justly remarked, implies that which is negatived, or, as he

expresses it, affirms the opposite. It is by abstraction from previous ex-

perience, by a limitation of its results, and not by any independent process,

that we arrive at the idea of space -whose dimensions are less than three.

     It is doubtless on this account that problems in plane geometry which,

although capable of solution on their own account, become much more

intelligible more easy of extension, if viewed in connexion with solid

space, and as special cases of corresponding problems in solid geometry.

So eminently is this the case, that the very language of the more general

method often leads us almost intuitively to conclusions which, from the

more restricted point of view, require long and laborious proof. Such a
ADDRESS.  21

 change in the base of operations has, in fact, been snccessf ully made in
 geometry of two dimensions, and although we have not the same experi-
 mental data for the further steps, yet neither the modes of reasoning, nor
 the validity of its conclnsions, are in any way affected by applying an
 analogous mental process to geometry of three dimensions ; and hj

 regarding figures in space of three dimensions as sections of figures in

 space of four, in the same way that figures in piano are sometimes con-
 sidered as sections of figures in solid space. The addition of a fourth

 dimension to space not only extends the actual properties of geometrical

 figures, but it also adds new properties which are often useful for*the pur-
 poses of transformation or of proof. Thus it has recently been shown

 that in four dimensions a closed material shell could be turned inside out
 by simjile flexure, without either stretching or tearing ; and that in such
 a space it is impossible to tie a knot.

      Again, the solution of problems in geometry is often effected by means
of algebra; and as three measurements, or co-ordinates as they are called,
determine the position of a point in space, so do three letters or measure-
able quantities serve for the same purpose in the language of algebra.

Now, many algebraical problems involving three unknown or variable

quantities admit of being generalised so as to give problems involving

many such quantities. And as, on the one hand, to every algebraical
problem involving unknown quantities or variables by ones, or by twos,

or by threes, there corresponds a problem in geometry of one or of two or

of three dimensions : so on the other it may be said that to every
algebraical problem involving many variables there corresponds a problem
in geometry of many dimensions.

      There is, however, another aspect under which even ordinary space
presents to us a four-fold, or indeed a mani-fold, character. In modern

Physics, space is regarded not as a vacuum in which bodies are placed
and forces have play, but rather as a plenum with which matter is co-
extensive. And from a physical point of view the properties of space are
the properties of matter, or of the medium which fills it. Similarly from
a mathematical point of view, space may be regarded as a locus in quo,
as a plenum, filled with those elements of geometrical magnitude which
we take as fundamental. These elements need not always be the same.
For different purposes different elements may be chosen ; and upon the

degree of complexity of the subject of our choice will depend the internal
structure or mani-foldness of space.

    Thus, beginning with the simplest case, a point may have any siDgly

infinite multitude of positions in a line, which gives a one-fold system of
points in a line. The line may revolve in a plane about any one of its

points, giving a two-fold system of points in a plane ; and the plane may

revolve about any one of the lines, giving a three-fold system of points in

space.

     Suppose, however, that we take a straight line as our element, and
22 report-- 1878.

conceive space as filled with such lines. This will be the case if we take

two planes, e.g., two parallel planes, and join every point in one with

every point in the other. Now the points in a plane form a two-fold

system, and it therefore follows that the system of lines is fonr-fold ; in

other words, space regarded as a plenum of lines is four-fold. The same

result follows from the consideration that the lines in a plane, and the

planes through a point, are each two-fold.

    Again, if we take a sphere as our element we can through any point
as a centre draw a singly infinite number of spheres, but the number of

such centres is triply infinite ; hence space as a plenum of spheres is four-
fold. And, generally, space as a plenum of surfaces has a mani-foldness
equal to the number of constants required to determine the surface.
Although it would be beyond our present purpose to attempt to pursue

the subject further, it should not pass unnoticed that the identity in the

four-fold character of space, as derived on the one hand from a system of

straight lines, and on the other from a system of spheres, is intimately

connected with the principles established by Sophus Lie in his researches

on the correlation of these figures.

    If we take a circle as our element we can around any point in a plane
as a centre draw a singly infinite system of circles ; but the number of

such  centres                                            in a  plane     is                                      doubly infinite                                                                  hence  the  circles  in a plane
                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

form a three-fold system, and as the planes in space form a three-fold

system, it follows that space as a plenum of circles is six-fold.

    Again, if we take a circle as our element, we may regard it as a

section either of a sphere, or of a right cone (given except in position) by

a plane perpendicular to the axis. In the former case the position of the

centre  is  three-fold                                           the directions of                                                                            the  plane,                         like        that of a  pencil of
                                                           ;

lines perpendicular thereto, two-fold ; and the radius of the sphere one-

fold; six-fold in all. In the latter case, the position of the vertex is

three-fold                                               the  direction                                      of  the  axis                                    two-fold ;                          and    the  distance   of the

plane of section one-fold : six-fold in all, as before. Hence space as a

plenum of circles is six- fold.

     Similarly, if we take a conic as our element we may regard it as a

section of a right cone (given except in position) by a plane. If the

nature of the conic be defined, the plane of section will be inclined at a

fixed angle to the axis ; otherwise it will be free to take any inclination

whatever. This being so, the position of the vertex will be three-fold

the   direction                                          of the  axis                                        two-fold                                         the  distance                       of the      plane of   section
                                                                                                                                                           ;

from  the vertex                                              one-fold                                       and  the direction of that plane one-fold if the
                                                                                                          ;

conic be defined, two-fold if it be not defined. Hence, space as a plenum

of definite conies will be seven-fold, as a plenum of conies in general,

eight-fold. And so on for curves of higher degrees.

     This is in fact the whole story and mystery of manifold space. It is

not seriously regarded as a reality in the same sense as ordinary space
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

it is a mode of representation, or a method which, having served its pur-

pose, vanishes from the scene. Like a rainbow, if we try to grasp it, it

eludes our very touch                                                                                                but, like a rainbow, it arises out of real conditions
                                                                                                                  ;

of known and tangible quantities, and if rightly apprehended it is a true

and valuable expression of natural laws, and serves a definite purpose in

the science of which it forms part.

    Again, if we seek a counterpart of this in common life, I might remind

you that perspective in drawing is itself a method not altogether dissimilar

to that of which I have been speaking ; and that the third dimension of

space, as represented in a picture, has its origin in the painter's mind, and

is due to his skill, but has no real existence upon the canvas which is the
groundwork of his art. Or again, turning to literature, when in legendary

tales, or in works of fiction, things past and future are pictured as present,

has not the poetic fancy correlated time with the three dimensions of

space, and brought all alike to a common focus ? Or once more, when

space already filled with material substances is mentally peopled with

immaterial beings, may not the imagination be regarded as having added

a new element to the capacity of space, a fourth dimension of which there

is no evidence in experimental fact?

The third method proposed for special remark is that which has been

termed Non- Euclidean Geometry; and the train of reasoning which has

led to it may be described in general terms as follows : some of the pro-

perties of space which on account of their simplicity, theoretical as well as

practical, have, in constructing the ordinary system of geometry, been con-

sidered as fundamental, are now seen to be particular cases of more general
properties. Thus a plane surface, and a straight line, may be regarded as

special instances of surfaces and lines whose curvature is everywhere uni-

form or constant. And it is perhaps not difficult to see that, when the
special notions of flatness and straightness are abandoned, many properties

of geometrical figures which we are in the habit of regarding as fundamen-
tal will undergo profound modification. Thus a plane may be considered

as a special case of the sphere, viz., the limit to which a sphere approaches

when its radius is increased without limit. But even this consideration

trenches upon an elementary proposition relating to one of the simplest of

geometrical figures. In plane triangles the interior angles are together

equal to two right angles ; but in triangles traced on the surface of a
sphere this proposition does not hold good. To this, other instances might

be added.

Further, these modifications may affect not only our ideas of particular

geometrical figures, but the very axioms of the Science itself. Thus, the

idea, which in fact lies at the foundation of Euclid's method, viz., that a geo-

metrical figure may be moved in space without change of size or alteration

of form, entirely falls away, or becomes only approximate in a space

wherein dimension and form are dependent upon position. For instance,

if we consider merely the case of figures traced on a flattened globe like
24 report-- 1878.

the earth's surface, or upon an eggshell, such figures cannot be made to

slide upon the surface without change of form, as is the case with figures

traced upon a plane or even upon a sphere. But, further still, these

generalisations are not restricted to the case of figures traced upon a sur-

face ; they may apply also to solid figures in a space whose very configu-

Weration varies from point to point.  may, for instance, imagine a space

in which our rule or scale of measurement varies as it extends, or as it

moves about, in one direction or another ; a space, in fact, whose geometric

density is not uniformly distributed. Thus we might picture to ourselves

such a space as a field having a more or less complicated distribution of

temperature, and our scale as a rod instantaneously susceptible of expan-

sion or contraction under the influence of heat: or we might suppose

space to be even crystalline in its geometric formation, and our scale and

measuring instruments to accept the structure of the locality in which

they are applied. These ideas are doubtless difficult of apprehension, at

all events at the outset; but Helmholtz has pointed out a very familiar

phenomenon which may be regarded as a diagram of such a kind of space.

The picture formed by reflexion from a plane mirror may be taken as a

carrect representation of ordinary space, in which, subject to the usual

laws of perspective, every object appears in the same form and of the same

dimensions whatever be its position. In like manner the picture formed

by reflexion from a curved mirror may be regarded as the representation

·of a space wherein dimension and form are dependent upon position.

Thus in an ordinary convex mirror objects appear smaller as they recede

laterally from the centre of the jficture ; straight lines become curved

objects infinitely distant in front of the mirror appear at a distance only

equal to the focal length behind. And by suitable modifications in the

curvature of the mirror, representations could similarly be obtained of

space of various configurations.

The diversity in kind of these    spaces  is of  course infinite                                                               they vary
                                                                                                                            ;

with the mode in which we generalise our conceptions of ordinary space
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

but upon each as a basis it is possible to construct a consistent system of

geometry, whose laws, as a matter of strict reasoning, have a validity and

truth not inferior to those with which we are habitually familiar. Such

systems having been actually constructed, the question has not unnaturally

been asked, whether there is anything in nature or in the outer world to

which they correspond ; whether, admitting that for our limited experi-

ence ordinary geometry amply suffices, we may understand that for powers

more extensive in range or more minute in definition some more general

scheme would be requisite ? Thus, for example, although the one may

serve for the solar system, is it legitimate to suppose that it may fail to

apply at distances reaching to the fixed stars, or to regions beyond ? Or

again, if our vision could discern the minute configuration of portions of

space, which to our ordinary powers appear infinitesimally small, should

we expect to find that all our usual Geometry is but a special case, suffi-
ADDRESS.  25

cient indeed for daily use, but after all only a rougli approximation to a
truer although perhaps more complicated scheme ? Traces of these ques-
tions are in fact to be found in the writings of some of our greatest and
most original mathematicians. Gauss, Riemann, and Helmholtz have
thrown out suggestions radiating as it were in these various directions

from a common centre while Cayley, Sylvester, and Clifford in this
                                                                                                                                                      ;

country, Klein in Germany, Lobatcheffsky in Russia, Bolyai in Hungary,

and Beltrami in Italy, with many others, have reflected kindred ideas with

all the modifications due to the chromatic dispersion of their individual
minds. But to the main question the answer must be in the negative.
And, to use the words of Newton, since " Geometry has its foundation in
mechanical practice," the same must be the answer until our experience

is different from what it now is. And yet, all this notwithstanding,

generalised conceptions of space are not without their practical utility.

The principle of representing space of one kind by that of another, and
figures belonging to one by their analogues in the other, is not only
recognised as legitimate in pure mathematics, but has long ago found its
application in cartography. In maps or charts, geographical positions,
the contour of coasts, and other featiires, belonging in reality to the
Earth's surface, are represented on the flat ; and to each mode of repre-

sentation, or projection as it is called, there corresponds a special correla-

tion between the spheroid and the plane. To this might perhaps be added
the method of descriptive geometry, and all similar processes in use by
engineers, both military and civil.

     It has often been asked whether modern research in the field of Pure
Mathematics has not so completely outstripped its physical applications
as to be practically useless ; whether the analyst and the geometer might
not now, and for a long time to come, fairly say, " hie artem remumque
repono," and turn his attention to Mechanics and to Physics. That the
Pui'e has outstripped the Applied is largely true ; but that the former is
on that account useless is far from true. Its utility often crops up ao

unexpected points ; witness the aids to classification of physical quanti-
ties, furnished by the ideas (of Scalar and Vector) involved in the Calculus
of Quaternions ; or the advantages which have accrued to Physical Astro-

nomy from Lagrange's Equations, and from Hamilton's Principle of Vary-

ing Action ; on the value of Complex Quantities, and the properties of
general Integrals, and of general theorems on integration for the Theories
of Electricity and Magnetism. The utility of such researches can in no
case be discounted, or even imagined beforehand who, for instance, would

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

have supposed that the Calculus of Forms or the Theory of Substitu-
tions would have thrown much light upon ordinary equations ; or that
Abelian Functions and Hyperelliptic Transcendents would have told us

anything about the properties of curves ; or that the Calculus of Opera-

tions would have helped us in any way towards the figure of the Earth ?
But upon such technical points I must not now dwell. If, however, as
26 eepoet-- 1878.

I hope, it has been sufficiently shown that any of these more extended
ideas enable us to combine together, and to deal with as one, properties
and processes which from the ordinary point of view present marked dis-
tinctions, then they will have justified their own existence ; and in using
them we shall not have been walking in a vain shadow, nor disquieting

our brains in vain.

     These extensions of mathematical ideas would, however, be over-
whelming, if they were not compensated by some simplifications in the
processes actually employed. Of these aids to calculation I will men-
tion only two, viz., symmetry of form, and mechanical appliances ; or,

say, Mathematics as a Fine Art, and Mathematics as a Handicraft. And
first, as to symmetry of form. There are many passages of algebra in

which long processes of calculation at the outset seem unavoidable. Re-
sults are often obtained in the first instance through a tangled maze of

formulas, where at best we can just make sure of our process step by
step, without any general survey of the path which we have traversed,
and still less of that which we have to pursue. But almost within our
own generation a new method has been devised to clear this entangle-

ment. More correctly speaking, the method is not new, for it is inhe-

rent in the processes of algebra itself, and instances of it, unnoticed per-

haps or disregarded, are to be found cropping up throughout nearly all

mathematical treatises. By Lagrange, and to some extent also by Gauss,
among the older writers, the method of which I am speaking was recog-
nised as a principle ; but beside these perhaps no others can be named
until a period within our own recollection. The method consists in sym-

metry of expression. In algebraical formulas combinations of the quan-

tities entering therein occur and recur ; and by a suitable choice of these

quantities the various combinations may be rendered symmetrical, and

reduced to a few well-known types. This having been done, and one

such combination having been calculated, the remainder, together with

many of their results, can often be written down at once, without further

calculations, by simple permutations of the letters. Symmetrical expres-
sions, moreover, save as much time and trouble in reading as in writing.
Instead of wading laboriously through a series of expressions which,

although successively dependent, bear no outward resemblance to one

another, we may read off symmetrical formulas, of almost any length, at

Aa glance.  page of such formulae becomes a picture : known forms are

seen in definite groupings ; their relative positions, or perspective as it

may be called, their very light and shadow, convey their meaning almost
as much through the artistic faculty as through any conscious ratioci-
native process. Few principles have been more suggestive of extended
ideas or of new views and relations than that of which I am now speak-

ing. In order to pass from questions concerning plane figures to those

which appertain to space, from conditions having few degrees of freedom

ADDRESS.  ^7

--stricted problems we have in many cases merely to add lines and columns

to our array of letters or symbols already formed, and then read off

pictorially the extended theorems.

    Next as to mechanical appliances. Mr. Babbage, when speaking of

the difficulty of ensuring accuracy in the long numerical calculations of
theoretical astronomy, remarked that the science which in itself is the
most accurate and certain of all had, through these difficulties, become

inaccurate and uncertain in some of its results. And it was doubtless

some such consideration as this, coupled with his dislike of employing
skilled labour where unskilled would suffice, which led him to the inven-
tion of his calculating machines. The idea of substituting mechanical
for intellectual power has not lain dormant ; for beside the arith-
metical machines whose name is legion (from Napier's Bones, Earl

Stanhope's calculator, to Schultz and Thomas's machines now in actual

use) an invention has lately been designed for even a more difficult
task. Prof. James Thomson has in fact recently constructed a machine
which, by means of the mere friction of a disk, a cyUnder, and

a ball, is capable of effecting a variety of the complicated calcula-
tions which occur in the highest application of mathematics to

physical problems. By its aid it seems that an unskilled labourer

may, in a given time, perform the work of ten skilled arithmeticians.
The machine is applicable alike to the calculation of tidal, of mag-
netic, of meteorological, and perhaps also of all other periodic phe-
nomena. It will solve differential equations of the second and perhaps

of even higher orders. And through the same invention the problem

of finding the free motions of any number of mutually attracting particles,

unrestricted by any of the approximate suppositions required in the treat-
ment of the Lunar and Planetary Theories, is reduced to the simple

process of turning a handle.

    When Faraday had completed the experimental part of a physical

problem, and desired that it should thenceforward be treated mathemati-

cally, he used irreverently to say, "Hand it over to the calculators." But

truth is ever stranger than fiction ; and if he had lived until our day, he

might with perfect propriety have said, " Hand it over to the machine."
    Had time permitted, the foregoing topics would have led me to point

out that the mathematician, although concerned only with abstractions,

uses many of the same methods of research as are employed in other

sciences, and in the arts, such as observation, experiment, induction,
imagination. But this is the less necessary because the subject has
been already handled very ably, although with greater brevity than might
have been wished, by Professor Sylvester in his address to Section A.

at our meeting at Exeter.

    In an exhaustive treatment of my subject there would still remain a

question which in one sense lies at the bottom of all others, and which
through almost all time has had an attraction for reflective minds, viz.,
--28 report 1878.

what was the origin of mathematical ideas ? Are they to be regarded as

independent of, or dependent upon, experience ? The question has been

answered sometimes in one way and sometimes in another. But the

absence of any satisfactory conclusion may after all be understood as im-

plying that no answer is possible in the sense in which the question is put

or rather that there is no question at all in the matter, except as to the

history of actual facts. And, even if we distinguish, as we certainly

should, between the origin of ideas in the individual and their origin in a

nation or mankind, we should still come to the same conclusion. If we

take the case of the individual, all we can do is to give an account of our

own  experience ;  how we played with marbles and apples                                                                                                                                                                                how  we learnt
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

the multiplication table, fractions, and proportion : how Ave were after-

wards amused to find that common things conformed to the rules of

number ; and later still how we came to see that the same laws applied to
music and to mechanism, to astronomy, to .chemistry, and to many other

subjects. And then, on trying to analyse our own mental processes, we

find that mathematical ideas have been imbibed in precisely the same way

as all other ideas, viz., by learning, by experience, and by reflexion. The ap-

parent difference in the mode of first apprehending them and in their ulti-

mate cogency arises from the difference of the ideas themselves, from the pre-

ponderance of quantitative over qualitative considerations in mathematics,

from the notions of absolute equality and identity which they imply.

    If we turn to the other question, How did the world at large acquire
and improve its idea of number and of figures ? How can we span the

interval between the savage who counted only by the help of outward

objects, to whom 15 was " half the hands and both the feet," and Newton

or Laplace ? The answer is the history of mathematics and its successive

developments, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, &c. The first and greatest

step in all this was the transition from number in the concrete to number

in the abstract. This was the beginning not onlv of mathematics but of

all abstract thought. The reason and mode of it was the same as in the

individual. There was the same general influx of evidence, the same

unsought-for experimental proof, the same recognition of general laws

running through all manner of purposes and relations of life. No wonder

then if, under such circumstances, mathematics, like some other subjects

and perhaps with better excuse, came after a time to be clothed with

mysticism ; nor that, even in modern times, they should have been placed

upon an a priori basis, as in the philosophy of Kant. Number was no

soon found to be a principal common to many branches of knowledge that

it was readily assumed to be the key to all. It gave distinctness of

expression, if not clearness of thought, to ideas which were floating in the

untutored mind, and even suggested to it new conceptions. In " the one,"

"the all," "the many in one," (terms of purely arithmetic origin,) it gave

the earliest utterance to men's first crude notions about God and the

world. In " the equal," " the solid," " the straight," and " the crooked,"
                                                                                                        ADDRESS.                                                                                                                                                                       29

which still survive as figures of speech among ourselves, it supplied a voca-

bulary for the moral notions of mankind, and quickened them by <nvino-

them the power of expression. In this lies the great and enduring interest

in the fragments which remain to us of the Pythagorean philosophy.

     The consecutive processes of Mathematics led to the consecutive pro-

cesses of Logic ; but it was not until long after mankind had attained to

abstract ideas that they attained to any clear notion of their connexion

with one another. In process of time the leading ideas of Mathematics

became the leading ideas of Logic. The " one " and the " many " passed

into the " whole " and its " parts ; " and thence into the " universal " and

the "particular." The fallacies of Logic, such as the well-known puzzle

of Achilles and the tortoise, partake of the nature of both sciences.

And perhaps the conception of the infinite and the infinitesimal, as well
as of negation, may have been in early times transferred from Logic to
Mathematics. But the connexion of our ideas of number is probably

anterior to the connexion of any of our other ideas. And as a matter of

fact, geometry and arithmetic had already made considerable progress

when Aristotle invented the syllogism.

  --Genei'al ideas there were, beside those of mathematics true flashes of

genius which saw that there must be general laws "to which the universe

conforms, but which saw them only by occasional glimpses, and through

the distortion of imperfect knowledge ; and although the only records of

them now remaining are the inadequate representations of later writers

yet we must still remember that to the existence of such ideas is due not

only the conception but even the possibility of Physical Science. But

these general ideas were too wide in their grasp, and in early days at

least were connected to their subjects of application by links too shadowy,

to  be  thoroughly apprehended                                                                          by  most  minds                                      and                                                                                                     so  it  came  to  pass
                                                                                                                                                          ;

that one form of such an idea was taken as its only form, one application

of it as the idea itself ; and philosophy, unable to maintain itself at the-

level of ideas, fell back upon the abstractions of sense, and, by preference

upon those which were most ready to hand, namely, those of mathematics.

Plato's ideas relapsed into a doctrine of numbers                                                                                                                                                                                                                    mathematics into mys-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

ticism, into neo-Platonism, and the like. And so, through many lono-

ages, through good report and evil report, mathematics have always held

an unsought-for sway. It has happened to this science as to many other

subjects, that its warmest adherents have not always been its best friends.

Mathematics have often been brought into matters where their presence

has been of doubtful utility. If they have given precision to literary

style, that precision has sometimes been carried to excess, as in Spinoza

and  perhaps Descartes                                                                                  if they have tended to  clearness of expression in

philosophy, that very clearness has sometimes given an appearance of

finality not always true ; if they have contributed to definition in theology

that definiteness has often been fictitious, and has been attained at the

cost of spiritual meaning. And, coming to recent times, although we

 may admire the ingenuity displayed in the logical machines of Earl
 Stanhope and of Stanley Jevons, in the ' Formal Logic ' of De Morgan,
 and in the ' Calculus ' of Boole ; although as mathematicians we may feel

 satisfaction that these feats (the possibility of which was clear a priori)
 have been actually accomplished yet we must bear in mind that their

                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

 application is really confined to cases where the subject-matter is perfectly
 uniform in character, and that beyond this range they are liable to

 encumber rather than to assist thought.
      Not unconnected with this intimate association of ideas and their

expression is the fact that, whichever may have been cause, which-
 ever effect, or whether both may not in turn have acted as cause and

 effect, the culminating age of classic art was contemporaneous with the
 first great development of mathematical science. In an earlier part of
 this discourse I have alluded to the importance of mathematical precision
 recognised in the technique of art during the Cinquecento ; and I have

now time only to add that on looking still further back it would seem

that sculpture and painting, architecture and music, nay even poetry
itself, received a new, if not their first true, impulse at the period when
geometric form appeared fresh chiselled by the hand of the mathematician,
and when the first ideas of harmony and proportion rang joyously
together in the morning tide of art.

     Whether the views on which I have here insisted be in any way

novel, or whether they be merely such as from habit or from inclination
are usually kept out of sight, matters little. But whichever be the case,

they may still furnish a solvent of that rigid aversion which both Literature

and Art are too often inclined to maintain towards Science of all kinds.

It is a very old story that, to know one another better, to dwell upon,

similarities rather than upon diversities, are the first stages towards a
better understanding between two parties ; but in few cases has it a truer

application than in that here discussed. To recognise the common

growth of scientific and other instincts until the time of harvest is not
only conducive to a rich crop, but it is also a matter of prudence, lest in
trying to root up weeds from among the wheat, we should at the same

time root up that which is as valuable as wheat. When Pascal's father

had shut the door of his son's study to mathematics, and closeted him
with Latin and Greek, he found on his return that the walla were
teeming with formulae and figures, the more congenial product of the
boy's mind. Fortunately for the boy, and fortunately also for Science,
the mathematics were not torn up, but were suffered to grow together

with other subjects. And all said and done, the lad waa not the worse
scholar or man of letters in the end. But, truth to tell, considering the

severance which still subsists in education and during our early years
between Literature and Science, we can hardly wonder if when thrown
together in the afterwork of life they should meet as strangers ; or if the
severe garb, the curious implements, and the strange waives of the latter

should seem little attractive when contrasted with the light companion-

ship of the former. The day is yet young, and in the early dawn many

things look weird and fantastic which in fuller light prove to be familiar

and useful. The outcomings of Science, which at one time have been

deemed to be but stumbling-blocks scattered in the way, may ultimately

prove stepping stones which have been carefully laid to form a pathway

. over difficult places for the children of " sweetness and of light."

    The instances on which we have dwelt are only a few out of many in
which Mathematics may be found ruling and governing a variety of sub-

jects. It is as the supreme result of all experience, the framework in

which all the varied manifestations of nature have been set, that our

science has laid claim to be the arbiter of all knowledge. She does not

indeed contribute elements of fact, which must be sought elsewhere ; but
she sifts and regulates them : she proclaims the laws to which they must

conform if those elements are to issue in precise results. From the data

of a problem she can infallibly extract all possible consequences, whether

they be those first sought, or others not anticipated ; but she can introduce

nothing which was not latent in the original statement. Mathematics

cannot  tell  us  whether  there be or be not limits to time or space                                                                                                                                                                                  but to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

her they are both of indefinite extent, and this in a sense which neither

affirms nor denies that they are either infinite or finite. Mathematics

cannot tell us whether matter be continuous or discrete in its structure

but to her it is indifferent whether it be one or the other, and her conclu-

sions are independent of either particular hypothesis. Mathematics can

tell us nothing of the origin of matter, of its creation or its annihilation

she deals only with it in a state of existence ; but within that state its

modes of existence may vary from our most elementary conception to our

most complex experience. Mathematics can tell us nothing beyond the

problems which she specifically undertakes ; she will carry them to their

limit, but there she stops, and upon the great region beyond she is im-

perturbably silent.

Conterminous with space and coeval with time is the kino-dom of

Mathematics ;     within this range her dominion is supreme                                                                                                                                                                                         otherwise than

according to her order nothing can exist ; in contradiction to her laws

nothing takes place. On her mysterious scroll is to be found written for

those who can read it that which has been, that which is, and that which

is to come. Everything material which is the subject of knowledge has
number, order, or position ; and these are her first outlines for a sketch of
the universe. If our more feeble hands cannot follow out the details,
still her part has been drawn with an unerring pen, and her work cannot

be gainsaid. So wide is the range of mathematical science, so indefinitely

may it extend beyond our actual powers of manipulation, that at some
moments we are inclined to fall down with even more than reverence

before her majestic presence. But so strictly limited are her promises and
powers, about so much that we might wish to know does she offer no

information whatever, that at other moments we are fain to call her results
but a vain thing, and to reject them as a stone when we had asked for

bread. If one aspect of the subject encourages our hopes, so does the
other tend to chasten our desires ; and he is perhaps the wisest, and in

the long run the happiest among his fellows, who has learnt not only

this science, but also the larger lesson which it indirectly teaches,
namely, to temper our aspirations to that which is possible, to moderate
our desires to that which is attainable, to restrict our hopes to that of
which accomplishment, if not immediately practicable, is at least distinctly
within the range of conception. That which is at present beyond our ken

may, at some period and in some manner as yet unknown to us, fall within

our grasp ; but our science teaches us, while ever yearning with Goethe
for " Light, more light," to concentrate our attention upon that of which
our powers are capable, and contentedly to leave for future experience the

solution of problems to which we can at present say neither yea nor nay.

     It is within the region thus indicated that knowledge in the true sense
of the word is to be sought. Other modes of influence there are in society
and in individual life, other forms of energy beside that of intellect. There
is the potential energy of sympathy, the actual energy of work ; there are
the vicissitudes of life, the diversity of circumstance, health, and disease,
and all the perplexing issues, whether for good or for evil, of impulse and
of passion. But although the book of life cannot at present be read by
the light of Science alone nor the wayfarers be satisfied by the few loaves

of knowledge now in oar hands ; yet it would be difficult to overstate the
almost miraculous increase which may be produced by a liberal distribution
of what we already have, and by a restriction of our cravings within the

limits of possibility.

     In proportion as method is better than impulse, deliberate purpose than
erratic action, the clear glow of sunshine than irregular reflexion, and
definite utterances than an uncertain sound ; in proportion as knowledge
is better than surmise, proof than opinion ; in that proportion will the
mathematician value a discrimination between the certain and the uncer-
tain, and a just estimate of the issues which depend upon one motive
power or the other. While on the one hand he accords to his neighbours
full liberty to regard the unknown in whatever way they are led by the
noblest powers that they possess ; so on the other he claims an equal right
to draw a clear line of demarcation between that which is a matter of
knowledge, and that which is at all events something else, and to treat the
one category as fairly claiming our assent, the other as open to further

evidence. And yet, when he sees around him those whose aspirations are

so fair, whose impulses so strong, whose receptive faculties so sensitive, as
to o-ive objective reality to what is often but a reflex from themselves, or a

projected image of their own experience, he will be willing to admit that

there are influences which he cannot as yet either fathom or measure, but
whose operation he must recognise among the facts of our existence.

Page 6, line 10. It is worth while to compare the following passage from

Plato's ' Republic,' Book vii. (Jowett's translation)

"After plane geometry, we took solids in revolution instead of taking solids in

themselves ; whereas after the second dimension the third, which is concerned with

cubes and dimensions of depth, ought to have been followed.

" It is true,        Socrates                                    but these  subjects seem to be as yet hardly explored.

" Why, yes, T said, and for two reasons ; in the first place, no government patro-

nises them, which leads to a want of energy in the study of them, and they are

difficult ; in the second place, students cannot learn them unless they have a

teacher. But then a teacher is hardly to be found, and even if one could be found,

as matters now stand the students of these subjects, who are very conceited, would

not mind him ; that, however, would be otherwise if the whole state patronised

and honoured them, then they would listen, and there would be continuous and

earnest  search, and  discoveries                                would      be  made                          since  even  now,  disregarded  as

they are by the world, and maimed of their fair proportions, and although none of

their votaries can tell the use of them, still these studies force their way by their

natural charm, and very likely they may emerge into light."

which attaches itself to the expression for the " time " merely means that previous

to a certain epoch the conditions which gave rise to the phenomena were not those
of conduction, but those of some other action of heat. If, therefore, we desire to

comprise the phenomena of the earlier as well as of the later period in »ne problem

we must find some more general statement, viz., that of physical conditions which

at the critical epoch will issue in a case of conduction. I think that Prof. Clifford

has somewhere given a similar explanation.

THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Catalogue of the Oscillation-frequencies of Solar Rays ; drawn up under

   the superintendence of a Committee of the British Association, consist-

  ing of Dr. Huggins (Chairman), Dr. De La Rue, Mr. J. Norman
  Lockyer, Dr. J. Emerson Reynolds, Mr. Spottiswoode, Dr. W.

   Marshall Watts, and Mr. G. Johnstone Stoney (Reporter) *.

Eveey periodic disturbance of the ether which can be propagated through

it as an undulation may be represented mathematically by one or more

Aterms of the harmonic expansion known as Fourier's series.  single term

of this scries suffices to represent the undulation when the waves are of

--that simplest type which can be represented by a curve of sines the curve

which represents the small oscillations of a pendulum. Eut when the waves

are of a more complicated form, two or more terms, perhaps all the terms,

of the series must be retained in order to represent it ; and in such cases

the terms of the series which remain severally represent the simple sinusoid

or pendulous undulations, which, if made to coexist in the medium by being

piled on one another, would become identical with the actual complex undu-

lation which is present in it.

The non-periodic disturbances which traverse a medium are of two kinds

those which, like the clang of a bell, may be represented by a series consisting

of sinusoid terms with distinct periodic times, though in this case not

harmonically, or at least not all harmonically, related ; and those which can

be decomposed into sinusoid elements only under the condition that the

elementary undulations have periodic times which pass without hiatus into

one another.

  Now so long as light is propagated through what is called a vacuum, the

undulation, however complex, maintains its form unaltered at all distances

from the source of light ; for in vacuous spaces waves of different periods

advance at the same rate and directly forwards, and therefore the simple

component undulations which are represented by the several terms of a

  A* Map of Oscillation-frequencies is in preparation, and will be presented to the

British Association at the Meeting at Sheffield in 1879.
--38 report 1878.

sinusoid series accurately accompany each other throughout their whole

journey.

    But the event is different if the light encounters an optical agent which
acts differently on waves of different periods. Of this kind are the prisms
and diffraction-gratings of our spectroscopes. Here Nature herself effects
the decomposition which is indicated hy the theory. Waves of different
periods are compelled to travel in different directions, and thus the several
terms of the sinusoid series appear under the form of lines in the spectrum.
The wave-lengths corresponding to each position in the spectrum have been
determined with great care, and these when corrected for the dispersion of
the air are proportional to the corresponding periodic times, which thus

become known. Moreover, the intensities of the lines may be observed, and

will give the coefficients to be applied to the corresponding terms of the

sinusoid series. Hence by a discussion of the observations we may expect

to learn much with regard to the original disturbance caused by the source ot*
light. Non-periodic disturbances of the second class will be indicated by

continuous spectra, while the other two classes of disturbances will be dis-

tinguished by spectra which consist of separate rays : and a careful study of

the positions and intensities of the rays may give valuable information as to

the periodic time, and sometimes even as to the particular form of the original

disturbance.

Hence in the present state of science it is of importance to facilitate this

inquiry as much as possible ; and it is hoped that aid will be given to the

student of nature by the Table now published, in which the oscillation-

frequencies of the principal rays of the visible part of the solar spectrum

have been computed from Angstrom's admirable determinations of their

wave-lengths in air, combined with Ketteler's observations on the dispersion of

air. Such a table and its accompanying map afford the most assistance that

can be given towards the detection of harmonic relations ; for rays that are

harmonically related are therein represented in the simplest form that is

--practicable in the Table by an arithmetic series of the same type as the series

of natural numbers, where the common difference is equal to the first term

and in the Map by a series of equidistant lines.

While this theoretic advantage has been the guiding aim of the Committee,

Athey have also kept constantly in view the convenience of observers.  map

of Oscillation-frequencies offers peculiar facilities for this, as its red end is

                                                                                                                                 o

less extended when compared with its blue end than in Angstrom's map and

more extended than in Kirchhoft's. It thus delineates the spectrum with an

appearance intermediate between that of a diffraction spectrum and that of

a prismatic spectrum, and does not distort either spectrum too much for

practical use. It may thus be employed without inconvenience by observers

with either of the two great classes of spectroscope. The Committee are

accordingly occupied in preparing such a Map to accompany the Table.

   The Committee Qwere of opinion that it would prove a boon to observers to
have Kirchhoff's, Angstrom's, and the new numbers in reference to each ray

brought together in one horizontal line. Before this could be accomplished it

was necessary to make a systematic comparison of Angstrom's numbers and

maps with Kirchhoff's, and of both with the actual solar spectrum, in order

to identify the rays wherever practicable.
   The Committee therefore felt that it was desirable that this work should be

undertaken ; and it has been satisfactorily accomplished by Charles E. Burton,

Esq., B.A., F.R.A.S., who has made all observations and computations required
by the Committee. He has, moreover, inserted (in brackets) in column 2 the
                  OSCILLATIOX-FREQUENCIES OF SOLAR RAYS.          39

                                                                                                                                                                                o

wave-lengths of those rays of KirchhofFs list which are not found in Ang-
strom's, wherever it appeared Opossiblc to make the interpolation with safety.

   The small corrections which Angstrom indicates at p. 29 of his memoir ('Le

Spectre Normal du Soleil ') have been applied to his numbers before insert-

ing them in column 2. Accordingly the numbers of this column which are

not in brackets represent Angstrom's work in its finished state.

   In column 6 the intensities and widths which Kirchhoff assigns to rays

Abetween and G have been reproduced ; and Mr. Burton has continued

                                                                                                              o

these determinations to all the rays recorded by Angstrom between G and U,

so that they now cover the whole spectrum from A to H. Before entering on

this work Mr. Burton prepared himself by a revision of portions of the spec-

trum which Kirchhoff had delineated, so as to ensure that he should employ

KirchhofFs symbols in the same sense in which they had been used 1)y Kirch-
hoff and his assistant Hofmann.

   And in the last column Mr. Burton has thrown the solar rays into such

groups as appeared to him to be the most convenient to an observer. It will

probably be possible to improve this part of the work, if a second edition of the

Catalogue is called for.

· In columns 3 and 4 are given the steps by which the oscillation-frequencies

of the rays have been computed from their wave-lengths, in order that it may

be easy to revise the former if improvements are at any time made upon

 o

Angstrom's table of wave-lengths, or on the values for the refraction of air

which have been used.

The Map which the Committee arc engaged in preparing will bo a mere

chart, in which the intensities of the rays will be indicated by lines of diffe-

rent lengths. It does not appear to the Committee to be desirable that they

should attempt a finished drawing of the Solar Spectrum in the present state

of spectroscopic science, in which observers may hope soon to have in their

hands good photographs of every part of the visible spectrum. In order

meanwhile to supply as far as possible the place of a more finished map,

tables will be appended which will enable any one 'who possesses KirchhofTs

..                o

exquisite map or Angstrom's to place upon them the outlines of a scale of

oscillation-frequencies, so as to make these maps in a large degree available.

The Committee will feel obliged to any spectroscopists who are so good as

to send to G. Johnstone Stoney, 3 Palmerston Park, Dublin, such corrections of

the present tables as may occur to them, with a view to their insertion in

future editions.

Column 1 gives the position on the Arbitrary Scale attached to Kirchhoffs maps.

Column 2 reproduces the waye-lengths in tenth-metres as determined by Angstrom, after
          applying to the numbers of Angstrom's list the small corrections which lie indicates
         at p. 29 of his memoir, " Le Spectre Normal du Soleil." The wave-lengths of rays

          sufficient safety. The wave-lengths of this list are wave-lengths in air of 700 millims.
          pressure at Upsala and 10° C. temperature.

Column 3 contains the reciprocals of the numbers in column 2, each multiplied by 10".
         Each number in this column may accordingly be regarded either as the number of

           times that the corresponding wave-length-in-air goes into one millimetre, or as the

          number of complete oscillations in the time fir, where ft is the index of refraction

             of air for that ray.

Column 4 contains the correction for the dispersion of air of 760 millims. pressure and
          16° temperature, deduced from Ketteler's observations. (See ' Philosophical Maga-

             zine ' for 1866, vol. ii. p. 336.)

Column 5 gives the oscillation-frequency of each ray in the time r, the time that light
         takes to advance one millimetre in vacuo. Or the numbers of this column may be
          regarded as the numbers of waves per millimetre in vacuo.

Column 6 indicates the intensity and width of each ray between A and G, as determined

      G Hby Kirehhoff, and between and 2, as determined by Mr. Burton, 6 being the

          most intense and g being very wide, viz. about 0'15 of one degree of the scale of

              oscillation-frequencies.

Column 7 enumerates the substances which have been found to emit bright rays coincident
          with dark solar rays, and contains some other remarks.

Column 8. In the last column the rays are bracketed into the groups which strike the eye
          in looking at the spectrum, and to each group is assigned a number winch suffi-
           ciently indicates its position upon the standard scale.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Cayley, Dr. Fare,

   Mr. J. W. L. Gtlaisheb, Dr. Pole, Professor Fuller, Professor
   A. B. W. Kennedy, Professor Clifford, and Mr. C. W. Merri-
   field, appointed to consider the advisability and to estimate the
   expense of constructing Mr. Babbage's Analytical Machine, and of
   printing Tables by its means. Draivn up by Mr. Merrifield.

We desire in the first place to record our obligations to General Henry

Babbage for the frank and liberal manner in which he has assisted the
Committee, not only by placing at their disposal all the information with-
in his reach, but by exhibiting and explaining to them, at no small loss of
time and sacrifice of personal convenience, the machinery and papers left
by his father, the late Mr. Babbage. Without the valuable aid thus kindly
rendered to them by General Babbage it would have been simply impos-
sible for the Committee to have come to any definite conclusions, or to

present any useful report.

   We refer to the chapter in Mr. Babbage's ' Passages from the Life of a

Philosopher,' and to General Menabrea's paper, translated and annotated
by Lady Lovelace, in the third volume of Taylor's ' Scientific Memoirs,' for
a general description of the Analytical Engine.

I. The General Principles of Calculating Engines.

The application of arithmetic to calculating machines differs from or-

dinary clockwork, and from geometrical construction, in that it is essen-

tially discontinuous. In common clockwork, if two wheels are geared

together so as to have a velocity ratio of 10 to 1 (say), when the faster

wheel moves through the space of one tooth, the angular space moved

through by the slower wheels is one-tenth of a tooth. Now in a calcu-

lating machine, which is to work with actual figures and to print them,

Wethis is exactly what we don't want.                                                                       require the second wheel not to

move at all until it has to make a complete step, and then we require that

step to be taken all at once. The time can be very easily read from the

hands of a clock, and so can the gas consumption from an ordinary

counter ; but a moment's reflection will show what a mess any such ma-

chinery would make of an attempt at printing.

This necessity of jumping discontinuously from one figure to another

is the fundamental distinction between calculating and numbering machines

Aon the one hand, and millwork or clockwork on the other.                                                   parallel

distinction is found in pure mathematics, between the theory of numbers

on the one hand, and the doctrine of continuous variation, of which the

ADifferential Calculus is the type, on the other.                                                           calculating machine

may exist in either case. The common slide-rnle is, in fact, a very power-

ful calculating machine in which the continuous process is used, and the

planimeter is another.

Geometrical construction, being essentially continuous, would be quite

out of place in the calculating machine which has to print its results.

Linkwork also, for the same reason, is out of place as an auxiliary in any

form to the calculation. It may be of service in simplifying the construc-

tion of the machine                                                                                         but it must not enter into the work as an equivalent
                                                                                                         ;

for arithmetical computation.
ox babbage's ANALYTICAL MACHINE.  93

     The primary movement of calculating engines is the discontinuous

train, of which one form is sketched in the accompanying diagram (fig. 1) :

-- AB is the follower, an ordinary spur wheel with (say) 10 teeth ; is its

driver, and this has only a single tooth. With a suitable proportion of parts,

Athe single tooth of only moves B one interval for a whole revolution of

A; for it only gears with B by means of this single tooth. "When that is

A Bnot in gear, simply slips past the teeth of without moving the latter.

     All the other machinery of calculating engines leads up to and makes

use of this, or of some transformation of it, as its means of dealing with

units of whatever decimal rank, instead of allowing indefinite fractions of

units to appear in the result which has to be printed from.

Fig. 1.

     The primary operation of calculation is counting : the secondary opera-
tion is addition, with its counterpart, subtraction. The addition and sub-
traction are in reality effected by means of counting, which still remains
the primary operation ; but the necessity for economising labour and time
forces upon us devices for performing the counting processes in a summary
manner, and for allowing several of them to go on simultaneously in the
calculating engine. For, if we use simple counting as our only operation,
and suppose our engine set to 2312 (say), then, in order to add 3245 to it
by mere repetition, we have 3245 unit operations to perform, and this is
practically intolerable. If, however, we can separate the counting, so as
to count on units to units only, tens to tens only, hundreds to hundreds
only, and so forth, we shall only have

                          3 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 14

turns of the handle, as against 3245 turns. In general terms the number
of operations will be measured by the sum of the digits of the number,
instead of by the actual number itself. This is exactly analogous to what
we should do ourselves in ordinary arithmetic in working an addition
sum, if we had not learnt the addition table, but had to count on our
fingers in order to add. This statement of the work is, however, incom-
plete. In the first place the convenience of machinery obliges us to pro-
vide 10 steps for each figure, whatever it may be, and there must be an
arrangement by which the setting of the figure to be added shall cause a
wheel to gain ground by so many steps as the number indicates, and to
mark time without gaining ground for the other steps up to 10. Thus, in
adding 7 our driver must make a complete turn or 10 steps, equivalent to
1 step of the follower ; but only 7 of these steps of the driver must be

effective steps, the others being skipped steps. There are various devices

for this. One of the simplest and most direct is that used in Thomas's

addition of numbers. Taking account of all this, it follows that by
separating the counting on the whole into counting on figure by figure,

ZO* Let  (fig. 2) be a plate with ten ribs of different lengths, Aa, Bb, . . . . K7i

soldered on it. Let Mw. be a square axis on which the wheel N is made to slide by

the fork P. Then, supposing N to have teeth which can engage in the ribs Aa, Sec,

when the plate is pushed past the wheel N, the number of teeth through which the

wheel N, carrying with it the shaft Mm, is made to rotate, depends upon the number

of ribs in which it engages, and this depends upon how far along the axis N is made

Mmto slide by means of the fork P. If this fork is set opposite the line marked 3,

will turn through a space equivalent to 3 teeth. If a wheel, keyed to the shaft Mm,

be geared to other wheels, this enables us to add any digit to any number at a

single motion of the plate, by simply changing the position of P to suit the digit

required. This is the principle used in Thomas's arithmometre, only that there the

traversing plate is replaced by a rotating cylinder.

    t Suppose Aa, Bb, . . . . F/ (fig. 3) to be a series of racks passing hrough mor-
tices in a plate aw, and meeting a series of spur-wheels mounted loos<> n a shaft, so

that each wheel gears with one of the racks at the line pq, and that 11 the whole
series can be thrown in or out of gear together. Starting with them out of gear,

let the racks be drawn out through the plate <rz as indicated. Next throw the shaft

pq into gear, and then press a plate PQ against the ends of the racks, pushing them
back until the plates PQ and sez meet. Then each wheel aa jiq will turn through

the number of teeth corresponding to the original projection of the racks. In this

way, if the wheels on pq stood at any given number, say 543243, we should have
added 314236 to them, and they would then stand at the sum of these two numbers,

namely, 857479. This, it will be observed, makes no provision for carrying. PQ is

the number of separate steps is reduced from that expressed by the number
itself to eleven times the number of its digits ; that is to say, for example,
the addition of the number 73592 to any otber number is reduced from
73592 to 55 steps, and although of this latter some are slipped, there is
no gain of time thereby, except in so far as several of the steps may be
made simultaneously. The ordinary engines beat the human calculator

in respect of adding all the figures simultaneously ; but Mr. Babbage was
the first to devise a method of performing all the carrying simultaneously

too.

Mechanical invention has not yet gone bejond the reduction of the

distinct steps involved in the addition of a number consisting of n digits

Wnto less than  ;  practically, from the necessity of accompanying the

carrying with a warning step, rather more are required.

      In all the calculating machines at present known, including Mr.

Babbage's analytical engine, multiplication is really effected by repeated

addition. It is true that, by a multiplication of parts, more than one addi-

tion may be going on simultaneously                                                                                                                                                                                                     but it yet remains true, as a matter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

of mechanism, that the process is purely one of iterated addition.

      By means of reversing wheels or trains, subtraction is as easily and

directly performed as addition, and that without becoming in any degree

a tentative process. But it is important to observe that the process can

be made tentative, so as to give notice when a minuend is, or is about to

become, exhausted. This is the necessary preparation for division, which is

thus essentially a tentative process. That does not take it out of the power

of the machine, because the machine may be, and is, so devised as to accept

and act upon the notice. Nevertheless it is a step alieni generis from the

direct processes of addition, multiplication, and subtraction. It need hardly

be stated that the process of obtaining a quotient consists in counting the

number of subtractions employed, up to the machine giving notice of the
minuend being exhausted.

     Another essentially distinct train is involved in the decimal shift of the

unit, in all the four elementary rules. This is most simply and most
commonly effected by the sliding of an axis or frame longitudinally, after

the manner of a common sliding- scale or rule, so as to bring either the

figures, or the teeth which represent them, against those to which their
decimal places correspond, and to no others. In multiplication and divi-
sion, this means a shift for each step of the multiplication and division.

         II. Special Characteristics of Mr. Babbage's Analytical Engine.

  --1. The mill. The fundamental operation of Mr. Babbage's analytical

engine is simple additition. This and the other elementary rules of sub-
traction, multiplication, and division, and all combinations of these, are
performed in what is called " the mill." All the shifts which have to take
place, such as changing addition into subtraction by throwing a reversing
train into gear, or the shift of the decimal place, carrying and borrowing,
and so forth, are effected by a system of rotating cams acting upon or

the reducing bar. In practice the arrangement is usually circular, the bar PQ

revolving about an axis parallel to itself instead of sliding. If the numbers on the
wheels pq are placed one way we get addition ; if reversed, subtraction. Otherwise

we may reverse by introducing an additional set of wheels between the wheels^

and the racks.
    This is the bare principle, admitting of many transformations, and making, like

the other, no provision for carrying.
                     --

--96 report 1878.

actuated by bell-cranks, tangs, and otber similar devices commonly used

in shifting machinery, sometimes under the name of clutches or escape-

ments. These clutches and bell-cranks control the purely additive and

carrying processes effected in the additive trains described in the note to

§ I., and, being themselves suitably directed, secure that the proper processes

shall be performed upon the proper subject-matter of operation, and duly

--Arecorded, or used, as may be required.
2. The store.        series of columns, each containing a series of wheels,

constitutes the store. This store, which may be in three or more dimen-

sions, both receives the results of operations performed in the mill, and

serves as a store for the numbers which are to be used in the mill, whether

as original or as fresh subjects of operation in it. Each column in the

store corresponds to a definite number, to which it is set either automati-

cally or by hand, and the number of digits in this number is limited by

the number of wheels carried on the shaft of the column. The wheels

o-ear into a series of racks, which can be thrown into or out of gear by

--means of the cards.
     3. Variable cards. All the numbers which are the subject of operation

in the mill, whether they are the result of previous operations therein, or

new numbers to be operated upon for the first time, are introduced to it

in the form of Jacquard* cards, such as are used in weaving. One set of

wires or axes transfers the numbers on these cards to the subject of ope-

ration in the mill, exactly as similar cards direct which of the warp

threads are to be pushed up, and which down, in the Jacquard loom. The

--Amill itself punches such cards when required.
4. Operation cards.      different set of cards selects and prescribes the

sequence of operations. These act, not upon the number wheels of the

mill or store, but upon the cams and clutches which direct the gearing

+of these wheels and trains. Thus, in such an operation as (a b c) d,

we should require :

1st, 4 variable cards with the numbers a, b, c, d.
2nd, an operation card directing the machine to multiply a and b

    together.                                        p, as a fifth

=3rd, a record of the result, namely the product ab

    variable card.

4th, an operation card directing the addition of p and c.

5th, a record of the result, namely the sum p + c=q, as a 6th variable

   card,

6th, an operation card directing the machine to multiply ~q and d

    together.

7th, a record of the result, namely the product qd=p 2 , either printed

   as a final result or punched in a seventh variable card.

    * In a letter written by Mr. Babbage to Arago in December 1839, the following

explanation of the use of these cards is given. It probably conveys the idea in the
fewest words possible. It is only necessary to add that their twofold employment

embodies the separation of the symbols of operation from those of quantity. " You
are aware that the system of cards which Jacquard invented are the means by
which we can communicate to a very ordinary loom orders to weave any pattern
that may be desired. Availing myself of the same beautiful invention, I have by

similar means communicated to my calculating engine orders to calculate any

formula however complicated ; but I have also advanced one stage further, and I

have communicated through the same means orders to follow certain laws in the use

of those cards, and thus the calculating engine can solve any equations, eliminate

between any number of variables, and perform the highest operations of analysis."

                         III. Capability of the Engine.

     It has already been remarked that the direct work of the engine is a
combination and repetition of the processes of addition and subtraction.
But in leading up to any given datum by these combinations, there is no
difficulty in ascertaining tentatively when this datum is reached, or about
to be reached. This is strictly a tentative process, and it appears probable

that each such tentamen requires to be specially provided for, so as to be
duly noted in the subsequent operations of the machine. There is, how-

ever, no  necessary restriction to any particular  process, such as division
                                                                                                                                                                   ;

but any direct combination of arithmetic, such as the formation of a poly-

nomial, can be made to lead up to a given value in such a manner as to yield

the solution of 'the corresponding equation. In any such process, how-

ever, it is evident that there can be only (to choose a simile from mechanism)

one degree of freedom ; otherwise the problem would yield a locus, inde-

terminate alike in common arithmetic, and as regards the capabilities of

the machine. The possibility of several roots would be a difficulty of

exactly the same character as that which presents itself in Horner's solu-

tion of equations, and the same may be said of imaginary roots differing

but little from equality. These, however, are extreme cases, with which

it is usually possible to deal specially as they arise, and they need not be

considered as detracting materially from the value of the engine. Theo-

retically, the grasp of the engine appears to include the whole synthesis

of arithmetic, together with one degree of freedom tentatively. Its capa-

bility thus extends to any system of operations or equations which leads

to a single numerical result.

     It appears to have been primarily designed with the following general

--object in view to be coextensive with numerical synthesis and solution,

without any special adaptation to a particular class of work, such as we

see in the difference engine. It includes that a majori, and it can either

calculate any single result, or tabulate any consecutive series of results

just as well. But the absence of any speciality of adaptation is one of the

leading features of the design.

Mr. Babbage had also considered the indication of the passage through

infinity as well as through zero, and also the approach to imaginary roots.

For details upon these points we must refer to his ' Passages from the

Life of a Philosopher.'

          IV. Present state of the Design.

The only part of the analytical engine which has yet been put together

is a small portion of " the mill," sufficient to show the methods of addition

and subtraction, and of what Mr. Babbage called his " anticipating car-

riage." It is understood that General Babbage will (independently of

this report) publish a full account of this method. No further mention

of it will therefore be made here,

   A small portion of the work is in gun-metal wheels and cranks,

mounted for the most part on steel shafts. But the greater part of the

wheels are in a sort of pewter hardened with zinc. This was adopted from

motives of economy. They are for the most part not cast, but moulded

by pressure, and the moulds of most of them are in existence.

    A large number of drawings of the machinery are also in existence. It

is supposed that these are complete to the extent of giving an account of

1878.                            h
98 bepoet-- 1878.

every particular movement essential to the design of the engine ; but, for
the most part, they are not working drawings, that is to say, they are not

drawings suited to be sent straight to the pattern or fitting shop, to be
rendered in metal. There are also drawings for the erection of the
engine, and there appears to be a complete set of descriptive notes of it in
Mr. Babbage's "mechanical notation." There remains, however, a great

deal to be done in the way of calculating quantities and proportions, and
in tbe preparation of working drawings, before any work could actually

be set in hand, even if the design be really complete. There is some doubt
on this point as the matter stands, and it certainly would be unsafe to rely
upon the design being really complete, until the working drawings had been
got out. Mechanical engineers are well aware that no complex design

can be trusted without this test, at least.
     It was Mr. Babbage's rule, in designing mechanism, in the first place

to work to his object, in utter disregard of any questions of complexity.
This is a good rule in all devising of methods, whether analytical,
mechanical, or administrative. But it leaves in doubt, until the design
finally leaves the inventor's hands in a finished state, whether it really
represents what is meant to be rendered in metal, or whether it is simply

a provisional solution, to be afterwards simplified.

V. Provable Cost.

       It has not been possible for us to form any exact conclusion as to the

· cost. Nevertheless there are some data in existence which appear to fix

  a lower limit to the cost. Mr. Babbage, in his published papers, talks of
  having 1,000 columns of wheels, each containing 50 distinct wheels ; this

  apparently refers to his store. Besides the many thousand moulded

  pewter wheels for these, and the axes on which they are mounted, there
  is the mill, also consisting of a series of columns of wheels and of a vast

  machinery of cams, clutches, and cranks for their control and connection,
 so as to bring them within the directing power of the Jacqnard systems
  of variable cards and operation cards. Without attempting any exact

  estimate, we may say that it would surprise us very much if it were found

  possible to obtain tenders for less than 10,000L, while it would pretty

  certainly cost a considerable sum to put the design in a fit state for

  obtaining tenders. On the other hand, it would not surprise us if the cost

  were to reach three or four times the amount above suggested.
        It is understood that towards the close of his life Mr. Babbage had

   contemplated carrying out the manufacture of the engine on a smaller
   scale, confining himself to 25 figures instead of 50, and to 200 columns
  instead of 1000 or more. This would of course reduce the amount of

  the metal- work proportionately, but we do not think that it would mate-
  rially reduce the charge which we anticipate for bringing the design into

  working order.

VI. Strength and Durability.

The questions of strength and durability had by no means escaped Mr.
Babbage's attention, and a great deal of his detail bears marks of having
been designed with especial reference to these two points That was
essential in a large amd complex engine with some thousands of wheels, all
requiring at some time or other, although not simultaneously, to be driven
by the means of one shaft. This necessarily throws a great deal ot
mampressure, and also a grv«*t deal of wear and tear, on the  driving shatt
                  on babbage's analytical machine.  99

Weand the gear immediately connected with it.  have no means of

knowing, in the present state of the design, to what extent Mr. Babbage

had sncceeded in redncing this, or whether he had always been successful

in arranging his cams and cranks so as to secure the best working angles,
and to avoid their being jammed at dead points or otherwise. Giving

him full credit for being quite aware of the importance of this, we cannot

but doubt whether the design was ever in a sufficiently forward state to

enable him, or any one else, to speak with certainty on this point. Several

of the existing calculating machines show signs of weakness in the

driving-pinions.

One of the movements apparently necessary to the tentative processes

of the engine is, when the spur-wheels on a given shaft have been brought

into certain definite positions depending on previous operations, to bring

up a sharp straight edge against them in a plane passing through the

axis of the shaft. This pushes some to right and others to left, according

to the position of the crown of the tooth relatively to the straight edge.

This operation is necessary to secure that the clearance of the different

parts of the machinery, whether originally provided in order to allow it
to work smoothly, or whether afterwards increased by working, shall not

introduce a numerical error into the result. The principle of this operation

is used generally throughout the analytical engine. Its consequent

effect, both in respect of the work which it throws upon the main driving

gear, and of the wear of the parts which it pushes, forms an important

element in considering the durability of the machine. This bar also

serves the purpose of locking part of the machine when required.

    On the other hand, it is to be remarked, that the use of springs has

been wholly discarded by Mr. Babbage, as directors of motion, although

he occasionally uses them for return motions.

                     VII. Probable utilization of the Analytical Engine.

     It has been already remarked that one of the main features of the
engine is, that its function is coextensive with numerical synthesis and
solution, and that there is an absence of any special adaptation. In thus
widening the sphere of its capability, it is made to diverge from the
general tendency of mechanical design, which is towards the selection and
particularization of the work to be performed, and the restriction of the
machinery to one particular cycle of operation, usually within close
numerical limits, as well as limited in kind. Nevertheless, modern
engineering practice finds ample room for " universal " drills, shaping
tools, and other machines having very general adjustments and appli-
cations. But it remains practically true that each step of freedom of
adjustment is also a step in diminution of special aptitude.

     While the analytical engine is capable of turning out a single result,
as the combination of a complex series of numbers and operations per-
formed upon them, it can also yield a series of such results in a consecutive
form, and thus give tabulated results. Only it is not restricted, as is the
difference engine, to the special method of tabulation by finite differences,
nor is tabulation its primary function or intention. If its actual capa-
bilities are found to realize the intentions of its inventor, it will tabulate
all functions which are within the reach of numerical synthesis, and those

direct inversions of it which are known under- the name of solutions. It

deals, however, with number, and not with analytical form.
                                                         h2
--100 REPORT 1878.

     Theoretically it might supersede the difference engine, a majori; but
for reasons already stated, the specialization of the difference engine
would probably give it an advantage over the more powerful engine,
when the work was specially suited to finite differences.

     There would remain much work, tabular and other, for which diffe-
rences are not very directly suited. Among these may be mentioned the

determination of heavy series of constants and of definite functions of
them, such as Bernoulli's numbers, 2a;-n, coefficients of various expan-

sions of functions, and inversions of known expansions, solutions of
simultaneous equations with large numerical coefficients and many

variables, including, as a particular, but important case, the practical
correction of observations by the method of least squares. If all sorts of
heavy work of this kind could be easily and quickly, as well as certainly,
done, by merely selecting or punching a few Jacquard cards and turning

a handle, not only much saving of labour would result, but much which is
now out of human possibility would be brought within easy reach.

     If intelligently directed and saved from wasteful use, such a machine-
might mark an era in the history of computation, as decided as the intro-
duction of logarithms in the seventeenth century did in trigonometrical
and astronomical arithmetic. Care might be required to guard against
misuse, especially against the imposition of Sisyphean tasks upon it by
influential sciolists. This, however, is no more than has happened in

the history of logarithms. Much work has been done with them which

could more easily have been done without them, and the old reproach is
probably true, that more work has been spent upon making tables than
lias been saved by their use. Yet, on the whole, there can be no reason-
able doubt that the first calculation of logarithmic tables was an expen-
diture of capital which has repaid itself over and over again. So-
probably would the analytical engine, whatever its cost, if we could be

assured of its success.

              VIII. Possible Modification of the Engine.

Without prejudging the general question referred to us as to the

advisability of completing Mr. Babbage's engine in the exact shape in

which it exists in the machinery and designs left by its inventor, it is

open to consideration whether some modification of it, to the sacrifice

of some portion of its generality, would not reduce the cost, and simplify

the machinery, so as to bring it within the range of both commercial and

mechanical certainty. The "mill,"'for example, is an exceedingly good

mechanical arrangement for the operations of addition and subtraction,

and with a slight modification, with or without store-columns, for multi-

Weplication.  have already called attention to the imperfection of the

existing machines, which show weakness and occasional uncertainty. It

is at least worth consideration whether a portion of the analytical engine

might not thus be advantageously specialized, so as to furnish a better

multiplying machine than we at present possess. This, we have reason

to believe, is a great desideratum both in public and private offices, as

well as in aid of mathematical calculators.

Another important desideratum to which the machine might be

adapted, without the introduction of any tentative processes (out of

which the complications of the machinery chiefly arise) is the solution of

simultaneous equations containing many variables. This would include
                on babbage's analytical machine.                      101

a large part of the calculations involved in the practical application of

the method of least squares. The solution of such equations can always

be expressed as the quotient of two determinants, and the obtaining

this quotient is a final operation, which may be left to the operator to

perform by ordinary arithmetic, or which may be the subject of a separate

piece of machinery, so that the more direct work of forming the deter-

minant, which is a mere combination of the three direct operations of

addition, subtraction, and multiplication, may be entirely freed from the

tentative process of division, which would thus be prevented from compli-

cating the direct machinery. In the absence of a special engine for the

purpose, the solution of large sets of simultaneous equations is a most

laboi'ious task, and a very expensive pi-ocess indeed, when it has to be

paid for, in the cases in which the result is imperatively needed. An engine

that would do this work at moderate cost would place a new and most

valuable computing power at the disposal of analysts and physicists.

Other special modifications of the engine might also find a fair field

Wefor reproductive employment.  do not think it necessary to go into

these questions at any great length, because they involve a departure, in

the way of restriction and specialization, from Mr. Babbage's idea, of

which generality was the« leading feature. Nevertheless, we think that
we should be guilty of an omission, if we were to fail to suggest them for

consideration.

                     IX. General Conclusions, and Recommendation.

    We1. are of opinion that the labours of Mr. Babbage, firstly on his

Difference Engine, and secondly on his Analytical Engine, are a marvel

of mechanical ingenuity and resource.

    We2. entertain no doubt as to the utility of such an engine as was

in his contemplation when he undertook the invention of his analytical

engine, supposing it to be successfully constructed and maintained in

efficiency.

    WeS. do not consider that the possibilities of its misuse are any

serious drawback to its use or value.

    4. Apart from the question of its saving labour in operations now
possible, we think the existence of such an instrument would place within
reach much which, if not actually impossible, has been too close to the
limits of human skill and endurance to be practically available.

    We5. have come to the conclusion that in the present state of the

design of the engine it is not possible for us to form any reasonable
estimate of its cost, or of its strength and durability.

    We6. are also of opinion that, in the present state of the design,

it is not more than a theoretical possibility ; that is to say, we do not

consider it a certainty that it could be constructed and put together so as
to run smoothly and correctly, and to do the work expected of it.

    We7. think that there remains much detail to be worked out, and

possibly some further invention needed, hefore the design can be brought
into a state in which it would be possible to judge whether it would
really so work.

    We8. think that a further cost would have to be incurred in order

to bring the design to this stage, and that it is just possible that a
mechanical failure might cause this expenditure to be lost.

     9. While we are unable to frame any exact estimates, we have reason
--102 REPORT 1878.

to think that the cost of the engine, after the drawings are completed,
would be expressed in tens of thousands of pounds at least.

    We10. think there is even less possibility of forming an opinion as

to its strength and durability than as to its feasibility or cost.

    11. Having regard to all these considerations, we have come, not
without reluctance, to the conclusion, that we cannot advise the British
Association to take any steps, either by way of recommendation or other-

wise, to procure the construction of Mr. Babbage's Analytical Engine
and the printing tables by its means.

    We12. think it, however, a question for further consideration

whether some specialized modification of the engine might not be worth
construction, to serve as a simple multiplying machine, and another
modification of it arranged for the calculation of determinants, so as to

serve for the solution of simultaneous equations. This, however, inas-

much as it involves a departure from the general idea of the inventor, we

regard as lying outside the terms of reference, and therefore perhaps
rather for the consideration of Mr. Babbage's representatives than ours.

We accordingly confine ourselves to the mere mention of it by way of

suggestion.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Joule, Professor

     Sir W. Thomson, Professor Tait, Professor Balfour Stewart, and

     Professor Maxwell, appointed for the purpose of determining
      the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.

It will not be necessary to make a long report to the Association this

year. Dr. Joule has published a paper, giving in extetiso the experiments
summarized in the last two reports in the ' Philosophical Transactions of

the Boyal Society,' which was the medium of the publication of his former
paper in 1850. The new result, which confirms the old one, gives 772'55

foot-pounds as the equivalent at the sea level and the latitude of Green-
wich of the heat which can raise a pound of water, weighed in vacuo,
frcm 60° to 01° Fahr. of the mercurial thermometer, where the perma-
nent freezing point is called 32°, and the permanent boiling point of
water under a barometrical pressure of 30 inches of mercury raised to
G0° Fahr. is 212°. The work at present in hand is a more accurate
investigation of the true position of the freezing and boiling points of
the thermometers when cleared from the effects of the imperfect elasticity
of the glass of which they are constructed. The correction of the above

equivalent which may thus accrue is not expected to be of considerable

amount.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor G. Forbes, Pro-

   fessor Sir William Thomson, and Professor Everett, appointed

  for the purpose of making arrangements for the taking of cer-
   tain Observations in India, and Observations on Atmospheric

   Electricity at Madeira.

The Committee lias purchased three electrometers. These hare been

given, one to Surgeon-Major Johnson, in India ; the second to Mr. Michie

Smith, in India ; and the third to Dr. Grabham, in Madeira. Surgeon-

Major Johnson was engaged in the frontier war in  India                            and  Dr.  Grab-
                                                                                ;

ham has hitherto been too much occupied to make observations, while

Mr. Michie Smith has not yet had time to furnish any. So that up to the

present time no observations have been received. Tour Committee feel

confident of obtaining results from Mr. Smith, and hope also from the

other observers, but in the event cf their being unable to furnish regular

observations, your Committee would get the electrometers back and make

them available for other persons. They propose that the Committee

should be reajipomted.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir William

     Thomson, Professor Clerk Maxwell, Professor Tait, Dr. C. W.
     Siemens, Mr. F. J. Bramwell, Mr. W. Froude, and Mr. J. T.
     Bottomlet, for commencing Secular Experiments upon the
     Elasticity of Wires. Drawn up by J. T. Bottomlet.

The Committee have to report that the arrangements for suspending the
wires for secular experiments on elasticity are now complete ; and that
within the last few days two wires, one of palladium, and the other of

platinum, have been suspended in their places.

    An iron tube has been erected in one of the rooms in the tower of

the University buildings in Glasgow. It is 60 feet long, 9 inches wide,
and 4^ inches deep from face to back. It is of rectangular section, in
lengths of 6 feet ; and it is supported by being firmly attached to the
heavy outer stone wall of the tower.

     At the top of the tube there is a heavy gun-metal plate, which is sup-
ported independently of the iron tube ; and from this plate the wires
under examination are to be suspended, as well as additional wires to be
used for carrying additional comparison marks. With this arrangement

no yielding of the supporting plate that may take place will introduce

errors into the results of measurement of the lengths of the wires ; for
the point of support of the wire carrying comparison marks will expe-
rience the same amount of lowering, due to the yielding, as is experienced
by the wire to be measured against these marks. The gun-metal plate
has been pierced with three rows of holes through which the wires are
to pass. The holes are trumpeted at each end so as to avoid sharp con-
tact with the wires, and the rows are arranged so that the wires shall

hang down in planes parallel to the face of the tube. It has not yet
been decided what is the best way of fixing the upper ends of the
--104 BEPOET 1878.

wires above the gun-metal plate, or of attaching the weights to their

lower ends. No thoroughly satisfactory mode of attachment has yet

been found. In the course of experiments which have been carried on

at Glasgow on the breaking weight, and the Young's modulus of elasticity

of the gold, platinum, and palladium wires, which it is intended shall be

first suspended for examination, several modes of suspension have been

tried                        but it has  not  been found possible to  make  sure  of  avoiding very
                          ;

considerable weakening of the wire at the points of attachment at the ends.

At the bottom of the iron tube there is a window of plate glass

through which the lower parts of the wires can be viewed, and the

window can be drawn up so as to allow of the lower parts of the wires

being reached.

In front of the window a strong gun-metal table is set up. It is sup-

ported, independently of the iron tube and of the floor of the room, on

iron brackets fixed to the stone wall of the chamber, and is very carefully

levelled. On this table a cathetometer is carried, by means of which

marks on the wires are to be observed. The cathetometer moves on the

table parallel to the planes of the rows of wires. It has the two back

feet of the triangular sole-plate on which it is supported movable in a
V-groove cut in the table, the third foot resting on the plane upper sur-

face. There is also a slot cut in the table through which a screw passes
up from below to the sole-plate of the cathetometer, and by means of this
screw the cathetometer can be clamped in any required place.

     The cathetometer is a small instrument which has been constructed
by Mr. James White, of Glasgow, for the purpose of these experiments.
The main pillar is 1 foot high. It is supported on a 3ole-plate having

three levelling screws. The telescope or microscope, having cross fibres,

is raised or lowered on this pillar on a proper geometrical slide, and has

also a lifting screw in connection with a vernier for giving fine adjust-

ment. The vertical pillar is carefully graduated ; and by means of this
scale the differences of levels of proper marks put upon the wires are

to be determined.

     The arrangements have only been completed within the last few days.
They require to be carefully tested in several points, and particularly the

cathetometer requires careful examination. There is every reason, how-

ever, to expect that the work will turn out quite satisfactory. As soon
as possible the work of testing will be completed and wires suspended,
measured, and marked.

     During the past year experiments in connection with this investiga-
tion have been carried on in the laboratory of the University of Glasgow,
on the breaking-weights and elastic properties of various wires. In the

first place the breaking-weights and the Young's modulus, or modulus of

elasticity for longitudinal pull, have been determined for the gold, pla-

tinum, and palladium wires, with which it is proposed that the secular

Aexperiments on elasticity shall commence.                            large number of experi-

ments on the effect of stress, maintained for a considerable time, in alter-

ing the breaking weight and the extension under increased stress of

various wires, have been carried on. Soft iron wire, steel wire, and tin

wire in particular, have been experimented upon, and already some inte-

resting results have been obtained, showing that prolonged application of

stress certainly produces a noticeable effect.
.

ON THE CHEMISTRY OF SOME OF THE LESSER-KNOWN ALKALOIDS. 105

Report of the Committee on the Chemistry of some of the lesser-
   known Alkaloids, especially Veratria and Bebeerine ; the Com-

   mittee consisting of W. Chandler Roberts, F.R.S. (Sec), Dr. C.

   R. Alder Wright, and Mr. A. P. Luff.

The work at present completed has led to conclusions very diverse from
those arrived at by previous experimenters who have partially examined

the alkaloids contained in the seeds of Veratrum Sabaclilla (Asagroea

officinalis) ; in consequence, other species of the Veratrum family (such as
Veratrum album) are being investigated with a view to finding out how-

far the alkaloids therein contained are related to the bases found in V.
Sabaclilla. These investigations being at present incomplete, it would be
premature to report on them otherwise than in general terms. The same
remark applies to Bebeerine ; the experiments with this alkaloid having

at present led to little that is definite.

     Amongst other pharmaceutical and chemical researches on the alkaloids
of Veratrum Sabadilla may be briefly mentioned those of Pelletier and

Caventou, who isolated in 1819 an amorphous alkaloid or alkaloidal

mixture fusing  at  50°                   and  of  Couerbe, who,  in  1834, obtained  three
                                       ;

alkaloidal bodies, one of which was amorphous, but yielded a crystalline

sulphate ahd hydrochloride ; to this base he applied the term Veratrine.

The second base isolated was soluble in water, and crystallisable there-
from, and was termed by him Sabadilline ; whilst the third substance was
soluble in water, but non-crystallisable ; this was termed by Couerbe
Hydrate of Sabadilline. Later on, in 1855, Merck isolated from the
amorphous mixture sold under the name of " Yeratria " an alkaloid readily

crystallisable from alcohol, but forming salts quite uncrystallisable, the

aurochloride excepted. Notwithstanding that this base differed entirely

in properties from the Veratrine of Couerbe, Merck applied to it the same

name, "Veratrine," and ascribed to it the formula C 3 2H 52 N 2 8 . In 1871

Weigelin, working in Dragendorff's laboratory, obtained from V. Sabadilla

three alkaloidal substances, one of which was apparently the Veratrine of

Merck in an impure state ; whilst the other two were soluble in water,
and were termed respectively Sabadilline and Sabatrine. Within the

last year or two, Schmidt and Koppen have re-examined the so-called

"Veratria" of commerce, and have obtained from it and from Sabadilla

seeds direct a crystallisable base, fusing at 205°, and evidently identical

with the Veratrine of Merck. To this, however, they assign the formula,

H NOC 32 50 9 , somewhat different from Merck's formula, especially in the

nitrogen

On working up a quantity of crushed Sabadilla seeds by percolating

with alcohol acidulated with tartaric acid, evaporating to a small bulk,

adding water, filtering from resin, and extraction of alkaloids by adding

soda and shaking with large bulks of ether, we have obtained an alkaloidal

mixture from which, by further operations, there have been separated

three distinct alkaloids. As the process employed has been already

described at length ('Journal of the Chemical Society,' 1878), it is un-

necessary to repeat it here.

One of these alkaloids melted at 205°-206°, crystallised finely from

alcohol, formed a crystallised aurochloride, but no other crystalline salts,

and was evidently identical with the Veratrine of Merck. The second did

not crystallise itself, but formed a well- crystallised sulphate and hydro-
106 REPORT-- 1878.

chloride, and was apparently identical with the Veratrine of Couerhe. The

third neither crystallised nor yielded crystalline salts, but was sharply dis-

tinguished by its sparing solubility in ether. Nothing agreeing in properties

with the ' Sabadilline ' of Couerbe and of Weigelin could be found either in
the alkaloids extracted from the seeds, in a quantity of tbe alkaloidal mix-

ture sold commercially as " Veratria," or, finally, in a substance purchased

from Messrs. Burgoyne and Burbidges (Kablbaum's agents) as being Saba-

dilline itself ! This last substance consisted entirely of the third base

above mentioned, the only point of similarity between it and ' Sabadilline '

being very sparing solubility in ether.

     Each one of the three bases was saponified by alcoholic soda, the first
and third apparently forming the same acid product which has been
identified with the Methylcrotonic Acid of Frankland and Duppa, and

with the Gevadic Acid of Pelletier and Caventou ; the second bass yielded,

by similar treatment, Bimetlujlprotccateclmic Acid, identical with that

similarly obtained from pseudaconitine, and, as Korner has shown,

identical with that isolated by Merck from V. Sahadilla seeds, and

termed by him Veratric Acid. From these circumstances we propose

to assign to the three bases respectively the following names. The for-
mula? attached are those derived from our own analyses ; in the case of

the first base our numbers are practically identical with those of Merck

and of Schmidt and Koppen, Merck's nitrogen determination excepted.

exhibits a certain amount of similarity to the " Sabadilline " described by

Weigelin, and because it appears to form Cevadic acid on saponification.

The basic complementary products formed by saponification from these

three bases we propose to term respectively Gevuie, Verine, and Cevilline.
Cevine and Verine are non-crystalline, and much resemble one another.

    When Cevadic acid is heated with fusing potash, hydrogen is evolved,

and acetic and propionic acids formed. As Cevadic acid melts at 64°-65°,

its identity with the Methylcrotonic acid of Frankland and Duppa is

thereby demonstrated, this acid having been found to melt at 62° (F. and

D.) ; whilst Angelic acid, which also forms acetic and propionic acids by
fusion with potash, melts at 45°.

    When Cevadine is heated to 100° with excess of benzoic anhydride, it

forms a benzoylated derivative, Benzoyl Cevadine, in virtue of the reaction

       H H = H H HN0 +C32 49 9 (C 7 50) 2

   A large proportion of the alkaloidal mixture obtained from V. Saba-

dilla seeds, even with most careful working, so as to avoid as much as

possible alteration of alkaloids during extraction, refuses to crystallise

either as free base or as a salt. This has been considered by Weigelin and

by Schmidt and Koppen to indicate the existence of an isomeric amor-

phous modification of Cevadine (the Veratrine of Merck) ; another modi-

fication being also considered to exist, soluble in water, and obtainable

Wefrom this amorphous mixture by treatment with water.           find, however,

that the amorphous mass is simply a mixture of Cevadine and Veratrine,

the one base preventing the other from crystallising in the free state, and

the other preventing the sulphate, or other salt of the first, from crystal-

lising readily, and the crystallisability being further hindered by the

presence of more or less Cevine, Verine, &c, formed by partial spontaneous

saponification. This latter, too, is the cause of the partial solubility of

the amorphous mixture in water, the cevadates and veratrates formed by

the partial change being readily soluble in water.
     Doubtless the " Sabatrine " of "Weigelin was a mixture of saponification

and alteration products. Whether his Sabadilline was a definite precon-

tained principle or not we cannot say, not having been able to find it,

even in the preparation sold as being the body itself.

In pursuance of these results, we are investigating the alkaloids of

V. album roots. These have been already shown by Pelletier and

Caventou, Simon, Mitchell, and others, to contain at least two alkaloids,

one being nou-sternutatory, crystallisable from alcohol, and forming very

sparingly soluble salts with certain mineral acids, e.g., sulphuric acid
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

another being non-crystalline, but powerfully sternutatory. Since both

the Cevadine and Veratrine above described are powerfully provocative of

sneezing and tickling of the throat when inhaled as dust, it would seem

probable that the former alkaloid, Jervine (which has never been found in

V. Sabadilla seeds), is utterly distinct in its nature from the latter one.

Our experiments, at present far from complete, lead us to believe that

" Jervine " is not a single alkaloid, but a mixture of two or more closely

alike in many respects, and    quite    dissimilar    from  the  sternutatory  base  -

                                                                                     r

whilst the latter is a mixture of bases, of which one is, if not identical

with the Veratrine above described, closely allied to it, as on saponification

the mixture forms a small quantity of Veratric acid.

Report on the best Means for the Development of Light from

   Goal-Gas of different qualities, by a Committee consisting of
   Dr. William Wallace (Secretary), Professor Dittmar, and Mr.
   Thomas Wills, F.G.S., F.I.G.

                                                 Part I. Drawn up by Dr. Wallace.

The fact has long been recognised that the illumination afforded by the

combustion of coal-gas depends, to a large extent, upon the way in which it

is burned. Setting aside, for the present, all reference to the different

theories of Davy, Frankland, Heumann, and others, as to the source of the

illumination, whether from solid highly-heated particles of carbon or from

incandescent gases, the fact is patent that a given quantity of gas may be

burned under different conditions, so as to yield widely different illumi-

nating effects. For example, a gas made from bituminous coal gave, when

burned by Sugg's Improved London Argand at the rate of 5 cubic feet

per hour, the light of 14'81 candles. The same quantity burned by a

union jet at  -5 inch                            (water)       pressure                                       gave 11-46 candles                                                                                    and by a union
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

                                                                                                         ;

100, 77, and 25. Pattinson states that burners are in extensive use in

Newcastle which, for 5 cubic feet of gas, give a light equal to only 3£
candles, which gas, burned in a good Argand, gives for the same consump-

tion 17| candles, and in good union or fishtail burners 12±- candles.

In the case of cannel-gas, the variations are not so extensive"; but the

following illustrates the effect of pressure alone in influencing the light

obtained, the burners being of the same kind in each case, but with orifices

suited to deliver 5 cubic feet of gas at the different pressures : at i-inch pres-

sure a union jet of the best construction gave a light equal to 28~47 candles,

while at 1^-inch pressure the light from an equally good union jet was

21T4  candles                                    these  numbers                                       being   in the proportion of 100                                                                              to  74.  In
                                              ;

these instances the quantities of gas were the same (5 cubic feet per hour)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but if we take smaller quantities of gas, and calculate the results to

5 feet, the numbers obtained are still more startling. The following cases

are quoted from Wallace's paper on the " Economic Combustion of Coal-

Gas," * all the burners used being Bray's " adam as-tipped " union jets for
Acannel-gas.
                                                 No. at 1^-inch pressure burned 2 cubic feet per hour, and

gave a light of 35 candles, or for 5 cubic feet per hour, 88 candles a

No. 8 at 1-inch pressure burned 7T cubic feet per hour, and gave 45-4

candles, or for 5 cubic feet, 32 candles. Between ordinary working

limits of pressure and with equally good burners, we have, therefore, a

given quantity of gas (5 cubic feet per hour) giving, in the one case, 32

candles, and  in the other 8'8                                                                        or  in  the  proportion  of  100 to 27^.                                                                               The

loss of light here shown, amounting to 72^ per cent, of the whole, is ex-

ceededwhen still higher pressures are used,"and it is greater with common
Athan with cannel-gas.

cannel-gas with about twice its bulk of air. At a low pressure in an

Argand jet with large holes it gives a fairly luminous flame, while, at a

high pressure (3 or 4 inches), although the quantity of gas consumed is

three times as great, the flame is almost totally non-luminous, and has a

greenish tint. The gas, used somewhat extensively in the United States,

made by saturating air with petroleum spirit, requires to be burned at a>
pressure not exceeding '1 of an inch, which can be obtained only with an-
Argand with very large holes, or a batwing of peculiar construction,
called the " American Regulating Batwing." At ordinary pressures, such

as are used for coal-gas, there is scarcely any light, and the flame keeps
about a quarter of an inch or more above the burner.

     It is not only on the score of economy that it is desirable to burn gas-
in such a manner as to afford the greatest possible amount of light. The
burning of a moderate sized jet of gas produces as much carbonic an-
hydride as the breathing of two grown-up men, and as, in an ordinary
apartment, we have usually from three to six of these, the air becomes
vitiated with remarkable rapidity. It is therefore desirable, in relation to
health, to obtain the illumination we require with the least possible ex-
penditure of gas. The sulphur in gas is a very serious drawback to its
use. In burning it is, no doubt, converted chiefly, if not entirely, into

sulphurous anhydride ; but it is soon converted into sulphuric acid, which
attacks with avidity all the more readily destructible articles in the apart-
ment. So far back as forty years since the effects of the sulphuric acid

arising from the combustion of gas upon the binding of books and many
articles of furniture was noted, and recent experiments have shown that

leather, paper, &c, in ill-ventilated apartments exposed to the emanations
from burning gas for a series of years contain very large quantities of sul-
phuric acid. One of us has had occasion recently to investigate the action
of burning gas upon cotton goods stored in warehouses in London, Manches-
ter, and other cities and towns, and found that, in some cases, a few
months are sufficient to affect certain colours ; while within a year enough
sulphuric acid is absorbed to seriously injure the strength of the fabrics.

No doubt the true remedy for this evil is to ventilate the warehouses ; but

it is obvious that if the gas were burned in an advantageous manner, and
the quantity reduced to one-half or one-third, the damaging effects would

be proportionately lessened.

     There are several distinct qualities of gas in use in this country. The
best may be described as Scotch cannel-gas, as it is made only in Scot-
land, where the illuminating power varies from 2-1 to 30 standard for 5

cubic feet per hour, consumed in a union or fishtail jet ; the average may

be fairly stated as 26 candles. In London a cannel-gas is used in small
proportion, the illuminating power of which is about 23 candles ; and in
Liverpool, Manchester, Carlisle, and probably some other towns, an inter-
mediate gas is manufactured, the illuminating power of which is about 20
candles. The common gas in London and most other English and Irish
towns has an illuminating power of 14 to 16 candles. In the present
Report it is our intention to confine our investigations to two qualities of
gas, i.e., cannel-gas of 26 candles, and common gas of 16 candles illumi-
nating power. The photometric results in each case will be calculated
to these standards, although in the actual experiments the gas may have
been a little higher or lower in quality. In the case of cannel-gas the
standard is found by testing the gas by a union jet consuming 5 cubic
feet at a pressure of "5 of an inch ; while the common gas is tested by
Sugg's London Argand, consuming 5 cubic feet per hour at a pressure of
about - 05 of an inch. The best means at present known of burning each
quality of gas will be pointed out, and tabulated results will be given,

containing the details of the testings of the different kinds of burners
under varying conditions of pressure.

     The burners at present in nse may be divided into the four following

--classes : 1st, Cockspur or rattail ; 2nd, Union or fishtail ; 3rd, Bat-

wing ; 4th, Argand. Of each of these there are a number of modifica-

tions.

     The cockspur or rattail burner is the simplest possible form of gas

jet, and it was at one time the only one used for burning gas. It may
be made by simply drawing out a piece of glass tube and breaking off

the point so as to leave an orifice, having a diameter of 1 millimetre or
less ; but it is usually constructed of cast iron, which is drilled out as wide
as possible from the bottom, leaving only a thin shell, which is then bored

with a fine drill. Two sizes of these were tested, No. 1 having an orifice
of about -6, and No. 2 of about 75 millimetre. These jets are used in
Glasgow for lighting common stairs, and the larger size were formerly
employed for street lamps, but are now discarded in favour of union jets.

The following are the results with 26-candle gas :

--may also result from other causes such as a sharp bend in the gas supply

tube, a speck of dust in one of the orifices of the burner, or, in fact, any-

thing that disturbs the even and quiet flow of the gas. One singular

--example of this is the following : If a union jet is burning 5 cubic feet

of gas at 5- inch pressure, and a portion of the gas is led away by means

of a tube inserted a few inches below the flame, the flame, although

diminished in volume, immediately begins to blow.

In testing flat flames the custom has invariably been to present the

flat side to the disc of the photometer ; but although the results so ob-

tained are satisfactory in comparing one flat flame with another, they

cannot fairly be compared with rattail or Argand flames, which give an

equal light all round. The edge of a flat flame gives considerably less

light than the side, but the difference between the two depends very much

upon the richness of the gas, or, in other words, the opacity of the flame.

A flame of gas of low quality is so transparent that an ordinary news-

paper can be read through it ; but this cannot be done with a flame of

cannel gas except at the lower portion, which in any case offers scarcely

any obstruction to the passage s>f light. The following example may be
-- Agiven:
            union jet consuming 5 cubic feet of cannel-gas at '5 inch

pressure gave a light of 27 candles when tested in the ordinary manner

with the flat side towards the photometer disc, but the edge gave only

23 candles, and when rotated so as to give the flame in every position

the average result was, as nearly as possible, 26 candles, showing that the

ordinary test gave one candle too much, or nearly 4 per cent. In the case

of paraffin flat-flame lamps, the difference between the front of the flame

and the average all round varies from 4 to 10 per cent. In the latter case

the flame is intensely opaque and of a deep yellow colour. All the figures

given in this report refer to the flat side of the flame ; and this must be

borne in mind in comparing flat with round flames.

The following table gives the results obtained with Bray's union jets

without obstruction to retard the flow of the gas and reduce its pressure
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

result being obtained with about 1 cubic foot per bour, and the highest

with 5 cubic feet. This last result, i.e., 26 candles for 5 cubic feet of gas

per hour, burned in a union jet at 5- inch pressure, is taken as the
standard of comparison in all the experiments in cannel-gas. The ratio

of illuminating power to quantity is nearly the same at higher pressures,
and there is no difficulty in deducing the general law that the value in

illuminating effect per cubic foot of gas increases with the mass of the

flame.                                 ·

The effects of pressure are not less striking, and might have been

more so had the gas been tested at lower pressures than 5- inch and higher
than 1-5 inch. The results obtained with a jet consuming 5 cubic feet
per hour gave 26 candle3 at the low pressure and only 166 at 1*5 inch,

showing a loss'of lighting power amounting to about 36 per cent, ; 3 feet

per hour, calculated to 5 feet, gave at the low pressure 21 candles, at the

high pressure 123 candles; the burner being a No. 4 in the one case and
a No. 2 in the other. The medium pressure gave results intermediate
between these. At the higher pressures some of the larger-sized burners

became useless, as already explained.

As in practice it is found impossible to distribute gas at a pressure of

less than 12 or 15 tenths of an inch of water, various contrivances for

breaking the force of the gas have been invented. Among union jets of

this kind, the simplest, perhaps, is that of Leoni, consisting of a brass and

an iron tube which fit into one another, and between which a thin film of

cotton wool is placed. This is a very good burner, but it cannot be
depended upon for delivering exact quantities of gas. Bray has con-

structed a very good burner similar to those already mentioned, but

having a double ply of cotton cloth stretched across a metal ring placed
in the tube, in order to reduce the pressure. The same manufacturer has

more recently invented another burner in which the reduction of pressure

is attained by passing the gas through an orifice in a porcelain plate

--cemented into the lower part of the burner. He calls these special

burners, and they are of two kinds one intended for general use and the

other for street lamps, in which the orifices are somewhat smaller, and

in which, consequently, the pressure is further reduced. Morley's patent

burner is of brass and vase-shaped, with a porcelain top, and at the bottom

one or two small orifices in the metal for admitting the gas. Williamson's-

jet is similar in principle, but more complicated in construction. Da

Costa's burner consists of a hollow vase stuffed with iron turnings, into

which an ordinary iron union jet is screwed. There are others, but all

have the same object in view ; and the simpler and cheaper burners, such

as Bray's, accomplish it as successfully as those of more complicated con-
struction, and these have, therefore, been selected for a series of com-

parative trials, all being made with 26 candle gas. Some of the burners

referred to are called regulators, but this is a mere name, for it is obvious

that they merely obstruct the flow of the gas, the quantity delivered rising

as the pressure is increased. In Bray's special burners the two holes
forming the " union " jet are placed at an angle of about 120°.

Manchester and other towns in England, and which is an excellent burner

for gas not exceeding 20 candle power, but gives a somewhat smoky

flame with gas of high quality.

The only other batwing that requires further to be noticed is the

patent regulating batwing used in the United States of America, where

it was introduced in 1871, and which is practically the only flat flame

burner capable of burning advantageously the "air-gas" made by saturat-
ing air with the vapour of petroleum spirit. It consists of a very much

elongated iron batwing with an exceedingly narrow slit, surrounded by a

brass tube at the distance of about 2 millimetres ; into the space between

the two, gas is admitted by a wide orifice (the amount being regulated

by a screw) , and this gas ascends entirely without pressure, while the

force of the gas issuing from the narrow slit spreads it out into a fine

soft flame. This burner gives excellent results with gas of all qualities,

but its shape is not adapted to the gas fittings in use in this country, and

it has not been used here except for air-gas made for private houses.

Argand burners are exclusively used in the photometric testing of

common gas, and they are also employed rather extensively for lighting

shops and public buildings, but to a limited extent for private houses.

They give a higher photometric effect with common gas than any flat-

flame bui'ner known ; and even with cannel-gas, the best descriptions,

especially those of Sugg and Silber, give results which approach very near

to those obtained when the gas is tested at a comparatively low pressure

by large-sized fishtail or batwing burners.

The original form of Argand was a brass double cylinder with, above,

an iron ring perforated with small holes, and below, a " crutch " or forked

Atube, by which the gas was introduced at opposite sides.                                          wide and

short glass chimney was used, but this was afterwards modified in a variety

of ways with a view to making the current of air impinge more directly

upon the flame and so increase the intensity of combustion. The holes

being small, the  gas  escaped  at a comparatively  high                             pressure                                         and the
                                                                                                                                   ;

character of the flame both as to volume, shape, and luminosity, depended

partly upon the initial velocity with which the gas escaped from the

burner, and partly upon the shape and dimensions of the funnel. The

enlargement of the holes enabling the gas to escape at a moderate pressure

was proposed by the late Dr. Letheby, who was afterwards associated with

Mr. Sugg, by whom many improvements in Argand burners have been

introduced. The Letheby burner raised the apparent quality of London

gas from 12 to 14 candles, and a further increase of 2 candles was obtained

by Sugg's London Argand now generally accepted as the standard burner

for testing gas made from common coal. In this burner the principle is

recognised of permitting the gas to escape practically without pressure,

the shape and volume of the flame being determined by the narrow funnel

and a " cone " of thin metal which serves to throw the current of air into

close contact with the outside of the flame. The upper portion of the

burner is of steatite, and instead of the ordinary " crutch " below, the gas

Ais introduced by three very narrow tubes.          number of sizes of this

burner are made of which details are given below, but the following are

the various dimensions of the standard burner used in photometry :

Diameter of steatite top,  external,  '84 inch internal,                             - 47 inch  ;  number of
                                                                                  ;

holes, 24 ; diameter of holes '04 inch, chimney 6 x If inches, for gas of 14
6x2candles, and
                  for gas of 16 candles. The narrow funnel and the

cone restrict the quantity of air to very little more than is required to

barn the gas, thus avoiding the diminution of light which results from a

too rapid combustion of the gas, and the cooling effect of a large quantity

of air. The pressure of the gas inside the steatite top is considerably less

than -1 of an inch, and that required to pass 5 feet per hour through the

complete burner is about -2 of an inch.

In the burner introduced by Mr. A. M. Silber, the steatite top with

wide holes (about 1 millimetre or -04 inch) is also adopted, but the body

of the burner is considerably prolonged, and the so-called "cone" is long

Aand cylindrical with a curved top.      very essential feature in the Silber

Argand is an air tube introduced into the centre of the jet, which is said

to carry a portion of the air to the upper part of the name, and which

certainly has a remarkable effect in steadying it. The funnel is 7 or 8
x If inches, and in consequence of the form of the " cone " is kept so cool

at the bottom that it may be handled without difficulty while the flame is

burning. Funnels of 10 inches high are also used, but while the con-

sumption of gas is thereby increased, the illuminating power per cubic

foot of gas remains almost quite constant. Mr. Silber has recently dis-

covered the remarkable fact that a globe or vase placed below his Argand

increases the illuminating power considerably ; and his statement has been

verified both as to common and cannel gas, the increase with the former

being about a candle, and with the latter about 1| candle. The effect of

placing a vase below an ordinary union jet was also tried, but no increase

of light was obtained, while the flame showed a distinct tendency to

"blow." That the flame of the Argand should have its illuminating-

power increased 6 per cent, by passing the gas through a glass vase (or

·cylindrical metal bos, which answers the purpose equally well) is a phe-
nomenon which appears to be at present incapable of explanation.

     The following table gives the results of photometric tests of various
Argand burners with cannel-gas of 26 candles illuminating power. From

3 to 4 cubic feet of gas per hour was burned in each case, and the result

calculated to the usual standard of 5 feet per hour:

and the gas jets placed in position and accurately adjusted by the governor

to exactly two candles. Both meters were placed on the left side, and close

together, and were provided with three-way cocks, so that the gas could be

turned off or on each meter without disturbing the burning of the gas.
In making the test with the candles, these were carefully selected and

prepared, and after being lighted were allowed to burn for twenty minutes

before the test was proceeded with. The photometer room was large and

well ventilated, but absolutely free from sensible currents of air ; dia-
phragms covered with black velvet were placed in well-selected positions,
and all surfaces which by any possibility could reflect light were also

covered with the same material. After working for some hours the gas
was tested again in order to ascertain whether its quality remained con-

stant, and if it had changed sensibly the tests which had been made

were rejected.

Experiments were made in order to ascertain the loss of light result-

ing from the use of globes of different kinds and of various shapes. The

loss is always considerable and in many cases excessive, and it results

partly from the absorption of light from the material of the globe and

partly from the draught caused by the ascension of the heated air in the

confined space. As regards material, a piece of clear window-glass held

in front of a gas flame diminishes the light to the extent of about 10 per

cent., but in the case of a clear globe it is in some cases less owing to

the reflection from the surface farthest from the photometer. Globes

frosted or ground all over, technically known as " moons," absorb about

25 per cent, of the light when well shaped, and opal or " cornelian " globes

40 to 50 per cent., according to the thickness and quality of the glass.
The following results were obtained with globes of different sizes ground

all over, and shew the effect of increased draught in diminishing: the

light:-

                                               A 6-inch globe caused a loss of 25 per cent.

--All these globes had the usual sized opening below about If inches in

diameter. Experiments were made with clear 1\ inch globes, having

openings below varying from 2f inches to 1 inch in diameter. The
source of light was a Bronner batwing, No. 5 top, No. 4 bottom, burning

under a pressure of 1 inch 3*35 cubic feet of gas.

The naked flame gave a light of 16-8 caudles.

With the two larger sized openings the flame was perfectly steady,

with the 2 inch opening there was a slight flickering caused by the

sive with the 1 inch opening, making the flame practically useless as a

source of light. It is evident, therefore, that the openings of the globes

should be as wide as possible, and not less than 2i inches. The

cornelian globes used in Bronner's system of gas lighting have an open-

ing of 2| inches diameter, and Sugg has introduced globes of similar

material, which lie calls " albatrine," but with openings of 4^- inches

diameter. These globes are constructed of various sizes to suit certain

burners, both batwing and Argand, and the combinations are known by-

certain names, such as the Westminster, Viennese, Frankfort, Italienne,

Parisienne, &c. Some of these arrangements are fitted with Argands,

and some with batwings, and some have attached to them regulator's

with the intention of maintaining a constant pressure.

One of the difficulties connected with gas illumination is that the

pressure in the mains varies considerably in different parts of a town,

and at different hours of the day and night. One result is that a system

of lighting adapted for a part of a town situated in a low level will show

Ainferior results in a more elevated situation.                         rise of 10 feet gives,

roughly, a tenth of an inch of increase of pressure, so that it may easily
happen that in the same town or city the pressure in one place may be

1 inch, while in another it may be 2^ inches. Again, the pressure of the

gas as sent out from the gaswork is altered from time to time in accord-

ance with the consumption, and as public works, shops, &c, are suddenly

lit up or extinguished at certain hours, private consumers are annoyed in

the one case by a falling off in the amount of light, and in the other by

a flaring flame and hissing sound, both of which are very irritating. The

cure for these evils is to be found in the use of governors or regulators.

Every district of a town, the elevation of which is such as to affect appre-

ciably the pressure of the gas, should have a governor, which may either

be self-acting to maintain a constant pressure throughout the day, or to

vary sympathetically with the governor at the gasworks. Many of these

have been invented, among which may be mentioned those of Catheis,.

Peebles, and Eoulis. The pressure in the mains should not be reduced

below 12 or 14 tenths of an  inch                        but  as  over  that is  too high  a  pres-
                                                      ;

sure for the economical burning of gas, each house should have a regulator

in order to reduce the pressure constantly to about 7 or 8 tenths. Some

of these regulators are dependent on the action of the gas upon a broad

leather disc, attached to which is a ball-and-socket valve, while others

have metal or glass bells floating in mercury, and acting upon a valve of

the same kind. Both of these work satisfactorily. Among the best dry

regulators are those of Sugg of London, and Peebles of Edinburgh,

while probably the best mercurial governor is that of Busch of Oldham.

In the case of public works, and other buildings consisting of several floors,

a regulator should be placed in each floor, and one should be placed on

each street lamp, for which a special form is constructed. The best street

lamp regulators made in this country are those of Peebles and Sugg,

but a very admirable little instrument called a rheorneter is extensively

used in Paris, and has been tried with tolerably successful results in

several of our own cities. It is the invention of M. Gh-aud of Paris, and

it differs from the regulators which maintain a constant pressure in

delivering a constant volume of gas, with any size of burner, and under

any pressure, provided that the pressure is not less than 7 or 8 tenths of
an inch, and the burner is sufficiently large to pass the requisite quantity
of gas. The recently invented " needle governor " of Peebles is similar in

principle, and maintains a given volume of gas with remarkable constancy.

   --The Tortuous Gallery. When their Thirteenth Report was drawn, the

Committee were engaged in the exploration of a branch of the Cavern
opening out of the southern end of the " Bear's Den," to which, on
account of its form, they had given the name of the "Tortuous Gallery."
(See ' Report Brit. Assoc.,' 1877, p. 7.) This gallery divides itself into
two reaches and a small terminal chamber. The first or outermost reach

extends southwards from the Bear's Den about 23 feet, where it is suc-

ceeded by the second reach, which, after a course of 11 feet in an easterly
direction, reaches the terminal chamber. The reaches vary from 6 to 8
feet from the roof to the bottom of the excavation, and from 1'5 to 4'5

--feet in width the second or innermost being the narrower. The upper

 surface of the deposits they contained inclined inwards, falling 13 - 5 feet

in the 34 feet between the Bear's Den and the terminal chamber, or at a
mean gradient of 1 in 2'5. In the eastern wall of the first reach, about

 16 feet from its entrance or northern end, an opening leads to a consider-

able undervaulting, to be subsequently described; and near the junction

of the reaches a small recess extends southwards about 5 feet. At the
end of July 1877 the two reaches only had been explored. (See ' Report

Brit. Assoc.,' 1877, pp. 7-8.)

     On entering the terminal chamber, its floor was found to be a complete

pavement of blocks of limestone, some of them of considerable size.

Their removal disclosed an almost horizontal bed of the typical Breccia

-- --the most ancient deposit yet found in the cavern the thickness of

which was undetermined. It was excavated to the customary depth of
4 feet, but without reaching its base anywhere. The chamber measured
about 30 feet from north to south, from 7 to 13 feet from east to west,

Aand from 8 to 13 feet from the roof to the bottom of the excavation.

narrow gully extended towards S.S.B. from the southern end, but became

too contracted for a man to pass beyond 7 feet in that direction. The
roof of tbe chamber was much fretted, and had several vertical and

almost cylindrical cavities, about a foot in diameter as well as in height.

The walls were very angular, and presented everywhere so much the

appearance of fresh fracture as to suggest that the blocks of limestone

forming the floor, as already stated, had fallen from them in compara-

tively recent times.

     The only objects of interest found in the chamber were four pieces of
bone (Nos. 7093-5), which occurred at depths exceeding a foot, and a
lump of oxide of manganese (No. 7092) found in the third foot-level.

   The recess, near the junction of the two reaches, as mentioned pre-
viously, was in proportion to its capacity much more productive, as it
yielded four "finds" (Nos. 7096-9), including 12 teeth of bear and
sevferal pieces of bone. One of the finds (No. 7098) occurred in the
Crystalline Stalagmite, and the others in the Breccia, at depths exceeding

a foot.

     The exploration of the Tortuous Gallery was closed on October 30,1877,
after having occupied very nearly 5 months. It yielded a total of 23
" finds," of which 15 were described in the Thirteenth Report. The entire

--series, from first to last, included 26 teeth of bear several of them in

--pieces of jaws 1 tooth of horse, several bones and pieces of bone, 3

--bits of coarse friable black pottery, and a piece of black flint in all pro-

bability a "strike-light" of the present century. The relic of horse, as
well as the potsherds and the strike-light, was found on the surface,
and very near the Bear's Den.

   --The Undervault. On the completion of the Tortuous Gal.ery, the ex-

ploration of the branch thrown off towards the west, from its first reach,

as stated above, was at once undertaken. This has been called the

"Undervault," as it was probably the principal "undervaulting" men-
tioned by Mr. MacEnery in the following passage from his Cavern Re-

--searches (see 'Trans. Devon. Assoc.,' iii., 307-8): "In a narrow neck

which, on the right hand as you enter, issues from the Bear's Den, you
come to a naked floor of rock (see ' Report Brit. Assoc.,' 1877, p. 7) per-
forated with numerous shafts or spiracles by which you descend, by the

aid of hands and feet, as down a chimney, into a low space. They expand

into a low range of undervaultings. extending under the upper cave to a

considerable extent, but too low to be accessible to any extent. From the

first landing place there is a gradual descent, step by step, into a second

and even a third terrace, like so many stories. Broken flags of stalag-

-- --mite the debris of the successive formations were strewed about and

partially inserted in the latest crust now actually accumulating. In one
place the crust went bodily down entire with the loam it covered ; in
another it may be seen extending across in the form of a bridge ; in more

places it was shattered to pieces and reversed."
     The observations made by the superintendents of the present explora-

tion harmonise well with Mr. Mac Enery's description just quoted. The

deposit found in the Undervault must be regarded as an uncertain mix-
ture of cave-earth and breccia, probably washed confusedly together by
water descending rapidly, and at intervals, to the lower levels. The total
number of "finds" met with was 35, of which by far the greater num.
ber were not more than 2 feet below the surface. They included 47 teeth
of bear, 33 of hyaena, and 2 of fox, numerous bones and fragments of

bone, 1 chert flake, and the greater portion of a large quartzite pebble.

Many of the teeth, of both bear and hyaena, were in jaws or portions of

jaws.

     Amongst noteworthy specimens may be mentioned the right lower jaw

of a hyasna (No. 7101), which contains all the teeth with the exception of
two of the incisors, the outer and inner, and is almost perfect ; whereas
most of the jaws of the hyaenine deposits in Kent's Hole are more or

less mutilated, having lost the condyles, or the lower border, or both. It

was found within a foot of the surface, with 1 tooth of bear, a vertebra
of the same hue as the jaw, and several bone chips, on November 3, 1877.

     No. 7129, also a right lower jaw of hyaena, and a fine specimen, has
lost its condyles and all the incisors, but is otherwise perfect. The teeth,
however, have seen more service than those in the jaw described pre-

viously. It was found with 4 detached teeth of hyaena, and several
bones, in the second foot-level, on November 4, 1877.

     In striking contrast to the two foregoing specimens is a portion of a
left lower jaw of hyaena (No. 7131), which, whilst it retains all the molar
teeth, has lost its condyles and lower border, and is thus in a condition

much more characteristic of the Cavern. It was found, with a canine
tooth of fox and several bones, in the first foot-level on November 7,

1877.

The "find" No. 7234 included part of the left lower jaw of bear,

containing the  canine  and  2  molar teeth, and a detached tooth of                    bear
                                                                                                              ;

and was found in the second foot-level on December 11, 1877. This was

the last " find " met with in the Undervault.

The chert flake (No. 7102) is of a dark grey colour, has a pentagonal

outline, and was in all probability produced artificially. It was found,

with a canine tooth of fox and pieces of bone, in the first foot-level, on

November 3, 1877.

The fragment of a quartzite pebble mentioned above (No. 7119) is

more than half of a well-rounded ellipsoidal mass, weighing nearly 3 lbs.

avoir. It was met with in the second foot-level, without any object of

interest near it, on November   19,  1877                          and does  not  bear  any traces of
                                                                ;

having been used as a li hammer stone." The exploration of the Under-

vault ended on December 17, 1877.

--The Great Oven. The narrow branch of the Cavern connecting the

Cave of Inscriptions -with the Bear's Den, by passing from the southern

side of the former to the north-western corner of the Den, is known as

--the " Great Oven." It consists of three reaches the western, opening

out of the Cave of Inscriptions ; the central ; and the eastern, opening out
of the Bear's Den. They are all, and especially the central reach, very
contracted in both height and width. The western reach was explored in

1875 (see ' Report Brit. Assoc' for 1876, pp. 2-3), the central one does not
appear to have ever contained deposits of any kind, and the eastern

reach occupied the Committee from December 18, 1877, to February 15

1878.

At its junction with the Bear's Den, the eastern reach had a continuous

unfractured floor of stalagmite of great thickness, and, with the exception

of a thin upper layer, all belonging to the Crystalline or most ancient

variety ; whilst at the southern angle was a boss of the same material fully
5 feet high. Beneath this floor lay the deposit termed the Breccia but

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

at 6 feet from the entrance, and thence onward, Cave-earth presented itself
between the two stalagmites. At first it was found adjacent to the
northern wall only, and in a depression in the surface of the Crystalline

Stalagmite, but it soon extended itself from wall to wall, and for a few
feet the successive sections were in descending order.

1. Granular stalagmite, a few inches thick only.

2. Cave-earth, also but a few inches thick.

3. Crystalline stalagmite, from 2 to 3 feet thick.

4. Breccia, the base of which was nowhere reached.

     At about 10 feet from the entrance the lowest two deposits occupied so
narrow a slit that all attempts to excavate them were abandoned ; and from
that point to the inner end of the reach, the Granular Stalagmite varied
from 6 to 12 inches in thickness, and the Cave-earth from 6 to 24 inches.

     The length of this reach of the Great Oven was 34 feet, and its width
varied from 10 feet at the outer to 3 feet at the inner end. It may be
described as a narrow oblique slit in the limestone.

     It yielded a total of 29 "finds," 2 of them in the Granular or least

ancient Stalagmite, 16 in the Cave-earth, 2 in the Crystalline Stalagmite,

and 9 in the Breccia. The animal remains included 36 teeth of bear of

--which 20 were in the Cave-earth, 1 in the Crystalline Stalagmite, and 15 in

the Breccia 8 of hysena, and 3 of fox. The only relics found in the
Breccia were those or bear. The presence of the hyama was also attested
by a few coprolites in the Cave-earth.

The only noteworthy "find," perhaps, was No. 7138, which included

an almost perfect left lower jaw of hysena, 2 detached teeth of hyaena

5 teeth of bear ; a few bones, including a perfect left radius pieces of
                                                    ;
                              This " find " was met with in the first foot-
bone and a few coprolites.

   A total of 40 " finds " was met with in the two reaches of the Oven, in

1875 and 1878 together; 2 of them were in the Granular Stalagmite, 18 in

the Cave-earth, 2 in the Crystalline Stalagmite, and 18 in the Breccia. The

relics in the Cave-earth included 20 teeth of bear, 9 of hysena, and 3 of

fox, whilst those of the Crystalline Stalagmite and the Breccia included

25 teeth of bear.

    Nothing indicating the presence of man was detected in any part of

the Great Oven.

--The High Chamber. la their Eleventh Report (1875) the Committee

stated that on June 15, 1875, they commenced the exploration of a

" Recess," opening out of thenorth-west corner of the Cave of Inscriptions,

which it was expected would lead to a new external opening to the Cavern ;

that its floor, a sheet of Crystalline Stalagmite, abruptly truncated at the

junction of the recess and the Cave of Inscriptions, had been found, by

boring,  to  be  18  inches  thick                            that  this  floor                                                covered  and  rested  on  a

thick accumulation of Breccia, reaching a higher level than elsewhere in

the Cavern so far as was known ; that it had been intended to leave the

floor intact, and to burrow under it ; that at 10 feet from the entrance the

lateral walls were so very nearly together as to render it necessary to

abandon the work altogether, or to break up the floor so as to secure, at a

higher level, sufficient space for the operations of the excavators ; and that

the work had been reluctantly suspended on July 6, 1875, after no more

than three weeks had been spent on the recess. (See ' Report Brit. Assoc.,'

1875, p. 11.)

     The workmen, on completing the Great Oven, were directed to return to

the Recess just mentioned, and, in accordance with the conclusion arrived

at in 1875, as already stated, to break up the thick floor of stalagmite,
instead of attempting to burrow under it. From that time they have been
exclusively occupied there, and at the end of July, 1878, had advanced
upwards of 30 feet from the entrance, and reached a level of about 6 feet

above that of the adjacent Cave of Inscriptions. On account of this com-
paratively high level, the name of the " High Chamber" has been given

to the so-called Recess.

From the entrance up to 25 feet within it, there was a continuous un-

broken floor of stalagmite from 5 to 6 feet thick, with several large bosses

of the same material rising from it ; but everywhere beyond, so far as the

work has at present advanced, the floor consisted of large blocks of lime-

stone fallen from the roof, and extending almost from wall to wall, but

with stalagmite in some of the vertical spaces between them.

The stalagmitic floor consisted mainly of the more ancient, or Crystalline,

variety, covered with a thin sheet of the less ancient, or Granular, kind.

In most cases the two stalagmites lay one immediately on the other, but
a few instances of " pockets," occupied with some Cave-earth, were met

--with between them ; and the Breccia or, so far as is known, the most
--ancient deposit in the Cavern was found everywhere beneath, and in con-

tact with the Crystalline Stalagmite. Large fallen blocks of limestone

occurred abundantly in this lowest accumulation, many of them requiring

to be blasted  before  they  could                            be removed                                                       whilst several others, pene-
                                                                                                                            ;

trating into the deposit below the depth to which the excavation was

carried, were left undisturbed.

    From the time the work was resumed in the high chamber up to the
end of July, 1878, a total of 53 " finds " had been met with, of which 2

occurred in the Granular Stalagmite, 1 in the Cave-earth, and 50 in the

Breccia. Of those in the Granular Stalagmite (Nos. 7153 and 7170), the

former consisted of three specimens of black, perhaps charred, bone

whilst No. 7170 was the greater part of an ulna unfortunately broken by the

workman who extracted it. The " find " in the Cave-earth, No. 7193,

was a solitary molar tooth of a horse.
     The specimens yielded by the Breccia included 89 teeth of bear,

many of them in jaws or portions of jaws pieces of skulls, bones and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

pieces of bone, one flint nodule tool, two flint flakes, and a quartzite

pebble.

       ON THE EXPLORATION OF KENT'S CAVERN, DEVONSHIRE.           129

Several of the osseous remains are good specimens, but none of them

require detailed description.

     The flint implement (No. 7167) was found, without any object of

interest near it, on May 16, 1878, in the fourth or lowest foot-level. It
is about 31 inches long, 2 - 5 inches in greatest breadth, and 2'2 inches in

greatest thickness. It is rounded, but by no means smooth, at one end,
where the original surface of the nodule remains ; and is abruptly truncated
at the other, where its edge is smooth, almost a plane, and measures 1'6
inch by "5 inch. The prevalent colour is slightly pink, as is usual with

the Breccia implements ; but the truncated edge, already mentioned, is
almost white, and suggested that it was, perhaps, fractured by the

workman who extracted it. This, however, he asserts was not the case

and, from the frankness which has always characterised him, the assertion
is no doubt correct. The implement is very convex and irregular on each

face, whence several flakes have been dislodged. It possesses the rude,
massive, unsymmetrical characters which mark the Breccia series of tools.

    The flake (No. 7189) is not of much importance. In form it is not

unlike an elm leaf; and, though no doubt artificially dislodged from a

nodule, it was probably never intended to be used as a tool. It is 2'25
inches long, 1*5 inch in greatest breadth, and 4- inch in greatest thickness.

Its entire edge is thin, and it seems neither to have been used by man

nor to have undergone any natural abrasion. It was found in the third

.foot-level, without any object of interest very near it, on June 11, 1878.

The flake, or, perhaps, fragment of a tool (No. 7203), is 1*5 inch long,

1*2 inch in greatest breadth, and 6- inch in greatest thickness. It is

rudely triangular in form, obliquely truncated at the base where it is
broadest, convex on one face, and somewhat flat, but by no means plane

on the other. Several distinct facets occur on each face, and especially

on the convex one ; and its general appearance suggests that it is probably
a fragment of a larger tool. It was found alone in the third foot-level on

July 27, 1878 ; but at 2 feet higher level a portion of jaw of bear, con-
taining one tooth, with a few fragments of bone, were found vertically

above it the day before.

     The quartzite pebble, a rolled fragment of a larger one, is an oblique

semi-ellipsoid, measuring 33 X 2'2 x 2'2 inches, and, though of a form

and size suitable for a " hammer- stone," bears no marks of having been

utilised in any way. It was found alone in the fourth foot-level on July

29, 1878.

     It is, perhaps, worthy of remark that, whilst the Breccia in the High

Chamber has yielded fifty "finds," the "tools," which form three of them,

have never been found with any relic of an animal, and have, on the
whole, occupied a decidedly lower zone. Thus of the 46 osseous "finds "

31 occurred in the first or uppermost foot-level, 11 in the second, 3 in

the third, and 1 in the fourth or lowest, whilst the 3 flints have been

found only in the third and fourth foot-levels.

    It is difficult to understand how the tools found their way to a branch
of the Cavern so remote from the known entrances, and occupying so high

a level. The problem is apparently insoluble except on the hypothesis
that the workmen are approaching an entrance hitherto unknown ; and

as this supposition has been forced on the minds of the Superintendents

by other and independent facts, they believe it to be most desirable to

settle this question if possible, as they do not doubt that it would give a

definiteness to the explication of some of the Cavern phenomena,

130 REPORT-- 1878.

Report of Committee, consisting of Professor Harkness and Mr.
     William Jolly (H. M. Inspector of Schools), reappointed for

     the purpose of investigating the Fossils in the North-west High-

     lands of Scotland. By Mr. Jolly, Secretary.

At last year's meeting of the Association at Plymouth, the old Committee

was reappointed for the discovery of fossils in remote parts of the North-
west Highlands of Scotland. One of the most active members of the

Committee, and of this Association, the well-known Dr. James Bryce, who

had given special attention to the problem of the nature and succession of
the rocks of the North-west Highlands, and had frequently studied it on

the spot, has perished since last Report, in the prosecution of his favourite

science, at Inverfarigaig, near the Falls of Foyers, on the shores of Loch
Ness, a loss to science and to friendship.

     For several years the Committee have carried on diggings at various
points along the great limestone strike that runs from Durness and Loch
Eribol, near Cape "Wrath, to Loch Kishorn, opposite Skye. These were
made chiefly by various local parties resident in the district and interested
in the subject, by Dr. Bryce, and by the Secretary, whose official duties
as Inspector of Schools have given him unwonted opportunities for this
purpose. The fossils discovered were obtained almost entirely in the
Durness Limestone, an isolated basin on the Kyle of Durness, fourteen
miles east of Cape Wrath. The only other place where fossils have been
found in the limestone is at Inchnadamph, on Loch Assynt, in the west of
Sutherland. These consist of a single fragment of Orthoceratite, dis-
covered many years ago by the lynx-eyed Mr. Peach, and spoken of in
Sir Roderick Murchison's valuable paper on these rocks ; and another

piece, found by the Secretary, which may turn out to be organic, and

which is sent for examination to the present meeting of the Association.
     The purpose for which the Committee was originally appointed was to

obtain as many fossils as possible from this limestone and its associated
rocks, in order that a more decided determination of the kind and age of
the fossils might be made, than was possible when Mr. Salter wrote his
monograph on the few fragmentary specimens discovered by Mr. Peach in
the Durness limestone, and submitted to him for examination. The Com-

mittee, after working for some years, succeeded in obtaining a considerable
collection of fossils mostly from the same limestone. These were placed
under Dr. Bryce's care, and remained with him until his sudden death.
Unfortunately, however, on account of his unexpected decease, his collec-
tion of fossils was left in a more or less scattered and unmarked state, and
though careful search has been made in his house, the Durness specimens
have not yet been found. The Secretary has also corresponded with
several of his scientific friends on the subject, and with the Jermyn Street

Museum, with no better success. Mr. Ralph Tate, to whom it was known

Dr. Bryce purposed submitting them, is now in Australia, and could not

be communicated with in time for the present meeting. It is sincerely to
 be hoped that the loss of these fossils is not irretrievable, but that further
search will be successful. This will be made in all possible quarters, and
 the Secretary trusts to be able to report their discovery to the next meet-
ing of the Association.

      During the past year, through the good offices of several local friends,

particularly the Rev. W. C. M. Grant, the minister of Durness, who

has all along taken the most intelligent interest in the subject, and given
ON FOSSILS IN THE NORTH-WEST HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND. 131

the Committee ready and efficient assistance, a considerable collection of

fossils has been made, which are now submitted for inspection to the

present meeting. These were obtained from an isolated, steep, rocky islet,

called Garveilan, or the Rough Island, a few miles east of Cape Wrath.

This island is a bare uninhabited rock, the home of the sea-gull and his

associates, which is composed entirely of the Durness limestone. It is fall

of fossils, which appear protruding from the weathered surfaces of the

rock, the hard but less indurated matrix enclosing them having yielded to

the action of the wild weather and the wilder waves of that iron-bound

coast. The fossils are so imbedded in the crystalline limestone on the

level surfaces, that they can be abstracted only with the greatest difficulty.

Hence many of  those obtained  were  got  out  only in fragments                                                                                  but the
                                                                                                                                               ;

fossils sent, considering the whole circumstances, are numerous and in

singularly good condition. The specimens are mostly of the smaller kinds,

the larger not being now obtainable, or having been carried off on pre-

vious visits.

     The island is very difficult of access, and can be approached only in

the very calmest weather. On one occasion, the late Dr. Bryce and the

Secretary sailed, with some friends, to the island for the purpose of obtain-

ing fossils, but though the day was calm and the sea unbroken, the

great Atlantic swell sweeping round Cape Wrath, which rose against the

steep sides of the rock, entirely prevented landing, though anxiously

attempted ; and the Rev. Mr. Grant and party, in obtaining the fossils

now submitted, narrowly escaped with their lives, the great thunderstorm

of June last having overtaken them on their return voyage.

Mr. Grant has learned from the boatmen that accompanied him that

there is another place, on a cape on the mainland, near Durness, con-

taining good fossils. This he purposes visiting, if he has not already

done so ; but the Secretary has not yet received any fossils from the Dur-

ness limestone, besides those sent.

Some miles east of the Kyle of Durness lies the sea firth called Loch

Eribol, on the shores of which there is a great development of the same

or a similar limestone, with its associated quarzites and fucoid beds. These

rocks give to Loch Eribol its special character of wildness and picturesque-

ness. The limestone has been worked, for commercial purposes, at Heilim

Inn, on its east shore, where the ferry crosses the loch ; but, though diligent

search has been made on the spot, on many occasions, by members of the

Committee and by local and other parties, no fossil remains have yet

been discovered in that rock. In the thin, brown, shaly strata, called

the Fucoid Beds from their contents, very distinct and well-preserved

impressions of sea-plants are abundant on Loch Eribol, and along the

great limestone strike from north to south. In the thicker-bedded

Quartzite which occurs along this strike in immense masses, forming some

of the highest mountains, and giving rise to some of the most striking

scenery on the North-west coast of Scotland, with its pronounced features

of combined grandeur, mass, wildness, and beauty, the only evidences of

ancient life hitherto found are certain worm or annelid boi'ings, more

or less abundant everywhere, which are very distinct, having been, in most

cases, filled up with different-coloured matter. Both of these proofs

of organic life in the past have been spoken of and pictured, in the excellent

joint paper on these rocks by Sir R. Murchison and Professor Geikie.

During this year, however, a discovery has been made in this Quartzite,

in the shape of certain fossil remains which have not yet been described,

and which may turn out to be of importance. This was made by Mr. Donald
Mackay (innkeeper at Portnacon, or the Dog's Port, at the western side of

the ferry over Loch Eribol), an intelligent man, with sharp eyes, which he

has used to some purpose. On making his discovery, Mr. Mackay com-

municated with Professor Nicol of Aberdeen, whose valuable paper on
these controverted rocks represents one of the two great solutions of the
problem of these north-west strata, the other being Sir Roderick
Murchison's. Mr. Mackay also sent to Professor Nicol specimens of the

new fossils, which are now in his possession. Since finding these first

fossils, the discoverer has also succeeded in obtaining others, which he

has sent to the Secretary. Unfortunately, the Secretary, who writes the
present report in the Outer Hebrides, had to leave home on official duties

before the fossils arrived, and has, therefore, had no opportunity of

examining them. He has, however, forwarded them to the present
meeting for inspection, that they may speak for themselves, Mr. Mackay

reserving the ownership of the largest slab for himself. It would be well
to have these fossils carefully examined and reported on for the Associa-
tion, before returning them to their discoverer, in order to determine
their nature, and ascertain their bearing on the general problem of the
place and succession of the rocks of the North-west Highlands. The
specimens in Professor Nicol's possession should also be examined along

with them.
      In view of the present loss of the fossils once in Dr. Bryce's

possession, of the successful search for fossils now being carried on at
Garveilan and at the new point already mentioned near Cape Wrath, and
of the importance of the discovery of new fossils in the Quartzite of Loch

Eribol · it would be most desirable that the Committee should be con-
 tinued, with a grant at their disposal as hitherto, in order to prosecute
the search at Durness and Loch Eribol, and at other points along the
 great limestone strike. The fact that fossils have been discovered in Loch

 Assynt shows that diligent search maybe crowned with success, there and

 elsewhere in these interesting rocks.
      It is also most desirable that all the fossils discovered in these regions

 should be submitted to experts, in order that a full report may be obtained

 in regard to them, so as to have as correct and decided a determination
 of their character and age as is possible with the new discoveries placed
 at our disposal. The materials available for this purpose are these
 (1) The fossils from the Durness limestone reported on by Salter for Sir

 Roderick Murchison, and since deposited in the Jermyn Street Museum

 (2) those in the hands of the Committee, obtained from Durness, Loch
 Eribol, and Loch Assynt ; (3) those placed under Dr. Bryce's care, which

 it is hoped may yet be found ; (4) a suite of Durness fossils in the Museum

 of Aberdeen University, gathered for Professor Nicol, and those sent to

 him from Eribol by Mr. Mackay; (5) others that future search may

  reveal.

       Such a Report would sum up the labours of the Committee, and would,
  no doubt, be a valuable contribution to Scotch geology.

Fifth Report of a Committee, consisting of Professor A. S. Hebschel,
     M.A., F.R.A.S., and Gr. A. Leboub, F.G.S., on Experiments^ to
     determine the Thermal Conductivities of certain Rocks, showing

      especially the Geological Aspects of the Investigation. ,

The best means used for determining the thermal conductivities of sub-

stances are of two distinct descriptions, which may be denoted severally

as direct and indirect methods of procedure. In methods of the former
kind which were principally used by Peclet, and to which this Committee

has had recourse, the rate of passage of heat through the trial substance
is measured by the change of temperature of a standard body which it

leaves or enters, while the temperature of the trial substance itself is
practically free from alteration. In methods of the indirect kind the

measure of the quantity of heat which passes is given by changes of

temperature of the trial substance itself, and a knowledge of the thermal

capacity of the substance per unit of volume is therefore necessary for

their application. These latter methods commend themselves not only

by a larger choice of conditions most favourable for exact observation

which they offer, but also by the absence of any discontinuity in the
materials through which the passage of the heat takes place, and conse-

quently of any uncertainty about the area of surface which enters into

conducting contact where two solid bodies are placed or pressed together

as perfectly as possible. The Committee has indeed found that a film of

water wetting two such surfaces completely, and uniting them, renders

the whole of their areas effective in conducting heat without introducing

any sensible resistance, and fine wires of a thermopile lodged in this

water stratum measure the two extreme temperatures of a trial layer of

the substance to be tested with the greatest certainty and convenience

but the application of water to porous and to soluble bodies like chalk
and rock-salt gives for obvious reasons doubtful values of their conduc-

tivities, and only those bodies which resist, and which do not absorb

water can be tested accurately for thermal conductivity by those means.*

It has therefore appeared very desirable to the Committee, for the suc-

cessful use of processes in which the indirect method is adopted, to deter-

mine as exactly as possible the specific gravities and specific heats of the

series of rock-specimens now at their disposal ; and in the table presented

with this report the results of their observations of these quantities are

given of every plate which has hitherto been prepared for their examination.
The measurements have been made at their request by Mr. J. T. Dunn,f

whose name as a careful and active prosecutor of these investigations the

Committee desires, in the event of its reappointment for another year,
Ato add to the rather restricted number of its present members.
                                                                    brief

description of the process of these observations will explain the results

of the measurements obtained from them, the statements of which, in

a very abridged form, are presented in the table.

    * As a  means   of excluding water without breach     of   its  intimate contact with
                    rock surfaces, it has been suggested  to        Committee to " silver "
soluble or  porous                                            the

the plate-surfaces with mercury and tinfoil in the same manner that the face of a

plate-glass mirror is silvered ; and there appears every reason to expect that the coat-

ing of amalgam thus applied, while impervious to water would firmly attach itself to

and fill up quite solidly all the asperities of the surface ; but the actual efficacy of

this method for some of the very porous rocks has not yet been practically tested.

134 report--1878.

The mean diameter and thickness of each rock-plate was ascertained

by callipers applied with the help of a magnifying glass to a standard

steel scale of inches divided into tenths and fiftieths of an inch. The

volume was thus obtained in cubic inches with a probable error which

on account of the small thickness (about half an inch) and its occasional

unevenness, together with some irregularity, occasionally, in the diameter

of the nearly circular plates, it would be fair to reckon at between a half

and one per cent. The rock-plate was then weighed in its state of natural

dryness in the atmosphere,* and its specific gravity in the dry state was

then deduced by comparison with its water- weight, at 253 grains of water

(at maximum density) to a cubic inch. The plate was then heated fourteen

or fifteen minutes in boiling water, and quickly transferred to a well-

jacketed calorimeter containing (inclusive of its own water-equivalent of

1500 grains) a charge of 15,000 grains of cold water, in which, with the

assistance of an agitator (enclosing the indicating thermometer), it was

allowed to disengage its heat. The time taken by the plates to impart

to the water in the calorimeter its highest temperature varied considerably,

from two or three minutes with rock-salt to about twenty-five minutes

with pit-coal, with the different plates, and a rough control of the relative

conductivities of the various specimens, already previously determined,

presented itself accordingly during these immersions. The calorimeter

was freshly supplied with water a little colder than the room for each

experiment, and it was besides so thoroughly protected by coverings of

cork and vulcanised india rubber from outward influence that no correction

for heat-loss by radiation was required to be applied. The lumps of rock-

salt were thinly painted with wet oil-paint, folded in tin-foil similarly

painted inside, and thus rendered waterproof, and were heated (as were

also the plates of chalk, plaster of Paris, and two plates of brick) in a

well-jacketed steam space until they acquired its temperature, before im-

mersion in the calorimeter. The experiments with brick were conducted

to determine the proportion of boiling hot water which porous rocks

imbibe by steaming, and by boiling them before plunging into cold water,

as the heat conveyed by this water to the calorimeter must be known and

deducted before assigning to the dry rock its real specific heat.

     After removal from the cold water of the calorimeter each rock speci-

men was weighed, and being regarded as now perfectly saturated with

water, the specific gravity of the rock in its thoroughly wet state was

thence obtained, which is given with parentheses, for the porous rocks, in

Athe table.  slight gain of weight was almost always observable, but

where this did not amount to one-half per cent., the small amount of

porosity which it denotes is regarded as without influence in distinguish-

ing the properties of the wet from those of the dry rock, and only single

values of the specific gravities and specific heats of these rocks are noted

in the table. It is to be remarked that the percentage gain of weight of

the absorbed water must, in order to afford the porosity of the rock as

the percentage volume of pores or cavities which it contains, be multi-

plied by the specific gravity of the dry rock (which is the bulkiness which

water has in comparison with the rock), and the result will be the

    A* sensible proportion, perhaps 10 or 12 per cent, of the possible quantity of

water absorbable by a porous rock, adheres to it when left to find its own condition
of dryness in the open air ; and no experiments on rocks artificially dried and freed
from this hygroscopic moisture in a water-bath have been attempted, but the "dry"
state recorded in the table is the nearly constant condition which the rock naturally

assumes in the atmosphere of a well-ventilated room.
ON THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES OF CERTAIN ROCKS.  135

space which the absorbed water occupies in proportion, per cent., to
the whole volume of the rock, or the porosity as a fraction of that volume.

Some special deportment of the water in the rock-pores may, however,

sometimes interfere with such a calculation, so as not to allow the real
volume of the spaces open to its penetration to be thus determined. It
was thus observed that the addition of water to dry sand contracts, and
of water to dry clay expands its volume considerably, so that the per-
centage gain of specific gravity of these substances (dry sand and dry
clay) by water saturation, is not the same as their percentage weight of

imbibed or appropriated water. Two numbers are given for these sub-

stances in the column of percentage gain, the last of which, in brackets,

denotes the water added, while to obtain the first or the change of the

specific gravity, a new measure of the altered volume of the wet com-
pound material made by the mixture had to be obtained.

     The several experiments of heating brick plates in steam and boiling
water, without afterwards immersing them in cold water, showed that a
single such treatment impregnated the plate with about a half, or up-
wards, of the whole quantity of water which the plate finally absorbs by-
plunging it in cold water, and although the same experiments have
not yet been extended to other porous rocks, a provisional assumption is
adopted for them all, to calculate the specific heats, that the rocks which
sensibly absorbed water in the process were laden with one half of it at
the boiling temperature, when they were plunged into the calorimeter.

It is not possible to say if this allowance is too great or too small in any
given case, but any rectification which it requires cannot at least
exceed (positively or negatively) the adopted value itself, and the per-
centage change in the calculated specific heats, which a plus or minus
rectification to the whole extent of the adopted allowance would introduce,
is subjoined in the column of the table immediately following the specific
heats, wherever the capacity of absorption of a rock specimen was so
great as to render needful a distinction between its properties in the wet
and dry condition. If the allowance of one half of the final water- gain,
supposed to be introduced by boiling, is deficient, so that any fractional

increase, or positive rectification of it is actually required, the same frac-
tion of the percentage correction given in the table must be subtracted
from each of the specific heats recorded as the provisional observed values

in the table. If the allowance was in any case too great by a known

part or fraction of itself, and therefore required a negative rectification to
the extent of such a fraction, the same fraction of the percentage correction in
the table is to be added to the recorded values of all the different specific heats
to obtain their real values. The adopted allowance is probably very near
the truth for the slightly porous rocks (whose coefficient of absorption is
less than 6 per cent.), and no corrections of the specific heats given in
the table are required for these, nor for any of the perfectly compact and
solid kinds of rock in which no sensible signs of porosity and of water
absorption were observed. With the increa'se of porosity, however, the
assumed allowance probably requires an increasing addition of perhaps
nearly its full value for some of the most porous ones (as chalk and

plaster of Paris) ; but considering the smallness of the correction itself

in the rocks of small and moderate absorbing powers, a common rule of

adding half its value to the adopted allowance, and therefore of subtract-
ing half the percentage amount named in the table from the recorded
specific heats of all the porous rocks, is one whose results will certainly

not deviate far (it may be five or six per cent, in the most absorbent
                                                                                                                                          ;

rocks), from their real thermal capacities in the wet and dry states, by-
volume and by weight.

     Percentage corrections thus deducted from the specific heats by volume
of porous rocks in the table, must be added, however, (and vice versa) to

the value of the ratio - given in its last column. The specific heats of

dry and wet sand were found by enclosing them hermetically in a thin

flask, and are free from any such source of uncertainty as that described

while the amount of water present in the heated clay and in two speci-

mens of brick was known, and the real allowances having been made for

these, the specific heats assigned to them in the table need not be cor-

rected. The following examples of the correction when it seems to be

required will illustrate its use in other cases.

The average specific heat by volume of three specimens of Calton Hill

trap rock (taken from the escarpment of rock on the west side of the

Observatory)  is  052*                          the average   percentage limit of                                 correction              to this

= =0-016 X 0'52 £$ X '52 -009) and subtracting it from the provisional

value, the corrected specific heat by volume of the Calton Hill trap rock

is 0511 ; or 051 instead of - 52 as presented in the table. The average

value of the quantity - for the same specimens is O0060, in the Table, and

the rate of correction which this requires will be the same as that just

used (^o)) for the specific heat, but to be added instead of subtracted

from it, with the result O'OOBl instead of O0060 taken from the table. The

value of the same ratio calculated by Sir W. Thomson from the under-

ground thermometer observations was O00786 ; and adopting for this
rock's specific heat by volume the value - 524, which agrees very closely
with the value 0-511 here arrived at, he deduced a value of the thermal

conductivity of - 00415, rather higher than the mean, - 00312, of the values
here concluded by the application of the direct method of experiments.

     The average specific heat by volume of six specimens of Craigleith
sandstone, four of which are from the site of the thermometer borehole
which was established there f by Professor Forbes in the year 1837, is

* Two additional places of figures to which the observations and calculations

for the table originally extended are suppressed in this abridgment of its determi-

nations in order to present them together in an easily apprehended view, where it is

believed that very little material utility of the individual results is sacrificed by

rejecting the last two figures obtained by the reductions.

 ·* f" The quarry was visited on March 17th, 1878, under the direction of Mr. Wedder-
burn from Messrs. Adie & Sons, and of Mr. Wallace from the Edinburgh Eoyal Ob-

servatory, by Professor Herschel ; the foreman of the present tenant (Mr. Hunter, of

Newcastle) soon communicating the object of his search to the best possible authority

at the quarry, one of the oldest workmen there, Robert Buchanan, who assisted in

sinking the hole, and in depositing the thermometers in it in January, 1837. The

face of the quarry in that neighbourhood has not been altered, although the field

between it and the tenant's house of Craigleith-Hill, in which the hole was sunk to a

depth of 24 feet, was opened over nearly the whole area near the house to a depth of

about 20 feet to seek for " Liver rock " (the finest, stone of the quarry) in the imme-

dia e neighbourhood of the tenant's house. But the search was unavailing. Robert

Buchanan was Mr. Johnson's foreman when the ground was thus turned over and the

thermometers were taken up ; and he directed the excavations. He selected for Pro-

fessor Herschel from the face of the quarry near their site several specimens of the

rock coinciding as nearly as possible with the top and bottom beds of the sandstone,

.through which the thermometer hole must have passed. Four plates cut from these

specimens are named  T  1, 2, and               B  1,  2  in  the table                                           and two more plates of  ordinary

7j per cent., making a part of the whole quantity equal to 0029. Sub-
tracting this presumptive correction from the whole mean value, the
resulting specific heat is - 376, instead of - 405 as obtained directly from

the table.* The average value of the ratio -- for the six specimens,

0"01947, corrected by addition to it of the same proportional quantity, or 7\

per cent., is - 02088. Sir W. Thomson's determination of the same ratio's

value by reduction of the thermometer records, is 0"02311, 11 per cent.
greater than the value given by these direct experiments. But the agree-
ment is yet very noteworthy if we reflect that (with the single exception
of rocksalt, - 0288) no other description of rock in the present list

--exhibits such a high average value of the ratio                                      as Craigleith sand-

                                                                                    6

stone quartz itself being a little inferior to it. It owes this property
                              ;

partly to its high conductivity, which in the slightly wetted state that the

process entails (averaging in the actual experiments less than 3 per cent.,

or less than half the quantity of water needed to thoroughly saturate the

stone)  almost attains that of  quartz                                 and  partly  to its  low heat capacity
                                                                    ;

by volume arising from a specific gravity much less than that of quartz,

which it enjoys in common with other building sandstones.

Using for the specific heat by volume of Craigleith sandstone a value,

0"4625, which somewhat exceeds the above found average thermal

capacity of the rock, Sir W. Thomson's deduction of its absolute thermal

                                                                              k

conductivity (from the high value of its ratio - already found by his re-

ductions) is also higher, - 01068, for this second reason, than anything

which the Committee has yet met with among rocks of the ordinarily

occurring kinds. It must, however, be acknowledged that in its thermal
conductivity this building sandstone ranks so high that only compact

quartz surpasses it, as the following series of measurements, made during
the past year with the apparatus in the excellent state of permanent
efficiency which it acquired last year (by the use of German silver and

iridio-platinum wires), very plainly indicate.

     As a check upon the exactness of the measures of the thermal
 capacities the annexed table will also supply useful comparisons with some

 well-known standard observations of these quantities for a few minerals

much used for buildings, and "Bed rock," the more general produce of the quarry, better
suited for foundations, were also made from specimens obtained for the Committee
from the quarry, before Professor Herschel's visit to it, by Mr. K. Irvine, of Granton.
Two tenants of the quarry, before Mr. Hunter's succession to it, have occupied Craig-
leith-Hill House, and have vacated it since Mr. Johnson's residence there* and the

thermometer hole, or well, seems to have been demolished not long after the four or
five years' records of its thermometers were ended and discontinued. It took three
months to sink it to the full depth of twenty-four feet, with a diameter of three inches
at the bottom and six inches at the top ; it was full of water always to a certain height
while it was in progress, and was packed, when the thermometers were placed in it

.at their proper depths, with sand. A damp or wet state of the rock (and of the in-
troduced sand) it may be gathered from these preserved accounts of its construction

must have prevailed in the whole or a great part of the stratum of rock through

 which the bore-hole passed.

     * Had the measurement of the specific heat of each porous plate been repeated

with the rock in its perfectly saturated state, it is evident that the necessity of this
correction would have been avoided. It is superfluous, apparently, for the sand-
stones and less porous rocks, for which one average error-range (for the wet and dry

states together), only, is given in the table.

value found for white chalk, after deducting the above correction, perhaps
arises from a considerable amount of hygroscopic moisture contained in
the stone in its ordinary state ; but, if on account of its extreme porosity

mined characters capable of affording most useful assistance as permanent
and special qualities for distinguishing them from one another.

     Another example of comparison between the direct and indirect
methods of experiment has presented itself in the Committee's observa-
tions of Thermal Conductivities, where, however, they have not yet
investigated the original substance which was the subject of the earlier

experiments, but only an approximately similar one in two different con-
ditions which permit a fair comparison of the measurements to be made,
which have been obtained by direct, and also by a totally different method
of procedure. The quantity of water (23 per cent.) found to be taken
up by dry sand when thoroughly wet, as stated in the table, should raise

its specific heat by weight from 0*200, there given, to 0*348 ; but the

specific heat observed in the second case was only 0*284, corresponding
to an absorption of only 12 per cent, of water. The specific heats by
weight and by volume given in the table for thoroughly wet sand are, there-

fore, too low, and the value of the ratio - deduced from them must be

                                                                                        c

sensibly higher than its real value for saturated sand. For perfectly dry

sand it is 0*0032, for thoroughly wet sand it must accordingly be about

0-0100, and for the sand in the experimental garden in Edinburgh, Sir

W. Thomson obtained  the  value                                    h  by  a  reduction

                                 --0*0087, of the ratio ,

of the records of Professor Forbes' underground thermometers. Could

a specimen of the sand itself, which the Committee hopes to procure, be

obtained in which the thermometers were sunk, the value of the ratio

found by Sir W. Thomson would no doubt be very closely corroborated
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and, at the same time, the real values of the absolute conductivity and

specific heat of a loose and porous earth like that in which these ther-
mometers were placed, which the Committee has not yet determined,

would be added to the present list.

The Committee has the satisfaction to notice with peculiar commenda-

tion the series of excellent and accurate experiments on the thermal con-

ductivities and capacities of certain specimens of rocks of Japan, which

the professors of the Tokio College there, Messrs. J. Perry and W".

Ayrton, have conducted with the greatest skill and originality of method

and ©f practical execution. Of the very excellent memoir of these

experimenters, and of the contributions from other sources to the practical

investigation of the subject of rock-conductivity which have been made

recently and in bygone years, the Committee hope to point out the

bearings in a collective review, if the production of such a historical

report, during the coming year, presents itself as a sufficiently desirable

object for their reappointment. Thin microscopic sections of about

twenty of the rock- specimens upon which they have experimented have

been prepared by Mr. G. F. Cuttell, of London, which convey much

information to the eye regarding the causes of the various degrees of con-

ductivity that are met with in particular rocks. The compact, almost

purely siliceous nature of the quartzites is thus visibly presented, and

the reason of their ranking with quartz much higher in conductivity

Athan the more heterogeneous sandstones is very obvious.                     similar

minute inspection of the structure of Craigleith sandstone will no doubt

furnish evidence of similar purity of its material in comparison with other

sandstones, in explanation of the very distinctive quality of remarkably

high thermal conductivity which it appears to possess among them.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. H. F. Barnes-
     Lawrence, C. Spence Bate, Esq., H. E. Dresser, Esq. (Sec),

      Dr. A. Gtunther, J. E. Harting, Esq., Dr. G-wtn Jeffreys, Pro-

     fessor Newton, and the Rev. Canon Tristram, appointed for the

     purpose of inquiring into the possibility of establishing a " Close
     Time " for Indigenous Animals.

It is with regret that your Committee has to report that, for the first time
since its original appointment in August 1868, the work it has not unsuc-

cessfully had in hand has been brought in question, and this in a way
which requires serious attention on the part of all who wish to preserve

our indigenous animals from the extermination that, until the last few

years, was threatening so many of them.
     In July 1877, it having been reported to Her Majesty's Secretary of

State for the Home Department that " the Herring Fishery on the coast

of Scotland is in an unsatisfactory state, and that it is desirable that
inquiries should be made to ascertain whether any legislative regulations
would tend to promote the welfare of the fishermen engaged in the said
fishery, and to increase the supply of herrings for the benefit of the
public," that gentleman appointed Mr. Buckland, Mr. Spencer Walpole,

and Mr. Archibald Young to be Commissioners to make such inquiries
and to report to him the result thereof.

     In accordance therewith the Commissioners above named reported to

the Home Secretaiy, under date of March 1, 1878, and their ' Report,'

with ' Appendices,' was subsequently presented to both Houses of Par-

liament by command of Her Majesty.
     This ' Report,' containing certain conclusions arrived at by the Com-

missioners, naturally attracted the notice of your Committee ; and after
due consideration it was resolved that a letter should be addressed on

behalf of your Committee to the Home Secretary in regard to some of

those conclusions.

     The following is a copy of the letter thereupon sent :

" To the Right Honourable B. A. Cross, H.M. Principal Secretary of State

                                for the Home Department.

                                             " 6 Tenterden Street, Hanover Square, W.,
                                                                                           " London, July 6, 1878.

   --" Sir, The Committee of the British Association for the Advancement

of Science, appointed for the purpose of inquiring into the possibility of
establishing a close time for indigenous animals, having had under their
consideration the ' Report on the Herring Fisheries of Scotland,' dated

March 1, 1878, and the conclusions at which the Commissioners have
arrived (pp. xxxv., xxxvi. of that Report), beg leave respectfully to sub-

mit to your consideration the following observations, viz. :

   --" I. That conclusions Nos. 2 and 3 of the Commissioners viz., that

' legislation in past periods has had no appreciable effect,' and that

* nothing that man has yet done, and nothing that man is likely to do,
ON ESTABLISHING A "CLOSE TIME" FOE INDIGENOUS ANIMALS. 147

--Las diminished, or is likely to diminish, the general stock of herrings in

the sea ' if correct, are absolutely contradicted by conclusion No. 13,
which recommends that ' The Sea-Birds Preservation Act, pi'otecting
gannets and other predaceous birds which cause a vast annual destruction

of herrings, should be repealed in so far as it applies to Scotland.'

     " II. That conclusion No. 1, stating that ' the Herring Fishery on the
coast of Scotland, as a whole, has increased and is increasing,' clearly
shows that there can be no necessity for the step recommended in conclu-
sion No. 13 as above cited.

" III. That conclusion No. 13 seems to have been arrived at from ex-

aggerated or incorrect information, as will appear from the following con-

--siderations : The number of gannets on Ailsa is estimated (Report,

p. xi.) at 10,000, and a yearly consumption of 21,600,000 herrings is

assigned  to                                                 them                            while  the  Commissioners  assume                                                                    that  there  are ' 50
                                                                                          ;

gannets in the rest of Scotland for every one on Ailsa,' and on that

assumption declare that the total destruction of herrings by Scottish

gannets is more than 1,110,000,000 per annum. This is evidently a mis-

calculation                                                  for,  on                        the  premisses,  this  last number  should be                                                              1,101,000,000,
                                                          ;

a difference of more than 8,000,000.

" But, more than this, supposing the figures at the outset are right, it

appears to the Close Time Committee that the succeeding assumption of

the Commissioners must be altogether wrong ; at any rate there is no

evidence adduced in its support, and some that is contradictory of it.

" The number of breeding-places of the gannet in the Scottish seas

has long been known to be five only, as, indeed, is admitted by one of the

Commissioners (Appendix No. 2, p. 171); and the evidence of Captain

M'Donald, which is quoted in a note to the same passage, while estimating

the Ailsa gannets at 12,000 in 1869 (not 1859, as printed), puts the whole

number of Scottish gannets at 324,000 instead of 510,000, which there

would be at the rate of 50 in the rest of Scotland for one on Ailsa, accord-

ing to the Commissioners' assumption.

" Moreover, 50,000 of these 324,000 birds, or nearly one-sixth, are

admitted by this same Commissioner to be ' of great value to the inhabit-

ants ' of St. Kilda ; and, indeed, they are of far greater value to them

than any number of herrings, since it is perfectly well known that the

people of St. Kilda could hardly live without their birds ; therefore this

50,000 must be omitted from any estimate of detriment. Deducting,

then, 50,000 from Captain M'Donald's 324,000, we have 274,000, and

these, at the Commissioners' estimate, would consume 600,060,000 her-

rings instead of the 1,110,000,000 alleged by the Report, and, therefore,

nearly 200,000,000 fewer than the Commissioners' estimate of the annual

--take of the Scottish fisheries (800,000,000) 25 per cent, less, instead of

37 per cent. more.

" Hitherto the supposition of the Report, that the gannets frequent the

Scottish seas all the year round, has                                                                               been followed                                                                 but  the  Close  Time

Committee begs leave to observe that, as a matter of fact, these birds are

not there in force for more than half the year.

" This, then, will require another abatement to be made. Not to exag-

gerate the case, the Committee assumes them to frequent these waters

seven months, or seven-twelfths of a year. This will make their annual

capture of herrings 350,350,000, instead of the more than 1,110,000,000

of the Commissioners, being nearly 700,000,000, or much less than one-

third, fewer.

     "IV. That in all the evidence received and published by the Commis-
sioners only two witnesses allege that any harm has resulted to the fisheries

from the Sea-Birds Protection Act. Of these, the first, Robert M'Connell,
presented a petition from the fishermen of Girvan, in which it is stated

(p. 145) that ' no legislation is called for or required ; ' while another
witness from the same place, John Melville (a fishery officer), declares (at

p. 146) that ' the fishery has very much increased this last year. Recent
years have also shown a gradual increase. The increase is partly due to
the increased machinery, and partly to the increase in the number of

herrings.'

" The second witness unfavourable to the Act, John M'William (an In-

spector of Poor), speaks (pp. 147-49) only from personal knowledge

acquired between 1833 and 1853, when he ceased to be a fisherman, and

not from any recent experience. He can therefore scarcely be held com-

petent to give an opinion of his own as to whether the Sea-Birds Pro-

tection Act (passed in 1869) has injured the fisheries. Another witness

recommends the repeal of this Act ; but he, Hugh MacLachlan, expressly

states (p. 143) that he ' thinks the cause of the decrease [in the number

of herrings taken]  is  the  catching immature                      ;  and  the  remedy ho

                                                  fish '

proposes is the adoption of a strict close time.

" V. That, on the other hand, the utility of sea-birds in pointing out

the situation of shoals of herrings and other fish is not only generally

notorious, but is even admitted in the Report (pp. 57 and 175).

"VI. That if the Sea-Birds Act be repealed on the grounds alleged for

Scotland, its repeal for England  and  Ireland    must  logically follow                                                           and
                                                                                                                                ;

this Committee trusts that no steps may be taken to repeal the Act for

Scotland.

To this letter the following reply has been received :

--" Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to acknowledge the

receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., submitting observations on behalf
of the Committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science

on the Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the herring
fisheries of Scotland, dated the 1st March last.

    Tour Committee conceives that the points at issue between it and the
Scottish Herring Fishery Commissioners are thus fairly stated, and is

confident that all unbiassed persons will admit that those Commissioners

have over-stated their case. Your Committee would further remark that,
     ON OCCUPATION OF A TABLE AT THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES. 1 49

though the Sea-Birds Preservation Act contains a provision (in section 3)
for varying the close time therein enacted on due application, no such
application appears ever to hava been made on the ground of detriment
to the herring fisheries caused by sea-birds ; while there can be no reason-
able doubt that any application for shortening the close time on that

--ground, if duly made, would be granted circumstances which would

seem to show that the conclusions of the Commissioners were not gene-

rally shared by those interested in the fisheries. On the other hand, your
Committee may refer to the fact, already mentioned in former Reports,
that several applications have been made for prolonging the existence of

the close time.

     With regard to the Wild-Fowl Preservation Act your Committee has

to report that the discontent caused by its establishing a close time,
different from that which was originally proposed by your Committee,
still exists in some quarters, but that the power of variation the Act con-

tains has been put in force in many counties ; and your Committee trusts
when this power has been still further exercised, as it doubtless will be,
 and the Act practically brought into accordance with your Committee's
 first proposal, of which there are many indications, dissatisfaction will be

 reduced to a minimum, or will altogether cease.

    A Bill for the Protection of Freshwater Fish has been introduced into

 Parliament during the present Session, and will doubtless receive the
 Royal assent. It has not, however, been of a kind that needed any action
 on the part of your Committee.

     In view of any proceedings which may be taken in the Session of 1879
 in regard to the recommendations of the Scottish Herring Fishery Com-

 missioners already recited, as well as on general grounds, your Committee
 respectfully urges its reappointment.

 Report of the Committee appointed for the purpose of arranging
    with Dr. Dohkn for the occupation of a Table at the Zoological
     Station at Naples ; the Committee consisting of Mr. Dew-Smith
     {Secretary), Professor Huxley, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. GrWYN Jeffreys,

    Mr. Sclater, Dr. M. Foster, Mr. F. M. Balfour, and Professor
     Ray Lankester.

 Your Committee have the honour to report that the working of the Zoo-

  logical Station is proceeding in the most satisfactory manner, and that its
  efficiency has greatly increased since the last report was made.

       Since August 1, 1877, no less than twenty-one naturalists have been
  engaged in working at the Station, which is a larger number than in any
  former year.

       The steam launch presented by the Berlin Academy of Sciences has

  been of great service in providing animals found at a distance from Naples,
  and of short-lived animals requiring rapid transit, to enable them to be
  used in a sufficiently fresh condition.

     Of late, one of the main objects of the Station has been largely de-

veloped, viz., the supplying of animals for research, and for museum

specimens at a small cost to persons applying for them.

The animals are procured and preserved by the staff at the Station,

and are sent off and charged for at the bare cost of the animals, plus the

cost of the preservation solutions.

Since August 1, 1877, packages of specimens have been sent to forty-

Anine different naturalists residing in various parts of the world.         list

is appended to this report, giving the names of those to whom the speci-

mens were sent, and also the nature of the specimens themselves.

The scientific work of the Station is progressing well, as the following

list of monographs preparing for publication will show :

                                                      ,, Dr. Mayer.

Also several algological monographs by Dr. Falkenberg, Dr. Schaiitz,
and Professor Solms-Laubach are nearly ready, besides many papers on

minor investigations,

   We hear that the monographs on Ctenophoridfe, by Dr. Chun, and

on Balanoglossns, by Dr. Spengel, are already in the press.

   We very much regret that no naturalists have availed themselves of

the use of the table engaged by the Association, and we would suggest
that members should endeavour to make it more widely known that

naturalists desirous of working at some group of animals may, with the

consent of the Committee, proceed to Naples, and there find every con-

venience for their work, including material and use of the steam launch
for dredging purposes, supplied to them free of all cost.

    Lastly, we very strongly urge the desirability of renewing the grant
of £75, as although, as we have shown, the Station is in a most prosperous
condition, still it can only remain so when liberally supported by public

bodies interested in the advancement of science.

Aparatus for measuring height. (3).         spirometer                                                    and  (4)  a spring

balance for testing strength of arm. Of these instruments the Committee

have purchased four complete sets.

   A great number of the forms have been distributed to persons in various

parts of the country.

     The schedules already filled up and received by the Committee relate
to the measurements of the boys at Westminster School, the 2nd Royal

Surrey Militia, letter-sorters in the General Post Office, recruits, persons
employed in a large manufactory in Bedford, criminals ; and a few relate

to persons engaged in different occupations. Some of these, however,
have not been taken strictly according to the instructions drawn out by

the Committee, and some of them are of less value than the rest.
     Other measurements have been promised by Dr. Mouat ; by the Rev.

George Style, the head-master of a grammar-school in Yorkshire ; by Dr.
Farr ; and by Capt. Brown, of the 18th Kent Rifle Volunteers. Capt.Brown

states, in his letter to Dr. Farr, that he will have much pleasure in fur-

--nishing measurements of the men in his corps about 100 ; and that he

will see personally the other eight commanding officers, and ask them to
assist the Committee. Should Capt. Brown be able to obtain the whole,

they will amount to about 900 men.

    Amongst those who have furnished the Committee with measurements
may be mentioned the names of Major-General Lane Fox, Mr. Francis

Galton, Inspector-General Lawson, Dr. Waller Lewis, Dr. Bain, Dr. Scott,

the head-master of Westminster School, and Professor Rudler.

   A few sets of tables have been prepared from the above returns, show-

ing the age and height, age and weight, age and strength, and average

height, weight, and strength, as well as the ratio between height and

weight and the ratio between height and strength.

    An extract from the tables relating to criminals has been drawn out by

Mr. Francis Galton, as an illustration of one of the methods in which it

is proposed to deal with facts collected by the Committee, to be circulated

with their forms and instructions.

General Lane Fox has written a full report on the measurements, which

he personally superintended, of the 2nd Royal Surrey Militia ; and from
which he has prepared several tables, which are shown at the end of his

report. His tables, though differently constructed, agree in nearly every

particular with those prepared under the direction of Dr. Farr.

It will be observed that several gentlemen have promised to furnish the

Committee with measurements, and they hope soon to be in possession of

such facts as will enable them to compare the results with the different

classes of the population, and to determine the physical characters of

persons born and living in different parts of the country.

In the meantime the Committee abstain from submitting incomplete

results ; they, however, think the following short abstract from some of

the tables alluded to may be of sufficient interest to deserve consideration.

     For the purpose of inquiring into and determining the typical forms of
our race a sub-committee has been formed, consisting of Mr. Brabrook,
Sir Rawson Rawson, Major-General Lane Fox, Mr. Francis Galton, Mr.
Park Harrison, Professor Leone Levi, and Mr. Distant.

     The Report of the Sub- Committee is annexed hereto.

    In conclusion, it may be said that the Committee have now organised the

system of observations, and have tested them sufficiently; they have
distributed blank schedules, which they expect to have returned to them

filled up ; they have also agreed on the more important points concerned
in the forms of reduction of the raw materials.

    They are now prepared, with instruments sufficient to enter upon a large

field of observation.

     They have expended .£83 lis. 2d. in their prefatory work of the £100
that was voted to them, and have handed the residue back to the
Treasurer. They now beg that the residue be re-granted to them, to-
gether with an additional sum of £83 lis. 2d., which will put them in
possession of £100 to carry on operations during the next year, which

they trust will produce a valuable harvest of results.

July, 1878.                                  William Fare,

                              Chairman of Anthrojjometric Committee.

             Report of Sub-Committee.

     The Sub-Committee appointed by the Anthropometric Committee to
deal with that portion of the reference to them which relates to " the

publication of photographs of the typical races of the empire," resolved

in the first instance to limit the inquiry to the investigation, by means of

photographs, of the national or local types of races prevailing in different

parts of the United Kingdom.

The plan which the Sub-Committee thought it best to adopt was to

select a number of districts in which it is believed a distinct type prevails,
and in each such district to request the assistance of as many competent
observers as can be found ; each to be asked to obtain a limited number

of photographs, six to ten, representing in his opinion the type chiefly

prevalent among individuals belonging to families long settled and inter-
marrying in the district. From the materials thus obtained, the Sub-

Committee hope to be able to select representative specimens.

In the carrying out of this plan, the assistance of professional and

amateur photographers, of medical men, and of clergymen, has been

Asought.     circular has been addressed to about a hundred members of

the Association, and a letter has been published, by authority of the

Committee, in the ' Photographic News.' This inquiry is one, however,

in which almost every member of the Association may be able to assist,

and the Sub-Committee (presuming the Association will authoi'ise the

continuance of the work) appeal to the members generally for such

assistance.

The Sub-Committee recommend

1. That the selected individuals should be adults.

2. That the details of their pedigree, as far as possible, should be given.

3. That, in general, only those should be accepted whose two parents

and four grandparents were born in or belonged to the district.
     4. That the colour of bair and eyes should be stated, if practicable.
     5. That the photographs should be accompanied by a written description

of the particular features they portray as being characteristic of the dis-

trict.

In pursuance of this plan, the Sub-Committee have received from Pro-

fessor Rudler an excellent selection of 5 male and 5 female inhabitants of
Aberystwith, which are laid upon the table, as specimens of the way in
which the work should be done. Mr. Park Harrison, one of their body,
has made a selection of types from Wales and Cornwall, and others from
                                             ;

--156 report 1878.

Sussex and East Kent. Miss Whitmore-Jones, of Chastleton House,
Oxfordshire, has kindly arranged for the photographing of some of the
inhabitants of that parish whose pedigree can be traced in the parish
registers up to their very commencement, nearly 300 years ago. (Six
groups thus obtained are laid upon the table.) Mr. Hooper, a skilled
photographer, has promised to furnish the Sub-Committee with specimens
from several districts. They have had also most liberally placed at their

disposal the important collections which have been made during many
years past by their colleague, Dr. Beddoe. The Rev. Mr. Crompton, in
Norfolk, Mr. Spence Bate, in Cornwall, Mr. C. Staniland Wake, at Hull,

Mr. Sorby, at Sheffield, Dr. Muirhead, for Scotland, and numerous others,
have also kindly undertaken to collect photographs for the Sub- Committee.

Collectors for Ireland are much wanted.
    Though the Sub-Committee are as yet only on the threshold of their task,

and their operations have been hitherto tentative, they are hopeful of use-
ful results. Their sense of the importance and interest of the work has
grown with every step they have taken, and it is abundantly clear that,

if not now completed, it will become more and more difficult in future
years. The influence of railways has during the last fifty years greatly

increased migration and intermixture, and that influence must increase
instead of diminishing. It has indeed been suggested to the Sub- Committee
by some of their correspondents that the requirement as to pedigree is
already too onerous for urban and manufacturing districts, and that in
such cases it will be necessary to be content with proof that a mere
majority of the three generations, and not the whole, belong to the dis-

trict.

     The Sub- Committee respectfully recommend that they be reappointed,
with the view of pressing forward the work to completion. They would
be glad if a few practical photographers could be added to their number
and they again ask for the assistance of any competent persons who will

undertake to select six or ten typical photographs in the district they

know best, and for any other aid in carrying out the undertaking that the
members can give.

     In connexion with this branch of the subject, the Sub- Committee have

watched with much interest the experiments of their colleague, Mr. Francis
Galton, in preparing compound photographs from several individuals

belonging to the same category. In dealing with the features of criminals,
Mr. Galton has produced some remarkable results, and the Sub-Committee
will not fail to inquire whether an application of his process would not be

useful for their own purposes in generalising the peculiar features observed

in different localities.

     Though the Sub-Committee have of necessity postponed the collection
of photographs of races of the empire outside the United Kingdom, Sir
Rawson Rawson has been kind enough to obtain for them from the
Colonial Office a set of the very fine series of photographs which that
department obtained some years ago under the advice of Professor Huxley ;
and the authorities of the India Office have also kindly placed at the dis ·
posal of the Sub-Committee their valuable collection of photographs of

Indian races.

               For the Sub- Committee,

                            E. W. Brabrook.

ON THE USE OF STEEL FOR STRUCTURAL PURPOSES.  157

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. A. W. Williamson, Pro-

     fessor Sir William Thomson, Mr. Bramwell, Mr. St. John Vin-

     cent Day, Dr. C. W. Siemens, Mr. C. W. Merrifield, Dr. Neilson

     Hancock, Mr. F. J. Abel, Mr. J. E. Napier, Captain Douglas

     G-alton, Mr. Newmarch, Mr. E. H. Carbutt, and Mr. Macrory,
     appointed for the purpose of watching and reporting to the
     Council on Patent Legislation.

This Committee begs leave to report that, with the exception of the

introduction of a Bill on the Patent Law by a private member, which

Bill was not proceeded with, there has not been any attempt at legisla-

tion on the subject. The Committee request that they may be reap-

pointed.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. W. H. Barlow, Mr. H.

   Bessemer, Mr. F. J. Bramwell, Captain Douglas G-alton, Sir

   John Hawkshaw, Dr. C. W. Siemens, Professor Abel, and Mr. E.

   H. Carbutt (Sec), appointed for the purpose of considering the
    Use of Steel for Structural Purposes.

Owing to the action of your Committee, the Board of Trade requested

two of your members, viz., Sir John Hawkshaw, F.R.S., and Mr. W. H.

Barlow, F.R.S., to co-operate with Colonel Yolland, "to consider whether

it is practicable to assign a safe co-efficient for steel."

    After a long and careful consideration they, on March 19, 1877, re-

ported as follows :

    We" assume that with steel, as with iron, the engineer will take care

that, as well as the required strength, he secures a proper amount of

ductility.

     " Having given the subject our best consideration, we recommend that
the employment of steel in engineering structures should be authorised by

the Board of Trade under the following conditions, namely :
     " 1. That the steel employed should be cast steel or steel made by

some process of fusion, subsequently rolled or hammered, and that it
should be of a quality possessing considerable toughness and ductility,
and that a certificate to the effect that the steel is of this description
and quality should be forwarded to the Board of Trade by the engineer

responsible for the structure.

     " 2. That the greatest load which can be brought upon the bridge or
structure, added to the weight of the superstructure, should not produce
a greater strain in any part than 6£ tons per square inch.

     " In conclusion we have to remark that in recommending a co- efficient
of 6| tons per square inch for the employment of steel in railway struc-
tures generally, we are aware that cases may and probably will arise when
it will be proposed to use steel of special make and still greater tenacity,
and when a higher co-efficient might be permissible ; but we think those
158 report-- 1878.

cases must be left for consideration when they arise, and that a higher co-
efficient may be then allowed in those instances where the reasons given

appear to the Board of Trade to justify it.

                                                 " We are, &c,

                                                      (Signed)  "John Hawkshaw,
" The Secretary of the Board of Trade, &c."
                                                                "W. YOLLAND,
                                                                " W. H. Barlow.

     This Report has since been acted upon by the Board of Trade in the
printed paper issued by them in reference to railway structures.

      It will be observed that a co-efficient of 6^ tons per square inch is
assigned to steel, that of iron being 5 tons per square inch.

     This increase of the co-efficient will effect important economy in
structures, especially in bridges of large spans, and will also tend gene-
rally to increase the employment of steel for railway and shipbuilding

purposes.

     The labours of your Committee having ended in such a satisfactory
manner, there is no necessity to reappoint them.

Report on the Geographical Distribution of the Chiroptera.

                    By Gr. E. Dobson, M.A., M.B.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in externa
                                       among the Reports.]

In his work on the Geographical Disti'ibution of Animals, published

--scarcely two years ago, Mr. Wallace writes : " The genera of Chiroptera

are in a state of great confusion, the names used by different authors

being often not at all comparable, so that the few details given of the

Wedistribution of the bats are not trustworthy.                 have therefore made

little use of this order in the theoretical part of the work." And again :

" The bats are a very difficult study, and it is quite uncertain how many

distinct species there are ; the genera are exceedingly numerous, but they

are in a very unsettled state, and the synonymy is exceedingly confused.
The details of their distribution cannot therefore be usefully entered upon

here."

     These remarks furnish a suitable preface to this paper. The recent

publication of my work on the Chiroptera renders them, I hope, no longer
applicable, and I purpose now to set forth in greater detail the results of
my inquiries into the geographical distribution of these animals than the
space at my disposal in the introduction to the work referred to has per-

mitted.

     Mr. Wallace points out the pre-eminent importance of the distribution

of Mammals in determining the limits of zoological regions ; but also

remarks that, " there are two groups which have quite exceptional means

--of dispersal the bats which fly, and the cetacea, seals, &c., which swim.

The former are capable of traversing considerable spaces of sea, since two
                                                                                                  .

       ON THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE CHIROPTERA. 159

,

North American species either regularly or occasionally visit the Ber-
mudas, a distance of 600 miles from the mainland."

     I do not think that the occurrence of two American species of bats in

the Bermudas affords much proof of the general capability of the species

of Chiroptera in traversing considerable spaces of sea, for it is exceedingly

probable that the few individuals which have been noticed there have
been carried thitber by storms (to which cause is evidently due the great
number of straggling species of birds which have been found there), or
have been imported into the island while hybernating in the holds of
vessels, or are the descendants of such accidentally imported individuals.
However, even if it be granted that the Chiroptera possess great powers
of dispersal, it is certain that quite nine-tenths of the species avail them-
selves of them in a very limited degree indeed, and it is significant that
the distribution of the species is limited by barriers similar to those which
govern it in the case of other species of mammals. This is well shown

by the small number of species which are known to inhabit more than
one of the recognised zoological regions, which amount to 22 only out
of 400. The following list includes these species, and shows also their

distribution.

Estimating the total number of known species of Chiroptera at 400, it

follows that 5^ per cent, only wander beyond their respective zoological

regions, or, in other words, 94^ per cent, are characteristic. It is also

noticeable that more than two-thirds of these wandering species belong

to the family Vespertilionidae, which has by far the widest geographical

distribution, and includes the least specialised forms.

inhabiting each  zoological region                                                                and shows that in the regions  situated

principally within the tropics (as the Oriental and Neotropical regions)

in the temperate zones (as the Nearctic and Palsearctic regions).

closely related to some of the species of the Neotropical genus Molossus
than to any of the Old World forms; and the same remark applies to
Nyctinomw) australis, which is characteristic of the Australian region.

     Although the Emballonuridae have as wide an eastwardly and west-
wardly distribution as the Vespertilionidas, yet they are far exceeded by
the latter family in their northern and southern range. While the

Vespertilionidae extend in the Northern hemisphere as far as the isothermal
of 32° Fahr. or thereabouts, the Emballonuridas are rarely found north or
south of the isothermal of 55°.

     The RhinolophidaB are limited to the Eastern hemisphere, and within

these limits the species have much less extended bounds than even those

of the preceding family. No species has as yet been recorded with cer-
tainty from the Polynesian subregion, from Tasmania, or from New
Zealand. With the exception of Rhinolophus ferrum-equinum, which

extends throughout the Ethiopian and warmer parts of the Patearctic

region, the species of this family inhabiting each of the zoological regions
comprised within the area of its distribution are distinct and charac-

teristic. No species of the subfamily Phyllorhinince extends into the

Palaearctic region                                                                   Ccelops is                                      limited  to the  Oriental region, and Rhino,

species alone extends int) the Malagasy subregion.

     The Nycterida? are limited to the Ethiopian and Oriental regions one
species only passing slightly beyond the limits of the latter region,' and
none have as yet been found in the Malagasy subregion of the former.
The Ethiopian species of the genus Megaderma are more closely related to
each other than to the Oriental species. The distribution of Nycteris is
mremarkable

found Java, and differs from all the rest in the large size of the second
lower premolar.

     The Phyllostomidas present the only instance of a family of Chiroptera
limited to a single zoological region. None of the species are known
with certainty to inhabit permanently any of the countries beyond the
recognized limits of the Neotropical region. This family is therefore
eminently characteristic of that region. Although Central America and
Southern Mexico have representatives of almost every genus of Phyllo-
stomidae, none of the species have been, with any certainty, recorded from
the Southern States of North America, though the mean annual tempera-
ture ot a great part of these countries equals or exceeds that of many
parts of South America where representatives of the family are abundant
It is worthy of note that Macrotus waterhousii, which has been alone found
as tar north as Cape St. Lucas in California, is apparently omnivorous

present probably more peculiarities in their distribution tban aDy other
group of Chiroptera. Like the Rhinolophidae and Nycteridse, they are
strictly limited to the Old World, and scarcely extend anywhere beyond
the tropics. Their limitation to the tropical parts is easily explained by
a consideration of the fact that there only is found a continuous supply
at all seasons of the tree-fruits on which they subsist ; but this does not
account for certain peculiarities in their distribution in an eastwardly or
westwardly direction. While the family is distributed throughout the

Ethiopian, Oriental, and Australian regions (except Tasmania and New

Zealand), a single genus only, Cynonycteris, extends throughout all these
regions. Epomoplwrus, which includes certain species so different from all
other Megachiroptera, as to almost necessitate the formation of a distinct
subfamily for their reception, is strictly limited to that part of the
Ethiopian region included within the continent of Africa. Cynopterus is
also limited to the Oriental region a single anomalous species, G. latidens

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

(which differs widely from all the other species in the form of its teeth)

being found in the Moluccas. Eonycteris is, as yet, known from the

Indo-Malayan subregion alone ; Notopteris appears to be limited to the
Polynesian subregion ; Harpyia and Cephalotes are characteristic of the
Austro-Malayan subregion.

     The distribution of the genus Pteropiis (which includes more than half
the whole number of the species of Pteropodidce) is more remarkable than
that of any of the other genera of Chiroptera. The Comoro Islands
in the Mozambique Channel form its westward limit, thence the species
extend throughout the Malagasy subregion, even to the small hurricane-
swept island of Rodriguez (from which 1 have lately described a new
species), and northwards through the Amirantes and Seychelle Islands
to India, where their westward limit is found at the southern frontier of
Baluchistan : from India they extend eastwards throughout the Oriental

and Australian regions (except Tasmania and New Zealand), inhabiting

Polynesia as far eastwards as Samoa and Savage Island. Although one

thousand miles of unbroken ocean divide the Seychelle Islands from the
Chagos group (the nearest intermediate land to India), the Indian and
Madagascar species (Pteropus medius and Pt. edwardsii) are very closely
allied ; while, on the other hand, not a single species crosses the narrow
channel between the Great Comoro Island and the African coast, although
certainly two species (Pteropus edwardsii and Pt. livingstonii), and pro-
bably a third (Pt. vulgaris), inhabit the Comoro group.

      The following table exhibits the very remarkable distribution of the
species of this genus :

164 report-- 1878.

From the table (p. 162) it may be observed, that of the 39 species, 30

(or nearly 80 per cent.) inhabit the Malagasy snbregion, and the Austra-
lian region ; and that more than 50 per cent, of the whole are fonnd within
the narrow limits of the Malagasy and Austro-Malayan subregions.

     It is worthy of notice, that of the nine species inhabiting the Oriental
region, three only can be considered very distinct, and these are closely
related to some of the species from the Malagasy and Austro-Malayan

subregions, so that it appears evident that the species now inhabiting

the Oriental region, were derived at a comparatively recent period from
the above-named subregions.

     The sum of the foregoing remarks is well set forth in the second
table (p. 163), which exhibits the number of peculiar genera and species

of each and of all the families of Chiroptera in each zoological region,
and also shows their percentage on the total number of the genera and
species. This table also shows that among the Vespertilionidse and
Emballonuridaaonly, which are cosmopolitan in their distribution, does the
percentage of peculiar species in each zoological region fall below 90,
while even in these families it is rarely as low as 70.

   We may now proceed to consider to what extent the recognised zoo-

logical regions are severally characterised by the possession of peculiar

families, genera, or species of Chiroptera.

     In the first place, the two primary divisions of the earth, Palasogsea
and Neoga?a, are well characterised by their Chiropterous fauna : the
former by the possession of three peculiar families, the Pteropodida?,
Rhinolophidse, and Nycterida?, and by the absence of the Phyllostomida?
the latter by the absence of the three first-named families, and by the
presence of the latter. Although the Vespertilionida? and Emballonuridse

are common to both hemispheres, one species only is known with certainty

to inhabit both the New and the Old World, and all the genera except

three are peculiar.

     The remarkable poverty of the Nearctic and Palasarctic regions in
species, and especially in peculiar species, is well shown in the table.
In the Nearctic region the number of peculiar species is but one-tenth of
those which are characteristic of the closely connected Neotropical region;
in the Palasarctic, one-sixth of those in the Ethiopian, and one-seventh of
those in the Oriental region. Moreover, the few species which appear to
be peculiar to these two regions do not present such marked differences
 in structure from the species of the adjoining regions as the peculiar

 species of other regions ; in other words, they are not so characteristically
 peculiar. This taken into consideration with the comparatively large
percentage of non-peculiar species which are found in these and in the
 adjoining regions, and which extend as a rule into the southern parts only

 of these regions, shows that the Chiropterous fauna of the Nearctic and

 Palasarctic regions is mainly, if not wholly, derivative.

      This is precisely what we should have expected theoretically ; for, know-
 ing that the greater part of the Nearctic and Palsearctic regions was covered
 with ice at a comparatively recent period, and therefore uninhabitable by
 a class of animals few of which now extend even in summer as far as the
 limit of permanently frozen ground, we must suppose that on the cessa-

 tion of the glacial epoch, these regions derived their Chiropterous fauna
 from countries lying south of them.

       It appears evident, however, that the Nearctic region has derived

 many of its species from the Palasarctic, probably by way of Bearing

Straits, at a time when more dry land existed in the northern parts of the
Pacific Ocean. Although Vesperugo serotinus is the only species known

with certainty to extend from the Palrearctic to the Nearctic region, yet

so close is the connection between many other Patearctic and Nearctic

species (between Vespertilio mystacinus and V. nitidus, Vesperugo abramus

and V. hesperus, Vesperugo borealis and V. propinquus, e.g.), that it is not

necessary to require long separation to account for the few specific dif-

ferences now noticeable.

Of the eleven species which appear to be peculiar to the Paljearctic

region, both the species of Ehinolophidas are evidently very closely

related  to  Ethiopian  forms                                   and  the Vespertilionida?,  with the exception  of
                                                             ;

Plecotus auritus, and Synotus barbastellus, are also represented by nearly

allied forms in either the Ethiopian or Oriental regions.

     The Nearctic and Pala^arctic regions are therefore more characterised,
so far as their Chiropterous fauna, by the absence rather than by the
presence of peculiar genera and species.

     The remaining four regions, however, present a remarkable contrast in
this respect. Each region appears to be as well characterised by its
Chiroptera as by any other order of Mammalia.

     This is especially noticeable in the Neotropical region, which possesses

a very remarkable family, the Phyllostomida?, nowhere represented beyond

its limits ; also six peculiar genera of Emballonuridae (amounting to 75
per cent, of the genera of that family) ; and two of Vespertilionida?,
making in all 39 genera peculiar to this region.

     The Ethiopian region (excluding Madagascar and its islands) is cha-
racterised by that very remarkable genus of Pteropodidas, Epomophorus,
which stands so far apart from all other genera of this family ; also by
71 species of other genera, of which more than 90 per cent, are peculiar.

     Madagascar and adjoining islands, included by Mr. Wallace under the

name of the Malagasy subregion, although possessing some species

(Phyllorhina commersoiiii, Nyctinomus acetabulosus, Taphozous mauritianus,

Vesperugo minutus, e.g.) which are also found on the African continent,
has other species representing a genus of which the remaining representa-
tives are found in far distant continents. Thus, as I have remarked

when treating of the distribution of the Pteropodida?, the genus Tteropus
is well represented in Madagascar and adjoining islands, and in the

Oriental and Australian regions as far as the Navigator's Islands, although

not a single species extends into the continent of Africa. This genus

includes by far the largest and most highly organised species of Chiro-
ptera, which in number also amount to more than one-tenth of the whole
order ; and their remarkable distribution can only be accounted for by
adopting the hypothesis of the existence at a comparatively recent date

of a continent, or, more probably, of an archipelago of very closely con-
nected islands, in the wide space of ocean now separating Madagascar
from India and Australia. It is inconceivable that species to which a
narrow channel of less than 200 miles suffices to act as an effectual

barrier, could traverse thousands of miles of unbroken ocean in other

directions.

     Even if we suppose that their presence in Africa is prevented by some
cause unknown to us, still it is difficult to imagine species so slow in their

flight as those of this genus crossing a channel of even half the width
of that separating the Comoro Islands from the coast of Africa. But
Tteropus medius of India is so closely related to Pt. edwardsii of Mada-
166 kepokt-- 1878.

--gascar, that by many zoologists it would most probably be considered a

variety only of the former species a variety, it is quite conceivable, which
might result from separation in a comparatively very short period.

     The Malagasy subregion also possesses four other species of Pteropus
all very distinct from each other, having their nearest allies in the Aus-
tralian region. One of these species, Pt. rodricensis, recently described by
me, inhabits the small wind-swept island of Rodriguez, where its means of
subsistence must now be very limited. It is difficult to account for the
presence of such large and highly- organised species in these small islands,
except on the supposition that the islands were not only much larger at
some former time, but were also, as I have already remarked, closely
connected with a chain of slightly separated islands, uniting them with
the Indian and Australian continents.

     The Oriental region falls very slightly short of the Ethiopian in the
percentage of its peculiar species, and slightly exceeds it in genera. Of

110 species eighty-eight are peculiar ; of these eight only are also found in

the Ethiopian region, and they also extend into the Palsearctic. The

genera Cijnopterus,Eonycteris, Gcelops, and Cheiomeles are characteristic, but
the latter three are each represented by a single species only. Of the
remaining seventeen genera, two, Pteropus and Emballonura, are also com-

mon to the Malagasy subregion and to the Australian region, and ten are

also found in the Oriental and Australian regions. With the exception
of such cosmopolitan species as Miniopterus schreibersii and Vesperugo

abramus, the Oriental species extending into the Australian region appear

to inhabit only the adjacent parts of that region. The distinctiveness of
the Oriental and Australian Chiropterous faunas is well shown by a collec-

tion made lately in Duke of York Island and New Ireland, in which,

out of twelve species, two only are also known from the Oriental region.
     The Australian region comes next to the Neotropical in the number of

its peculiar genera ; of the twenty-one known, six are peculiar, and of these
four belong to the Pteropodidas, being nearly half the whole number of the

genera of that family. This region may therefore be considered the cradle

of the Megachiroptera, although the total number of all species falls far

short of either that of the Ethiopian or of the Oriental region, yet in the
percentage of peculiar forms it holds an intermediate place.

    Two of the Australian subregions, the Austro-Malayan and the New

Zealand, claim particular attention, the former for the great number of
its species, the latter for the opposite reason. Of sixty-four Australian
species, fifty-seven are peculiar, and of these nearly half appear to be limited
to the Austro-Malayan subregion ; while two species only, of which one is

peculiar, inhabit New Zealand.
    Great Britain, which nearly equals New Zealand in extent, has eight

times the number of its species ; and Madagascar, which is alone com-
parable with it in peculiarity of fauna, exceeds it almost in the same

proportion.

     The poverty of this subregion in species is, therefore, unequalled, and
undoubtedly depends to a great extent, if not altogether, on the com-
parative absence of insects, and probably especially of those species on
which bats prey. The peculiar structure of Mystacina tuberculata* appears
to indicate that this species seeks its food among the branches and leaves
of trees on which Longicorn Coleoptera, which are most abundant among

my* See  paper on this species in P. Z. S., 1876, p. 486.

the New Zealand insects, feed. This remarkable species of Emballonuridse

constitutes a distinct group of that family, but has its nearest allies in the

species of the group Molossi. Its fancied relationship to the Phyllostomidse
of the Neotropical region (as set forth by Mr. R. F. Tomes) is altogether
illusory, as it depends only on the agreement between it and the species
of that family in possessing a third phalanx in the index finger, which is
related, as I have shown,* to the peculiar manner in which the wing is
folded in repose, and occurs not only in this species, but also in some of

the larger species of Molossi.

  A review of the above-stated facts shows :

     1. That the Chiroptera, though possessing exceptional powers of loco-
motion, and therefore of dispersal, appear to be almost as strictly limited
by certain barriers as other orders of Mammalia.

     2. That while the geographical distribution of the families, genera, and
species of this order on the whole adds further remarkable confirmation

of the accuracy of the division of the earth into six zoological regions as
defined by Mr. Sclater and subsequently adopted by Mr. Wallace, the
peculiar distribution of the most highly organised and distinct, as well as

of the largest genus, namely, Pteropus, adds additional strength to the

views of those who, in consideration of the very peculiar nature of the
fauna of Madagascar, feel disposed to form with it and the adjoining

islands a seventh zoological region, to which Mr. Sclater's name " Lemuria"

has been applied.

On Recent Improvements in the Port of Dublin. By Bindon B.

   Port and Docks Board.

                                     [Plates I., II., and III.]

 [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso
                                            among the Reports.]

The trade of few harbours in the United Kingdom has made greater

relative progress within the last twenty years than that of Dublin. This,
no doubt, is mainly due to the increased prosperity of the country as a

whole, but it may also be attributed in great measure to the convergence

of the main fines of internal traffic to Dublin, which has thus naturally
become more and more the mart and emporium for a great portion of
Ireland. During this period of twenty years the tonnage entering the

port has much more than doubled. In 1857 it amounted to 880,844 tons,

and last year it rose to 1,973,781 tons, while during the current year
there is a good promise that it will surpass the 2,000,000 limit. For the
sake of comparison I have placed in a tabular form the tonnage of Liver-
pool and Glasgow, as well as those of the three principal ports in Ireland,
for the three years preceding 1858 and 1878 respectively, so as to give
fair averages of their respective rates of progress within the last twenty

years.

    From this table it will be observed that while the tonnages of Liver-

pool and Glasgow have respectively increased fifty per cent, in the last

                                                              * P. Z. S., I. c.

twenty years, those of Belfast and Cork have nearly doubled, and that of
Dublin has considerably more than doubled in the same time. Also, the
tonnage of Glasgow is only one-fourth more and that of Liverpool is not
four times greater than that of Dublin.

 fold in the space of twenty years. Accordingly it was determined, after

 mature consideration, to extend the North Wall, and construct a large

 tidal basin with 24 feet at low water inside and 22 feet along the river

 face, so as to float the largest commercial vessels at all states of tides.

 The masonry was commenced in 1871, and up to the present about 2500

 lineal feet of wall have been built on a novel principle which avoids the
 trouble and expense of cofferdams, pumping, staging and other tem-

 porary works, the expenditure on which frequently exceeds the cost of

the permanent work to which they are merely ancillary. The new mode

of construction consists in the use of blocks of masonry of unprecedented

 size in the foundations below low water level, as represented in the
diagrams which accompany this paper. Each block is 29 feet high,

11^ feet long, and 21 feet 4 inches broad at the base, and weighs 350

tons ; they are built on land on a block wharf (Plate II.), and about three
months after completion they are lifted by a powerful floating shears
(Plate I.), and conveyed to their destination in the quay where each
block forms 11-| feet in length of the lower portion of the wall as far
as low water level, and when a number of these blocks have been thus

laid in position the superstructure up to the coping level is built over
them in the usual manner by tidal work, the total height of the wall
being 45 feet. Besides the large floating shears for lifting and moving

--the blocks about, there is one other special appliance namely, a diving

bell (Plate III.), also of unprecedented size and peculiar in construction.
This bell, which weighs 80 tons, is used for excavating and levelling the
river bed on which the blocks lie. The chamber is cast-iron, 20 feet
square and 6^- feet high, with a tube or funnel 3 feet in diameter, and

rising to a height of 44 feet over the bottom of the bell ; and this is
the greatest depth of water for which the present bell is intended,
though by adding to the length of the funnel it might be worked in
greater depths. The upper end of the funnel forms an air lock 6£
feet high, with double doors and suitable cocks for admitting the com-
pressed air from the chamber into the lock, or for letting that in the
lock escape into the external atmosphere, and by this arrangement the

workmen can pass up and down without lifting the bell off the bottom or
stopping the work of excavation. Inside the chamber are two large iron

trays, and the men shovel the excavated earth into these trays. When

they are filled the bell is lifted a few feet off the ground, and the
barge hauled some yards to the rear of the wall where the trays are dis-
charged, by pulling out a detent, and the barge is then brought back to
its working position, and the bell lowered as before.

   --The operation of lifting and setting a block is as follows : The float-

ing shears is brought bow-on to the block wharf during flood tide, and
the lifting chains are attached to iron suspending bars which pass
through each block. The chains are then hauled in by the winches on
board, and water is pumped into a large tank at the after- end of the
vessel to counterbalance the weight of the block, which is then floated
away to its destination and lowered into place the following low water,
so that at one step 11^ feet forward of wall are built up to low water level.

     The cost of both floating shears and diving bell was under 25,000?.,
and the whole of this was repaid in the first GOO feet of wall by the
superior economy of this system over ordinary cofferdam and pumping
work, and the relative saving now amounts to about 16,000Z. per annum.

     It would obviously be useless to construct deep water quays if the
                                                                                                          ;

river channel and bar were not also deepened to correspond. Sixty-

years since the depth of water on Dublin bar was about 6 feet ; indeed,

there was, a few years ago, an old man in the harbour employment who

had in his youth stood on the bar at a good low water. At this time the

North Bull Wall did not exist, and the bar, consisting of hard sand,

extended in a curved direction about half a mile east of Poolbeg Light-

house. As soon, however, as the Bull Wall was built, the large volume

of water flowing and ebbing over the 2500 acres which were enclosed

between it and the Pigeon House Wall, was confined in direction and

augmented in velocity, so that it impinged against the bar and scoured

it away to its present depth of about 16 feet at low water, giving a depth

of 28 feet at high water springs, and this is still gradually improving

for 20 years since there was 3 feet less than at present, and it is believed

that there is no other instance on record of a bar being so successfully

deepened by artificial means. The depth in the river channel has

recently made great progress, corresponding to the other improvements

in the port. The average tonnage dredged in each of the ten years

preceding 1860 did not reach 150,000 tons, and it is now close on a

million tons per annum. The greater portion of this dredged material is
now conveyed to sea in very large hopper barges, each of which carries

850 to 1000 tons, according to the state of the weather, to a distance of

8 miles from Dublin, or about 2 miles beyond the Bailey Lighthouse,

where it is deposited in deep water beyond the influence of tides within

the bay. Very great economy has resulted from this system of large

hopper  barges  as  compared     with  the  older  methods                                          for,  multiplying
                                                                                                 ;

the present tonnage dredged by the saving per ton, the gross saving

amounts to considerably over 40,000Z. per annum. Indeed, without this

economy it would have been impossible to carry out the other improve-

ments in the port ; for Dublin, though one of the larger ports in the

kingdom, has relatively the smallest income, as there are no dues on

goods except some small ones on timber, bricks and marble, which in

the aggregate do not reach 2000Z. annually. This will appear at a

glance from the following table, which gives the revenue derived by the

ports already mentioned from tonnage dues and dues on goods for the

year 1877, and also the income which each ton yields the several ports as

well as their respective debts.

The tonnage rates for Cork include 3791Z. derived from one half-

penny per ton levied on vessels using or entering the harbour as a port

of call, but not loading or unloading cargo therein. It represents a

tonnage of 1,819,860 tons, and is quite distinct from the 740,201 tons

which  represents vessels  loading  or  unloading cargo                                                                          but, as  it is avail-

able for port purposes, it is included in the tonnage rates of Cork

harbour, in the second column above. If this were omitted, the income

would be reduced to 9d. per ton register.

     This table shows that for every ton entering their respective ports,
Liverpool receives more than four and a half times and Glasgow more

than twice the revenue that Dublin gets, while Belfast gets two-thirds

more, and Cork nearly fifty per cent. more.

    The floating shears and diving bell are useful for many other purposes
besides building quay walls. Among others they are well adapted for

breakwater construction and laying the foundations of beacons and light-

houses in suitable localities. There is at present a lighthouse in process

of construction at the extremity of the Bull Wall which forms the north

side of the entrance to Dublin Harbour, the foundations of which in such

an exposed place would have been very costly if built by any of the ordi-

nary methods. The base is formed of two large semicircular blocks,

each sixteen feet high, and together forming a circle of thirty feet in

diameter and weighing nearly 700 tons. These blocks were built on the

block wharf and conveyed about three miles down the harbour, where

they were laid at a depth of several feet below equinoctial low waters on

the rubble stone forming the extremity of the Bull Wall which had been

previously excavated by the diving bell. On top of these blocks is built

in heavy granite ashlar with solid rubble hearting the lower part, or what

may be called the plinth of the tower, rising some feet over high water,

and on top of this again the shaft of the tower is in process of construc-

tion, formed of wrought iron lined with timber, the total height from

foundation to top of lantern being 79 feet. Opposite this lighthouse, and

at the south side of the harbour entrance, stands Poolbeg Lighthouse,

erected in the last century at the extremity of the pier beyond the Pigeon

House Fort. The foundations of this latter lighthouse were laid at about

low water level in the centre of a mound of rubble stone, and it was

originally surrounded by a handsome cut stone platform, which was heavy

enough to stand ordinary rough weather, but which, with the rubble stone

on which it was laid, was constantly washed away by heavy storms from

the sea front of the lighthouse, leaving the base of the latter exposed and

liable to be undermined, and causing heavy annual expense from hauling

the rubble back again, to be again scattered in the next gale. The light-

house base and foreshore are now protected by large blocks weighing

140 tons each, two of which were carried at a trip by the floating shears

and dropped on the irregular foreshore in front of the lighthouse, which

they now protect from the violence of the sea which breaks on them before

reaching the lighthouse. This work was exposed to the full brunt of the

great storm of January 3rd, 1877, which nearly cut across the east pier

of Howth Harbour and did considerable damage to the paved slope of

Kingstown West Pier, and to the railways both at Monkstown and at

Howth, which, strange to say, were apparently completely covered by

their respective piers. The big blocks, however, protected the base of

Poolbeg Lighthouse, and no damage whatever occurred to it. Besides

excavating, the diving bell has been used for removing portions of wreck

and pulling up pile stumps in deep water, in which latter operation it is
very successful, and three or four pile stumps can be drawn at one effort
by attaching chains hanging from the ceiling of the bell chamber to the
heads of the piles, and then raising the pile by its hoisting chains, which
have a surplus working strength of about seventy tons when the bell is
under water.

    Account of the Calculation of the Factor Table for the Fourth Million.

A description of the different factor tables that have been .published

is given in the British Association Report, 1873, pp. 34-40 ; and a more
complete historical account of factor tables, especially of Felkel's and the
manuscript tables of the last century is contained in the ' Proceedings of
the Cambridge Philosophical Society,' vol. hi. part iv. pp. 99-138, 1878.

It is only necessary, therefore, to give a brief notice of the extensive

tables that have been published during the present century, and which
it is the object of the Committee to complete.

     These tables are :
     (1). Chernac's Cribrum Arithmeticum, which gives all factors of all
numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 from 1 to 1,000,000.
     (2). Burckhardt's Table des Diviseurs, which gives the least factor of
all numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 from 1 to 3,036,000."

     (3). Dase's Factoren Tafeln, which give the least factor of all num-

bers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 from 6,000,000 to 9,000,000.

-- The reason of the gap between 3,036,000 and 6,000,000 is as follows
   Burckhardt completed the publication of his three millions in 1817, and
some time previous so 1849 Crelle presented to the Berlin Academy the
manuscript of the factor tables for the fourth, fifth, and sixth millions.
In 1850 Gauss urged Dase to calculate factor tables for the seventh,
eighth, ninth, and tenth millions, as the three intermediate millions
were in the possession of the Berlin Academy, and he did not doubt
that sooner or later they would be published. In 1860, through the

support of friends in his native town, Hamburg, Dase, who was
distinguished for his ability in calculation, was enabled to devote him-
self wholly to the carrying out of Gauss's project. On September

11th, 1861, he died suddenly, leaving the seventh million complete and
the eighth million nearly complete; he had also determined a great
number of the factors for the ninth and tenth millions. Dr. Rosen-
berg, of Hamburg, undertook the continuation of the work, and the

seventh million was published at Hamburg in 1862, the eighth in

1863, and the ninth in 1865. In the preface to the ninth million it is
stated that the tenth million was near completion. There was thus left

ON MATHEMATICAL TABLES.                                    173

a gap of three millions between the third and seventh millions, which

it was very desirable to fill up not only for the sake of completing the

table up to nine millions, but also in order to render more useful the

millions already published. Accordingly, Professor Cayley, the chair-

man of the Committee, wrote to Professor Kummer, the secretary of the

Mathematical Section of the Berlin Academy, asking if there were any

chance of the publication of the manuscript ; and Professor Kummer, in a

letter dated April 29th, 1877, replied that it had been examined on a

former occasion, and found to be so inaccurate that " the Academy was
convinced that the publication would never be advisable." The calcula-
tion was then at once commenced by Mr. James Glaisher, with the assis-
tance of two computers, and has been continued without interruption since.
The fourth million is completed and ready for press, and some progress
has been made with the fifth and sixth millions, which are being calcu-

lated together, and which will be completed, it is believed, by the meeting
of the Association at Sheffield. The tenth million has not been published.

It remained in the possession of the widow of Dr. Rosenberg till the early
part of the present year, when it was presented by her to the Berlin
Academy.

The method employed in the calculation of the fourth million, and by

which the fifth and sixth millions are being calculated, is practically

the same as that which was invented by Burckhardt, and was adopted by

Dase. As the method is a very remarkable one, and as no description

of it (with the exception of a brief notice by Burckhardt himself) has

been published, the following account of it is given here :

   A form was lithographed (Plate rV\), having 78 vertical lines and 81

horizontal lines (besides several other lines used for headings, <fec.) ; it is

thus divided into 77 x 80 oblong spaces which may for convenience be

called squares. The eighty rows are numbered, at the extreme left of the

sheet, 01,07... 97; 01,03. ..99; 03,09,. ..99; there being two white spaces

separating the hundreds. This is the same as in Burckhardt's or Dase's

tables, each column representing 300 numbers. The advantage of having 77

columns is that the 7's and ll's are lithographed on the form and have not

to be determined and inserted by hand. Thus if 77 consecutive columns

of Burckhardt's tables be taken, and all the headings and tabular results

except 7's and ll's be supposed to be removed, we have a representation of

the form. The form actually used was constructed to begin from 3,000,000,

so that for the exact representation of it we are to commence with the

column headed 201 on p. 3 of Burckhardt's table (i.e., the 68th column).

     Since each sheet corresponds to 77 X 300 numbers, a million -occupies

about 43^ sheets, and as on each sheet the number of 7's lithographed is

880, and the number of ll's is 480, it follows that, by adopting a form

which permits the 7's and ll's to be lithographed, about 59,000 entries

are saved in each million ; and, what is even more important, the accuracy

of these 59,000 tabular results is assured.

The squares to which the least factor 13 belongs were obtained as fol-

+lows : Find the numbers between 3,000,000 and 3,000,000 13 x 300,

which are divisible by 13, but not by 2, 3, or 5. Take 13 consecutive

columns of any blank form and cut them off from the rest of the form
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

then, supposing the first column to correspond to the column headed

3,000,000, make a mark in the squares that correspond to the multiples of

We13, previously found, and cutout the squares so marked.  thus have

a group of 13 columns, from which a number of squares (80) have been

removed, and which may be called a screen or sieve. Place the sieve over

the first 13 columns of the first sheet of the fourth million ; then either
empty squares or squares containing a 7 or 11 will appear through the
holes of the sieve ; in each empty square write the number 13. Then
place the sieve over the next 13 columns and proceed as before, and so on
throughout the whole 44 sheets.

     The sieve for the next prime, 17, contains 17 columns, and is made in
the same way, viz., by cutting out the squares corresponding to the num-

+bers between 3,000,000 and 3,000,000 17 x 300, which are divisible by

17, and not by 2, 3, or 5. Then this sieve is placed over the first 17
columns, and 17 entered in all the empty squares, then placed over the next

17, &c, and so on.
     The sieves for 13 and 17 are drawn in the plate (Plate TV.), the

shaded squares being those that are cut out. The 13-sieve is formed of
the first thirteen columns of one of the sheets, and the margin, con-
taining the figures 01,07,..., is retained in order to show the arrangement
of the form, which contains 77 columns. Of course in using the sieve
this margin is cut off as in the 17-sieve. The 13-sieve shows the num-

bers between 3,000,000 and 3,000,000 + 13 x 300 which have least factors

7, 11, or 13 ; thus, for example, from the third column we see that

3,000,613  3,000,739                     3,000,823
3,000,641  3,000,767                     3,000,851
3,000,683  3,000,781                     3,000,893
3,000,697  3,000,809

have 7 as their least factor ; that

3,000,679  3,000,811                     3,000,877
3,000,701  3,000,833                     3,000,899

have 11 as their least factor, and that

3,000,647  3,000,751                     3,000,829
3,000,673  3,000,803                     3,000,881

have 13 as their least factor. Of course the numbers such as 3,000,179,
for which 7 appears in a shaded square, have 7 as their least factor, and
are also divisible by 13 ; and similarly, when 11 appears in a shaded square,
the number has 11 for its least factor and is also divisible by 13.

     The 80 argument numbers 01, 07,. ..97 ; 01, 03,.. .99 ; 03, 09,. ..99 cor-

lithographed on the form, but the headings of the columns of course are
different for each sheet and are written in. Each page in the printed

tion- is that the original sheets, when completed, are sent to the printer as

they stand, so that there is no copying required.

somewhat smaller form would have sufficed, but this gives ample space
in each square for four figures, and was not found to be inconveniently

the purpose. The sieves drawn in the plate have been reduced to suit

multiple of 13 exceeding 3,000,000 is 3,000,023 : add 26 continually till
3,000,000 -f- 13 x 300 is reached, and then throw out the multiples of 3
and 5 ; there are thus left 80 numbers, which correspond to the squares
to be cut out from the sieve. The accuracy of the 80 numbers that
remain was verified by differencing them ; as the differences recur with a

period of eight.*

     In general the sieve for the prime p contains p columns, and it is to be

noted that every sieve, whatever its length, has exactly 80 squares cut
out, one in each line. To show that there must be one square cut out in
each line it is only necessary to observe that p must have some multiple,

+not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, of the form 300 q a, where a is any one of the

80 numbers less than 300 and prime to it. For, by a known theorem, if

p be prime to r, and if p, 2p, 3p,. . . (r-- 1) p be divided by r, the remainders

--are the r 1, numbers 1, 2, 3,...r-- 1 ; in this case, therefore, if p, 2p, 3p,

...299p be divided by 300, the remainders are the 299 numbers 1, 2, 3,...

299, and if 2p, 3p,4p,... and all the multiples of p divisible by 2, 3, or 5 be

thrown out, the remainders divisible by 2, 3, or 5 are thrown out also, and
the remainders left are the 80 numbers less than 300 and prime to it. Also,

there cannot be two squares in the same line cut out from the sieve, for a

being a given number, if 3002 + a be divisible by^>, the next number in
+the same line divisible by p is 300qp a, viz.,.is a number^ columns fur-

ther on.

     The cube root of 4,000,000 is 158 - 74..., and in a factor table extend-
ing to 4,000,000, the prime 157 appears once, and only once, as the least
factor of a three-factor number, viz., for 3,869,893. Thus 163 and larger
primes will only occur as least factors of two-factor numbers, and we

may find the numbers to which they belong without the use of the sieves

as follows :

     Supposing that we are constructing a factor table from the commence-
ment, the least factor 163 first appears at the number 163 x 163, then at
167x163, 173x163, 179x163, 181x163, &c. ; 163, 167, 173, 179, 181,
&c, being the series of primes starting from 163 ; for we only consider

products of two primes, of which 163 is the smaller, that is, numbers
formed by multiplying l63 by the primes greater than itself. To obtain

the results of the multiplications it is only necessary to add to 163 x 163
the product 4 x 163, and to this 6 x 163, &c. ; the work standing thus

&c.  «fec.

    p* It is easily seen that this must be so ; for form the multiples of the prime

that are not divisible by 2, 3, or 5; these are p, Ip, Up, 13/>, Up, 19p, 23p, 29p,
then the next eight are obtained by adding 30/; to each of these and so on. Thus

the differences are 6p, ip, 2p, ip, 2p, 4p, 6p, 2p, recurring with a period of eight.

     This process will give all the numbers to which 163 belongs as least

=factor up to (163) 3 4,330,747, where the three-factor numbers commence.

All that is required in order to reduce this to mere addition is a list of

differences of consecutive primes from 163 to y^Z, I being the limit of the

table, supposed less than 4,330,747, and a small table of even multiples of

163 from 2 x 163 to 2m X 163, 2m being the greatest difference between

two consecutive primes between these limits. If I be 4,000,000, the nearest

prime below j^l is 24,533 ; and the greatest difference is 52, between

19,609 and 19,661.* The accuracy of the work can be verified at any

stage and as often as thought necessary by multiplying together the two

factors. Of course in the calculation of the fourth million the commence-

=ment would be made at 18,413 x 163 3,001,319, the smallest number

exceeding 3,000,000 to which the least factor 163 belongs.

There are thus two distinct methods, each of which has its special

advantages, viz., the sieve method and the method by calculation of multi-

ples. The latter is unsuitable for small primes, which appear as least

factors  of  numbers  having  three  or  more  prime factors                                                                 in  fact,  this

method is only appropriate for two-factor numbers. On the other hand,

the sieve method is rather more suitable for the entry of small primes, as,

when the prime is large, the great size of the sieve is inconvenient ; this

method, however, points out all multiples of the prime, not divisible by

2, 3, or 5, whether they be two-factor, three-factor, four-factor, &c,

numbers.

It is clear that up to 163 the sieve method should be used ; and that for

163 and beyond we may employ the multiple method. Burckhardt states

that he used sieves for primes up to 500, and the multiple method for

higher primes. In the calculation of the fourth million sieves were used

for primes up to and including 307, and the multiple method was employed

for primes from 211 to 1999. The numbers corresponding to the least

factors from 211 to 307 inclusive were obtained by both methods.

As the multiple method only gives numbers where the least factor is

the given prime p, it follows that every number so found must correspond'
to an empty square, and the verification thus afforded of the entries

already made was very valuable.

The sieve for 307 contains 307 columns, and therefore occupies four

sheets all but one column : considered as a whole, therefore, it has only

to be moved 11 times for the million, while the sieve for 13 has to be-

moved 257 times.f

Before the calculation was begun, it seemed as if the excessive length

72(31,397 31,469). For a list of the differences that exceed 50 and other allied
tables, see ' Messenger of Mathematics,' vol. vii. pp. 174-175 (March, 1878).

     f In the fourth million the 13's were entered by a sieve consisting of 13 columns,

the 17's by a sieve of 17 columns, and so on. In the fifth and sixth millions now in
progress, the 13*s were entered by a sieve of 78 columns, equivalent to six 13-sieves
fixed together. This was found to greatly facilitate the entries, as the number of

removals of the sieve was reduced in the proportion of 6 to 1, and there was less
risk of error. The saving of time effected by the use of the 78-column sieve
amounted to nearly one-half. For the 17's a sieve of 5 x 17, = 85, columns was
used, for the 19's a sieve of 4 x 19, = 76, columns, and so on, the number of columns
being made as nearly as possible equal to the number of columns (77) on a sheet.
It was found also that by the use of the long sieves the sheets were much better
preserved from wear and tear, as the sheet upon which the factors were being
entered was in general almost wholly covered by the sieve, and so protected from

friction, &c.

of the sieves (the 307-sieve is 10 feet 6 inches in length, and the
499-sieve 17 feet 1 inch) is productive of great inconvenience, and would
also necessitate very great accuracy and care in the lithographing and

printing of the sheets, so that the squares should correspond exactly, over

so great a distance ; and it seemed surprising that Burckhardt should

have continued the sieve method so far. But this was on the supposition
that the portions of the sieve would he all fixed together, so that it would

consist of one long sheet. Experience, however, soon showed that nothing

was gained by fixing the sheets together, and in fact that it was a positive
inconvenience to do so. The sheets forming the sieve were numbered 1,

2, 3, &c, and all that was requisite was to use sheet 1 first, then sheet 2,

then sheet 3, then sheet 1 again (if the sieve consisted of only 3 sheets),
and so on ; in fact, the long sieves were found to be quite as easy to use

as the smaller ones. Above 307, however, it seemed to be scarcely worth

while to construct the sieves, as so little use was made of them, and as the

multiple method was preferable in consequence of the verification afforded

by it.

The mode of work was as follows : The entries were made by the

sieves, and one multiple of $ obtained from each position of the £>-sieve

was divided out by p, in order to verify that the sieve was always rightly
placed ; this verification was employed for each position of every sieve. The

numbers were then examined by Mr. Glaisher himself by the sieves. They

were then examined a third time by the sieves, and every number ticked.

The least factors obtained by the multiple method were read out and

entered on the sheets ; and they were subsequently read out again in a

different manner and ticked. Any numbers found unticked were after-

wards specially examined. The proofs of the table when printed will be

read with the original calculations of numbers by the multiple method.

On the whole the method of construction is a very perfect one. It has

been explained in some detail, because Burckhardt contents himself with

a very brief sketch occupying only two paragraphs ; and the process is

sufficiently interesting to deserve a more complete account. Bach sieve,

as stated, has 80 squares cut out, one in each line ; though of course, as

there are only 80 squares cut out, whatever be the length of the sieve,

many of the columns on the longer sieves are left intact. The patterns

formed by the holes in the sieves were very curious, some being very

regular, while in others the holes were very scattered, and no two were

much alike. The sieves for 149 and 151 were remarkable, the holes

running steadily up in the one case and steadily down in the other.* The

reason for this is that these numbers are nearly equal to the half of 300,

the difference between two adjacent squares in the same line, so that

numbers distant from one another by even multiples of 150 are in the

same line. For a similar reason the holes in the sieves for 59 and 61, and

29 and 31, show a steady ascent and descent. When the sieve for 23 is

laid in its proper position on any one of the sheets a slightly ascending

row of 13's (including some  7's and ll's)  is seen through  the  holes                           this
                                                                                               ;

=scending row of 7's is seen, as 7 X 43 301, and other instances of the

same kind were remarked. It may be observed that when the pattern

was regular (as in the case of the 13-sieve and 17-sieve, where the holes
slope down in parallel lines) the entry of the factors was much facilitated.

Great care was always required in order to be certain that no factor had

escaped entry ; but this examination was much more rapidly performed when

the pattern was fairly regular. The size of the volume would, however, be

increased very greatly if all the factors were given, without any propor-

tionate advantage. Burckhardt's arrangement of the table is an admirable

piece  of  condensation,  p    the  least                                                                                                                                                          factors of  9,000 numbers  are given,  in

                           as

the space of half a square foot, on each page.

It will be evident from this description that it would be just as easy

to enter all prime factors in the table as to enter only the least ; and if all
the prime factors were entered the verification would be easier, and in the

numbers entered by the multiple method no error could occur, unless the
same mistake were made independently in entering both factors.

     The methods described in this section are no doubt practically iden-

tical with those employed by Burckhardt, and the calculation of the million

suggested no improvements upon them, except in a few matters of detail.
The construction of the table, though very simple in theory, required such

continual care at every step, and such constant supervision, that it could

not be undertaken by any one who was not prepared to devote a great

portion of his time to the work.                                                                                                                                                                               ·

   Rate of Increase of Underground Temperature downwards in

   various Localities of Dry Land and under Water. Drawn up

   by Professor Everett {Secretary).

Dr. Stapff has continued his observations of the temperature in the

St. Gothard Tunnel, and has contributed to the Swiss Natural History

Society a paper* of 56 quarto pages, embodying the results.

The following is his description (pp. 26, 27) of the mode of observing

the temperature of the rocks in the tunnel :

" The exact determination of the temperature of the rocks in the tun-

nel formerly occasioned a notable expenditure of time and money. At

first thermometers about a metre long (made by J. Goldschmid, of Zurich)

were employed for this purpose                                                                                                                                                                     their tubes being cemented into a wooden

projected below, and the scale (extending from 15° to 30° C.) above.

Tallow was poured round the wooden cylinder, and the whole thermo-

meter was then thrust into a bore-hole a metre deep, so that only the

scale projected, from which readings were taken from time to time nntil
the temperature became constant. The final reading had to be corrected

not only for rise of zero but also for the temperature of the quicksilver in

the thermometer tube which extends from the opening to the bottom of
the bore-hole. Another very notable correction was required for the
more or less oblique position of the thermometer; for the hydrostatic

pressure of the quicksilver presses out the glass bulb so far that without

change of temperature the long thermometer reads from                                             o- 4  to     o-  less

in the vertical than in the horizontal position.

" After about from three to ten days, the reading of a thermometer

luted into a bore-hole ceased to alter.
      " Separate trials with thermometers of similar construction, but different

length, showed moreover that, after months, the temperature of the rock
at about a metre deep was still unchanged. This is obviously owing to

the small difference of temperature between the rock and the surrounding

air.

    "From the observations at No. 8 and No. 15, in Table III., it is seen

that the temperature at the bottom of the bore-hole was sometimes a little
lower and sometimes a little higher than nearer its mouth.

     " This mode of observing gave correct results, but was laborious and
costly, not only on account of the necessity of making special bore-holes

for the purpose, but because almost every experiment cost a thermometer.

The projecting end was often maliciously broken off, and on account of

the swelling of the wooden case it almost never happened that at the end

of an experiment a thermometer was drawn out again uninjured.

" Hermann and Pfister remedied this latter evil by surrounding the

thermometer tube, from the bulb to the scale, with a glass case, and this

with a steel jacket. This arrangement, however, involves not only con-

duction through the steel, but also continual interchange of heat by

currents of air in the glass case, from the mouth to the bottom of the hole.

For these reasons the observations made with these thermometers could

not be employed without intricate corrections.

    " Later I tried a Thomson's maximum thermometer,* kindly placed at

my disposal by Professor Everett, which (after previous strong cooling)

was left for several days at the bottom of the bore-hole, closed air-tight.

The results agreed with those obtained by  other  methods                                         but       who    can
                                                                                               ;

guarantee that the higher temperature prevailing in a newly-bored hole

is always just so much depressed by the cold mass of the thermometer

and its copper case, that the rock temperature alone determines the final

indication of the maximum thermometer.

" This consideration induced me to employ for rock-temperature

observations (and they also serve for air and water observations) the

above-mentioned short thermometers with insulated bulbs, the first of

which Professor Everett caused to be made by Negretti and Zambra

for this express purpose. These thermometers, enclosed in a metal

box provided with a handle, are thrust to the bottom of the bore-hole, which

is at least a metre deep. To the handle is fastened a strong cord reach-

ing to the mouth of the hole, by which it can be drawn out again at

the end of the trial. The bore-hole, from the thermometer to the

mouth, is stopped with greased rag or other similar material, as air-

tight as possible. After two or three days, the thermometers have

usually assumed the temperature of the surrounding rock, that is to
say, their reading has ceased to alter. The insulation of the quick-
silver prevents alterations during the drawing out and reading of the

thermometer. The correctness of the result is in no way prejudiced
by sediment from the boring which may yet remain in the hole-. The
pouring in of some water may even be useful in accelerating the experi-
ment. Wet bore-holes with standing water are, however, to be avoided,

because rock- temperature and water-temperature are not identical.
     " In the manner last described, at every available opportunity, that

is to say, when the work of the tunnel is from any cause compelled to
cease for a few days, rock-temperature observations are now instituted in
bore-holes ready to our hand. The observations are simple, give exact
results if taken with proper precaution and sufficient duration of the
experiment, and cause no further expense, since the thermometers, being
sunk in the rock, are secured against wanton injury, and there are always

bore-holes available."

     Dr. Stapff further states by letter that, the two original thermometers
supplied by Negretti and Zambra having been broken, he has had others
made, in which he has introduced the improvement of hermetically seal-
ing the outer glass case, instead of closing it with a waxed cork, which
gradually admitted moisture.

     In the Report for 1876 an account was given of the observations of
Herr Dunker in a bore about 4000 feet deep at Sperenberg, and allusion
was made to the undue weight which had been attached by some writers
to the empirical formula in which Herr Dunker sums up his observations ;
a formula which indicates a retarded rate of increase, and, if extended to

greater depths, leads to the conclusion that the temperature reaches its

maximum at the depth of about a mile.

    A discussion has been carried on in Germany on this subject,* chiefly

in the ' Neues Jahrbuch fiir Mineralogie,'&e, and the best authorities seem
to be unanimous in rejecting the hypothesis of a retarded rate of increase
in the earth's surface as unwarranted, either by the Sperenberg observa-
tions or any others. Herr Dunker himself concurs in this opinion. Dr.

Stapff also, though some of his own empirical formula? indicate a retarded

 rate of increase, writes to Professor Everett in the following terms :

" As to my formulas, I beg you to remember that they are not con-

structed for expressing laws of Nature. They simply are made for
facilitating the view over a heap of figures and data of observation. And

genei'ally I beg you to be sure that those formulas in my mind cannot

express any law for the increase of warmth at greater depths than those
in which the tunnel observations were made. The formulas give good
means for eliminating empirically some of the influences of the shape of
surface which occur in the profile of the mountain."

    Mr. W. Galloway, one of H. M. Inspectors of Mines, has taken

observations in Fowler's Colliery, Pontypridd, South Wales. The shaft
is 846 feet deep, and the air current down it amounts to between twenty
and thirty thousand cubic feet per minute.

      In order to determine the normal temperature of the coal, a hole 1^-
inch in diameter was bored in the side of a narrow place that was being

the depth of four feet. The thermometer (one of the Committee's slow-

action non-registering instruments) was placed at the inner end then a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

wooden cylinder of nearly the same diameter as the bore-hole, and 9 inches

long, was pushed in until it came in contact with the copper case of the

thermometer                                                              and lastly a wooden plug,  wrapped  round  with cloth,  was
                                                                      ;

driven firmly into the mouth of the hole. The thermometer was at 58° F.

when it was put into the hole, and after remaining there from 2 p.m. on

August 25th, 1876, to 3.45 p.m. on the following day, it stood at 62°7.

There was no water whatever in the hole, and the depth below the surface

of the ground was 855 feet.
     The circumstances of this observation seem to preclude any consider-

able disturbance of the normal temperature ; and combining it with the

mean annual temperature at the surface, which is said to be 51 0, 5, we

have an increase of ll°-2 F. in 855 feet ; which is at the rate of 1° F. for
76 feet.

    Two other observations were taken in other parts of the mine. They

are not directly available for the purposes of the Committee, but were

intended to test the influence of air-currents on the temperature of the
coal ; and they show variations of 2° or 3° according to the season of

the year.

     Observations are being taken for the Committee by Mr. G. F. Deacon,
Borough Engineer of Liverpool, in a bore which has attained the depth

of 1004 feet, in connexion with the Liverpool Waterworks at Bootle.

The temperature at this depth is 58°1. The observation nearest the

surface was at the depth of 226 feet, the temperature at this depth
Webeing 52°.
                                                                         have here a difference of 6°'l in 778 feet, which is at the

rate of 1° for 128 feet, and the same rate is approximately maintained

throughout the descent. For instance, at 750 feet the temperature was
56°, which gives 1° for 131 feet by comparison with the depth of 226 feet,
and 1° for 121 feet by comparison with the bottom.

     The bore is 24 inches in diameter, and the observations were taken

with a protected Phillips's maximum thermometer every Monday morning.
The operation of boring was continued up to twelve o'clock on Saturday

night, and was not resumed till the temperature had been taken on the
following Monday. The time that the thermometer remained at the
bottom was not less than a quarter of an hour, and was sometimes half
an hour.

The rock-formation consists of the pebble beds of the Bunter or lower

trias, and most of it is described as hard, close-grained, and compact.

The speed of boring is indicated by the dates of the observations at

226 and 1004 feet, the former being Nov. 12th, 1877, and the latter

AAug. 12th, 1878.                                                        month was lost by the jamming of the drilling

tool, in May and June, 1878, when a depth of about 890 feet had been

attained.

     The depth from the surface of the ground to the surface of water in
the bore has gradually decreased from 66 feet, when the bore was at 318
feet, to 52 feet when the bore was at 800 feet, and to 51-1 feet at the
present depth. It would thus appear that the inflow of water from below
has increased with the depth attained. There is a slow percolation
from the upper part of the water-column to an underground reservoir
near at hand, the top of the water-column being considerably higher than

the top of the water in the reservoir. Mr. Deacon remarks that the
                                                                           ;

182 report-- 1878.

slow upward flow which supplies the water for this gradual discharge 13

favourable to the accuracy of the observations (which have always been
taken at the bottom,) by checking the tendency of the colder and

heavier upper water to descend and mix with the lower. As bearing on
the subject of the disturbance of temperature by the stirring of the
water in boring, as well as by the generation of heat in the concussions of
the tool, it may be mentioned that the last observation before the month's
interruption by the jamming of the tool was o7°'5, at 886 feet, and the
first observation after the extraction of the tool, was 57o- 0, at 898-6 feet

the former being on May 20th, and the latter on July 1st. The smallness

of the difference between these two temperatures seems to indicate
smallness of disturbance by the action of the tool.

     It appears from these various circumstances that the observations are
entitled to considerable weight, and that the rate of increase of tempera-
ture downwards at Liverpool is exceptionally slow. It will be remembered

that the rate found by Mr. Fairbairn, at Dukinfield Colliery, in the

adjacent county (Cheshire), was also very slow, though not nearly so slow

--as that indicated by these Liverpool observations. (See our Report in

the Volume for 1870.)

Mr. E. Wethered, of Weston, near Bath, has also commenced obser-

vations in a colliery in that neighbourhood. Mr. J. Merivale, of Ned-

derton, near Morpeth, has received a thermometer for observations in a
colliery. Mr. J. T. Boot, of Hucknall, near Mansfield, has received a
second thermometer (in place of a broken one) for observations in a deep
bore, and Mr. Rowland Gascoigne, of the same town, has received one for
a similar purpose.

     In the eleven years which have elapsed since the appointment of this
Committee, a large amount of useful work has been done, by methods of

observation not requiring any elaborate or expensive appliances, or any

special training on the part of the observers.

Two difficulties are encountered in investigating underground tem-
Weperature.
             have to contrive instruments which shall truly indicate

the temperature at the point of observation, and we* have further to

ensure that this temperature shall be the same at the time of observation

as it was before the locality was artificially disturbed.

As regards the first of these difficulties, the Committee have been

completely successful, and have largely increased the resources at the

command of observers.

     But in regard to the second difficulty, the same amount of success
has not been attained. The circulation of water in bore-holes and of air
in mines are disturbing elements difficult to deal with. Even such firm
plugging as was employed to isolate portions of the water-column in the

great bore at Sperenberg cannot altogether remove the error arising from

convective disturbance ; for the long-continued presence of water at a

temperature different from that proper to the depth affects the tempera-

ture of the surrounding rocks, and the temporary isolation of a short
column would not abolish this source of error, even if the plugs them-

selves were impervious to conduction and convection.

After the experience which has now been gained of rough and ready

methods, it is time to consider the propriety of resorting to a more-

special method, which has been more than once suggested, but has

hitherto been postponed on account of the additional labour and skill
which would be requisite for carrying it out.

ON THE EXPLORATION OF THE FERMANAGH CAVES.  183

     There can be no doubt that the surest way to bring any point of a
boring to its original temperature is to fill up the bore, and reduce it as
nearly as possible to its original condition. Several instruments have
been contrived which, when buried in the earth, with wires coming from
them to the surface, admit of having their temperature observed by

electrical means.

     One of these is Siemens' resistance thermometer, another is Wheat-
stone's telegraphic thermometer, of which a description will be found in
the Report of the Dundee Meeting of the British Association ; another
is Becquerel's thermo-electric apparatus, which has been employed by its
inventor and his son and grandson for some forty years. It is described
in the following terms in the first report of this Committee (1868) :

     " The thermo-electric method might also be followed with great

advantage. Two wires, one of iron and the other of copper, insulated by

gutta-percha or some other covering, as in submarine cables, and
connected at their ends, might be let down, so as to bring their lower
junction to the point where the temperature is to be taken, their upper
junction being immersed in a basin of water, and the circuit completed

through a galvanometer. The temperature of the water in the basin

might then be altered till the galvanometer gave zero indication."

    Sir Wm. Thomson now adds the recommendation, that, in carrying

out this method, the two wires, each well covered with gutta-percha,
should be twisted together ; that the wires should be stout and as homo-
geneous as possible throughout, and that a piece of stout copper tube
should be attached to the lower junction, this tube being uncovered and
in close contact with the earth all round, its purpose being to ensure that

the junction takes the proper temperature.

     It would probably be desirable, in filling up the bore, to mix clay
with the original material, to render it watertight, for it would be
impossible to render the filling of the bore as compact as the surrounding

rock.

     Several pairs of wires would be buried in the same bore, with their

lower junctions at different carefully measured depths.
     The upper junctions would be kept in a room provided with a steady

table for a mirror-galvanometer.

Report of the Committee, consisting of the Rev. Dr. Haughton, Prof.

   Leith Adams, Prof. Barrett, Mr. Hardman, and Dr. Macalister,
   appointed for the purpose of Exploring the Fermanagh Caves.

   Drawn up by Mr. Thomas Plunkett, Enniskillen, for Dr. Mac-

    alister, Secretary of the Committee.

Probably there is no locality in Ireland where there are so many

interesting caves found as in the region of Knockmore, in Fermanagh.
Fifteen of these caves have been explored during the past three years,
every one of which yielded memorials of man, and were no doubt used by

--savage tribes as dwelling-places.
     A. The first cave explored this year was partially excavated last year.
It penetrates a deep escarpment on the eastern side of a rocky hill, and

attains a length of about fifty yards, and in width varies from three to

nine feet. The floor was irregularly formed, some parts of it being quite

level, but in some places the floor passed in with a very swift incline.

The first or top layer was composed of dark mould, and varied in

thickness from one to two feet deep. In this layer bones of the sheep,

goat, and Bos longifrons were found, also some sea shells and a large iron

cloak-pin or skewer, 5^ inches long, which had a ring on the head or larger

end of the pin. Underneath this stratum there was a deposit of rock debris

and yellow clay, in which were found large angular blocks of limestone

which had fallen from the roof. This stratum was very irregular in depth,

and varied from  two  to  eight                                                                                                                                      feet  deep                         charcoal, rude  pottery, and  a
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;
-- --very large quantity of animal bones some of them broken were dug

out of this stratum, also flint flakes and one bone pin. Underneath the

above deposit there was a layer of calcareous breccia, covered over in

some places with sheets of  stalagmite the latter in                                                                                                                                                            some    places attained
                                                                                    ;

a thickness of two feet. Animal bones were found embedded in the stalag-

mite, also charcoal, and in the stratum underneath, on which the sheets

of stalagmite rested, bone pins and flint flakes were found associated with

broken bones.*

The next stratum reached during the excavation was composed of

brown tenacious clay, which resembled brick earth and rested on gravel,

and was no doubt deposited at the period when water traversed the cave.

This was excavated to a depth of ten feet, but no animal remains or work

--of art was found in it.
     B. " The Ram's Cave " was the second explored, and occurs in the

top of a cliff several hundred feet high. It is a small chamber, about

four feet high and ten feet long, and was very dry inside. The deposit on

the surface of the floor was composed of black mould, which had a depth

of two feet, and contained charcoal, burnt bones, and a bronze pin. The

next stratum was composed of a gravelly kind of earth, and contained a

few angular blocks of limestone. This stratum yielded rude pottery,

--charcoal, and the bones of the red deer, wild boar, goat, sheep, and fox.
     C. The third cave examined was about six feet wide, and extended

into the rock for a distance of twelve feet. This cave yielded a large

quantity of broken pottery, some of it very rude. The first stratum re-
moved was composed of carbonate of lime mingled with brown earth, and

contained bones of the pig and red deer, and pieces of pottery which bore

traces of ornamentation. The next layer removed was" of an average thick-

ness of about eighteen inches, and was composed of dark mould, and con-

tained a quantity of charcoal and rude pottery devoid of any ornamen-

tation, also broken bones belonging to Bos longifrons, horse, deer, dog,
and sheep.

  --D. The fourth cave explored opens out on a rocky slope, and the

surface of the floor passes in with a gentle incline for a distance of thirty

yards, when the passage becomes entirely choked up with a deposit of

stalagmite. The surface of the floor was covered over from end to end

with rough angular limestones                                                                                                                                        while  these                       stones  were being removed,
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

bones of the horse and boar were found mingled with them. These stones

rested on a deposit of yellow clay and carbonate of lime. During the

removal of this stratum a quantity of animal bones were found associated

     * The bones have been submitted to Dr. Macalister for examination, and his

report will be presented to the next meeting of the Association. The caves have no
local names, so we have indicated them by letters.

with charcoal ; nothing else of any interest was found during the explora-
tion except the tusk of a boar, which was whetted to a sharp edge, and

--probably was used as a knife by the cave-dwellers.
     E. " Shining Rock " cave enters a rock on the south side of Knock-

more, and prior to its excavation was nearly filled to the roof with rubbish

and debris. The top stratum was almost entirely composed of vegetable

earth, and of an average depth of two feet, and yielded some bones of fox,

dog, and deer. The layer underlying this contained a quantity of bronze

or iron clay, also bones of the pig, deer, and rabbit. Near the bottom

Aof the cave a quantity of bones were found in calcareous breccia.

shells were found.

    The explorations were suspended after the exploration of F cave, as

the probability is that none of the caves in this district will yield bones

of extinct mammalia or objects of any great interest.

Sixth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Prestwich,

   Or. H. Morton, D. Mackintosh, R. H. Tiddeman, J. E. Lee,

   and Mr. Molyneux, appointed for the purpose of recording the
   position, height above the sea, lithological characters, size, and
   origin of the Erratic Blocks of England, Wales, and Ireland,
   reporting other matters of interest connected with the same, and
   taking measures for their preservation. Drawn up by the
   Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Secretary.

This Committee has pursued its inquiries, and is able to record many
new and important observations. In many districts, however, the obser-
vations are not yet completed, and it will be necessary for the work of

the Committee to be continued for some time, before they can be justified
in classifying the facts collected, or in presenting any theoretical con-

clusions.

     The Committee are favoured with the following notes on Boulders
near Kendal by Mr. J. R. Dakyns :

     The most remarkable boulders near Kendal are those of the granite of
Wastdale Crag, near Shap Wells. These boulders are specially interest-
ing, for two reasons : in the first place, boulders of the granite of Wastdale
Crag, or the Shap Granite, as it is often called, can be readily identified
186 kepokt-- 1878.

by means of the large crystals of pink orthoclase felspar which the rock

contains ; and, secondly, the distribution of these boulders near Kendal
would seem to show that they must have travelled over the high ground

south of the granite area, and not followed the course of the present drain-

age                  for I                       have traced these boulders,  north of  Kendal,  directly towards
                  ;

this area on the one hand, while on the other hand I have not noticed

them in the depression extending from Kendal to the river Lune, along

which the London and North -Western Railway runs, east of Docker Garth
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  j

but as I have not minutely examined this part of the country, I cannot

say which is the precise eastern limit of the boulders. It seems, then, that

the Shap granite boulders came nearly due south from Shap Fells, across

the high ground over which the old coach road goes from Kendal to

Shap. The highest point where the granite occurs in place, viz., Sleddale

Pike, 1659 feet above the sea, is higher than the greater part of this

ground                                           but the greater part of the granite area is lower than the ground
                                              ;

across which the boulders travelled in their southerly course ; nor is there

immediately to the north of the granite any ground as high as the granitic

fell itself. The greater part of this fell, sloping northward, drains into

Wet Sleddale, whose waters, forming the river Lowther, flow north, and,

joining the Eden, go out to sea by the Solway ; the remaining small por-

tion, including the site of the quarries, facing southward, overlooks Wast-

dale Beck. This beck flows N.E. along the strike of the rocks to Shap

Wells, where its waters turn sharp at more than a right angle, and thence

flow S.S.E., and join the Lune at Tebay. On the south side of Wastdale

rise the Upper Silurian falls to the heights of 1691, 1589, 1494, 1588,

1544, 1523 feet above the sea ; the lowest part of the range being the

Hause, over which the coach road goes. The height of this point is not

given on the Ordnance one-inch map ; but it is between 1300 and 1500

feet above the sea, and is probably over 1400. Across this high ground

the Shap granite boulders travelled south from their parent rock, which

attains an extreme height of 1659 feet at its most westerly outcrop, and

a height of 1478 on its steep southward face ; while north of these points
the granitic area falls gently away northward, the centre of the area being

about 1373 feet above the sea.

The general due south course of the boulders is further shown by an

examination of their distribution south of Kendal. It is not to be expected

that very many boulders should now remain scattered over the surface of

the rich and highly cultivated land near Kendal ; they have mostly been

long since cleared off the surface of the pasture and meadow land, and are
now to be found built into the walls, where, however, they are good evi-

dence of their existence in the country, because boulders are not carted

a long distance for walling in a country that has plenty of such material

at hand; but there are some large boulders still remaining unmoved, from

the place where they were once dropped by the ice, and in ploughed

lands others are from time to time turned up and placed among heaps of

stones for road metal.

I have traced these boulders as                  far south as Milnthrop                                                                                                      they occupy  a

of Shap Fells. I have not seen any west of the river Kent. The most

westerly I have seen are some near Hincaster, still lying undisturbed in a

near Windy Hill, about two miles S.E. of Kendal railway station; but I

once saw one high up on the side of Grayrigg Fell, north of Grayrigg

Tarn, which lies a good deal farther east.

The chief boulders still in their original position are the following :

Several on SpitalWood; one near the Kendal reservoir ; one or two on the

Castle Hill, Kendal ; the one near Windy Hill ; one on the east side of

east of Stainton ; others near the footpath from Stainton to Sedgwick

one on the top of a drift hill, half a mile due west of Sellet Hall ; several

near Hincaster ; some in front of a farm house at Wath Sutton. I have

also found granite boulders on the roadside between Natland and Helm,

at the inns near Helm End, and in a field a quarter of a mile west of Storth

End, and on the road half-a-mile N.E. by north of Storth End, and at

the bend of road east of Milnthrop station, besides in many other places,

which it would be tedious to mention.
     Boulders of the dark compact altered rock that surrounds the granitic

area are generally found along with the granite boulders.

    When the localities where granite boulders occur are marked on a

map, the steady lineal north and south direction of their course is very

striking.

     Boulders of the ordinary volcanic rocks of the Lake Mountains indicate

other directions for the ice-flow ; thus a large boulder of volcanic breccia

from the Lake Mountains may be seen lying on the side of the Sedbergh

road, about two and a half miles out of Kendal, and east of the line of
granite boulders. As the granitic area of Shap Fells is at the extreme east
end of the volcanic rocks, this boulder must have crossed the line of flow
along which the granite boulders travelled. Amongst noteworthy boulders
is a monster boulder, by the natives designated by the undignified term
of a "cobble," of volcanic ash in the beck course at Stainton, measuring

9x0x4 feet, or 216 cubic feet.

     The distribution of boulders on the bare limestone fells in the neigh-
bourhood of Kendal is in some particulars remarkable. Thus, on Farleton

Fell, a conspicuous hill of bare limestone on the east side of the Lancaster

and Carlisle Railway, there are very many large limestone boulders lying
on glaciated surfaces, and often having pebbles and small boulders of Upper
Silurian rock beneath them. Some of these limestone boulders, too, are

standing on edge with their planes of stratification vertical or highly

inclined, so that there can be no doubt about their being true boulders.

On the same fell there are, as already stated, many small boulders of

Upper Silurian rock but I have met with no boulders of volcanic rock^ or
                                                                                                             ;

of granite on this fell. Unfortunately I could find no good scratches to
show the direction of the ice-flow ; but, considering the great size and
number of the limestone boulders, and the smallness of the Upper Silurian
ones, I should be inclined to think the ice came from the N.W., in which
case it would traverse a great extent of limestone country, and the Upper
Silurian rocks that were the origin of the boulders would be several miles

distant ; and this transport of boulders probably took place while the
adjacent limestone area was free of drift, and therefore before the trans-

port of the granite boulders, which, as being found in the drift that now
covers the low ground N.W. of Farleton Fell, belong to the time of the

deposition of this drift.
188 report-- 1878.

The limestone fell immediately west of Kendal, which ends in the fine

escarpments known as Scout and Cunswick Scars, overlooking a broken

foreground of Upper Silurian rocks to the Lake Mountains in the distance,

is singularly free from limestone boulders. This is only what might be

expected, as it is the extreme north end of the limestone area ; for
this fell is plentifully strewn with large boulders of Upper Silurian rock,

and small ones of volcanic rocks, though there are a few large boulders

of volcanic rock as well ; for instance, one well-glaciated boulder of

volcanic ash about a mile and a half S.W. of Kendal, and a large one

above Cunswick Scar, near the footpath to Kendal.

Whitbarrow, too (another bare limestone fell), is generally free of

limestone boulders, except at the south end, where there are several large

ones                        but  Silurian boulders                                     are     pretty generally distributed      over it, and
                         ;

amongst these one large boulder of ash deserves notice. This boulder,

which is a tolerably conspicuous object on the fell, is situated on the

western side of the fell, perhaps a mile or better S.W. of Row. It is

about six feet high, and is split in two, the inner surface of one portion

corresponding to that of the other. But the southern portion has been

moved away from its fellow, slightly on the western side, but as much as

several feet (five or six) on the east ; the general result being motion from

north to south. One might fancy that the boulder was originally split as it

fell off the end of the ice, and that subsequently the ice had shoved one part

slightly away from the other. Connected with boulders is the difficult

subject of the accumulation of drift. For a geologist who has a day to

spare at Kendal no more instructive walk can be recommended than this.

Walk out along the Kendal and Sedbergh road for about five or six miles

till you come to the summit level, 930 feet above sea, then tarn south

acoss the fell called New Hutton Common to its summit, 1097 feet high.

Looking S.W. from this point yon will see spread out before you in the

Gatebeck and Saint Sunday Valleys, a tumultuous assemblage of mounds,

a truly wonderful sight. These mounds are the vast moraine, or system

of moraines, which the great glacier, or ice sheet if you will, of old threw

down in the low ground between Helm on the right and the uplands on

the left, ending in Scout Hill.

    And if anyone wishes to see moraines of the ordinary Swiss type, shed

by local glaciers, let him go to the recesses of the mountains to the head of

Mr. D. Mackintosh reports some new facts relative to the derivation of

boulders already discovered by members of the Committee, the existence

of several large boulders previously unrecorded, aud the extent to which

Ireland has sent erratics into England.

In our Report for 1875 there is a full account of many large blocks of

felspathic rock in the neighbourhood of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. I

have principally examined them between Catsbill and Hagley, in a district

from which granite would appear to be entirely absent. From a com-

parison of their shape, size, appeai'ance of weathered surface and internal

structure as revealed by chips, I have no doubt whatever that these

boulders are what may be called an overshot load from the great Arenig

stream of erratics which has found its way through Llangollen Vale into

the central plain of England, and which has left large blocks about Chirk
and Welsh Frankton (west of Ellesmere). In our Report for 1876 there is

an account of the Arenig dispersion, and the enormous Cefn felstone
         :

bonlder is mentioned. Some distance S.E. of Cefn, and about a quarter

of a mile S.E. of Chirk Bridge, on the east side of the Holyhead road, there

is a felstone boulder, the greater part of which is evidently buried. The

exposed part is about 13 x 7 feet, and three feet above ground. Between

this boulder and Welsh Frankton, Arenig erratics are numerous, and

Asome of them are very large.  short distance west of Welsh Frankton,

8x8and close to where a canal is crossed by the main road,                                     feet of an

Arenig boulder may be seen above ground. It is somewhat varied in

structure, part of it approaching the character of hornstone. Around

Welsh Frankton there are numerous moderate-sized, and a few very large

Arenig boulders, One, close to Mr. Oswell's house, is quite 8 feet in

average diameter ; and another, a few yards distant, 8| x 6 X 5 feet.

They are accompanied by good-sized boulders of Silurian grit and Carboni-

ferous sandstone and quartzite from the Welsh borders.

Mr. Mackintosh lately found a number of lumps of a very white rock

in a gravel-pit which had been excavated in an undulating continuation of

the Wge and abrupt mounds of middle drift age which may be seen south

of Ellesmere, Shropshire. He has since found many more lumps at

Wrexham, and, after much inquiry, he cannot hear of any rock like it in

situ. It looks very much like silicified chalk, but the fossil evidence is

Ain favour of its Jurassic age.  fragment of lias, with characteristic

fossils (now in the possession of Mr. W. Shone), was very lately found

about 8 feet down in upper boulder clay at Guilden Sutton, near

Chester; and Mr. Watts, F.G.S., has found large chalk flints and a

specimen of Grypluea incurva in a boulder clay at Piethorne, near Rochdale.

These erratics, in all probability, came from Ireland.

  --Mr. Moltneux reports as follows upon Boulders in the Midland

District

     Stretching westwards from the town of Burton-on-Trent, and bounded

on the south and east by the Trent Valley and on the north by that of the

Dove, is a range of table-land, from 100 to 300 feet above the levels of

those rivers, and comprising within its limits the broad acreage anciently

included in the Royal Forest of Needwood. The whole area is covered

more or less thickly with one or the other or each of the three different

deposits which constitute the Boulder clay group of the Midlands. These

deposits consist in well-defined divisions of sand, gravel, clay, and boul-

ders, and are of an aggregate thickness of 120 feet. On the iess elevated

face of the country under consideration they repose directly on Red marls,

and  on  the  high.e.r.tracts  of Christchurch-on-ISreedwood and                               Bagot's  Park

teristic force and condition. The boulders, or rock masses, occur prin-

cipally at from three to ten feet below the surface, intermixed with blue

and yellow clay, and consist of angular, sub-angular, and rounded frag-

ments of Carboniferous limestone and chert, Yoredale sandstone, Millstone

grits, Granites, Porphyry, Syenite, Greenstone, Trachyte, and Toadstone,

with smaller fragments of Liassic and Oolitic rocks, many of which bear

the usual evidences of the action of ice. There is also, stretching across

the high grounds of Hanbury Woodend, running east and west, an extra-

ordinary trail of Chalk flint flakes. The Boulder clays, with their asso-

ciated deposits, cap the high land of Waterloo Hill and Moat Bank on the

en,ters largely into the composition of the basement bed of the valley-
gravels at Burton-on- Trent, but in a more rounded condition. Gryphtea
and other Liassic shells are frequently found in the sand and gravel of
each deposit.

     During some drainage operations at Sinai Park, overlooking Burton-

on-Trent, many hundreds of tons of boulders were excavated, the weight
varying from a few pounds to half a ton each. I am in a position to

place on record one only of these boulders, which deserves a place in the
catalogue of Staffordshire erratic rocks. This was exhumed from near the
surface of some gravel workings at Postern House, three miles due west
from Burton-on- Trent, and where the letter P, of Postern House, in the
Ordnance Survey map, occurs. It lay at 180 feet above the Trent
Valley, and is an angular fragment of coarse Millstone grit five feet six
inches long by four feet six inches deep, one of its sides being planed
down by ice action. Another sub-angular boulder of Syenite was about
two years' ago obtained from the bottom of a well sunk in the valley
gravel at the brewery of Messrs. Truman, Hanbury, and Buxton, _at a

point just north of the letter B in Burton-on-Trent, between the road and

railway, as shown on the Ordnance map. It lay at twenty-four feet
from the surface, embedded in a foot or two of Boulder clay, which there
comes between the valley gravel and the Red marls, and which with

other similar evidences is conclusive proof of the excavation of the Trent

Valley hereabouts before the Boulder clay period. The boulder weighs
nearly a ton, and was removed for preservation to the residence of the
writer, about a mile south of Burton-on-Trent on the Lichfield road.

  --Mr. James Plant continues his reports upon the Boulders in Leices-

tershire :

                                               (1.) Isolated Boulders.

     The "great erratic" from Humberston (briefly described in a former

report) has been recently laid quite bare to the bottom.
     There is a great quantity of traditional material connected with it,

and it must have excited considerable interest in the " olden time."
Several distinguished antiquarians have written upon it, and described

these traditions.
      I believe that this block has a certain relation to the monolith " St.

John's Stone," exactly three miles S.W. by W. across the valley of the

river. Both blocks are on the rise of the land, and visible from either
locality if a fire was lighted on each at night.

   A festival (Romish) was formerly held near the St. John's Stone (a

vestige of old " fire, or sun worship ") on Midsummer Day, and this
Humberston block woidd be in the line of the greatest eastern stmrise.

     This boulder is situated in St. Mary's parish, on the Pochin estate, on
Kirby's Farm, Humberston, Leicestershire, close to the bend of the road
from Humberston to Thurmaston. It measures 8 feet x 7 feet x 5 feet,
and its weight is nearly 20 tons. It is pentagonal, edges sharp and an-

gular. Longest axis is N.W. by S.E. It has about six deep irregular
grooves two inches deep on the top, sides nearly vertical and smooth,

and the striations are in direction of the longer axis. It is composed of

the syenitic granite of Mount Sorrel, distant 5^ miles N.W. from the
locality. Many legends are connected with this block, and it is known

glacial " drift-clay," and is quite isolated. It was thought by many per-

sons to be the rock in situ. It rests upon worn surface of Rhaetic beds.

It is to be removed to the grounds of the Leicester Museum, and photo-

graph taken before removal.

Another large isolated boulder is situated at Loseby, Leicestershire,

on the estate of Sir F. T. Fowke, Bart., Loseby Hall, Leicestershire. It

measures 5 feet 3 inches X 3 feet 5 inches X 2 feet 4 inches. It is

rounded and worn, is long shaped, has never been moved by man, and has

small groovings at various angles on all the sides exposed. It is composed

of millstone grit, which occurs 35 to 40 miles N.W., but it may have

travelled 80 miles if it came from the north. It is 650 feet (ordnance

datum) above the sea; and rests in "upper glacial drift," composed of

sand, flints, chalk, has, sandstone, millstone grit and pebbles of various

sorts, and lumps of clay.

                         (2.) Oroups of Boulders.

     The first group recently found in the " Coleman Road " (a new road
about two miles from here) is quite a new district for boulders. The group

occurs in Bvington parish, near Leicester ; the road is about two miles
long, in a "cutting" through "Crown Hill." The largest boulders

are 3 feet 3 inches x 3 feet x 2 feet 6 inches ; the smallest 1 foot 3 inches
X 1 foot x 1 foot. They are angular and sub-angular, except the block of
"limestone," which seems rounded, but it may have been done in situ.
All have been moved in excavating the road, and many broken up.

Most of the sandstones, grits, and limestones, have striations in various

directions on the top and sides, and at different angles. The localities at

gravel) on the narrow end, as if all the materials had been solidified when

deposited on the lower lias clay.

no striations can be seen. They are derived from Groby, Markfield, and
Charnwood Forest. Groby is six miles distant N.N.W., and Markfield
eight miles N. All are composed of syenite. The group is 280 feet above
the sea, and has about two feet of gravel over it, and covers an area about
ten yards square. The boulders were all covered by a deposit of gravelly

drift, and were found in the sand.

   A third group occurs in Aylestone parish, Belmont Park, Leicester,

half a mile east of Aylestone. The largest boulder is 2 feet 6 inches x 2
feet x 1 foot 10 inches ; the smallest is 1 foot x 10 inches x 9 inches.
The boulders are angular and sub-angular ; and all have been moved in
making new roads. There are no striations. Rocks of the same nature
are found at Mount Sorrel, Groby, Markfield, Bradgate Park, in Charnwood

Forest, at a distance of six to eight miles. They are composed of syenite

greenstone, syenitic granite, 20 blocks were measured and examined.

The group is 320 feet above the sea, and covers an area about 100 yards

by 20 yards. It is covered by gravel containing flint.

   A fourth group occurs in St. Margaret's parish, on the estate of the

Freehold Land Society, Leicester, on the road leading to Evington from
Leicester. The largest boulder is 3 feet 1 inch x 2 feetxl foot 10
inches, and the smallest 1 foot 5 inches X 1 foot 2 inches x 1 foot 1 inch.

The boulders are rounded, angular, and subangular; out of twelve

boulders eight are syenitic granite, two triassic sandstone, one millstone

grit, one oolite. The group is 290 feet above the sea, and covers an area

100 yards square.                               It was uncovered by making foundations for houses
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

all have been moved. No striations exist on the igneous rocks, but the

sandstones and oolitic blocks are striated at various angles. Igneous rocks

of the same nature are found at Mount Sorrel, Groby, sandstones at

Nottingham, ooUtic rocks at Ketton near Stamford, at the respective

distances of eight, twenty- six, and twenty miles.

    A fifth group, occurs in Evington parish, "Spinney Hills" Road,

Leicester. The largest boulder is 3 feet x 1 foot x 1 foot ; the smallest,
2 feet 6 inches x 1 foot 2 inches x 1 foot 4 inches The boulders are sharp,
fresh looking, angles all round ; no striations are visible. Rocks of the
same nature are found at Mount Sorrel, a distance of six and a half miles.
They are composed of syenitic granite, and are at the height of 290 feet
above the sea. They have been moved out of a field to the side of the
road, but are on the S.E. side of " Spinney Hills," and therefore must have

come over them.

A sixth group occurs in Saxe-Coburg Street, Leicester. The largest

--Report on the Present State of our Knoiuledge of the Crustacea.

       Part IV. On Development. By C. Spence Bate, F.R.S.

                                         [Plates V., VI., & VII.]

Having, during the last three Reports, given an account of the present
state of our knowledge of the dermal skeleton of the higher forms of
Crustacea as it appears in various genera in the adult animal, it is

desirable that we should next obtain some knowledge of the forms that
these animals undergo in their passage from the ovum to the adult.

     It is highly probable, judging from the very perfect resemblance to the
parent form that the animal attains while yet young, that the earlier

zoologists believed them to quit the egg in this condition. For when Bosc

took in mid-Atlantic the small animal which he christened Zoe, he never

for a moment thought that it was the young of some other form.

     It was in 1802 that it was first described, and ranged by the author
between the Branchiopoda and Amphipoda. But Latreille, in the first
edition of the ' Regne Animal ' of Cuvier, placed it at the. end of the
Branchiopoda, between Polyphemus and Cyclops, while expressing an
opinion that it approached nearly to the Schizopoda.

     Leach seems to have held this same opinion, for without giving his
reasons, he placed it at the end of the legion of Podophthalma, by side

of Nelalia.

      Desmarest, in his ' Consid. sur Crustaces,' places it in the order
Branchiopoda, near Branchipes, while Latreille ranks it with " Monocles,"
while Milne-Edwards ranges it, with doubt, at the end of the Decapoda,
with other questionable genera, after the Schizopoda, and before the
Stomapoda.

In 1830 Vaughan Thompson took a zoaea in Cork harbour that while

in his possession passed into the Megalopa stage, which induced him to

assert that zoasa was nothing more than the larval stage of one of the

crabs common to our shores.

This idea was much doubted by the naturalists of the day, more

especially Milne-Edwards, Latreille, and Westwood, as the idea of any
metamorphosis in the development of the Crustacea was contrary to
preconceived opinions, and to the careful and very complete observations

of Rathke on the development of the embryo in the common crayfish of

Europe (Astacus fluvialis)
     The articles of Milne-Ed wards in the 'Dictionnaire Classique d'Histoire

Naturelle, and the remarks of Latreille in the ' Cours d'Entomologie,'
were followed in 1835 by what appeared at the time to be an exhaustive
discussion of the subject by Mr. Westwood. His observations were
carried out upon the ova of some land crabs, that were living in the
Zoological Gardens, with an exactitude and care that has left little to be
added. Mr. Westwood's memoir was published in the ' Philosophical Trans-
actions of the Royal Society,' and he received the honour of the Society's
gold medal for what, at the time, appeared to be a complete refutation of
Mr. Vaughan Thompson's theory of metamorphosis in Crustacea.

     It is, however, a very remarkable coincidence, that the same volume of
the 'Philosophical Transactions,' 1835, that contains Mr. Westwood's com-
munication on the absence of any morphology in the progressive develop.
ment of the Gegarcinus, also published a memoir of Mr. Vaughan Thomp-
son on the larva of the Cirripedia, showing not only that a very extensive
form of morphology takes place, but demonstrating conclusively that they

are crustaceous animals, and bear no relation to the mollusca among which

they previously had been generally classed by naturalists.

     From this time until the present, the young form and development of

these animals have been of the foremost interest in marine zoology.

    In 1839 Capt. Du Cane sent to the British Association, and pub-

lished in the ' Annals of Natural History,' a communication on the forms

in which the young left the egg in the common prawns and shrimps of our
coast. And soon after (1852), Mr. R. Q. Couch gave an account at the

Dublin Meeting of the British Association of the form in which the

young left the ovum in the common crawfish (Palinurus vulgaris) of our

seas. In each of these the form so differed from one another, and from
any of the others, that it began to appear as if the young of every genus
in the Crustacea left the egg in a larval form, different in character.

     This view appears to receive much strength from the development of
the larva in Mysis, although many of the changes which this animal

undergoes are those of a subembryonic rather than a larval condition,
since they take place pi-eviously to the animal's becoming an independent

creature. An elaborate account of the development of this animal is
o-iven by Van Beneden, in his memoir on the littoral animals of Belgium.

     Since then, the crowning interest was given by Dr. Fritz-Muller, when

he captured a small crustaceous animal in the high seas which in general

form corresponds with the small entomostracous genus known as

Nauplius. This he prononnced to be the early condition in which some
of the prawns, and especially Penasus, quits the ovum. Some naturalists
accept this hypothetical discovery as conclusive, while others more
cautiously consider that the evidence Fritz-Muller has received is not

sufficient, the more especially since several genera of prawns are known
to quit the ovum in a more advanced form. (PI. V., fig. 1.)

      It should be remembered in the reporting on this discovery of Fritz-
Miiller, that first it has not been taken in connection with the parent,
second, that it has not been traced from the nauplius to the zoaea con-
dition, and lastly, has not been traced by Midler beyond the Schizopod
                                           ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.                                                                                                                                                       19.5

stage, hence its connexion with Penseus has not been demonstrated at
either extremity of the chain of evidence.

     The little creature, according to Muller, is rather opaque and of a
brownish colour, darkest towards the extremities of the appendages.

     It is by these little appendages that the young animal swims, lashing
the water and working its way upwards to the light.

     The first change that is observable is that it becomes slightly larger,
and the terminal part projects into two pointed processes, terminating in
the two long caudal hairs which were previously present, and to which
others less important have been added. The number of hairs on the
natatory appendages have also increased.

    At this stage the form of the carapace is first indicated in the presence
of a transverse line. In this we perceive an important variation from
the forms of either the Cirripedia or decapod Crustacea, and moreover

contrary to that of the Euphausia as illustrated by Metschnikoff.

     In the youngest forms of Decapoda and Cirripeds the carapace is defined
from the earliest stages.

In Lophogaster, according to Sars, the development resembles that of

Mysis. The form of the embryo is more annulose and the formation of

the great dorsal shield is more progressive. According to Fritz-Miiller

the development of the carapace in the young of Penaaus is upon the

same plan, and is first detected by the presence of a line immediately

behind the third pair of appendages. In the anterior pair may now be

seen that which after the next moult Fritz-Miiller takes to be the first

pair of antennae. The second pair becomes the second antennas, and the

third pair becomes the mandibles                                                                                                                                                                                  close  to which  a  large helmet-shaped
                                                                                                                                                                                                               :

protuberance, which is taken to be the homologue of the anterior labrum,

is present. In this early stage Dr. Muller sees within the third pair of

appendages the mandibles with a prominent acute tooth and a broad

transversely furrowed masticatory surface, and he says that the mandible

must bear a non-setigerous appendage. Posterior to these three pairs of

lobes, the embryonic condition of the future oral appendages make their

appearance                                                     the eyes still continuing to be represented by a solitary

central organ.

     The rudimentary appendages exhibit within the sacs the presence of
hairs, which induced Dr. Muller to believe that after the next moult the
animal will pass into the Zocea stage. But here the progressive link is
broken in his researches, and there is nothing to demonstrate that this
Nauplius form passes into a Zooea stage more than the young of Mysis does.

      Previously to the time that Muller found his Nauplius, Professor Sars

(1862)* studied the development of Lophogaster typicus, a Schizopod
belonging to the family Eupliausidm, and this he states to be precisely

similar to that of Mysis.

In 1871 Metschnikoff communicated to ' Zeitschrift fur Zool.' his ob-

servations on the young of Euphausia. The first specimens he found

in the open sea, and hypothetically assumed that they were the young of

Euphausia, although they were not in any way connected with the parent,
and had undergone one or two changes of form since quitting the ovum!
He says                                    "I was yet convinced that it by no means represented the

thetically point to a six-legged transparent Nauplius as to the earliest
larval condition of Euphausia. This supposition has since been confirmed

by the examination of a considerable number of free-swimming Euphausia
larvae. Besides the larvse, which were in various stages of progress, I fished
up, he says, some ova from which I procured some Nauplii of the youngest

form, but as my observations on the embryonic development of the Schizo-

poda have not been concluded, I shall only describe the ovum containing

a mature larva." (PI. V., fig. 2.)

   --" The ovum is a complete ball, in which one can distinguish two mem-

branes. Between the exterior membrane the extraordinarily delicate

--Morion and the inner, the yolk skin, is a fluid clear as water, which

I have also seen in the ova of Penams. The yolk skin covers closely the
now quite mature and highly transparent larva, which latter shows three-
distinctly developed pairs of extremities. Through the movements of the
larva the egg-membranes are torn, and there escapes a peculiar animal,
on the oval body of which three pairs of appendages are attached which
exhibit the peculiarities of the Nauplius form of Crustacea."

     " The first pair is simple, while the two others are branched and articu-
lated into three joints, i.e. two basal and the terminal ; the only existing
opening is the oral aperture which is in the median line between the
base of the third pair of appendages. It appears in the form of a very
small hole which leads to a narrow oesophagus. With the exception of
red tint on the ventral surface, the larva is otherwise colourless and
transparent, and it is with much difficulty that some of the interior

organs can be distinguished."

     Herr Metschnikoff was able to trace some of the early changes, and was
in hopes to be able to remove some of the objections against Fritz-Miiller's

treatment of the development of Penaeus. He tried to follow the various

alterations in the same specimen, but failed to keep the animals alive

after a short period in his vessels. He was however here enabled to

trace the changes which conduct, he says, the larva "into that condition
which Claus has already described," but remarks that all the forms
examined by him lost with their moulting the indented or crenulated
margin of the carapace, which shows that he had to do with another

species than Euphausia Mulleri of Claus. He concludes with saying that
he " must draw attention to a phenomenon which is common to the

Nauplius stage of Euphausia and Penaeus, the contemporaneous formation
of the several pairs of appendages succeeding the larval and swimming
feet." " It is," he continues, "remai'kable that such a mode of formation is
not observed in any Entomostraca which have been developed through the
Nauplius metamorphosis. I have examined in this relation the Cirripedes
and Branchiopoda, and became convinced that in these Crustacea the
maxillaries are developed apart from the other appendages, as has been

shown by Claus to be the case in the Copepoda."
      Professor Claus has given the subject his attention, but his researches,

like those of Fritz-Muller, were carried on upon specimens taken in the
high sea, without any immediate clue to the parent from which they

derived their origin.
     It is certainly remarkable that so advanced an observer as Professor

Claus should have been content to have drawn his conclusions from such
incomplete and unsatisfactory data, particularly as he considers that an

imperfect appreciation of the development of the Crustacea has occasioned
in recent davs the supposition relative to the genetic relationship of

insects, and as a further consequence to considerable inquiries about the

origin of Crustacea.

     The importance of obtaining accurate knowledge of the relationship of
the young and immature forms with those of the adult animals, is exem-
plified by the numerous speculative theories which have arisen and depend

upon the correctness of Fritz- Miiller's discovery.
      Claus, in his ' Crustaceen Systems,' says that Fritz-Muller even

believed that he found in the Zoaea of Crustacea the origin of the insects,

and very soon this view was made use of by others for the Arachnoidea.
     "Anton Dorhn," says Claus, " has endeavoured by peculiar reasoning '

to prove the Zoaea form to be a stage in the development of the Ento-
mostraca, and sought to show that the Phyllopodes, Ostracodes, and Co-
pepoda have once passed through a free Zoaea stage during the phylogmatic

development."
     Claus distinguishes two more typical stages in the metamorphosis of

Crustacea between Nuuplius and Zoaa, which he distinguishes by the
names of Metanauplius and Protozoeil ; but as these are given to stages in

the progress of development rather than to forms that represent the stages

as they leave the egg and become free creatures, I doubt if this addition

to the nomenclature will ultimately be found to prove convenient. He
moreover contends that of all Crustacea now existing that of the Phyllopoda

is most probably that which bears the nearest resemblance to the primordial
type, and that Nebalia and Bmnchipus most nearly approximate the earliest

representations.

In the Schizopoda and Peneidce the larva he asserts is hatched as a

NaupUus, and undergoes its  further  development in free life                                                                                                            the rest of
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

the Caridea go through the Nauplius and Protozoaea stages within the

ovum, and that the first stage of free life is that of the Zoaea, mingled with

features of the Mysis-like stage. The Thalassinidae and Paguridae are

hatched in the Zoaea stage.

      In the course of his researches Dr. C. Claus has determined the early

forms of Leucifer and Sergestis, neither of which, although Schizopods,

pass through the Nauplius condition, and Professor Sars says that Lophi-

gaster, one of the Euphausidce., develops its young as Mysis. And we
know from actual observation that the young of the Anomura leave the
ovum in a form little distinguishable from the Zoaea of the Brachyura, and

in a more advanced condition.
     It is desirable in a Report which is intended to record the present state

of our knowledge of the subject, to define clearly what is understood by
the several names applied to the larvae of Crustacea according to the form

in which they quit the ovum.
     Here I feel it a duty to protest strongly against the terms larva and

pupa which have of late been much introduced into the study of carcino-
logy. They are the more objectionable at this present time when there

is a desire to trace the connection of one class of animals with another,

inasmuch as the terms are likely to convey the idea of a closer approxi-

mation by the resemblance of the nomenclature than may exist in natural

phenomena. The term larva is suggestive of the grub or caterpillar con-
dition in which insects leave their ovum, but as the condition in which the

young of the Crustacea varies in form and degree, is not only different in
families but in animals that might be classified as belonging to the same
genus, as is the case in Crangon vulgaris and Crangon horeas, but for the
different stages in which the young are hatched.
198 report-- 1878.

    For the term pupa I believe that Mr. Darwin is mainly responsible. He

having introduced it in his monograph on the Cirripedia, when there ap-
peared to be a great change in the progressive growth of the young which
was thought to equal the metamorphosis of insects, if not to represent it

in kind.

      I therefore propose to substitute the term Brephalus (from f3pE<pog f
infant : a\c, sea), or young marine animal, for the term larva, while
that of " pupa " had better be suppressed. Seeing that the development of
the animal is gradually progressive, there is no stage or state of the
animal which can be represented by it.

     In this Report, whenever used, the term brephalus will mean the form of
the animal as it quits the ovum, no matter whatever stage of develop-
ment it may represent.

     The several terms used for the young animal in its separate stages have
been taken from animals which had been previously described as adults.
These are, Nauplius, Zoa?a, Phylosoma, and Megalopa. Each of which is
now recognised as being a stage in which the brephalus quits the ovum,
and therefore one in the development of the Crustacea. To these must now
 be added those of Metanauplius and Protozcaea.

      The term nauplius, as representing one of the stages in which the
embryo of the Crustacea quits the ovum, was introduced by Fritz-Miiller
in 1864, in consequence of his having taken a small crustacean that
 while in general form it resembled the entomostracan genus Nauplius,
 yet exhibited unmistakable evidence of being the young of some macrurous
 decapod : which he believed to be that of Penceus.

      Metschnikoff has announced that the brephalus of Euphausia is in the

 form of nauplius, while it is known to be that of all the cirripedes as well
 as most of the entomostracous Crustacea, but these last, excepting Bran-
 chipvs, differ from the typical Nauplius in having but two pairs of free

 appendages.

      The nauplius, as it quits the ovum of the Malacostracous parent, is an

 animal of an ovate form, having three pairs of free appendages, the first
 of which is unibranched while the other two are biramose, and a single
 ophthalmic spot or imperfect central eye, and a strongly projecting
 labrum or anterior lip.

       This is the state in which Euphausia (Plate V., fig. 4) is hatched accord-
  ing to Metschnikoff ; and Pena?us according to Fritz-Miiller. (PI. V.,

  fig. 1.)

       Shortly after it has become a free swimming animal it moults its
  external skin, and with each successive exuviation it advances a stage in

  development, its first apparent advance is in the appearance of lobes that
  ultimately become the appendages of the mouth. Metschnikoff remarks

  that this phenomenon is common to the nauplius of Euphausia and Penceus,

  that is, the contemporaneous formation of several appendages succeeding

  the three original pairs of swimming feet.

      He says moreover that it is remarkable that such a mode of formation

  is not observed in any of the Entomostraca which have been developed
   through the nauplius metamorphosis.

        It is this stage for which Clans has suggested the tercn Metanauplius
  (PI. V., fig. 2), while that for which he proposes the name of Protozowa
  is when the pleon is developed, but neither the pereiopoda or appendages

   of the pleon are present. (PI. V., fig. 3.)

       But here we have so close an approximation to the Zoaea as it leaves the
ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  199

 ovum of the Braehynra, that it appears doubtful if there be any distinction

 between Protozosea and Zosea.
      Fritz-Miiller comprehends under the term Zosea all those brephaliQarvss)

 that have two pairs of antennas. The oral appendages and the gnathopoda
 present the latter in the form of swimming appendages. Having in view
 the young of the Brachyura, Anomura and Macrura, as well as certain stages
 in the development of the Stomapoda, whilst he could not include the young
 Schizopoda with the six pairs of legs (Euphasia) which Claus considers must

 be accepted as a zoaaa form. Claus considers that there is a highly im-

--portant character excluded from this definition, the stage of the develop-

 ment of the pereion, or, as he terms it, the limbless central body (Gleid-
 massenlosen Mittelleibes) in contrast with the pleon (Hinterleib) and its ap-
pendages This is, he says, just the characteristic of the zosea, which needs
explanation, and at the same time contains the key tor the comprehension

 of the structure of the zoasa stage of the Malacostraca. It is necessary to

understand and explain the striking relation of the pereion that exists in
an immature condition, and from which sprout the five pairs of pereiopoda
between the cephalon, with its numerous well-developed appendages and

the well-formed but still limbless pleon. He says that almost in all forms

of brephalus (larva) the pereion is either completely suppressed as in the

Decapoda, or appears in the form of rudimentary somites, as in Schizo-
poda and Stomapoda. The pereiopoda are produced later than the ap-
pendages of the pleon. " Of course," he continues, " an exception must be
made for the zoaea of Penceus, from which the limbs of the pereion are pro-
duced previously to those of the pleon, with the exception of the two
lateral appendages of the tail, which as belonging to the sixth somite of
the pleon appears sooner, or at least about the same period, as those of the

pereion."

      In arriving at this conclusion Claus appears to have gathered his facts
from too circumscribed an area. Assuming his observations on the
development of Penceus to be correct, he has overlooked that of the
typical zoaea when it quits the ovum, as seen in Garcinus Mcenas, and that
of Stenorhyncus, Inachus and Maia, of the latter two of which he has
himself given figures that represent the pereiopoda advancing in develop-
ment anterior in degree to that of the pleopoda. Moreover, the · bre-
phalus (larva) of Homarus and Palinurus have the pereiopoda well ad-
vanced in formation previously to any evidence of the pleopoda being in

existence. Whilst others have them developed in a common ratio.
     The zoaea of Crustacea therefore may be defined as a brephalus (larva)

that has two pairs of antennas, the oral appendages and gnathopoda more
or less developed, but in which the pereiopoda and pleopoda are yet
absent or in an immature condition.

     This is the condition in which the brephalus quits the ovum as the zoaea
of the Brachyura, Anomura, and some Macrura. But in each there is a

persistent feature that distinguishes one form from that of the others, and

as far as my own observations have led me precludes their being con-

founded one with the other.
     The brephalus of the brachyura is a zocea (PI. VI., figs. 3 and 4), and the

most constant as to its general type of all the families of the class. With
the exception Gecarcinus, which quits the ovum in the Megalopa stage, I
am not aware of any other of the short-tailed crabs that is not hatched

in the zoaea condition.

    That of Carcinus mcenas, as our most common European species, may
--200

be taken as the type of zoasa. When it quits the ovum, and throws

off the enclosing membrane, and swims first as a free animal, it has a dis-

tinct and well-developed carapace. It is dorsally arched and laterally

compressed and rounded off at the infero-posterior angles. It is, moreover,

armed with long characteristic spines on the dorsal and lateral surfaces,

and anteriorly with a great rostrum, but these features vary in different

genera, as shown in PL VI., where the two extremes are seen. In Tra-

pezia, fig. 3, the spines are all very long, in Gelassimus, fig. 4, they are very

short. The pereion is in a compressed or immature condition, and the

pleon has six well-developed somites, the terminal one ending invariably

in a fork-like extremity that varies in degree, and is armed with a greater

or less number of strong stiff ciliated spines that differ in a constant degree

so as to enable one almost to define the generic limits of species. It has

invariably two pairs of antennas, represented by the early budding con-

dition of the permanent organ in the first pair, and by deciduous represen-

tatives in the second in the form of two long teeth or spines ; the

mandibles  and two  succeeding  pairs  of  oral  appendages                                                       the  third pair,
                                                                                                               ;

or tetartognathus, being absent ; while the gnathopoda are developed into

large characteristic swimming appendages. Of these, which are invariably

biramose, one represents the permanent and the other the secondary branch

of the adult organ : in this early condition the primary or permanent branch

is five-jointed, and the second three. The number of these joints repre-

sents the more or less advanced condition of the zoaea, and corresponds

with the progressive development of the animal. The pereiopoda are

represented by two or three small sac-like lobes, within which the several

pairs may afterwards be seen to be developed.

The brephalus of the Anomurais also a zoasa (PL VI., figs. 1 and 2), and

differs from that of the Brachyura more in general appearance than in its

degree of advanced development. The anterior portion corresponds, ex-

cept in the armature of the carapace, very closely with the same part

in the zoasa of the Brachyura, while the posterior portion of the animal

assimilates more nearly with that of the zoasa of the Macrura.

If we take the zoaea of Pagurus as the type, we find that the carapace

is dorsally more depressed than in that of the Brachyura, and extends

nearly horizontally from the rostrum to the posterior margin of the cara-

pace, the lateral margins are not so deep, and are produced posteriorly, so

as to form a prominent process or tooth on each side. This projection is
very constant, but varies in degree with separate families. The rostrum

also is generally prominent, and projects horizontally forwards.

The pereion is not appreciably developed. The pleon has six somites,

the posterior one being long, and terminating in a broad fan-like telson,

the posterior margin of which is divided into two halves by an excavation

that varies in extent in different genera. Each division is furnished
with fine strong ciliated spines, which stand on their own well-defined

lobes, and the outer angle is armed with a short sharp tooth.
     The eyes are large and ovate. The first pair of antennas resemble

those of the Brachyura, they are single jointed, and support several auditory
cilia, and two ciliated hairs, one apical, and the other (the longer) sub-
apical. The second pair of antennas consist of a basal joint and two appen-

dages: one is cylindrical, and tipped with two or three long ciliated hairs;
the other is formed into a broad flat squamose plate, straight on the outer

side, where it terminates in a strong tooth, and arched on the inner side,
and fringed with numerous long spinous hairs richly furnished with cilia.

           ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.                                               201

.The mandibles are without an appendage. The oral limbs are assum-

ing much of their permanent form, except the tetartognatbus, -which is

not visible. The gnathopoda are developed very similarly to those in the

Brachyura zoaea, but exhibit a joint more in the development of the

primary branch of the second pair. One solitary hair, differing in length,

structure, and position from the others, appears to be constant in all forms

of the Anomura zoaea. In some species it is nearer the base of the apical
joint than in others ; but it is invariably constant, extremely long, and
furnished with very long and delicate cilia, that are inserted at right angles

with the main stalk of the hair. I do not remember having observed it

on any zoaea but those of the Anomurous Crustacea.
    The zosea of the Porcellanidae (PI. VI., fig. 2) may readily be distin-

guished from those of Pagurus by the length of the rostrum and postero-

lateral processes of the carapace, which sometimes equal the length of the

animal, and sometimes half; by having unarmed spinal processes to

represent the second antenna?, instead of a ciliated squamose branch, and

by having the last somite of the pleon terminating in a broad flat plate,

the posterior margin of which is posteriorly produced to a point, instead

of being hollowed, while it carries five ciliated hairs on each side of the

median line. In one species, Claus figures the termination as produced

to a long spine.

The zoaea of Galathea(P\.V., fig. 6)may be distinguished by the posterior

margin of the carapace being definitely serrated ; by two dorsal teeth on the

posterior  margin  of the somites of  the pleon                                                     by the extremely long ovate
                                                                                                 ;

eye occupying about one half the length of the carapace ; by the presence of

a sharp serrated tooth at the distal extremity of the basal joint of the

second antennae ; by the shortness of the cylindrical branch that ter-

minates in a small tooth and one ciliated hair ; and the sharply pointed

distal angle of the squamose branch of the same antennae.

The zoaea of Dromia (PI. VI., fig. 1), much resembles that of Pagurus,

except that it appears to have no posterior processes at the infero-distal

angles of the carapace but more especially by the form of the telson, which
                                                                                                                     ;

is extremely deeply cleft in the median line of the posterior margin.

    The brephalus of the Mafiroura differs veiy much in the character in

which it quits the ovum in separate genera. Those that leave it in the

zoaea (PI. V., fig. 5) condition are very distinguishable from those of the
Brachyura and Anomura.

    The zoaea of the common Shrimp (Crangon vulgaris) may be taken
as the type of the form. It differs from the zoaea of the common Prawn

(Palcemon squilla) in very small details, one of which is in having a pointed

rostrum that it loses with the second moult.

The carapace, long, narrow and moderately compressed, furnished with

a slender rostrum projecting horizontally forwards, having no projection

or tooth along the posterior and lateral margins.
     The pleon consists of six somites, of which the last is expanded into a

flat membranous plate, slightly indented in the median line of the pos-

terior margin, and fringed with six ciliated hairs, and one, the external,

small spine-like point.

The eyes, a, a, are large, and obliquely ovate.

The first antennae, b, b, are two-jointed ; the basal joint is long and cylin-

drical ; it supports at the outer distal angle a stiff ciliated spine, and at the
extremity the second branch, which appears in the form of a small uni-

articulate joint, out of which near the extremity another seems ready to
202 eeport-- 1878.

bud, supporting at its apex a crown of auditory cilia, and one short ciliated

hair.

The second antenna?, c, c, consist of a peduncular basal joint, supporting

two branches                                                              the internal  gradually narrows                                                        from the          base,  and  termi-
                                                                       ;

nates in a long spine-like hair fringed with cilia ; the external is in the

form of a squamose plate, the external margin of which is straight, and

the internal becoming broader from the base, and then rapidly running

to an apex ; the inner oblique distal margin being fringed with ciliated
hairs. The mandible and oral appendages are well formed, each assuming

an approximation to the adult condition, except the posterior, or tetarto-

gnathus, which assimilates to that of the gnathopoda, the character of

which it partakes. In each, the number of joints in the primary ramus

has increased to six, and the pereiopoda exhibit evidence of rapid develop-

ment, in the form of cylindrical pendulous sacs, which decrease in length

posteriorly.

There are slight variations from this form in different genera.

In Palccmon the primary branch of the gnathopoda have but four

joints, and terminate in stiff short spine-like hairs ; while in Crangon the
hairs are long, flexible, and ciliated. This latter is the case with the

zosea of Alpheus and Stenopus; while in that of Hymenocera the character

is more in accordance with Palcemou.

The zosea in these orders respectively, Brachyura, Anomura, and

Macrura, while they differ from each other, yet possess characters that

are generally common to two. The form of the carapace in the zosea of

the Brachyura, with its great dorsal spine, which although in some genera,

as Gelassimus, Libinea, and Mencetheus, it is much reduced, so that in the

last it is a mere prominence, is still a feature peculiarly chai'acteristic of

the zosea of the order. Next to which are the great sjnnes on the lateral

walls of the carapace. The presence of these is not so constant, but they are

never seen on the carapace of any zosea in either of the other two orders.

In the Anomura great lateral spines, and sometimes smaller spines,

project from the posterior margin of the carapace these, together with
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the rostrum, more or less important, is a feature peculiar to this order,

and from my own knowledge I am not aware of any exception to this

rule. But Claus, in his work so frequently quoted, has given the figure

of one that has all the characters of the zoaea of the Anomura ; but he calls

it an " Erichthina larva" (PI. IV., fig. 1), but adds, " Nach Willemoes-

Suhm die Larva von Leucifer "                                                                                                                                    but certainly it  bears no resemblance to
                                                                                                                                                              ;

the young Erichthina as it quits the ovum of the adult Squilla. Another

feature that especially belongs to the zoaea is that of the terminal somite

of the pleon, or telson. It is always forked in the Brachyura, and the

few cases in which the terminal spines are short, still retain a distinct

and characteristic feature of the group.

In the zosea of the Macrura the carapace is free from spines or processes,

and the terminal somite is flattened out into a broad thin fan-like plate,

divided in the median line by a more or less defined emargination.
    Now, if we compare the zosea of the Anomoura with these two

groups, we shall find that the tendency is to class them from their general
form with the zoaea of the Macrura. And this, without exception, includes

the Porcellanidae, Dromidse, and other depressed forms, as well as the

Paguridae. And the stage in development of the antennae exhibits an ap-

proximation to the Brachyura zoaea only in the first pair, while in all

the other appendages the Macrura features prevail.
                                            ;

ON OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.  203

     It would therefore necessitate, if the Anomura be excluded from its
place in the classification of the Crustacea as a sub-order, as suggested by
Claus, that it should go over to the Macrura as a whole, including the
genera Dromia and Galathea. But it appears to me that if Claus' figures

be those of Albunea (Crustacean Systems, PI. IX., figs. 1-10), as he thinks
probable, the evidence is strongly in favour of the retention of the sub-

order, for the broad fan-like telson is suggestive of an internal Anomurus

structure.

     It would appear, therefore, the evidence is much in favour of the argu-
ment that the development of Crustacea shows there is a group of zoaea

between the two well-defined orders that exhibit features that belong to

it, and are not common to the others ; and these features show an advance

in the development of the crustacean embryo before it quits the ovum.
     The nearest form of crustacean life to the zoaea when it quits the ovum,

appears in the young of Squilla, which has long been known by the name
of Alima. The advancement in development is shown in the distinctly

pedunculated character of the eyes ; in the articulated condition of the
peduncle and the two distinct branches of the first pair of antennae ; in the

character of the gnathopoda, which assumes a resemblance more dis-
tinctly typical of the adult feature ; and in the advanced development

of the four posterior pairs of pereiopoda.

     Alima is more advanced in development when it quits the egg than
zoaea, but not so much so as the young of the genus Homarus, which is
developed in what Claus and Fritz Miiller have named the Mysis stage

that is, the appendages of the cephalon are well advanced towards their
adult form, and those of the pereion carry a secondary branch, or ecphysis,

attached to the third joint or ischium of each pair of pereiopoda.

     But in this last-named genus we find that some of the pleopoda are
present ; and the curious phenomenon exists, that, while an enormous
amount of development has gradually proceeded to such an extent that
all the appendages are rapidly assuming the permanent type, those of

the pleon, which in some genera are in advance of those of the pereion,
in Homarus remains in abeyance, and appear not to have progressed

beyond the zoasa stage.

     This curious fact is exemplified more decidedly in the genus Palinurus,
where the pleon appears to be in a still more embryonic condition, while

the cephalon and pereion are distinctly pronounced, in a parallel con-
dition with that of Homarus, from which it differs most apparently in the

length of the pereiopoda in Palinurus, and in the absence of the chelate

character of the first pair of pereiopoda.

   --In the young of Crangon boreas (Pbipps) which naturalists have
--been divided in opinion as to whether it should be embraced in the same

genus with Crangon vulgaris or not the young is advanced in development

beyond the condition of the zoaea as it is in Crangon vulgaris. It

quits the ovum with all its appendages conspicuously advanced, whether
they belong to the cephalon, pereion, or pleon. This we find to be also

the case in the genus Thalascaris, an undescribed deep-sea genus belong-

 ing to the Challenger collection of Crangonidas.

    A still further advance is found in a form closely allied to Alphceus,

that I believe has been recorded as a species, but which I described in
the ' Transactions of the Royal Society' under the generic name of Homaral-
phmus, on account of its resemblance in the adult form to Alphwus, and

in its young to that of Homarus.
--204
                  report 1878.

   A deep-sea genus, closely allied to that of Axius, that I have named

Eiconaxius, taken during the Challenger cruise in the Eastern seas,
has the same advanced condition of the embryo, and shows that the

Megalopa stage exists not unfreqnently in marine Macrura, although we
have previously had no evidence of it.

     The fresh- water genus Asia ens (PI. VI., fig. 5) and the land crab Gecar-
cinus, long since made known to us, the former by Rathke, and the latter by
Westwood, leave the ovum in the last stage, which is that of an approxi-
mation of form to the adult animal, while it yet retains many features that
exhibit incompleteness of development. This is most apparent in those
parts which show a tendency to depart from the characteristics of the order

to adapt themselves to constitutional requirements ; as, for instance, the

adult Atyheus mostly lives in dark places under stones, groping in mud

and in such like spots at the bottom of the sea at a few fathoms deep.
To suit this condition of things, it is highly convenient to the animal that
the eyes should be protected ; and since the peculiar habitat of the animal
is that of dark holes, those in which the eyes are least improved by use
are as suitable to its existence as others ; those which are protected and
least liable to injury become the kind most adapted to survive.

     Thus it follows, that while the rest of the animal advances in growth
the eyes remain in abeyance, and the anterior margin of the carapace
extends beyond and overlaps them, thus affording protection, and by its
tenuity admitting a sufficient amount of light for the purposes of the
animal's requirements. Thus it appears that the development of Alphceus
shows a relative retrograde character in the progress of the eyes to that
of other parts. So again, in the comparison of the pleopoda in the
Brachyura in the adult with those of the megalopa stage of the same
animal, we find that of the younger framed upon a simple type adapted

--for swimming, while in the adult it is altered to suit other purposes in

the female to snpport the gravid ovum, and in the male those of the
anterior to assist in copulation, while those of the posterior are more or
less rendered obsolete in consequence of the absence of any duty to fulfil.

     The study of the several forms in which the embryo quits the ovum in

Crustacea is, I believe, very instructive, as bearing on the tendency of

variation of forms in adult animals.

     From the earliest forms to that of the most perfect, in which the
brephalus quits the ovum, there is a series of stages in which the embryo
appears ready to take upon itself the conditions of a free and independent

animal. This capability does not appear to be connected with any par-
ticular adult type, or conditions of existence, but exists in closely allied
species and genera as well as in those that are extremely distinct : neither
does it appear to bear any relation to the more or less advanced character

of the several genera.

     The following list is the order of the various stages of development,
when the brephalus quits the ovum, together with the adult form from
which it is derived.

1. Nauplius       Euphausia (Metschuikoff), Penasus ? (F. Miiller.)
2. Meta-naupliu9  None.
3. Proto-zosea    None.
4. Zosea          Brachyura, Anomura, and some Macrura.
5. Phyllosoma
6. Megalopa       Palinurus.

                  Astacus (Rathke), Gecarcinus (Westwood).
          ON OUK PRESENT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CRUSTACEA.                                                                                                                                                                          205

In this list the earliest or nauplius form belongs to Euphausia, or the

lowest stage in the classification of the adult animal ; while the next

stage, or zoaea condition, belongs to all the higher forms with the exception

of one genus only among the Brachyura, and some of the Macrura.

To these belong the phyllosoma and megalopa stages.

Before we can conclude our report on the development of Crustacea, it is

desirable that we should examine the earlier stages of the embryo, as well

as the character of the various ova in relation to the adult forms.

The eggs of Crustacea vary in size in different genera and sometimes in

form, but not very much in this latter feature, never more than from

round to oval and egg-shaped. But in size the vai'iation is greater, and

this not in relation to the proportion of the animal ; for Palinurus, which

is two feet long, has the ovum only one-quarter the size of that of Astacus,

which is only three inches long.

Some idea may be gathered by the following list of the diameter of the

eggs  of  the  animals                                                                                               that  have  been examined                                                                     that  are  from the ovum

the vitellus appears to divide into larger masses, each mass being the con-
gregation of a number of cells adhering together by compression, as if
the cells had increased in size and with the increase enforced a correspond-
ing pressure against each other ; each cell, moreover, contained within
itself a number of smaller ones.

     The vitellus at a not very distant period becomes transparent, accord-
ing to our observation, at one spot (PI. VII., fig. 2a) on the margin.

When viewed laterally, it appears like a line of clear fluid near the chorion,

while the cells of the vitellus that are in contact with it have become
large and transparent, but tolerably even along its margin. This line
extends along the surface and deepens towards the centre. Later and
closer inspection shows that this transparent region extends to some
depth below the surface, and continued examination demonstrates that
it is progressive, so that the vitellus, while united at one point, is so
deeply divided at the opposite, that it appears to cover the embryo on
each side. Soon the cells appear to congregate together into lobes and
film over with a skin of extreme tenuity ; but these lobes, a, b, c, upon

inspection are repeated on each side, while a central one occupies a space
between them, while another, more important, is also apparent in the
same line ; all these are, at this stage, nearly equal in progressive de-
velopment, the two central being perhaps the largest, certainly the longest.

(PI. VII., fig. 3.)

     Soon after, three or four smaller lobes are seen to be formed in a con-

tinuous line with the preceding marginal ones, at this early stage the last-

named central lobe may be observed to divide into two equally prominent

Aones at its extremity.  little later and all the several lobes become

clearly defined. The four latest pairs that appeared are less massive than

the three previously existing pairs, and the whole, even at this early

embryonic stage, may from their relative position and arrangement be

detected in their connexion in the advanced embryo. (PI. VII., fig. 4.)
     The three pairs of lobes that were first brought into existence are more

massive and globular in their appearance. They are marked a, b, c, in

the figures, and very soon may be observed to assume definite forms.

The first (a) is rather long and compressed. The second (b) globular

at one extremity but apparently extended at the other ; while the third

(c) is extended and bilobed at its extremity. Under a slight compres-

sion these distinctions of form become readily appreciable to observation.

It is within our power to determine with confidence at this early

stage that these three pairs or sets of lobes occupy the position of the

future organs (a) of vision and antennge (b and c). The great central lobes

that separate them, and which in the decapoda approach each other, cor-

respond, the one to the labrum, the other to the terminal extremity of the

animal ; and the three or four smaller lateral lobes (d, e, f, g) that appear
a little later correspond with the oral appendages of the future animal.

Having ascertained in this incipient condition the relation of the first

croup of three anterior pairs of lobes to the appendages of the adult

animal, and observed how closely these lobes correspond with each other

at first, and how they vary and become distinct from the succeeding,

a distinction that is suggestive of their being a separate group of append-

--age^ leads to the conviction that they correspond with the three an-

terior pairs of appendages in the earliest or nauplius form of Crustacea, as

they exist in the brephahis of the Cirripedia.

     To strengthen this idea and give it demonstration, take the small dark
                                            ;;

spot that is considered to be an imperfect organ of vision. The oph-

thalmic spot is visible at this period in the embryo. (PI. VII., fig. 5.)

     If we follow this examination throngh succeeding periods, we find the
progression of the development of the embryo to be distinct and con-
tinuous, and the changes important and reliable.- The small ophthalmic
spot is present and the two central lobes are still in apposition, but have
become more elongated. The first (a) of the lateral lobes has enlarged and
become more massive and consolidated in structure. The second and
third (b, c) have increased very considerably in length and lost the lobe-
like appearance, putting on that of more extended appendages ; whereas

those of the three succeeding pairs of lobes still retain their simple

lobe-like character. (PI. VII., fig. 5.)

    The several parts are now becoming very distinguishable in their

relation to the rest of the animal, and it is interesting as well as
instructive to examine the nature of the structure in detail.

     The first or most anterior pair of lobes, a, meet together at the anterior
extremity, at the union of which the ocular spot is visible, while they
are separated at the opposite by the intervening central lobe which we
have already determined to be the labrum (lb.) The entire mass differs from
the other portions of the embryo by being of an opaline and less trans-
parent appearance. It is formed by an aggregation of exceedingly minute

cells that appear to cohere closely together ; these lobes appear to be con-
tinuous with a great central mass that extends from one extremity of the

animal to the other. Soon we perceive some pigment cells forming a small,
dark, irregular stripe deep within the anterior lobes, a, and by its arrange-
ment apparently separating off a portion of the great opaline mass.

(PI. VII., fig. 5.)

      This stripe of pigment is the early or incipient condition of the great
black cornea that is so conspicuous an object in all young Crustacea.

At the same period, near the opposite extremity of the ovum a small
and irregular pulsation may be observed. This is the position of the
future heart. At first the pulsation is very slow, feeble, and irregular
a small corpuscular body may be seen jerked forward and backward within

a small sacular space or hollow, after unequal intervals of rest. After a
time a solitary corpuscle is seen to burst through an opening in the walls

of the sac. This at distant intervals is repeated, and after a time more
frequently, until in a day or two the throb of the sac becomes more con-
stant, the presence of the corpuscles more numerous, and the flow of
them increasingly more regular and continuous.

     The vitellns has now decreased in size, but not to any very considerable
extent externally, but is gradually decreasing internally. At the opposite
extremity to the anterior lobes of the embryo, the margin of the vitellus
may be observed as having broken into a series of very even cells
(PI. VII., fig. 6), transparent in colour and regular in position, forming
two or three very decided rows, until they gradually disappear in the

undeveloped structure of the vitellus.
     The external surface of these several rows of transparent cells appears

(PL VII., fig. 6) to be enclosed by a membrane of extreme tenuity, that
is evidently connected with and forms the outer walls of the alimentary
canal, al. The marginal cells appear to build up the fibrous structure of

the walls, while certain small particles of granular waste (gw) matter fall
into the central passage. Here they exist as foreign bodies of not any

large amount, and lie enclosed within a cavity of their own makinc
--208
report !878.

within this cavity the small particles of opaque irregular granulose matter

move forwards and backwards with an uneven movement corresponding

to an irregular contraction of the walls of the alimentary canal.

    When this organism is so far advanced as to extend to the region beneath

the heart, it exists continuously to the terminal extremity of the pleon,

and the great dorsal artery, da, may be distinguished leading directly from

the heart to the terminal extremity of the animal, just beneath the dermal
surface of the embryo as it lies in close contact with the chorion of the
egg. The heart lies just beneath the dorsal posterior extremity of the
carapace, the posterior and lateral margin of which, mc, traverses the animal
just behind the heart in a slightly waved line to the eye. The antennae
have a distinctly appendicular appearance, and reach beyond the three
or four succeeding pairs of lobes, and terminate, one, b, in a single pointed
branch, the other, c, in two branches terminating in a serrated extremity.

     The oral appendages have not much departed from the lobular condi-

tion, but three other pairs, which appeared behind them, have enlarged

and are rapidly increasing and become double-branched. At the base of
these appendages the great opaline mass, ng, may be seen extending, being

apparently' doubled on itself, just behind the last pair exhibited, but in

reality following the inflection of the ventral surface of the folded embryo.

This continuous opaline mass may now readily be determined to be the

embryonic condition of the nervous ganglia. m
     The several parts from this time rapidly and regularly progress in the

development of their structure. The ophthalmic lobes gradually appear

to increase in condensation, every cell exhibiting a distinct but not very

opaque nucleus. The larger and rounder cells are nearer the periphery,
those that are deeper become compressed into angular shapes, while
those that are nearest the cornea arrange themselves in columnar

masses, most distinct towards their base.
     The antennae lie folded backwards along the margin of the carapace.

The mandible is directed inwards, and is invariably a single lobe, while
the two succeeding oral appendages are bilobed, with a tendency to

break up into more divisions. (PI. VII., fig. 7.)
     The development of the pleon is completed, as far as its external and

internal parts are apparent, at the period when the development of the
heart is advanced so that it is enabled to pulsate. The remainder of the

period necessary for incubation appears to be devoted to the completion of

the anterior appendages, and that of the internal viscera. (PI. VII., fig. 8).
     The vitellus is continuous with the development of the animal, and

exists in an inverse ratio with that of the growth of the embryo. When

it is entirely converted, the growing form has progressed as far as it is
capable through internal forces. To add to its further development, it is
necessary that it should obtain a fresh stimulus from agencies beyond its

own organization. Its vitality has advanced as far as it is capable, and
if forces its way by the rupture of the egg-case into other conditions.

     As a free animal, the brephalus exists, as I have shown before, in
various forms, which are probably dependent upon the length of time
that the embryo remains in the ovum. For extended observation appears
to demonstrate that it quits the ovum of various genera in almost every

stage of its embryonic growth.

Report of a Committee consisting of Professor Eolleston, Major-
   Greneral Lane Fox, Professor Busk, Professor Boyd Dawkins, Dr.

   John Evans, and Mr. F. Gr. Hilton Pbice, appointed for the pur-

  pose of examining Tivo Caves containing human remains, in the

   neighbourhood of Tenby.

Operations were commenced in the way of the exploration of the " Little
Hoyle " Cave, Longbury Bank, parish of Penally, near Tenby, on Monday,
July 22, 1878, and were continued during that week and upon the

ensuing Monday.
     It will be well to begin our report by a summary of the results which

we have attained, and in the second place to give in detail the facts upon
which our general conclusions have been based.

     The two caves which we here examined are contained in a peninsula of
mountain-limestone known as " Longbury Bank," bounded on either side
by a valley which unites with its fellow at the bluffly-ending N.E. ex-
tremity of the " bank." If we compare the levels hereinafter given with
the facts spoken to by the raised beaches along this coast, and by other
observations we cannot doubt that Longbury Bank was once, and that

in no very remote geological period, washed on either side by the sea,
and presented much the same general appearance as some of the still so-

1878.  p

                                                                                       ;

conditioned banks in the neighbourhood of Pembroke. Of the two caves

examined by us, one contained no objects of special interest, and the other

had been previously investigated by other explorers, viz., the Rev. H. H.

Win wood, of Bath (see ' Cave Hunting,' by Professor Boyd Dawkins,

E.R.S., p. 133, and ' British Mammalia,' Memoirs Pakeont. Society, 1878,

p. xxii.), and Mr. Edward Laws, of Tenby (see ' Journal of Anthropo-

Alogical Institute,' August 1877). very considerable segment, however, of

this latter cave had been left unexamined, and it has been by the ex-

amination of this undisturbed portion of the cave, and by the clearing

out and investigation of the contents of all the rest of the cave, and

comparison of them with the specimens previously obtained and most

liberally put at our disposal for this purpose by Mr. Edward Laws, that

we have been able to come to the following results.

     The cave in question, known in the neighbourhood as " Little Hoyle,"

in contradistinction to a much larger cavern close by, known as " Hoyle's
Mouth," may be divided roughly into two main segments, one beginning

with a large mouth opening northwards, and extending from that mouth in

a direction S. and with a sharp slope upwards up to a point distant 25 feet

from the mouth                                                                         the other of about 16 feet in length, dipping downwards
                                                                                    ;

from that point in a S.E. direction, to communicate by a narrow hole with

a wide cave rnouth on the S.E. side of the bank in which bones of man,

bear, and ox had been previously found by Mr. Laws. This second

segment of the cave had underlaid one of those " initiatory areas of

depression," to use the phraseology of the late Professor Phillips (see

' Report of British Association,' Bath Meeting, 1864, p. 63-64), which

ultimately lead, and here had led, to the breaking-in of the cave's roof,

and which might here be spoken of in the phraseology of the county as a

" sink " or " soaker." It was filled up to a depth of nearly 10 feet with

fragments of limestone, and made earth containing bones of men, domestic

animals, foxes, rabbits, and oyster and limpet shells. "We may speak of

it hereafter as the " segment of depression."

     This " segment of depression " had been scarcely touched by any ex-

plorers previously to ourselves. The longer segment of the cave, opening

northwards, may be spoken of as the " north cave ; " and a comparatively

low diverticulum 16 feet long, branching off from it to the east, and

widening from 3 feet to 10 feet for about 9 feet of its length, we may

speak of as the " east chamber." This last we found by means of smoke

to communicate through a narrow flue, with a small flat surface near the

top of bank, which was potentially an "area of depression," but had

actually been a fox-earth. Having in mind the levels and communications

of the several parts of this cave, and considering in connection with them

the relative proportions and conditions in which the contents of the

cave, viz., (1) breccia and stalagmite, (2) red cave-earth, (3) black earth

mixed with angular stones, (4) worked flint and other implements,

(5) fragments of pottery, (6) ashes, and (7) bones of men and of beasts,
pleistocene and other, found in the different segments of the cave, we are,

on the whole, of opinion that though the main or north portion of the

cave was used by man for purposes of habitation in times at least as

early as those in which the brown bear (Ursus Arctos) was still living in
this country, the part of the cave in which the greater part of human

remains were found, viz., the "segment of depression," has come to con-

tain those remains simply by the falling in of its roof, and of a burial-

place which had existed over it whilst it was yet only an " initiatory area
ON THE EXAMINATION OF TWO CAVES NEAR TENBY.             '211

Weof depression."    are farther of opinion that at no geologically recent

time previous to that of onr clearing out of the cave can any very free

intercommunication have existed between these two portions of it, at least

at times when they were above the level of the sea ; for the traces, at least

those which are unmistakeable and unambiguous, of its habitation at one

time by man and at another by pleistocene animals, are confined to its north-

ern portion, which it is difficult to think they would have been if its two

portions had been in open communication with each other ; though the

north cave is intrinsically as at present, and must have been always, better

Wesuited for the purpose in question.  have not found any evidence in

this cave of man's having been a contemporary of the extinct pleistocene

animals. The remains indeed of these animals themselves consist mainly

of comparatively small fragments, and are representative merely of much

larger quantities which were washed out of it by the sea in some later

occupancies of its interior, or may have been otherwise removed.
    There can be little doubt that, though man used the " north cave " for

purposes of habitation, the area above the south part of it was not used

·except for purposes of interment. Otherwise, more relics of the articles

for daily use in life would have been found in that segment. But we have

no evidence to show that the first use of the " north cave " for habitation

may not have been even long anterior in date to the first use of the other

area for interment.

Nearly all the human bones, whether of the skull, limbs, or trunk,

which were found by us in this cave, came from the previously undisturbed

space in the " segment of depression ; " some few, however, were found

externally to the north entrance of the cave, and must, ex hypothesi above

stated, have been passed down the whole length of the slope constituted

by the " north cave." Nearly all, again, of the human skull-bones found

by Mr. Edward Laws (' Journal Anth. Institute,' Aug. 1877) were lying

close together, near the southern extremity of the north cave, where its

upward sloping floor reaches its summit and becomes continuous with

that of the "segment of depression." In other words, nearly all the human

bones found in this cave were in positions into which they might, as the

sections show, have been thrown or rolled if they had been lying on the

roof of the " segment of depression/' when that roof fell in, and, as the depth

from the present natural surface round the "segment of depression" down

to the red cave-earth at the bottom of it may be taken as being from

12 to 14 feet, we have here a fall sufficient to account at once for the frag-

mentary condition of the human and other bones found in this space, and

for the space over and within which they were distributed or dispersed.

Ex hypothesi, these bones would be showered down upon a watershed-like

line of demarcation between the "north cave" and the "segment of

depression," and scattered in either direction much as is the sand in an

inverted hour-glass. In some cases a few bones such as the upper cervical

vertebras and some of the cranial bones would retain their natural rela-

tions of apposition, especially at the circumference under the cave walls
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

in others they would be widely separated ; and the long bones would

in almost every case be broken into longer or shorter segments. This

was actually the state of the case ; a state not explicable on the hypothesis
of their having been introduced, as bones must so often be held to have

been, by water-carriage, to say nothing of the impossibility of the feeding-

ground, represented by the upper surface of the bank having been large

enough to furnish sufficient water for such flotation.

212 report-- 1878.

We are not aware that this explanation of the presence of human bones

mixed with those of domesticated animals in a cave by the gradual or

sudden descent into it of such bones from a superimposed interment is

necessitated by the phenomena  of  any other                                                                                                                                                                cave                         it is obvious  enough,

however, that the concave surface presented by an " initiatory area of

depression " would be very likely to suggest itself as a convenient site

for such a purpose to any race of men who might be sufficiently free at

once from the conventionalities of civilised life, and from the superstitions

of savage life, and might be glad to take an easy way of burying their

dead out of their sight. It must also be plain that no mode of burial,

whether practised by civilised or by savage men, would by itself account

for the scattering through so many (12-13) feet in depth of so many

human bones, of so many (9-11) individuals, and this in the absence of

any undisturbed burial of an entire skeleton or of a burnt body.

If the hypothesis of a number of interments having been let down into

the "depression segment" will account for the presence of human bones in

that portion of the Longbury Bank Cave, the great abundance of certain

domesticated animals, viz., of the goat and cow, and the presence of

--the pig and horse, as also of edible shell- fish limpets, oysters, and
--winkles in smaller quantities, in the northern or larger portion of the

cave, as also the discovery in it and upon its natural floor of the ashes of

a fire-place, must be taken to prove that the main portion of the cave
was used as a human habitation. Some little weight, but not very much,

may also be given to the fact that of the few fragments of pottery and

bone implements found inside the cave, all were found either in this part

of the cave or on the surface elsewhere                                                                                                                                                                     and that of the worked stone im-
                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

plements, all but the single specimen found in the " depression segment

came also from the north cave. It would have been strange if this cave had

not been employed for purposes of habitation by some one or more of the

tribes of the neighbourhood, who must have become acquainted with it in

some one or more of the periods in which it was, owing to one of the up-

heavals which have taken place along this coast, left as comparatively dry

and commodious as it is at present. The easily available upward sloping

entrance, admitting of refuse being got rid of without much trouble,

and the height of the roof of this portion of the cave as well as the very
considerable " floor space " free from stalagmitic drip which it must

always since the glacial period have possessed in seras of upheaval, put

this portion of the cave at great advantage for dwelling purposes as com-

pared with the " segment of depression." And this advantage appears

to have made itself evident to the pleistocene lower animals, as well as to

neolithic and later man. For though some not inconsiderable amount of

pleistocene remains, notably bones gnawed by hyaenas, fragments of

teeth of rhinoceros, and large if not always identifiable fragments from

the large bones of that or other animals of similar bulk, were found in

the north cave ; these animals were not represented elsewhere in the

cave. Further, it is highly probable that the north cave and the segment

of depression may at all previous periods have been connected by but a

small passage, the fragments from the roof broken off by the glacial cold

or by the shocks of earthquakes having been accumulated in a great mass

on the water-shed-like line of demarcation between them, and so having

rendered access from the one to the other difficult. The opening of the

north cave into the segment of depression is, from the top of the arch of the

cave down to the natural bottom, five feet in height; and on the east side of

the opening there stands a mass of stalagmitic breccia three feet in height,

And debris may very probably have been piled up in this place to a still
Ahigher level than this.
                          fissure in the junction of the two parts of the

cave which still exists may have furnished an easy route for their descent.

It is of importance to note that the two portions of the cave appear to

have differed in function both in earlier and later times. The bones of

the pleistocene animals found in this cave were limited strictly to the

northern portion of it ; the same may be said of the ashes, and, with the

exception constituted by a single worked flint, of the implements of man's

manufacture ; and in this portion of the cave, whilst a very large quantity

of the bones of domesticated animals was found, only a few human bones

were discovered, the number of which is not greater than what the

scattering northwards and downwards which the falling in of the roof

of the depression segment, subsequently eked out by occasional causes

such as the interference of men or of burrowing animals, foxes,

rabbits, and badgers would adequately account for. On the other hand,

whilst the majority of all the human bones were discovered within or imme-

diately adjacent to the periphery of the segment of depression, the bones

of domesticated animals found within it were not more in number than

might be accounted for by the hypothesis of their having been th^ relics

of funeral feasts, a view which their being intermingled with the human

remains, as they would be if accumulated at successive interments, tends

to confirm.

     It may, indeed, be considered a matter for surprise that any pleistocene

bones or teeth were left in the cave when we consider its level and the
slopes of its floor ; but the few that were left, and its possible exposure
to the denuding influences of a pluvial period, it may be seen, might be
preserved from being washed out by lodgment in the pockets and an-

fractuosities along the sinuous walls of the cave.

     With reference to the period at which the owners of the human re-
mains may be supposed to have lived, whether in the Stone, the Bronze,
or the Iron age, the existence of the sunken forest at Westward Ho, on
the opposite side of the Bristol Channel, forbids us to forget that it may
have very well been some time later than the commencement of the
neolithic period when the sea last encroached upon and overwhelmed
areas in this district tenanted by stone-using men. And as such an

invasion would have left the contents of this cave in a very different
state from that in which we found them, even though no traces of
raetal of any kind were found inside any part of this cave, we must

not suppose that we are justified in placing the date either of the men
buried above or of the men who inhabited this cave far back in that
period. But further. Two of the pieces of pottery found, either inside or

in the talus just outside the north cave, appeared to be of the same style
as one which was found in a round barrow, containing a cremation urn
and burnt bones and flint chips, on the Ridgeway Hill, immediately

above the Longbury Bank ; and this may be supposed to suggest, though
it by no means proves, that the Longbury Bank cave-inhabitants were,

like the Ridgeway tumulus builders, of the Bronze age. Thirdly, in the
talus outside the north entrance, a spindle whorl made out of the bottom
of a jar of Samian ware, like two found in Dowker Bottom cave, in
Yorkshire (see Professor Boyd Dawkins's ' Cave Hunting,' p. 113), was
found ; and half of a saucer-shaped vessel of the same material showing

signs of ornamentation was found on the surface of the area of depres-
214 repokt-- 1878.

sion by Mr. Laws, lying by a piece of iron slag, the only piece of metal-

work found in or near this cave. Now these specimens would bring the

date of the inhabitation of the cave, if they had been found in situ within

it, down to a period as late as that in which the inhabitants had oppor-
tunities at least of procuring articles of Roman manufacture. There is

other evidence to show that the date of the burials on the roof of this

cave may have been no earlier than such a date ; but the finding of this

piece of pottery in the externally placed talus does not absolutely prove

the date of its being inhabited to have been so. But as regards the rela-

tive age of the human interments and of the human habitation of this

cave, it is of cardinal importance to note that two thin, flattish, fine-

grained red fragments of apparently Romano-British pottery were found,

in company with the human bones, deep down in the " depression seg-
ment." No other articles of human manufacture, however, except one

worked flint, though many remains of domestic animals, were found with

them. Still, it is difficult to think that these fragments were not of the

same date as the human bones found with them. On the other hand, in

the north cave and on the natural bottom, known locally as " Rabb,"

were found the ashes and fire-place already spoken of; and in the red

cave-earth, just inside the mouth of the north cave and beneath the black

mould, were found a flint chip, a horn-stone scraper, and a bone needle,

the juxtaposition of which is not without significance.

The finding of the remains of several dogs, one old and several young

ones, so closely mixed up with the human remains at the line of commu-

nication between the north cave and the segment of depression as to

suggest that the two sets of remains had been buried and had fallen down

together, and also the finding of a worked flint, and the absence of metal

in that segment, are phenomena usual or universal in neolithic interments.

But they have been all observed in interments even of the iron age.

    On the other hand, the finding of the bones of the brown bear (JJrsus

Arctos) in the black mould of the north cave, and notably also in the east

chamber, in company with, and similarly conditioned as to colour and

preservation to, the bones of man and of domestic animals, appears to

show with some probability that these latter remains should not take date

later than at least the time, about 900 years back, when this bear ceased

to infest Wales.

   We have, then, in the stone and bone implements found in the north

portions of this cave some tolerable evidence to the effect that it was

inhabited by man in probably late neolithic times. And whilst the

pottery found in the "depression segment," in company with the human

bones, appears to show that they, or, at any rate, the immense majority

of them, cannot be referred to an earlier than the Romano-British period,

the remains of the bear give us a certain datum line of at least 900 years

distance away from us as the latest period to which they can with any

probability be referred.

   We append a short summary of the results obtained from examina-

tion of all the bones obtained from this cave, whether obtained by Mr.

Edward Laws or ourselves, after they had been washed, cleaned, and

otherwise prepared.

Some 160 or so fragments of bones and teeth referable either to

rhinoceros or elephant were found scattered throughout the northern

Wesegments of the cave.  have not been able to find that they were in

positions apart from the other bones of more recent date, and usually of

different textural condition, belonging to domestic animals, to man, and

to certain ferce naturae still existing either in Great Britain or in Conti-

nental Europe which will be next specified. The steep slope of the part
of the cave in which they were found would render the disturbance of
them, and the interminglement of them with subsequent importations an

easy matter, whether the disturbing agent was the sea in a period of

subsidence, or rain in a pluvial period, or, finally, man himself in his

successive occupations of the cave.

    No remains of hyaenas were found by us amongst these palaeolithic

bones but the marks of gnawing, which are conspicuous enough npon
                                ;

many of these bones, are so closely similar to those produced by the

teeth of this carnivore elsewhere, that it is difficult to think they are

not to be ascribed to it ; and the more so as in other caves in this dis-
trict the hyaena is very abundantly represented both by bones and by

album grcecum.

    Most of the bones referable to the mammoth or rhinoceros are spongy

and  waterworn                                                     some  combining                               the   traces of  gnawings with  those  of
                                                                ;

waterwear. Some, on the other hand, have received much accession to

their weight and solidity, and have also become curiously polished on

their exterior by exposure to calcareous drip.

In the north cave and in its eastern diverticulum the remains of bear,,

roe, red deer, eagle, and black grouse were found, all being animals

which, without being extinct in Europe, or being foreign in strictness of

language to this part of it, would yet not be very likely to find their way

into this care in the present day. Of the bear species, Ursus Arctos, three

individuals are represented by the bones and teeth found here.

     Throughout the length and breadth of the cave, from its communica-

tion with the south cave to its northern opening, and in the talus lying

outside this opening, were found bones of domesticated animals, goat,

small ox, dog, pig. In the talus outside the north entrance some pelvic

bones were found, which I think are sheep and not goat bones. In the

same locality a nearly perfect skull of a goat was found. Some of the

domesticated animal bones appear to have been but of recent date, but a

great number bear marks in the way of weathering and of staining of a

very considerable antiquity. They represent breeds of small size.

The horse is, though but scantily, represented in the collection from

Longbury Cave ; and the wild boar we have failed to recognise here.
    The badger's, the fox's, and the rabbit's abound among the bones col-

lected here. The fox's represent a small variety.

As regards the human remains, the great majority of them were found in

the segment of depression or in the southward termination of the north cave

immediately adjoining and continuous with it. Most of the human bones

found by Mr. Laws were in the latter locality ; most of those found by

us were found  in                                                  the   former                                  but,  either by Mr.  Laws' or by us,  human
                                                                                                              ;

bones or teeth were, though but in very small numbers, found in every

part of the cave, not excluding even the south cave. The numbers of

--the several sets of fragmentary human bones may be given with some

approach to accuracy as follows : In the entire cave, exclusive of the

depression segment, about 150 fragments of more or less perfect human

bones were found ; from the depression segment alone about 350 frag-

ments were collected ; into the talus outside the north entrance some
6 to 10 fragments of a child and of an adult had found their way ; a human

tooth was found in the east cave ; and a piece of a skull and of a lower
216 heport-- 1878.

jaw were found in the mouth of the south cave. ' These numbers of

course very strongly support the view that these bones fell in from a

burial place corresponding to the segment of depression ; and that the
accident inseparable from such a tumbling down, and the subsequent

scattering inseparable from the presence of the burrowings of badgers and

foxes, account for the scattering of the comparatively insignificant num-

ber of bones found at any great distance from that area. It is instructive
also to put on record the fact that whilst a larger number of calvarial

bones was found in the depression segment, which we suppose to have
underlaid the place of interment of the human remains, than in all the
rest of the entire cave, only three more or less fragmentary lower jaws
were found in company with them ; whilst by Mr. Laws five mQre or less

nearly complete lower jaws were found in the north, and a large frag-

ment of a sixth in the south cave. The palaeontologist will find the fre-

quency of the separation of the lower jaw from the rest of the cranium,

with which he is so familiar, illustrated by this fact.

    We have absolute proof in the nine lower jaws just spoken of that

no less than nine human beings have their skeletons represented in the
collection made from this cave. Two fragmentary representatives of

--lower jaws found one in the talus outside the north entrance, the other

in the middle of the north cave--correspond probably to two other
skeletons, but it is just possible that they may be parts of some one or

other of the nine demonstrably distinct mandibles. Of these nine indi-

viduals, no less than five were males in or beyond the middle period of

life, one belonged to a woman in late life, one to a person about the age of

puberty, with the wisdom tooth as yet uncut, one to a child with the first

two molars just cut, one to a child with none but the milk teeth in

place.

Three more or less perfect calvaria have been reconstructed out of

the remains collected by Mr. Laws and ourselves ; one from the cranial
bones found in the north cave, two from those found in the depression

segment. All of the crania are dolichocephalic ; and one, a male skull,
that which came from the north cave, " mecistocephalic," in Professor

Huxley's language, with a cephalic index of 69, and with the pear-shaped
contour when viewed from above, due to rapid tapering from the level of

the parietal tubera forwards, which has so often been spoken of since

the writings of Professor Daniel Wilson as characteristic of many skulls

from the earliest sepultures of Great Britain. There is no doubt that

this is a very ancient form of skull, but the well-known tenacity and per-

sistence of such ancient forms forbids us to use it as an evidence as to

date. Of the other two, one belonged undoubtedly to a man, the other

to a woman                                                                    and neither, though dolichocephalic, are exaggeratedly 60,
                                                                           ;

as is the case with the first-named of the three.

     The long bones are all more or less fragmentary ; they do not pre-
sent any peculiarities specially worthy of notice ; the femora have not their
linece asperce greatly developed, though in one or two the upper portion of

the shaft is somewhat flattened from before backwards in the origin of
the insertion of the glutaeus maximus ; the tibia? are not platycnemic ; and
neither these nor any other of the bones give the notion of their owners

being much above or below the average size and height. In a word,
they have not the peculiarities of prehistoric bones. The human bones
present much the same appearance as to staining, wear and tear, and

weathering as the bones of bear and of domesticated animals found with
ON THE PHENOMENA OF STATIONARY TIDES IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL. 217

them. All three sets of bones alike differ from those belonging to the
palaeolithic period found here in being, except in a few instances, free
from interstitial calcareous deposit, and from marks of gnawing except by-

recent rodents.

     In one instance, some human bones were found imbedded in reddish-

white breccia. This breccia had been formed in several places along the
east wall of the north into masses about 3 feet to 3| feet in height, which
stood out against the wall like brackets. One of these, just 15 feet from
the north entrance, had embedded on its upper surface, which was about
3 feet 10 inches above the natural floor of the cave, the lower ends of

two human femora, which thus came to occupy just such a position as
they would be likely to do if picked up from the floor by some human
inhabitant who was incommoded by their presence and placed on the top
of the shelf-like bracket which was in the process of being added to by
drip. With these two human bones are concreted some bones of frogs

or toads, and at a depth of one foot a humerus of a roe, Cervus capreolus, was
found similarly embedded. It is of importance to note that these brackets
of breccia do not seem to be remnants of a floor which has disappeared from
between the side- walls of the cave ; no corresponding deposits at least ai-e
observable along the opposite wall on the west side, and, as is well known,
the stalagmite-forming drip, being regulated by the conformation of the
limestone, is very often anything but symmetrically arranged.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir William

   Thomson, Mr. W. Froude, Professor Osborne Reynolds, Captain
   Douglas G-alton, and Mr. James N. Shoolbred {Secretary), ap-

   pointed for the purpose of obtaining information respecting the

   Phenomena of the Stationary Tides in the English Channel and
   in the North Sea ; and of representing to the Government of
   Portugal and the Governor of Madeira, that, in the opinion of
   the British Association, Tidal Observations at Madeira or other
   islands in the North Atlantic Ocean would be very valuable,

   ruith the vieiv to the advancement of our knowledge of the tides
   in the Atlantic Ocean.

The Committee beg to report that last year the French Association

for the Advancement of Science, at their Meeting at Havre, which took
place subsequently to that at Plymouth, having had the subject of these
simultaneous tidal observations in the English Channel and in the North
Sea brought before them by the Secretary of the Committee, cordially
approved of the intended action of this Committee, and resolved to urge
upon the French Government that any observations required upon the
French coast should be undertaken by its engineers.

     At the commencement of the present year, the French Government
undertook to do this, in accordance with a programme of simultaneous
observations, approved of by the Chairman of the Committee.

     The Belgian Government likewise offered its co-operation at Ostend
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and in Holland the observations were kindly undertaken by the authorities
218 kepokt--1878.

at the month of the North Sea Canal and at Flushing ; while on this side
of the Channel, extending from Portland to Yarmouth, the port and other
authorities at the points selected also undertook the duties of making

the necessary observations.

     The results have not yet been all received, and they are not in a suffi-

ciently forward state to be presented at this meeting.
      In consequence of the great importance of accurate permanent tidal

records at Dover being available, the Chairman of the Committee urged

upon the Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord Granville, that a self-
registering tide gauge should be erected at Dover ; a proposal which met

with his Lordship's cordial approval and support.
     The Board of Trade have further consented to grant a suitable site for

the erection of a self-registering gauge on the Admiralty Pier, and have
undertaken to defray the cost thereof.

     The exact form best adapted to the place is at present under considera-
tion, but it is confidently hoped that before long a self-registering tide
gauge will be permanently at work at this very important locality.

     The subject of tidal observations at Madeira was brought under the
notice of H.M. Government by the Chairman of the Committee.

   A communication has lately been received from the Foreign Office,

saying that H.M. Minister at Lisbon, having urged the matter upon the
Portuguese Government, " has received the assurance that it will gladly
adopt the suggestion of the British Association and establish a tidal gauge

at Funchal."
      In consequence of the results of the tidal observations already under-

taken not being iu a sufficiently advanced state for presentation at this
meeting, the Committee request to be reappointed, and also that .£10 be
placed at their disposal.

to this department by Sir William Thomson, LL.D., in his capacity of
Chairman of the Committee of the British Association, " on Tidal Observa-
tions in the English Channel, &c," calling attention to the want of a
tide gauge at Dover, and enquiring whether the Board of Trade would be
disposed to undertake the expense of placing a continuous self-recording
instrument at the Government pier, where there is already a tide- well, I

am directed to acquaint you that this Board have received the sanc-

tion of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to the
expenditure for this purpose of a sum not exceeding one hundred and five

pounds (£105) (the estimated cost as given by Sir W. Thomson), and I
am to state that your Committee are at liberty to take the necessary

steps for fixing the gauge.

    I am to add that Mr. Druce, the Resident Engineer and Officer of

this Board at Dover, has been instructed to give such facilities in the
matter as he is able to afford.

     I have received the assurance that the Portuguese Government
will gladly adopt the suggestion of the British Association and establish
a tidal gauge at Funchal. The official note on the subject cannot be
sent for some days, as Senhor Corro is absent.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Sir
   William Thompson, Major-General Strachet, Captain Douglas
   Galton, Mr. G. F. Deacon, Mr. Rogers Field, Mr. E. Roberts,

   and Mr. J. N. Shoolbred (Secretary), appointed for the purpose
   of considering the Datum-level of the Ordnance Survey of Great
   Britain, with a view to its establishment on a surer foundation
   than hitherto, and for the tabulation and comparison of other
   Datum-marks.

The Committee, in their Report of last year, dealt with the question
of some uncertainties which existed as to the position of the

Ordnance datum-level, and of its relative position to other local datum-

marks in Liverpool. On the present occasion the Committee beg to report

that a list of local datum-marks, and the connexion of each with the
Ordnance datum, is in course of preparation. They beg to be reappointed,
with the grant of £10 (not drawn) to enable them to complete the list
of local datum-marks.

   Mr. C. W. Merrifield, Dr. C. W. Siemens, Mr. H. M. Brunel,
   Mr. J. N. Shoolbred (Secretary), Professor James Thomson, and

   Professor Sir William Thomson.

The Committee regret to say, that the Chairman has been unable

to complete the second series of experiments with the several instru-
ments for measuring the speed of ships.

     The Committee therefore beg to be reappointed, and that the grant
of £50 (which has not been drawn) be renewed.

220 report--1878.

Report of a Committee appointed for the purpose of further de-

   veloping the investigations into a Common Measure of Value in

    Direct Taxation, the Committee consisting of the Right Hon. J. Gr.
    Hubbard, M.P., Mr. Chadwick, M.P.* Mr. Morlet, M.P., Dr.
    Farr, Sir George Campbell, M.P., Mr. Hallett, Prof. Jevons,
   Mr. Newmarch, Mr. Shaen, Mr. Macneel Caibd, Mr. Stephen

   Bourne, Prof. Leone Levi, Mr. Hetwood, and Mr. Hallett (Sec.)

I. Your Committee presented to the British Association a first Report

of the results of their inquiry on this subject in 1876. In this inquiry,
following ordinary usage, they took income as the basis of their examina-

tion. They found, however, that in sundry jiroposed systems of common

valuation and assessment on this basis, incomes were sometimes considered
in themselves independently, sometimes in relation also to their owners.
The first consideration was directed to the real nature and constitution of
income, as the annual value, product, profits, or receipts of, or from,
some given source, whether land, labour, or capital. The other considera-
tion was directed to the income's relation to personal circumstances, or
in other words, to the owner's position in the scale of riches and poverty
.as determined by his possession. Assessment on the former principle
would vary with the positive value of the income, on the latter it would
vary with the value of the income qualified by the individual condition of

--the owner his individual tenure for example or his individual necessities.

£1,000 a year from land held on a short tenure or subject to large family
claims, would on the latter view be differently assessable to the same
income held on a long tenure or not subject to these claims, whilst on
the former and sounder view the two assessments would be the same.
The Committee in dealing with the subject referred to them, confine their
attention to the income's positive value. Positive value is the professed
Tjasis of the present Income Tax, and were it possible to adjust an Income

Tax to differences of individual tenure and necessities, as well as to
differences of positive value, some uniform method of comparing and

measuring the positive values of incomes would still be essential. It is
impossible to estimate the relative effect of incomes upon different in-
dividuals without first knowing their values considered in themselves.

     II. But the equal assessment of incomes according to positive value
demands a common measure of value, and legislation, in the absence of
such common measure, must act on a mere nominal equality which often
involves it in a real and gross injustice. £1,000 a year from perishing

-- --labour, that for instance of a barrister or physician, is taxed equally

with £1,000 a year from permanent land. The question then presented
itself, " how does the difference between nominal equality and true equality,
or as it might be called, the difference between nominal income and true
income arise, and how is it expressible ? " The Committee considered
that this difference was universally resolvable into the extent to which
the production of an income involved the expenditure of its source's
value. Labour, land, houses, and other great sources of income, are

--more or less consumed, impaired, or diminished some more, some less,

in producing income, and this varying diminution in the source's value
appears as a more or less enlarged income and makes it of more or less
nominal worth. Such nominal income is in fact a mere mixture of true
                                                       --

           ON A COMMON MEASURE OF VALUE IN DIRECT TAXATION. 221

income and source's outgoings, and the more the source is impaired in

value, the larger is the proportion of these outgoings in its composition,
whilst the greater also will be its nominal excess above true income.

--From these considerations the Committee arrived at the following simple

rule of general application : " Deduct from the income as at present
returned the outgoings that belong to its production, and the remainder
will be its taxable amount."

     III. Under such a rule, taxable income would not as at present be
land-rent, house-rent, labour-wages, &c, but land-rent minus land-
outgoings, house-rent minus house-outgoings, labour-wages minus
labour-outgoings, &c. These outgoings are for the most part the
sequels of productive wear, tear, and depreciation, involving cost of

repairs, maintenance, or replacement either of the source itself or of its

value. By their deduction the source's value considered as a capital or

principal, is maintained unimpaired, and the income left which would
always bear the same relation to source that interest bears to principal,

was called the source's "interest value," and was adopted as the common

measure of assessment. The plan of the Committee might indeed be
shortly summed up as the conversion of sources and incomes generally
to the form of principal and interest by uniform deduction of source's
outgoings, and might be indifferently denned as, " Taxation of the
Interest value," "Non-taxation of the Principal value as Income,"
"Exemption of Essential Outgoings," three equivalent expressions, each

one absolutely involving the other.
      IV. Incomes in their positive or source aspect as the object of direct

assessment and interest value as the assessment's common measure

such are then the chief conclusions of the last Report. In the present
inquiry, keeping this object and this measure distinctly in mind, and keep-
ing clear of all purely personal aspects, whether those of personal tenure
or of personal necessities, the Committee propose to determine more fully
the method and practicability of applying this measure to the chief cases
of actual Income and to append an approximate schedule of results.

      V. The rule of procedure in general is evidently that already given
for finding interest value, viz., " Deduct from the income as at present

returned all the outgoings that belong to its production," or speaking

independently of the Income Tax and its returns : " Deduct from the
 total receipts of any given source, the total cost of producing them, and
 the difference will be its interest value on taxable income." This being
 the rule, all that will be necessary for its particular application will be a
 knowledge of the receipts, and a knowledge of the outgoings or costs in
 each case in question. What are the costs to which land, houses, and

 mines are naturally subject in producing rents and royalties ? What

 are the costs to which ships, machinery, horses, cattle, vehicles, trade
 fixtures and furniture, railways, mills, and manufactories, in a word
 capital whether fixed or circulating, are subject in producing profits ?

 What are the costs to which labour, whether of offices, of professions, or

 of trades is subject in producing salaries, fees, or wages ? These costs
 consist as before stated of the source's outgoings through work, wear,
 and tear, and through depreciation in value by age and exhaustibility,
 and equally with that of the source's receipts a knowledge of them is
 implied in every comparison of values and is indeed the indispensable

 condition of all rational accounts.

      VI. Fortunately, however, the practicability of finding and deducting
--222 eeport 1878.

these outgoings, or costs, does not merely rest on the reason of the thing,

but in many cases is proved by actual precedent. The Income Tax Act

itself allows them in some cases, though it ignores them in others, both

recognition and non-recognition being equally haphazard and arbitrary.

It was recently stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that deduction

for depreciation in ships and railways, though not expressly recognised

in law, were practically recognised in the assessment offices. Deprecia-

tion in machinery is now added by special enactment, whilst the Law

Courts have recently discovered that allowance for depreciation in mines

has always been the real though the hitherto hidden meaning of the Act

itself. Special clauses of the Act expressly allow cost of repairs and

renewals. The immemorial usage of calculating the profits of capital in

business, viz., that of valuation of stock at the beginning and end of the

business year, and the inclusion of the difference in the profit and loss

account, involves a distinct deduction of source's outgoings, and the

Act in so far as it recognises this usage, recognises and allows this de-

duction. Moreover in other instances to which the Act is partially or

wholly blind, precedents of practicability are not wanting. Deductions

from gross annual value, in order to obtain rateable value, have ever been

recognised in local taxation, though in the absence of a common measure

of value, in a variable and uncertain manner. The Metropolis Valuation

Act of 1869, " an Act to provide for uniformity in the assessment of rate-

able property in the Metropolis," and the various Valuation Bills proceed-

ing from it, are founded upon these deductions, to which they attempt to

give a uniform and common basis, and their appended schedules, if not

wholly accurate, are valuable precedents for direct taxation generally. In
wthese, lands Avithout buildings are allowed a deduction of ^V; itu
                                                            .

^;buildings not houses of  houses are allowed a deduction varying

according to their class from £ to £, mills and manufactories a deduction

of £, &c. : all these deductions representing the expenses to which the
several properties are liable, as necessary to " maintain the hereditament

in a state to command its rent."

     VII. In the case of labour, however, no deductions are allowed either

in practice or in legislation, and yet the income from the labour of men

is as subject to essential outgoings, costs of maintenance, depreciation,
Aexhaustibility, as the income from houses or from horses.
                                                            man's

labour, it is popularly said, is his capital, but if so, it is both a con-

sumable and perishable capital. Like the labour of a horse, to take the

previous example, it undergoes a daily exhaustion of power that has to

be supplied by food. As the horse has to be clothed and stabled, so the
productive labourer has to be clothed and housed. As the horse by

age undergoes a depreciation of its value, so by age the productive
labourer undergoes a similar depreciation, and as the work and value

of the horse finally disappears, so does the labour and value of the

labourer disappear also. As questions of economic valuation, the cases
of the working horse and working man, be his work mental or manual,

are precisely analogous, and the outgoings of the labour's value that are

capable of calculation and allowance in one case, are capable of calculation

and allowance in the other. The calculation in the case of horses, is the
Anecessary condition of maintaining a business in horses.
                                                           job-master,

for example, may receive from the hire of a pair of horses worth £200,

which he supplies with food, stabling, and attendance, full £200 a year.

The Income Tax assessment even, would scarcely venture to charge such
ON A COMMON MEASURE OF VALUE IN DIRECT TAXATION. 223

a capitalist with an income of £200 a year for each pair of horses thus

let ; he would he allowed a deduction for the food, stabling, and hired

attendance. But the horses in the course of half a dozen years are worn

out, and have to be replaced, and he is allowed a deduction for this

expense also, if not in the shape of a fund annually put by for deprecia-

tion, at any rate in the shape of cost for resupply of diminished stock.

The Income Tax assessment, however, does charge in this manner the

labour of the capitalist himself, and thus not only is the man of industry

assessed on powers in his possession on which the man of idleness is not

assessed at all, but he is assessed on the gross receipts of these powers,

whilst their necessary expenditure, with the exception of the small in-

surance allowance, is absolutely ignored.

VIII. As an individual's labour is thus a possession of limited and

uncertain duration, and subject to an annual expenditure for maintenance,

the true mode of valuing its income would be to regard it as a terminable

annuity, subject to an annual cost. In this aspect the amount of this

annuity would be that of the labour income at present returned, its term

the average labour period, and the annual cost that of the labour's main-

tenance. This annual cost, which would in general be expressible as

some proportion or percentage of the income, added to the annual fund

necessary to replace the capital of the annuity, would be the deduction

required for finding the labour's interest value, or taxable income. With

the requisite statistics, the calculation of this deduction is a question of

arithmetic. By a witness in the Hume Committee, it was stated as ^ of

the present assessable labour income, just as the deduction in mills and

manufactories is given as ^, and that of certain classes of houses as ^ of

their respective rents, and this, if not the exaot truth, must be a close ap-

Aproximation to it.  summary of these deductions is presented in the

following schedule, and the general adoption of the single principle they

illustrate would secure the immense advantage of a uniform plan of

assessment throughout both local and imperial direct taxation.

    IX. Where the nominal or gross income is the joint result of property
and personal labour, as in all trades, and in many professions, we have

first to consider the property income and labour income separately. If

the property be valued by the foregoing rules as a principal or capital, it
is a truism to say that the interest of the principal will be the interest-
value of the property, and that this subtracted from the joint income
will give the labour's nominal income. Deducting the labour's out-
goings from the latter, we have the labour's interest-value, which added
to the property's interest-value, makes the total assessable return re-
quired. Examples of the rule are given in the first Report. Being merely
a rule of valuation it is as legitimately capable of application by the owner

of a business, or by his recognised accountant, as any of the rules now in
use, and being thus applied it involves no exposure of his capital or other
detail of his business. The following are forms of ordinary account^

illustrative of the application of the rule to particular cases.

     X. To the question of the mode and practicability of applying the
"Common measure of interest-value to cases of property and labour in-

come, the above is perhaps a sufficiently detailed answer. In all these
-cases the measure is applied to the positive, or source aspect of the in-
come, and not to the personal. In all, the deductions are intended to
represent the source's average essential outgoings. In all, the interest-
value is the excess of receipts over these outgoings, or the principal-value
of each source is, by means of the deduction, maintained unimpaired, and

hence in a condition to command its future income. The Dr. and Cr.
forms appended are exemplars of the modes of making the deductions.
They show that the process of making them is merely that of keeping a

strictly uniform and just system of accounts, and that any system of
accounts that omits them is neither uniform nor just. Moreover, the
balance of each account exhibiting the true taxable income, is that alone
needful for the return. It is not affirmed that the amount of deduction

--given in each case is exact, but exactitude at least insurable exactitude

-- is purely a question of fact. From the facts obtained in a Government

office, for example, it might appear that as in the case of houses the pro-
portion of outgoings diminishes as the receipts increase, so would they also
in the case of labour. But if so the remedy already applied to one in
local assessment would be the remedy for both in imperial assessment,

viz., a scale of outgoings relative to such increase of receipts.

Comparison of the Measures of Interest-value and Capital-value.

     XI. Such is the system of assessment which your Committee recom-

mend for adoption. In discussions however on the question of direct

assessment, another common measure has often been proposed. It has

been proposed to assess incomes, not according to their real annual or

interest value, but according to their total or capital value, or in other

words according to the present money value to which they are equivalent,
and from which they might be supposed to be derived. Valuation by
capital value, capitalisation as it is called, finds a common measure and

expression in the numbers defining what is called the years' purchase of

the income. Thus an income valued at 25 years' purchase, ceteris

paribus, is worth twice as much as one valued at 12^ years' purchase, and
in the system of capital- value would be taxed twice as much. The figure

defining the years' purchase of an income, is thus at once an index or

measure of an income's value and of its assessability. As this system is

a simple, popular, and well understood mode of valuation, it will be useful

to consider and compare the results it gives with those of interest-value,
and this comparison can be made by means of the annexed table (p. 226).
The first column expresses the series of incomes equal in present value,

but varying in annual amount, from £4 per cent, up to J20, a variation

ON COMMON MEASURE OF VALUE IN DIRECT TAXATION.  227

XII. It appears to be sometimes thought that the capitalisation of in-

comes is equivalent to the conversion of an Income Tax into a Property

Tax. This however is not so. An Income Tax, whatever the measure

Aused, always demands an income.  Property Tax, however, would take

effect if there were no income. It is indeed the necessary condition of

property, having value, to produce income sooner or later, and equal

properties in the long run produce equal incomes ; but the advantage of

an Income Tax over a Property Tax, is that it falls on the property only

when it does produce an income, and in proportion to the amount pro-

duced. One of the advantages of a Property Tax over an Income Tax is

said to be that of its incidence on certain forms of value not reached by

the Income Tax, as for example, lands annually increasing in value in the

neighbourhood of growing towns, but yielding no corresponding rent,

and also the furniture, &c, of private houses. If true income be in-

crement or increase of value it may be fairly questioned whether the

annual increase of value in these lands is not true income, and truly liable

to Income Tax. Under the present system, a capital invested in such

property year by year increases in value, but pays no Income Tax on the

increase, whilst the same capital invested in funds or farms would be

annually assessed on its increase. It may be also questioned whether pro-

perty in furniture, rightly considered,is not as much property yielding an in-

come to its owner as the house which he owns and at the same time inhabits.

It has an annual utility, and its value invested in other forms would yield

income. Moreover, in this same form, if hired instead of owned, it yields

an annual income annually taxable, and it is difficult to see how the fact

of the same property being owned by one and used by another, and being

owned and used by the same person, can make a difference in the nature

of its annual use, value, or product. Questions of this kind, however,

belong rather to the province and extension of a direct tax than to its just

valuation.

XIII. Many of the objections which have been urged against capital-

value are probably grounded, not so much on a repugnance to the measure

itself, as to the mode in which it has been used, as for example, in re-

ference to the subject of tenures pointed out in the last Report. Uni-

formity of basis and application, whatever the measure may be, is of the
last importance, and the confusion that may attend the use of a true

measure was well exemplified in the arguments on the Knowles case, a

colliery Income Tax appeal, recently decided in the Court of Exchequer.

In this important case for Income Tax reform, the plaintiffs, maintaining the

principle that real income or profit is the difference between expenditure

and receipts, claimed at law a deduction from the taxable receipts of coal

mines for the exhaustion of the coal. Among the replies made by the Inland

Revenue Office as defendants, was " that if real income be the difference

between expenditure and receipts, why should not a person who buys a

lease in lands or consols be assessed to the Income Tax on the difference

--between what he gives for his lease and what he receives from it"

difference that would practically amount not to the interest-value of the

consols or land, but .to the interest-value of his purchase money. The

answer is, " real income is the difference between expenditure and re-

ceipts, but the analogy of a lease is a fallacious one. In expending

money on a lease, you are not, as such, producing an income, nor are you

buying that which produces it you are simply buying incomes already
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

dealer in incomes, just as you might be a dealer in sugars or teas, or in
any other commodity, taxable antecedently to your purchase, and you buy
them subject to all their burdens. Your receipts are in this case them-
selves incomes, themselves the difference between expenditure and pro-
duct, and the tax on them, though charged to the full amount, is a charge
on the money that buys them only in the same manner that the tithe is a
charge on the purchase money of lands."

     The fallacy of refusing a deduction to the products of perishable
sources, and the fallacy of claiming a deduction for the terminable tenure
of permanent products, are the obverse forms of a financial illusion. Both
fallacies arise from the phenomena of transfer. In the former, true
capital by transfer appears as income, and is taxed as income ; in the
latter, true income by transfer appears as capital, and as capital would

be exempted. It is this double illusion, ever manifesting itself in investi-
gations on the Income Tax, that has probably confused the vision of
economists and statesmen, and hitherto rendered abortive all attempts at

reform. Whether direct taxation be incident on property or on its pro-

-- --ducts on capital or on income for a series of years matters little ; but

it is monstrous that a tax which professes to be either a Property or an
Income Tax, should treat capital as if it were income, or income as if it

were capital.

    XIV. It sometimes appears to be thought that after all there is little

practical difference whether taxation be levied on gross income or on net,

Aon the higher or lower level as it is called. " certain sum has to be

raised, and what matters it whether it be raised as a smaller percentage
of a larger sum or as a larger percentage of a smaller one." Doubtless
if gross income bore the same relation to net in each case such an argu-
ment would be valid, but no such relation exists. The " grossness " of
an income stands for the amount of undeducted expenditure the income
contains, and gross incomes are of every degree of "grossness." The

-- --true net pound the interest-value pound is in all cases 20s., but the

gross pound is as variable as the nature of sources and the customs of
free contract. In land rent the gross pound is legally defined in the
Metropolis Valuation Act as 19s., in house rent as varying according to
the class of house from 15s. to 17s. Sd., in the rent of mills and manu-
factories as 13s. 4>d., in the wages of labour, though -not yet legally
defined, it is probably only 10s. All however are pounds gross, and in an
assessment proportioned to gross value like that of the existing Income

Tax, are equally assessable. By this mode of reckoning, an Income Tax

nominally bd. in the pound, is indeed for ordinary principal moneys
really bd., but for houses it is in some cases between 6d. and 7d., for
 mills and manufactoi-ies it is 7\d., and for labour it probably amounts to
 lOcZ. Gross value is thus not a single measure, but is a loose expression

including a number of measures, it may be a multitude of measures, pre-

 senting a conspicuous absence of uniformity of relation both to true value,
 and to each other. Perhaps the one positive point of community these
 measurements by " gross' " value do possess is their inordinate pressure
 on labour and the products of labour as compared with their pressure on

 the permanent sources of income. Human labour and the works of

 human labour have as their distinguishing marks waste and perishability.
 They essentially constitute the great category of things, quce ipso usu con-

 sumuntur, but it is " consumability by use " that " gross " value utterly
 ignores. Between the permanent and the perishable it distinguishes
ON COMMON MEASURE OF VALUE IN DIRECT TAXATION.                        229

nothing, and human labour in itself, and in its works, in its houses, its

mills, its manufactories, are the special victims of this ignorance.

XV. To contemplate modes of valuation such as these now employed,

as not the mere dicta of individual opinion, but as the accepted conclu-

sions of the State and the expression of its established law, would be to

despair of truth and justice in direct taxation. If, however, instead of

confining our attention to the present position of the valuation question,

we regard it in its successive changes and in relation to the progress in

the branch of science of which it is a part, reason for hope will appear.

Measures of value, like other measures, have their movement. The

history of measurement in general is in a high degree the history of

exact science, and whether the subject matter be lines or angles, forces or
values, this history presents an early state of " grossness " and disorder

that only by the slow march of intelligence developes into definiteness

and uniformity. And the history of the measurement of values in par-

ticular, low down in the scale of accuracy as it now is, yet presents an

undoubted ascent from a still lower condition. Sceptics indeed, both

without, and also, we regret to add, within the limits of this " Association

for the Advancement of Science," have doubted the possibility of a science

--of values of the science, that is to say, which forms the peculiar charge
--of this Section but the ebb of doubt has ever attended the wave^of pro-

gress, and the best antidote to such doubt, as well as the best stimulus to

further progress, is the consideration of the onward course of statistical

facts themselves. In the particular subject under discussion, the two

great parliamentary commissions of 1851-52 and of 1860, in which

many of the leading members of this Economic Section took a leading

part, evidenced the awakening of the public mind to the necessity of a

change. The Union Assessment Act of 1862 ; the Metropolis Valuation
Act of 1869 ; the Local Valuation Bills grounded on these Acts annually

introduced into Parliament ; the recent decision of the Court of Exchequer

in the appeal case of Knowles v. McAdam ; the deduction allowed in

this year's Inland Revenue Bill for depreciation of machinery, are all

incidents of a progress towards a better measurement of values ; and in

these incidents collectively considered, your Committee recognise a system

of lines of reform converging to the principle which they have attempted

in their Reports to define and illustrate. It need scarcely be added, that

the indirect results of true valuation, for example, its effect on the truth

Aof returns, are not less important than those which are direct.      false

system of valuation must of necessity encourage false returns. To

deceive or to be plundered are its only alternatives, nor is it wonderful

Athat popular casuistry often prefers the former.  true method of valua-

tion on the other hand encourages true returns ; it may not absolutely

secure them, but it secures the removal of all that can obstruct them, and

Acancels the invitation to fraud, afforded by the present law.        true

valuation alone can justify the exact and vigorous administration which

must be the characteristic of an equitable tax on income.

Report on Sunspots and Rainfall. By Charles Meldrum, F.R.S.

[A communication ordered by the Council to be printed in extenso among the

                                                                    Reports.]

     1. In 1873 and 1874 (see British Association Reports for those
years) I submitted tables of the rainfalls of various parts of the world,
and expressed the opinion that there was strong evidence of a connection
between rainfall and sunspots.

    2. Having received additional observations, I now beg to submit the

principal results obtained by comparing the rainfalls of different countries,
and the levels of some of the rivers of Central Europe with Wolf's rela-
tive sunspot numbers.

     3. Probably the best method of comparing the sunspots with the
rainfall is that of the harmonical analysis. In a paper which was com-
municated to the Royal Society in January, 1876, I applied that method
to the annual mean rainfalls of the greatest possible number of stations
scattered over the globe, and to the mean annual depths of some of the
rivers of Central Europe, and found not only that there was a rainfall
cycle of nearly the same length as the sunspot cycle, but also that the
two cycles had the same characteristics with respect to the intervals

between the epochs of minimum and maximum and maximum and mini-
mum, a circumstance which strongly pointed to a causal connection.

But, as the method is laborious, I have not yet had time to apply it to
the rainfalls of single stations, or even to the mean rainfalls of different
countries. I hope to be able to do so soon, and to communicate the
results on another occasion.

     4. In the meantime the probability or otherwise of a connection

between sunspots and rainfall may be shown by the old method of arith-

metical means.

     5. Although the mean length of 'the sunspot cycle is about eleven
years, yet, in employing the method of arithmetical means, it would be
objectionable to commence with any year whatever in a long series of
observations, and taking the greatest possible number of periods of eleven
years each, compare the annual mean rainfalls with the annual mean sun-
spots ; for by doing so the maximum and minimum years might be so
much dispersed over the common eleven-year period thus formed as to
conceal any periodic variation that might exist. It is essential to refer
the comparisons to the epochs of maximum and minimum, and this can-
not well be done by commencing with any year whatever.

     6. With a view of avoiding that objection as far as possible, and at the
same time of obtaining a simpler and more expeditious method than that
of the harmonical analysis, I make two comparisons, in one of which the
maximum years of sunspots are taken for the point of reference, and in
the other the minimum years.

     7. As the epoch of maximum sunspots occurs on an average 3" 7 years
after the epoch of minimum, and the epoch of minimum 7"4 years after
the epoch of maximum, the maximum years in the first comparison are

all placed in the sixth of thirteen terms or series of years, while in the

second comparison all the minimum years are placed in the eighth or

ninth of other thirteen terms or series. Then, with the object of dimi-
nishing the effects of so-called accidental irregularities in the rainfall, the
    ----

thirteen terms are reduced to eleven, and these, for convenience, are
called the ' mean cycle.'

                                                        I. Sunspots.

     8. Applied to Wolf's relative numbers of sunspots (latest edition),
the above method gives the following results for the years 1811-77 :

     -- --Table 1. Sunspot numbers. Maximum years in 6th line.

sa
--232 REPORT 1878.

12. It will be seen that the " mean cycle " exhibits a well-marked sun-

Nowspot variation.  if the sunspots are numerically related to the rain-

fall, an exactly similar treatment of the rainfall should give a rainfall

variation, corresponding, either directly or inversely, with the sunspot

variation.

13. In the next table the sunspot numbers for the minimum years'

1823, 1833, 1843, 1856, and 1867, are all in the eighth line, and the

places and numbers for the maximum years are marked with astei'isks.

       -- --Table II. Sunspot numbers. Minimum years in 8th line.

Years
          ON SUNSPOTS AND RAINFALL.  233

     The range of variation is about 3"7 inches.

    The epoch of maximum rainfall occurs about one year after th&
epoch of maximum sunspots.

     The spot variation has been derived from Table I.

    15. An important advantage of the above arrangement is that th&

columns of " means " enable us to compare directly the mean of the sun-
spot numbers for the maximum years with the mean rainfall for the same

      -- --Table III. Great Britain. Maximum years in 6th line.

above the average in the mean minimum year, yet it was below the

average in the previous and two following years, thus forming, on the

whole, around the minimum year, as shown in the " mean cycle," a group

of  four  or  five  years  in which  the  rainfall  was  below the  average                                  and
                                                                                                          ;

the mean rainfall for these years is scarcely affected by the positions
ON SUNSPOTS AND RAINFALL.  235

    Here we have a remarkable parallelism, both the sunspots and the
rainfall attaining their maximum and minimum in the same years, and

rising and falling together with considerable regularity.
     The mean of the mean cycle is 25*6 inches, and the mean rainfall is

257 inches.
     19. The next table gives the results of the converse arrangement for

the rainfall of Edinburgh.
--236 REPORT 1878.

     The mean rainfall for the mean cycle is 26*6 inches, and for the whole

period (1824-67) 26'8 inches.

     Owing to some heavy floods in 1844, 1855, and 1867, the rainfall for
the eleventh year of the mean cycle is somewhat above the average.

       Table VII.
ON SUNSPOTS AND BAINFALL.  237

     Considering that there are only two sunspot periods, the results may-
be regarded as favourable. The rainfall and sunspots were both above

+ --( ) or below ( ) their respective means in the same years.

     I have used Dr. Ielinek's table in preference to a more extensive one,
becanse, like Mr. Symons's table, it furnishes independent evidence.

     24. In the next two tables the rainfall of Paris is compared with the
sunspots. The series of observations at thi3 station is so long that eight

complete sunspot cycles might be taken, but, as objection has been made
to going back much farther than the time when Schawbe commenced his
observations, only four cycles are taken in one of these tables, and five

in the other.
--238 REPORT 1878.

    The rainfall decreases till the sixth year of the mean cycle, that is,
the year before that of minimum sunspots, and then increases to the

eleventh year.

    The mean of the mean cycle is 511 m.m., and the mean rainfall from
1816 to 1872 is 515 m.m.

     26. As another example of the rainfall variation at a single station on
the Continent of Europe, I will take Prague from 1832 to 1867.

 --TV. The Levels of Rivers of Central Europe compared with the Sunspots.

   28. A paper by Herr Gustav Wex, ' On the Decrease of Water in the

Wells, Streams, and Rivers,' published in 1873, contains a number of
Tables, giving the yearly mean heights (or depths) of water in the Elbe,
Rhine, Oder, Vistula, and Danube, for various periods from 1728 to

1871.

     Having been favoured with a copy of that important paper, I have
compared the annual mean levels of the rivers with the sunspots, in the
same manner as the rainfall has been compared, and the results are given

in the next five tables.

    The mean rainfall of the cycle is 33'6 inches, and for the years 1855

to 1867 it is 33-7 inches.
     45. The next table gives the resnlts obtained by the contrary arrange-

ment. From 1848 to 1860 we have the rainfalls of the Cape, Adelaide,
and Sydney ; and from 1859 to 1871 the rainfalls of the same three

stations, and of Mauritius, Brisbane, and Melbourne.

results for 1859 to 1871 :--

gives well-marked sunspot cycles, and that in all the comparisons both
the snnspots and the rainfall have been subjected to exactly the same

treatment ; and it might be added that the amonnt of dispersion is much
less than it would be in a method in which both the maximum and the
minimum years were dispersed over more than one half of the common

cycle.

     58. In order, however, to remove such a possible objection, I will, as,
far as possible, compare the rainfall with the sunspots, cycle by cycle,
from 1823 to 1867.

     It will be seen that the variations for Great Britain and the Continent
are nearly alike, and that those for America and India show a tendency
to a double oscillation.

    55. Taking now the sunspot period 1833 to 1844, we get the follow-

ing table :

    The mean for the cycle is 376 inches, and 37 - 4 inches for the years

1843 to 1857.

    The maximum rainfall occurs about one year before the year of
maximum sunspots, and the minimum rainfall in the years of minimum

sunspots at the beginning and end of the cycle.
    There is apparently a tendency to a double oscillation, the rainfall

diminishing a little from the fourth to the seventh year of the cycle, and
then increasing a little to the ninth year.

minimum and maximum rainfall.

                    --IX. Summary of Results.

65. If we knew exactly the annual rainfall for the whole globe during

the four sunspot periods 1824-67, and found that it varied as the sun's

spotted area varied, we should conclude that there was very strong

evidence of a causal connection between the two phenomena, especially
when it was considered that the comparative frequence or absence of solar

spots, faculas. and prominences indicated a variation in the sun's radiant

energy, upon which the variations in terrestrial meteorology mainly

depend. But as we do not know the total annual rainfall over the whole

sui'face of the earth, and have only approximate values of the annual

amounts of solar maculation, all that can be done is to compare the rain-

fall at the greatest possible number of stations in different parts of the

world with the available values of the sunspot areas, and see whether

there is anything approaching to a correspondence. This has been done

in the preceding pages, chiefly for the years 1824-67, and th« principal

results may be summarised as follows :

(1.) The mean rainfalls of Great Britain, the Continent of Europe,

America, and India, as represented by all the returns that have been re-

ceived, have, notwithstanding some anomalies, varied as Wolf's sunspot

numbers have varied, and the epochs of minimum and maximum rainfall

have nearly coincided with those of the sunspots.

(2.) The rainfall at five stations in the southern hemisphere for

shorter periods give similar results.

(3.) The levels of the principal rivers of Central Europe have also

varied with the sunspots, although, as in the case of the rainfall, there

are discrepancies.

     (4.) The rainfalls at individual stations, such as Edinburgh, Paris,

New Bedford, Bombay, &c, afford unmistakable evidence of a connection

between sunspots and rainfall.

     (5.) The variations in the levels of individual rivers of Central
Europe, such as the Rhine and Elbe, give similar evidence.

(6.) The results obtained by taking each sunspot cycle separately are

all favourable, with the exception of those for the cycle 1 834-43, which

are unfavourable for ten stations in America and three stations in India,

but favourable for thirty-seven stations in Europe.

    (7.) When the final results for each country are combined, by taking

means of all of them (Table XXXIIL), it is found that the rainfall and

the sunspots are below or above their respective means in the same years,

and that the epochs of maximum and minimum rainfall apparently coin-

cide with the epochs of maximum and minimum sunspots.

     (8.) The mean range of rainfall variation for the four cycles from

1824 to 1867, taking all the stations, is about 4 inches, and the annual
mean rainfall 38- 5 inches.

     (9.) There is a tendency to a double oscillation in the rainfall, a small

second maximum and minimum occurring after the principal maximum.

This is especially the case in India.

(10.) The principal maximum and minimum epochs of the rainfall do

not occur at the same time in different countries, but oscillate to the

extent of a year or two on either side of the sunspot epochs. On an

average, however, the rainfall epochs occur somewhat later than the sun-

spot epochs.

     66. The rainfall and sunspot observations being themselves probably
but rough approximations, the evidence of 'a connection between them is
necessarily qualitative rather than quantitative. But, considering how

apparently capricious an element the rainfall is, it is difficult to account

for the results which have been obtained for widely distant countries and

under all conditions of climate, except upon the supposition that they
are the manifestations of a general law. The number of rainfall returns

is no doubt small, but it is to be remembered that they are all that are

available, that they are not a selection, and that virtually they have been

obtained by haphazard. Moreover, the experience of seven years has

shown that as the number of rainfall returns increased, so did the evidence

of a connection between sunspots and rainfall.

67. The present discussion has been almost exclusively confined to the

four cycles from 1824 to 1867, because it is supposed that the sunspot
observations for those years are superior to earlier observations. But it

must be remarked that exactly similar results have been obtained for

previous cycles. The rainfall variations for the cycle 1811-23 show a
most marked coincidence with the sunspot variations, and similar rainfall

results have been obtained for still earlier cycles. Further, the variations

in the levels of the Elbe from 1728 to 1868, and in those of the Rhine from

1770 to 1835 were as favourable in the last century as they have been in

the present. The cycle 1868-78 is not yet complete, but judging from the

rainfalls in 1870-73, and from the droughts which have occurred since

1875, it is not improbable that the general results will be the same as for

Weprevious cycles.  know already that the mean rainfall at six stations

in the southern hemisphere from 1865 to 1877 is favourable.

The meteoric events of the greatest interest during the past year, of which,

as far as space will permit, the principal characters are described in this
Report, consist in part of the successive appearances of a rather unusual

number of very grand and remarkable fireballs which have been seen in
different parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and which have been
very satisfactorily recorded in those countries ; and in part also of some
new observations of meteor showers, and of some falls of aerolites, which
have added to the increasing store of knowledge of the nature and dis-
tribution of those astronomical phenomena which we possess.

    A stonefall of considerable abundance and importance took place on

the 13th of October, 1877, at Soko-Banja, N.E. of Alexinatz, the circum-

detonating meteor of unusual magnitude made its appearance in the

United States on the afternoon of November 20th, 1877, and was one of

unusual grandeur. As it was visible at Richmond and at towns of Vir-

ginia and North Carolina, where it exploded, all of them near the capital,

and was also seen by many persons in Washington itself, the inquiry

undertaken by Professor J. L. Campbell, of the Washington and Lee

University, regarding all the special characters of the great Virginia

meteor already in part successfully accomplished will, without doubt, con-

tribute some important additions to this department of our meteoric

knowledge.

   A fireball of the same description, scarcely less imposing, appeared (a

few days after the former one) in England on the evening of the 23rd of
November last, and was carefully described by a multitude of accounts of

it which were preserved, and which were communicated to Captain
Tupman. It appears to have been a member of a very well-known

meteor shower, whose shooting stars have often afforded plentiful and

pretty striking exhibitions in November, with a definite centre of

divergence in the head of Taurus. The " Taurids I.," as they have been

called, were very abundant in November, 1876, amounting to bright

showers, especially on the                                                         morning      of November                                                                                   20th in that year                                                                              but

mthey were remarkable by a nearly total cessation of the stream last year
   the month when this great fireball appeared to compensate, apparently,

for the absence of the lesser meteors of the shower. It is premature, until

future cases of a similar kind corroborate such a conclusion, to infer that

aerolitic meteors are sometimes furnished by ordinary star-showers, since

radiant points of very different and independent meteor systems are' some-

times found  to                                                          be   closely adjacent  to   each other                                                                               but the evidence thus

presented of such a connection existing between a meteor shower and an

aerolitic fireball certainly demands close attention and investigation, by
the certain determination which was made last year of an almost exact

resemblance between two such foreign visitants in the positions of their

radiant points.

The orbit of a certain comet, it may be noticed (that of 1702), coincides,

as far as the rough observations of it that were obtained will perhaps

allow us to conclude, with the date and position of this double meteor

radiant-point                                                            and  not  less  likelihood  exists                                                                                   that the comet and the two

kinds of meteor-bodies formed members together of a common system
coursing round the sun, than that the aerolitic meteor itself was only a

very large individual of the meteor shower. Captain Tupman has com-
puted, on the other hand, the orbit of a smaller fireball which he saw on
the night of the 27th of November, 1877
                                                                                                                                                                                           ;  and this meteor, he discovered,

had a nearly circular orbit, slightly inclined to the earth's, which it was
Aovertaking with a periodic time of revolution round the sun of only about
462 days.                                                                large fireball was seen in full sunlight on the forenoon of

March 25th, 1878, travelling over the North Sea from the neighbourhood
of Berwick to that of Aberdeen. Its height and real path were very well
determined, and this large fireball appears to have been directed in its

real orbit very nearly straight from the sun towards the earth. The next

large meteor seen shot from over the north of Yorkshire to the Firth of

Forth, where it disappeared at a height of 15 or 20 miles very nearly over
AEdinburgh, on the evening of May 12th, 1878.
                                                            report like thunder

heard at Galashiels, seems to have resulted from a division of the fireball,

seen at Scarborough, by a fragment falling from it some time before

the end of its course, when it must have been passing over Galashiels at a

distance of about 35 or 40 miles. It belonged to a radiant point in Virgo,

very probably identical with that of a new and rich shower of April and

May shooting stars, seen by Mr. Denning (and perhaps also, on April 18,

1841, by Professer Forshey, in America) at about 205°-10°, in 1877.

   A fireball descended with a detonation to a low height over a point

near Market Harborongh, on April 2nd, 1878. It was well observed at

two places, and its radiant-point in Ursa Major was very well determined.

A large  fireball  which  passed  slowly  over  Devonshire  on  the  7th  of June,
                                                                                        j

from the English to the Bristol Channel, probably had the same radiant

point, with one or two companion fireballs on the same evening, as the

detonating meteor (investigated by Professors Galle and Von Niessl) of

June 17th, 1873, in Austria and Bohemia. Of this fireball and of one seen

on the night of July 29th over the neighbourhood of Manchester, however,

the heights, real courses, and velocities have only been very partially

established from the observations.

    Among the chief annual meteor showers observed during the past

year, all but the April Lyrids were pretty notable displays, denoting well-

marked returns of the several special star- showers of the year. The

August display of Perseids, in the year 1877, was as bright as, or perhaps
a little brighter than the average ; but not much more so (if even quite
so bright as usual) in August, 1878, the state of the sky at some places

being, on August 10th, in both years, very fairly favourable for the

observations. The Orionids were well seen, and reached a maximum of

22 meteors per hour on    the morning           of  October  18th,   1877                          the
                                                                                                ;

meteors were bright, leaving very characteristic streaks, and radiated

very exactly from the point near v Orionis, which is the usual centre of the

shower. The Leonids were re-observed in England and in America, whei'e
two observers counted thirty of them per hour on the morning of
November 14th. The Andromedes were seen both on November 25th and

27th, about as numerous as the unconformable meteors on those nights.

The Geminids appeared in greater numbers than usual, reaching a

maximum on December 11th, 1877, which was well seen, and the

characters and radiant point of the shower were last year very well ob-

served. The meteors of January 2nd also made their appearance in a
pretty bright stream, seen in England to be very active on the morning of

that day, and affording a pretty good new determination of its radiant-
point. Among these regular returns of special showers, the display of

the Lyrids of April 19th-21st, in the year 1878, was, on the other hand,
somewhat scanty, and inferior to those of the other showers ; only a few
of its meteors being noticed, and those on the nights of the 21st and 22nd

of April, principally, when the meteor shower of the Lyrids ordinarily is

well-nigh extinguished.

     Throughout the autumn months, in the spring, and again on the ap-

proach of the August meteors, Mr. W. F. Denning recorded appearances

of meteor showers in watchful observations of the sky whenever the ab-

sence of the moon and freedom from clouds offered opportunities for their

detection. Of such showers, many were new, and presented other features

Aof especial interest.  selection of the brightest and most important

examples of these new views of meteor systems obtained by Mr. Denning

dnring the past year is included in the third Appendix, following the

above notices of the greater annual showers, with extracts from his list of

the almost innumerable shower centres of which he succeeded in tracing

and recording the existence. From the meteor lists of foreign observers,

also, Mr. Denning deduced a vast number of meteor showers, and he has
published a list of them in conjunction with that of his own observations.

In these two parallel lists the agreements are often very satisfactory and

·close. Mr. Greg has prepared a valuable abstract of them, showing the

many points in which these new results confirm and verify the results of

Aolder observations.    similar abstract by Mr. Greg of the extensive

shower-catalogue contained in the late Professor Heis' forty-three-year

summary of his meteor observations, which was published last year,

accompanies the former abstract ; and to these lists is added, in the same

part of this Report, the well-known catalogue of meteor showers deduced

by Professor Schiaparelli from Zezioli's observations of shooting- stars

at Bergamo in the years 1867-69, of which no perfect transcript has

hitherto appeared in these Reports.

     The fourth and last Appendix of the Report describes, as in former
years, the occurrences of stone-falls which have taken place, and the
results of researches on aerolites and meteoric irons which have been pub-
lished during the past year ; and it will be seen from its perusal that the
study of the nature of the substances, and of the circumstances of the falls
of aerolites, is being pursued with the same activity and success as has
oharacterised during the past year the observation of shooting-stars and

 fireballs.

     It now begins to appear extremely probable, especially from the results

of Mr. Denning's recent observations and reductions, that the highest
attainable accuracy in mapping the observed directions of the apparent
paths of shooting-stars is the real key to the solution of the problem pre-
sented by their nightly flights. Numbers of co-existing radiant-points,
which would have escaped detection by less careful observations, are thus
shown to be capable of recognition, and of being disentangled from each
other with precision. The question of the possible connection of large
fireballs, and among them of aerolites, or large stony masses, with such

showers, and accordingly, it may be, in certain cases with comets, depends

also for its solution upon accurate observations of these meteors. In all
the aspects which they present in appearance or position, whether on a

large scale of grandeur, or as the smallest scintillations, these singular

bodies are certainly attractive objects for accurate investigation and de-
scription from the profound obscurity in which at present the whole of
the history of their origin appears to be involved. The Committee has
thought it desirable, from these considerations, to offer some suggestions

to observers, taking the form of general directions for recording exactly
any particulars of the occurrences of shooting-stars, fireballs, and

aerolites, of which circumstances may enable them to furnish perfectly

definite and reliable accounts. The different heads and paragraphs of
these directions are added in a convenient series of sections at the end of

the Report.

I. Meteors doubly observed.

Among the lists of occasional observations of shooting-stars received by

the Committee during the past year, a few examples occur of simultaneous

observations by observers at distant stations of meteors which agree

together in every particular of their description, and which, on account of

the regularity of the watches kept, the few meteors noted on the same

dates, and the good accordance also of the apparent paths when allowance

is made for the observers' positions as regards length and direction of

the base-line between their stations, were undoubtedly independent

views of the same meteoric bodies, and will, therefore, afford approximate

data of the distances and positions, and of the lengths and directions of

their real paths. One additional observation of each of two meteors re-

corded in last year's Fireball List has been received, and the descriptions

of those meteors, at 10h 44m p.m., June 10th, 1876, and 10h 25m p.m.,

August 10th, 1877, already given, are here repeated for compainson with

the new descriptions of them which have since been received.

The radiant-points concluded from the recorded paths by their direct

projections are added in the last column but one of the list. But to

these positions, when the tracks nearly overlie each other, and therefore

give results very largely and doubtfully affected by the errors of observa-

tion, too much importance must not be attached in respect of the varia-

tions which they sometimes show from the independent estimates of their

probable radiant-points which were originally attached to them by the

observers. Radiant positions thus found are yet data of the first and

Agreatest interest to be extracted from such observations.    complete

discussion of the heights, velocities, and other particulars of these

meteors' real paths, and of those of a similar list of doubly observed

shooting- stars presented in last year's Report, is postponed at present,

until materials for a more general communication on the results of such

comparisons present themselves in the course of future observations.

II. Large Meteors.

Many of the desci'iptions of fireballs seen during the past year have

furnished reliable materials for determining their real courses and the

Aprobable astronomical relationships of their orbits.  condensed account

of these occurrences is given in this Appendix, as most of the following

notes were collected from very scattered sources, and are not the results

of preparation and of systematic watches, like those of the foregoing

Appendix. The two lists which are included in this Appendix contain

the final determinations of the real paths of the most brilliant and widely

observed of the past year's bolides and detonating meteors, and such

accounts of others, not so widely observed, as private and published

descriptions of them have enabled the Committee to collect.

    On June 14th, 1877, 8h 52m p.m., Paris Time. The large fireball

of this date seen in the south of France by M. Gruey at Clermont Ferrand

(Puy-de-D6me) was also observed at Bordeaux and at Angouleme with

accurate positions by the stars. The agreement of the recorded paths with

·each other and with a radiant point near 4 Bootis is very close, and this

star was culminating at the time on the south meridian. The initial

points of all the tracks begin so near it, probably by an extension to which

there is a natural tendency in observations, that the initial height of the

fireball thence obtained is without doubt much overrated, while its dura-

tion in seconds was very well determined by the independent estimations.

There appears no reason (from the greatly overrated length of path) to

accept M. Gruey's calculation that the real orbit of this fireball was a

hyperbola of very great eccentricity, as the measure of its real length of

Apath and velocity is based upon very questionable data ?                                                        loud detona-

tion followed the meteor's disappearance at Bordeaux, 55 miles from its

end point, in five minutes ; the distance which sound would travel in

that time is about 62 miles.
On October 19th, 1877, 6h 13m p.m., Ireland, and the West of

AEngland.                                       very magnificent fireball made its appearance westwards of

the English coast, over Ireland and St. George's Channel, during full

twilight, and before any stars were yet plainly visible, on the above

evening                                         and many accounts of its unusual appearance were presented in
                                             ;

the daily journals. The strength of the daylight hindered all definite

measures of its position, and a solitary description by the stars at Mon-

mouth, together with a careful sketch of its course forwarded to the Com-

mittee from an observer near Dublin by Professor Ball, of the Dunsink

Observatory, are the only available accounts among a score or two, for

determining the real direction of its course ! Its flash was like lightning at

Swansea, amid the glow in the west lingering after the departed sun.

By the few who saw the meteor itself, it is described (at Weston-super-

Mare) as a balloon of whitish light, falling slowly ; at Stoke Prior,

Wolverhampton, as a glowing poker rushing through the air ; and a

strange spectacle seems to have been presented by it (as described in the

' Times ' of October 24th) near Templemore, in the south-west part of

WeIreland. "                                    had one of the most brilliant meteors here last evening

that  I  ever                                   saw                       indeed, it was  rather  startling, as  the whole  heavens
                                                                       ;

seemed open, or rather divided. It was a quarter to six o'clock (Irish

time), and I was on the terrace when I suddenly heard a crackling noise,

or rather the intense light and noise came together. I looked up and saw

a great light. The meteor went from east to west. I did not see it fall

to earth, as it seemed to vanish away into space. It began small, then

grew alarmingly large, and gradually disappeared, although the light re-

mained visible for over seven minutes. I called M. from the piano, and

A, ran down from my room wondering what had come to pass. I went

down (100 yards off) to call K. and his family to look at the light, which

was still very bright, though not so intense as it had been, and which had

then assumed a semicircular shape, and gradually grew paler. It was

quite seven or eight minutes visible. I shall never forget the sight, it was

so grand and awful." Templemore is in the direction from Monmouth

which the meteor took, as it descended vertically, in the position there

noted near Arcturus ; and the alarming nature of the spectacle seems to

indicate that its nearest approach to the earth must have been not very

far from Templemore.

The observer (Mr. John Parker) near Dublin, also gives a singular
--Adescription of its appearance. " First indication :

illumination of all surrounding objects, casting a well defined shadow, as

in sunlight, and not such as is caused by lightning.

   The meteor appeared as a distinct well-defined silver-coloured streak,
W.S.W. of Dublin, forming a spiral curve, with a distinct head or nucleus of
white light, which after being visible for nearly two seconds, burst into frag-
ments with a loud noise [?] The spiral streak continued visible for seven

the substance of which Captain Tupman has discussed and presented in

three papers, which are contained in the first yearly volume of the newly
edited and published journal of Astronomy, ' The Observatory ' (at pp.
282, 316, and 351). The general features of the fireball, and of two

others seen on the same evening, are discussed, with a plate of several

phases of its appearance seen by Mr. Plant at Manchester, in the first

and the materials furnished for comparison, with particulars of the in-

dividual accounts, and with the final results to which their examination

led him, are presented in the remaining two of Captain Tupman's papers.

The same letter in the ' Times ' which invited these communications also

described a meteor of singular interest and brightness, seen by Captain

Tupman at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, on the night of Novem-

ber 27th, which will be the subject of the following paragraph of thi&

AAppendix.       striking statement of an observer at Queenstown, Cork

Harbour, followed in a few lines after the impression of the same letter,

that at the hour of the fireball's appearance a meteor of extreme bril-

liancy was observed travelling, in bright moonlight, across the northern

sky, showing the vast extent of country over which this large meteor,

which burst forth directly over Liverpool, was satisfactorily observed.

A fireball only slightly less conspicuous was, it appears, noticed at
                         25 m

and sufficient accounts of its course and apparent path were forwarded

to Captain Tupman from observers who were fortunate enough to witness

both meteors, to show that it was probably a member of the same meteor

Astream and diverged from the same radiant-point as the larger one.

detonating fireball of great brilliancy was also seen at Strassburg, on the

same evening, at 6 o'clock p.m.*

The position of this fireball focus, or centre of emanation of at least

one detonating or aerolitic fireball of the 23rd of last November is

sufficiently remarkable to become the source of a new series of conjectures

and researches regarding any aerolitic or detonating meteors that may in

future times be observed ; for it was discovered that in the real direction

of its flight this unusually striking fireball's radiant-point agrees in

position with that of a very notable and important star-shower diverging

from near the Pleiades and Hyades in the middle and early part of No-

vember. The star-shower thus indicated, known, since Mr. Denning's

and Mr. Corder's successful investigations of it in November, 1876, as

" Taurids I.," was found by Mr. Denning, among frequent rich displays of

its meteors in that year, to reach a conspicuous maximum on the morning

of November 20th, 1876, with a radiant-point marked with the greatest

+certainty at 62° 22°. It is exactly at this place that by a complete dis-

cussion of all the observations furnished to him, Captain Tupman found

that the great detonating meteor's radiant-point of the 23rd of November

last was situated. It is thus a very plain and obvious inference that the

shooting stars forming the body of the stream which the earth encounters

striking it from Taurus about the middle, and on a few later nights of

November, are of the same hard, compact materials, in smaller fragments,

as that of which the fireball must have been composed to produce the

loud and violent concussion of the air with which its explosion was marked

by a thunder-like report in Wales, Lancashire, and the Isle of Man.

270 eepokt-- 1878.

The " Taurids I." are apparently small aerolites ; and it may be added that

the comet of 1702, whose fragments, if they strike the earth at all, must

do so from a radiant point at about 56° + 20° on the 27th of November,
appears to be so closely associated with the new-found maximum of the

" Taui'ids I." on November 20th, that if the aerolitic character of that
meteor shower is certainly established, a fair presumption then suggests
itself that the material of the comet itself is a firm and solid substance,
and that the " Taurid " shooting stars, and even detonating fireballs which
sometimes accompany them, are but small fragments compared with
much larger stony masses which may be pictured as congregated to-
gether in the nucleus of the comet

    Besides the many scattered accounts, and the general review of their

contents given, with an engraving, by Captain Tupman, in his first Paper,
a full and varied collection of descriptions of the meteor's appearance by
different observers was published in ' Nature' (vol. xvii., pp. 94 and 113).
Particulars of these various descriptions, including some original accounts,
will be found in the list of observations of large meteors accompanying
this Appendix ; and the real height and description of its course, from 96
miles above the neighbourhood of Derby to a point 14 miles above the
Irish Channel, about 20 miles north of the Welsh coast near Llandudno, are
detailed at length in the list of such determinations (pp. 266-7) of several
large meteors during the past year which is here appended. The meteor's
apparent path was noted pretty exactly at ten, and less perfectly at five
or six other places in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, by the
stars or planets ; by estimated bearings and altitudes at some twenty-five

places, and by exact measurements of the same data at four or five. From

two observations of the latter kind by Mr. T. S. Petty, at Llandudno,
and by Captain Watson on board of the Algeria, in the Irish Channel,

very near the meteor's place of disappearance, Captain Tupman regards

the final height as having been only 14, instead of 26 miles, and the

+radiant-point at 62° 21° instead of at 63° + 15°, which were the first

deductions of its real course arrived at from the other observations.
Whatever discrepancies in the end-height and radiant-point are thus
exhibited, the adopted corrections thus finally introduced appear to be
absolutely necessary ones to satisfy some of the nearest well-observed
positions, and especially the two last-named very important observations.
Of the two explosions, or first outburst and final disruption, between
which the meteor was a most vivid bluish pear-shaped fireball, with a
long tail of red stars or sparks following it, the first took place at a height
of about 40 miles exactly over Liverpool, and in a considerable part of its
track before this point the meteor was described as resembling an ordinary
shooting-star. It left no long persistent streak, and burst at last into a
shower of highly-colom*ed fragments with an explosion, the report of
which was loudly heard in two or three minutes like artillery and thunder
on the Lancashire and Welsh coasts, and in the Isle of Man.

    The following is the calculation by Captain Tupman of the real course
of the bright fireball which he observed on the evening of November 27th,
1877 :--

      A Meteor of Short Periodic Time. By Captain G. L. Tupman.

    On the 27th of November, 1877, at 10h 26m G.M.T. precisely, the

sky being clear, I observed a fine fireball, of normal type, descend from

about 6° above tbe star Castor to a point about 5° or 6° to the left of
Sirius. The terminal point was exactly the same altitude as Sirius, and
about the same distance to the left. The meteor began as a first or

second magitude star ; and, after traversing one-fourth or one-third of its
path, it suddenly increased in brilliancy and apparent size to a fine
bluish-white fireball, and emitted a train, coloured blue, red, and green,

many degrees long. At this time the pear-shaped ball was 10 or 12
minutes in diameter. At about two-thirds of its course it began to dimi-
nish in lustre, and, turning a dull red colour, moved very slowly towards
the end, so slowly, that it seemed to come almost to a standstill. It was
then seen through a thin cloudy haze, and was about equal to Sirius in
lustre. I counted 22 seconds duration, making a mental allowance for
the time that had elapsed before I commenced to count ; but immediately

afterwards, by imagining the course to be described again, I thought the
duration was 15 or 16 seconds. It could not have been less than 15, and

may have been 20 seconds. The path was gently curved towards Orion.
The place of observation was half a mile Bast of the Royal Observatory,

Greenwich.

Tbe meteor was also seen by Mr. Henry Corder, at Writtle, near

Chelmsford, who thus describes it :

  --Nov. 27, 10h 25m At the commencement it was of the 3rd or 4th

magnitude, rapidly increasing to first magnitude, of deep red colour and

when produced the path coincided with 5 Monocerotis. Mr. Corder sup-

posed that the meteor ended at the extinction of the bright light, all
further view being cut off by the clouds. The duration was not noted,
as he endeavoured to call the attention of a friend ; but he was struck by

--the great length of time it remained visible estimated at about 5 or 6

seconds.

     The real ending was seen by Mrs. Ursula Ware, at Clifton Down,

Bristol, at an altitude equal to that of Sirius, and about 1° to the left of

the vertical of Procyon [by a diagram]. It moved very little during the
3 seconds it was visible. Time 10h 40m.

    Now assuming, as usual, the meteor to have been moving with the
-- Vvelocity due to a sensibly parabolic orbit that is to say, 19 - 1 X
                                                                                       2,

the aberration of the radiant would have been 44° 35', and the relative

velocity 16 - 9 miles per second. The meteor then would have traversed

the 78 miles of its visible path in about 4^ seconds of time, or the 50

miles of it seen by Mr. Corder in less than 3 seconds. Altering the

position of the radiant, even as much as 10° in the direction of maximum

effect, i.e., away from the apex of the earth's motion, produces no sen-
sible effect upon this " parabolic " duration.

    The actual duration was certainly not less than 15 seconds ; it may

have been 20 seconds (I should say it was 17 seconds, for I frequently

test my habit of counting seconds, and generally find it about 5 per cent,

too slow.) It is impossible that I can have been many seconds in error
in counting 15 or 20. Mr. Corder was struck by the long duration. He

made no attempt to count it, as he tried to call the attention of a friend.

His rough estimate of 5 or 6 seconds refers to about two-thirds of the

visible path.

     Taking 15 seconds as the real duration, the relative velocity is only
5£ miles per second, corresponding to an orbital velocity for the meteor

of 20'4 miles per second. Since the radius vector is common to both

orbits, we have the relation

                            V1V = «{v1=-V=(2-p)}

Vwhere V,, are the orbital velocities of the earth and the meteor re-

spectively, a the mean distance of the meteor's orbit, that of the earth
being 1, and p the common radius vector.

    I will now suppose that the actual duration was only one-half of that

taken before, that is only 7^ seconds. As the radiant point is determined
with a degree of accuracy that will not allow it to be shifted many degrees
farther away from the apex, the true orbital velocity of the meteor, on

     It is not worth while to consider the case of the duration having

possibly been much greater than 15 seconds ; for had it been so great

as 30 seconds, the elements of the orbit would be sensibly the same as

for a duration of 15 seconds.

It is remarkable that the elements of the orbit of this meteor, with the

exception of the inclination (i), are determined with a degree of accuracy

equal to those of a well-observed comet. The node is, of course, given,

by the mere record of time, within  3"              the perihelion distance is accurate
                                                 :

to the fourth place of decimals : the anomaly ((j>) and the longitude of

the perihelion are within a few minutes, while the mean distance and

eccentricity must be very approximate. Such favourable conditions,

however, as the present will rarely happen.

    Many observers have recognised a radiant point of shooting stars very

near to that of this fireball, and about the same date [see Mr. Greg's

comparative list, in ' B. A. Report,' 1874] ; but there are as yet no records
of the apparent velocity of the meteors. If the radiant be persistent and

the apparent velocity of the meteors be slow, there must exist a meteoric

ring of nearly circular form occupying the position in space defined by

the elements given above.

    So far as I am aware, the assumption of a parabolic orbit has satis-

fied, within probable limits of error, all previous observations of this

character. Hyperbolic orbits for fireballs have been deduced, but only on

the assumption that the observed durations were accurate. Experience

proves that the most reliable observers cannot avoid errors of 10 or even

20 per cent., and that in favourable cases of long duration.
     The orbit deduced above for the fireball of 1877, Nov. 27, is inde-

pendent of any reasonable error in estimating the duration. It is suffi-

cient for the establishment of a short periodic time (such as 500 days)

that the meteor " moved slowly " from a fairly well-determined radiant

point, distant about 90° from the point in the heavens towards which the

earth's motion was directed.

On the Perseids I. 1876, August 9, 10, 11. By Captain G. L. Tupman.

On the three evenings above mentioned, while residing at St. Moritz,

in the Engadine, I set myself the task of determining the position of the

Perseus radiant as accurately as possible. I watched the immediate

neighbourhood of the radiant, and only took account of those paths

which from falling favourably among stars could be mapped with great

accuracy. The number of such paths obtained was of course very limited,

but they are more valuable for the purpose than a large number of

roughly recorded paths. I made use of Mr. Proctor's ' New Star Atlas,'

first edition. It is not to be supposed that the determination of the exact

--point of beginning and ending of each track was attempted that would

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEOBS.                               275

110 miles north from Newcastle-on-Tyne, and 75 miles in a direct line

from Dunbar, a first outburst of sparks and scintillations (seen at Cal-

lander) seems to have taken place, agreeing nearly in its altitude (16°)

with the apparent altitude of" 12° or 15° at which it first attracted

observers' attention by its unwonted size and luminosity, at Newcastle.

It is in the last 60 miles of its path from this point that durations of its

flight varying from one-and-a-half to two seconds were noted at Newcastle

and at Callander ; while an observer, apparently "of its whole path, near

Stranraer, gives four seconds for its duration. Either of these estimates

--gives nearly 35 miles per second as its real speed of flight. The radiant

point was at 332° 20° (R.A. and Decl.), and the speed of a meteor from

this radiant point with a parabolic orbit is 33 miles per second ; a velocity

which the observations therefore substantiate very nearly. Measurements

of the meteor's course at two places near Callander, and at two places

near Newcastle-on-Tyne, as pointed out by observers there, were obtained

by Professor Herschel, and corroborated each other at those places within

a few degrees. In answer to a request for similar measurements addressed

to observers of the fireball in the ' Scotsman ' of May 1st, by Professor

Herschel, a very exact description of its apparent path by carefully

observed positions of the line of light, or cloud-streak left upon its track,

at Coupar Angus, 15 miles N.W. from Dundee, was sent to the Committee

by the head railway porter of that station, Mr. John Robertson. And good

accounts of its course at Wigton and Hawick, in the south-west part of

Scotland, and at Darlington, as a more distant point of observation in

England, were also recorded, of which the collected statements carefully

compared together, combine to fix with considerable certainty, and with a

degree of accuracy which only admits of very small corrections, the

height and situation, and the real direction and velocity, of the meteor's

Acourse, as above described.  peal of distant thunder, heard at about the

time of the meteor's appearance at Dunbar, is perhaps attributable to it,

though the distance of the nearest point of the meteor's track was there

70 miles, which sound traverses in five minutes and a half ; and throughout

its course it was indeed between 50 and 70 miles distant from all the

easternmost points of the coast, and from the principal towns of the east

part of Scotland, where it was very widely noted and observed.

The real direction of this fireball's motion round the sun and arrival

upon the earth is remarkable, as but little below the ecliptic (about 9°),

very nearly at the place which would belong to the path of a body

projected with parabolic velocity directly from the sun itself. In its real

orbit it approached the earth from a point of the heavens within 10° of

the sun's place (about 3° behind it in longitude, and 9° south of it in

latitude), which was in the ecliptic at longitude 4^°. The following table

gives the elements of its orbit, supposing it to have been parabolic : and

the conclusion arrived at from the observations is that the perihelion

distance, or the least distance of the meteor in its orbit from the sun's

centre during its closest approach to and passage round the sun, was

about ^th (0 - 022) of the earth's distance from the sun, or about four of

the sun's radii distant from its surface as it neared it, and made the rapid

circuit of its sharply returning orbit round it

was likened at Ochtertyre, as the meteor descended a short distance in

the N.E., to the "train of smoke left by a fast passenger train passing

along." At Arbroath several observers noted it "as an enormous ball of

fire passing rapidly before them. At length it exploded with magnificent

effect, the fragments, as it were, remaining semi-enveloped in smoke for a
few seconds." Though appearing (as at all these places) in bright sun-

shine it was yet seen by many there, and one observer at Arbroath, who

only saw it burst, was yet, like others who noted its startling apparition

at such an hour so struck by its descent in broad daylight as to be some-

what alarmed. The streak was long and straight at first, about ^° wide,

without any condensations (at Coupar Angus) for about two minutes, and

Aonly curled up into separate wreaths as it slowly disappeared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 light-

upon a single plane perspective chart of the sky for the observer's

excellent accordance with each other, although presenting an enormous

parallax, or displacement of the apparent positions of the end point of the

meteor's path in the heavens at the two stations. This angle between

the two observers' lines of sight of the meteor's point of disappearance is

just 9CP, or half of the visible span of the heavens, proceeding from a

distance between the two observers' stations of only 35 miles. The

meteor vanished accordingly at a height of only 14 miles above a point of

the earth's surface, about three miles west of Coventry. The observations

suffice also to determine completely the length and real position of the

whole of the meteor's visible path, or line of flight, before reaching this

Apoint of explosion and of final disappearance.       complete view of the

track was seen and mapped at Birmingham, extending to a length of 17°,

which was traversed by the fireball in five or six seconds, so slowly, that it

must certainly have been seen very much foreshortened, and have first

come into view there very near its radiant point. Only the terminal

part of the flight was observed at Leicester, but its direction prolonged

backwards meets that of the Birmingham apparent path similarly pro-

duced, about 3° before the point of first appearance there, at a common

+radiant point of the two apparent courses in R.A. 177°, decl. 46°, near

X Ursse majoris. In April, 1872, several remarkably bright meteors were
seen proceeding from radiant points in Ursa major (see these Reports,

Vol. for 1872, pp. 104, 11G), and the peculiar brightness of meteors

belonging to a group of April showers with radiant points in that con-

stellation was noticed by Mr. J. E. Clark (' Nature/ May 2nd, 1872) ;

one of them was doubly observed at York, and at Hawkhurst on the

night of the 19th of April, 1872, and its radiant point from the combined

projection of the recorded paths was like that of the present fireball,

                                                      (at 155° 47°),

April ' Ursids ' in Mr. Greg's general list of 1876 (Nos. 21 or 46,

45, and 56), and that to which attention was drawn by Mr. Clark, in his

letter in ' Nature,' above noticed, as producing meteors of peculiar bright-

ness. It is, however, the first of them, and especially Heis' radiant M7,

+April 1-15, at 180° 49°, included in it, which agrees most nearly with

the real direction of the present fireball's course.

With the real radiant point and point of disappearance of the fireball

as thus established, and with its apparent place of commencement as seen

at Birmingham, the beginning of its visible path is found to be at a
height of 80 miles over the town of Beckingham, near Market Har-

borough. The length of its real course was 75 miles, descending steeply
from an altitude of 58°, 4° N. of.E., which was the direction of its
radiant point ; its time of flight was reckoned at Birmingham as about five

or six seconds, giving, with the observed length of its course, a velocity of

about 13^ miles per second as the fireball's real speed of flight. This is

exactly the theoretical speed which corresponds, with the observed radiant
point, to a parabolic form of the fireball's real orbit round the sun ; this

concluding result of the combined projections gives fresh assurance to the

supposition that the fireball was really an unusually splendid and par-

ticularly brilliant member of an ordinary meteor shower.
    At Birmingham the meteor's light was like that of the full moon

overhead, attracting the observer's attention to its falling globe of bluish

flame, and it burst into red fragments at disappearance. At a place not
named (but apparently near Nottingham or Leicester), in the ' Times ' of

April 4th, 1878, where a rather more distant view of its appearance

seems to have been obtained (and where the meteor is also said to have
descended from the direction of Ursa major), the nncleus or head is said

to have been pear-shaped ending in a long tail of light ; three or fonr
times as bright as Jupiter, and bright white, changing to pale red as it

approached the horizon. It moved slowly, and halted apparently for a
moment in its course as it passed between Sirius and Orion's belt.

    At Leicester, towards the close of its course, the width of the fireball's
disc was about half the moon's diameter, and it was so radiant as to cast
shadows like the moon. It left no streak, but it had a short tail, and in

colour it seemed yellow or orange. Three minutes after its disappear-
ance [the time taken by sound to travel about 36 miles] a rumbling
sound like distant thunder was heard proceeding from its direction.
The motion of the nucleus in the last part of its flight seemed to be

slightly zigzag.

     The distance of the observed end point of the meteor's course from
Leicester is 31 miles ; and a point 10 or 12 miles before the end point,
along the meteor's course, is 36 miles from Leicester, so that sounds pro-
duced by the explosion, and by resistance to the motion of the fireball in
the last ten or twenty miles of its course, appear to have been those heard
at Leicester, like the rumbling sound of distant thunder. At Birming-

ham no sound of the explosion was perceived, although the distance of

the end point of the meteor's flight was only twenty miles from the
observer there ; but the circumstance that the track was directed

nearly towards him, may have been less favourable than its flank

presentation towards Leicester for conveying to that distance the rumbling
sound of its passage through the air ; and as it does not seem to have

been a loud sound at Leicester, it may also be owing to its slightness that
the report of a terminal explosion, which may really have taken place

at the end of the meteor's course, was not noticed by the Birmingham

observer.

on the real path of the meteor, in the ' Natural History Journal of Societies

tions of it in England of which he had received information. One of

the best of these was by Mr. W. T. Jackson, at York, who, with a party of

friends sitting in a gaslit room, saw the meteor descending, in a north-

west direction, through window panes, with a direction of fall towards
the earth, which was absolutely vertical. There was still much light in
the sky, and stars were only dimly visible, but Capella was observed near
the meteor's course, about 9° or 10° on its left, as was accurately ascer-
tained by measurement. Rough sketches of the stars, showing the
meteor's track among them, were also furnished to Mr. Clark by observers

from Scarborough) also confirming the same position of its apparent path

at the place where the fireball in its downward course reached tbis point

of its descent. Combining the description with that of a corresponding

point noted at York of the meteor's downward path, the real height

and locality of the fireball, when its apparent altitude at York was a little

above that of Capella, is found to have been just 50 miles over the little

chain of the Northumbrian lakes lying in the north part of the valley of

Athe Tyne between Haydon Bridge and Haltwhistle.                                                                            projection on the

map of the meteor's onward line of flight from this point (by a straight

line drawn through it from York towards the point of the meteor's

vertical descent, horizonwards, 36° west from north) passed (north-

westwards by north) through Hawick, and nearly over Selkirk, Gala-

shiels, and Peebles to Linlithgow, about 15 miles west of Edinburgh, on

the Firth of Forth. In its last part the track follows the direction of the

valley from Galashiels to Edinburgh, leaving Galashiels itself six or seven

miles, and the rest of the valley as far as Edinburgh ten or twelve miles on

its right. An observer on the Edinburgh road one mile north of Gala-

shiels " saw a very large and brilliant meteor pass along the valley to the

north-north-west. The head was large and round, like a ball of electri-

city, and the tail long and tapered, as brilliant as the head. It was in

view for five or six seconds, and seemed at the end to melt into nothing.

Two minutes after its disappearance [a time taken by sound to travel

twenty-five miles], I and others heard one loud deep peal, as of thunder,

and a quarter of an hour later sheet lightning began to flash, and con-

--tinued to do so at intervals for a considerable length of time." (J.S.

the ' Scotsman,' May 10th, 1878.)

The presumptive course of the meteor arrived at by Mr. Clark, from

a projection of all the English observations, was from between 75 and 80

miles above Northallerton, in Yorkshire, to about 22 miles over a point

five miles west of Hawick, a flight of 108 miles in about nine seconds,

descending at an angle of about 38° to the horizon. But in this pro-

jection the only Scottish observation used (by Mr. D. R. Stewart, in

Edinburgh, ' Nature,' May 23rd, 1878) was employed for the commence-

ment only, the description of the end point (see a letter by Mr. Clark in

'Nature,' of June 6th) being a little ambiguous, while it appears to indi-

cate that the real end point of the meteor was actually far north of

Hawick, and perhaps even, according to Mr. Stewart's description, a little

Anorth of Edinburgh.  letter received by Mr. Clark from Mr. D. R.

Stewart, soon afterwards, confirms the latter supposition, and describes

again the apparent place in the sky of the meteor's point of disappear-

ance near Edinburgh, almost exactly as it was before noted in ' Nature,'

but more clearly and distinctly. From his point of view at Kirknewton,

Edinburgh, the meteor began at an altitude of about 50° above the

S.S.E. horizon, some 30° east of the moon [then 5° west of the meridian,

alt. 31°, at Edinburgh], and passing somewhat west of the zenith reached

a position, when it burst and disappeared, about 30° or 40° N.W. by N.

from the zenith point of his position. Another observer in Edinburgh,

who saw the meteor's flight from a window facing south, was so im-

pressed with its apparent descent at last towards the direction of Fettes

about 20° above the horizon, S.S.E., and went up N.N.W., nearly right

--overhead." (' Observer,' the ' Scotsman,' May 16th.) The above pro-

jection of the meteor's path, derived from the York account, passes mid-

way between  Edinburgh  and    Bathgate                                                                                                             and  as the  note of   its course at

Bathgate contains no statement if the meteor's point of disappearance,

when nearly overhead, was on the east or west side of the zenith point,

the end point cannot be assigned more exactly from these descriptions

than at a height of about 20 miles above the Firth of Forth near Linlith-

gow, to which point, lying W.N.W. from Edinburgh and N.N.E. from

Bathgate, the track would pass about 20° west and east respectively of

the zenith points of those two places.

may nevertheless be inferred, with considerable probability, from the com-

bined descriptions. When first seen in the S.S.E., at Edinburgh, its

altitude was not much greater than that of the moon (31°), and it began

at an altitude of 20° only, according to the account at Bathgate. Recol-

lecting that apparent altitudes are always much over-estimated by the

unassisted eye, and that the initial point as seen at Edinburgh must have

been above the meteor's radiant point at least some few degrees, it seems

scarcely possible to assign a much higher altitude than about 20° for the

radiant point, or a much steeper slope of the meteor's path than this

towards the earth's surface. This is also the slope of a line of flight

from 50 miles above the Tyne valley to 20 miles above Linlithgow, where

two points   of the real path  were                                                                                                          found to    lie  approximately                                                                                                                             and it

passes 36 miles from Galashiels, a distance which requires 3 minutes

(instead of two minutes, which is said to have elapsed) for sound to

traverse it. If a lower height of about 15 miles near Linlithgow is

adopted for the end point (which seems very probable), the slope of the

resulting  real path is then 22°                                                                                                             in the first case the height  which the real

last case 78 miles, and the distance of the meteor's track from Galashiels

is 34 miles in the latter case, instead of 36, as in the former one. The

heights of 72 and 78 miles over Northallerton agree very well with the

height of 75 or 80 miles over the same place at which Mr. Clark esti-

mated, from a collective projection of all the English observations, that

the meteor began its flight ; but by the removal of the end point from a

place near Hawick to one at about the same vertical height near Edin-

burgh, the slope of path is diminished from 38°, as deduced from the

English observations, to 20° or 22° when the views of the fireball ob-

tained about Edinburgh and in some other parts of Scotland are included.

The observers' positions at Stonykirk (near Stranraer) in Wigtonshire,

and at Preston, were, of all the places where it was observed, the most

favourable, by the flank views which its descending path there presented

for determining the radiant-point ; but the apparent slope at those places

was not noted, and at Stonykirk only one datum of the meteor's appa-

rent position was recorded, that the splendid sight of its passage in the

heavens was in the direction of New Galloway, which, when prolonged far

enough from Stonykirk, coincides with the position of the meteor over

Galashiels.

mine with an amount of probable error, which would only be very small

and insignificant, the real eccentricity of its orbit round the sun.

The whole length of the meteor's path from over Northallerton to the

Firth of Forth was 155 miles, but only the last 100 miles of this track

(from about over Alston at the junction of the counties of Durham,

Northumberland, and Westmoreland) was visible at York. The duration

of this part of its flight was six seconds, measured independently by

several observers' recollections of it ; and its light was first noticed about

three seconds before the meteor itself was seen, which agrees with the

first third part of the length of its path in which the meteor was un-

observed. Most of the observers give five or six seconds as the time of

flight in the part of the meteor's path to which their view of it extended
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

and a duration of nine or ten seconds for the whole path of 155 miles is

thus probably not far from the real time of passage of the meteor along

this length of course. The velocity of the fireball's motion on this com-

putation was about 16^ miles per second, while the velocity of a body from
the same radiant point, moving in a parabolic orbit, is 15 miles per

second. This result conducts us, therefore, to a fairly probable conclusion

that the meteor's real orbit was not far from being one of a parabolic

form.

The head of the meteor was round, ending in a tail of moderate length,

consisting of sparks, which at a distance seemed red, but among which

some bright fragments of other colours were also visible to observers

nearest to its track : one of whom described its nucleus as double, and

another as ending behind in a long tail as brilliant as itself. Just before

its disappearance a fragment, or body of red sparks of considerable size,

seems to have detached itself from the head, and it is not impossible that

the explosion heard at Galashiels may have been caused by this dis-

ruption, of which no sounds are nevertheless recorded to have reached

Edinburgh or other places closer to the point of the meteor's final dis-
appearance. Though flashes of distant or " sheet lightning " were seen at

Galashiels, and continued for some time (unaccompanied it would seem by

thunder), about a quarter of an hour after the occurrence of the fireball,

yet the sky seems to have been pretty clear at Galashiels at the time of

the meteor's passage, and the later occurrence of flashes of distant

lightning there appears to offer no sufficient explanation of the " one
deep peal of thunder " which the observer of its transit there relates that
he heard two minutes after the fireball's disappearance. If the illuminating

power of the nucleus was very great, the strength of the light which it

cast is not expressly noticed by any of the writers who described it, but
it may be presumed that near Edinburgh, where its apparent diameter was

about one-sixth of that of the moon, its light must have been sufficient to
cast observers' shadows on the ground. At York its apparent brilliancy
was described as almost equal to that of the planet Venus. The nucleus

emitted no sparks, but split into two at the end, one part about ^° in

advance of the other when they both disappeared, apparently, behind a

thin cloud that stretched above some trees near the N.W. horizon.

aboat 45° or 50° E. of S. (R. A. about 250° or 255°) from which it was

directed. Its very slow and long protracted flight, and the form and

colonr of its nucleus, resembled those of the later meteor, and its

observed course, presumably horizontal, appears pretty certainly to have

been directed from the same radiant-point. It did not emit sparks nor

oscillate in its progress as the later and larger meteor seemed to do.

Captain Cunninghame, at Batbwick, also saw both meteors, the second

larger than the first, but resembling it otherwise in the characters of its

appearance. Mr. G. H. Holmes describes the first as singularly splendid

even in the nearly full daylight which prevailed. It was pale green, like

a globe of liquid fire sailing through the sky (Bristol newspaper accounts,

communicated by Mr. Denning).
     The next fireball, at 9h 53m p.m. was very widely noted in the south

of England. Mr. Denning's view of it at Bristol, however, supplies the

only precise data upon which calculations of its real path can be founded.

Observers at four places in Kent, and in the neighbourhood of London,

assign various heights at which it passed almost horizontally below, while

at Bristol it passed 6° above, the moon. At Silverton, near Exeter, it shot

towards Ursa Major (a little west of the zenith), and disappeared a little

beyond that constellation, and in Jersey it was seen to commence about

30° from the zenith, in the north, and fall towards the horizon. A common

plane perspective projection of all these apparent paths on a single map of

the sky at the time of the meteor's appearance shows that its path was

very little inclined to the earth's surface, and suffices to fix its real place

and altitude with fairly satisfactory exactness.

     The fireball began its course at a height of about 65 miles over a point

in the English Channel, near the Channel Islands, about 20 miles W.N.W.

from Guernsey, passed nearly over Start Point and the main land to

Bideford Bay, descending gradually to a height of about 37 miles over a

point in the Bristol Channel, 12 or 15 miles E.N.E. of Lundy Island,

where it disappeared. The length of this course is about 160 miles, de-

scending with a slope or inclination to the earth's surface of about 9° or

10° from the direction of about 23° E. of S. The radiant point was at

--R.A. 247° decl. 25°, within three or four degrees. From a description

of the duration of the flight at Hawkhurst, where it was well observed,

it may be reckoned not to have exceeded eight or nine seconds, although

durations varying from three or four to twenty or thirty seconds are else-

where assigned to the time occupied in its long course, with its slow

majestic speed. The real velocity of its motion given by this estimation

is about 19 miles  per second                                                             while  that  of  a  meteoric body  revolving
                                                                                       ;

round the sun in a parabolic orbit, and having the same radiant point,

would be 20 miles per second. The meteor did not burst, but threw off

some sparks, and had a short waving tail, with a slightly oscillating

motion, or flickering changes of brightness as it sailed along. It disappeared

suddenly, without leaving any streak, or producing an audible explosion.

Its radiant point closely resembles in position that of the great detonating

or aerolitic meteor of June 17th, 1873 (see these Reports, Vol. for 1878,

p. 145), seen in Austria and Bohemia, which was found, by Dr. Galle and
Prof, von Niessl, to be at R.A. 248°, decl. -20°; and it is, like that of

several large meteors which have occasionally been noted in June and

July, in the neighbourhood of the ecliptic, and of the bright star Antares
(a Scorpii, at 245°-5--26°"0).

The adopted radiant point of this fireball, at 247°-- 25°, is on the back-
                OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.                                    311

ward prolongation of the apparent track observed by Mr. Denning, about

nine or ten degrees above the horizon, due S.S.E. The linear pro-

longation of the Bristol track is directed from due S.E. to due N.W. with

a slope of 28°. The apparent paths in Kent, and near London, noted as
passing " horizontally " underneath the moon (then due W.S.W., alt. 22°)

at variously recorded altitudes from 12° to 20°, since they present a point

of convergence above the horizon with the Bristol track, are thus far

inadmissible. But, assuming, as is probable, that the apparent path observed

by Mr. Denning is exceedingly trustworthy, the least possible correction

which the Kentish tracks require is a slight inclination earthwards, near

the moon, sufficient to depress their point of convergence with the Bristol

path to the horizon, and to the same apparent earth-point, due N.W.

for all those apparent paths, as that of the meteor's course at Bristol.

With this slight emendation of those which were observed in the south-

eastern part of England, the real course of the fireball would be parallel

to the earth's surface, 40 or 50 miles above it, from S.E. to N.W. But

the observation at Prees, about 15 miles north of Shrewsbury, where the

meteor must have travelled at an altitude of about 15° from S. to

S.W., that there it " appeared first in the south, moving horizontally

westwards," is less easy to reconcile than the Kentish observations with a

truly horizontal flight of the fireball from a radiant point at the S.E. to a

point of convergence at the N.W. point of the horizon, and shows very

clearly that the real position of the radiant point on the apparent line of

flight observed at Bristol was not at or close to its intersection prolonged

backwards with  the  horizon,  due  S.E but                  at  some point upon it  at  an

appreciable altitude above the horizon, more nearly south. The above

adopted real path has at its commencement, as seen from Prees, near

Shrewsbury, a slight upward slope of barely 10° at starting in the south,

beginning there at an altitude of 14°, and just reaching its greatest
altitude of 17°, 35° westwards from this point in the S.W. by S. At
Hawkhurst, Greenwich, and other neighbouring places in the S.E. of
England, it began at alt. 17°, also the highest possible altitude of its

course there, and passed 7° below the moon (at an altitude of 15° W.S.W.),

descending there with a slope of about 7° from horizontal towards an

earth-point 40° N. from W. and disappearing at an altitude of 8° or 9°,

just one point N. of west. While this course almost exactly represents

the observed altitudes in Kent, with the exception of that of commencement

(which measured by memory in the open sky was uncertain) at Hawk-

hurst, it begins, just as the Shrewsbury apparent path ends, horizontally,
and at the points where the apparent course was described as " horizontal "
in Kent and near Shrewsbury the real direction was descending with a

slope of 7° at the first, and ascending with a slope of 10° from horizontal

at the last of those points of view. No fairer distribution of the scarcely

sensible errors of description which present themselves in the two accounts

can probably be made, and the very good adjustment to each other, of
which they actually admit, shows that the radiant point above adopted
must be very nearly the true one, and that the track of the fireball as
above derived from those descriptions, represents, in all probability, very

closely the height, direction and position of the fireball's real flight above

the earth.

    Even in Kent amidst the rays of the moon and of twilight, the meteor's

light was stronger than, and cast a distinct shadow like that of the moon.

about one-third of the moon's diameter ; at Silverton, near Exeter, its head

had an apparent width of about one-half, and at Versailles, and in Aisne,

France, where the fireball was also seen, its apparent width was about

one-sixth of the diameter of the full moon.

     1878, July 29th, 9 h ObTM (or ? 9h 31 m ) p.m.--Large fireball, near

Manchester and Lancaster. Good observations of this meteor's course

were fortunately obtained by Mr. R. P. Greg at Styall, 11 or 12 miles

south of Manchester, and by Mf. Thomas Kay at MiddletoD, about 5

miles nearly due north from Manchester. At the latter place the momen-

tary track of fire which the meteor left on its whole course enabled

Mr. Kay to fix its line of flight very accurately from an initial point in

Lyra to a terminal one in Canes Venatici, just grazing the star rj Ursse

Majoris in its path. At Styall, 16 or 17 miles south from Middleton, the

meteor's course was directed from the head of Draco, and Lyra, and its

terminal part passed through the middle of the square (a, /3, y, o) of
Ursa Major, and ended immediately beyond it. These two observations

fix the end-point of the meteor's course very exactly, at about 20 miles

high above a point near the mouth of the river Ribble, between Preston

and Blackpool. Its apparent descent to this point, northwestwards, was

almost exactly vertical to both of the Manchester observers. The remaining

descriptions of its apparent course concur to show that the real direction

of its descent was, in fact, almost truly vertical, but at the same with an

inclination, from the south-east, of somewhere about 20° from per-

pendicular. Thus at Whitehaven and at Lancaster, both nearly north

from its end-point, its nearly vertical descent in the S.S.E. and S.S.W.

was from the north-east, and from about 15° east of the zenith, re-

spectively, at those places. At Bristol, 150 miles south from its end-

point, it fell in the haze of the north horizon almost vertically from the

region of Cassiopeia, which is (if the meteor really shot from the direction

of Cassiopeia) from about 35° east of the zenith. The point of commence-

ment of the Middleton track is itself almost exactly in the zenith of that

place, and with the meteor's long apparent course there of over 50°, a

less distance than 10° or 20° at starting, from its radiant point, can scarcely

radiant points in Cygnus at the end of July this brilliant fireball's rapidly

descending path was really to be ascribed it is scarcely possible now to

ward prolongation of the observed path at Middleton passes, in fact, on

each side of this point, nearly parallel to the stars 8, e Cygni (in the

swan's  right  and left  wings)                                   and it                 appears  uncertain  nearer to which

of these two wing-stars of the constellation the fireball's apparent radiant

point may not impossibly be supposed to have been situated a little more

shooting-stars seen by Mr. Denning on the last two or three nights of

+284° 44°. But these two places are only 10° and 6°, respectively, S.S.E.

and S. by E. from the zenith, and this agrees imperfectly with some of

the descriptions of the meteor's obliquely descending course. Never-

theless, it may very fairly be conjectured that this exceedingly brilliant

fireball was in reality one of a very closely adjacent group or system

of ordinary shooting-stars to that observed by Mr. Denning.

    With this observed radiant point the beginning of the meteor's course

at Middleton was 82 miles above a point about 8 miles west from Man-

chester its length, to the point of disappearance is 70 miles, and its

duration as estimated by the length of time occupied by the flashes and

illumination until the meteor disappeared, was a second and a half, or

between two and three seconds, as noted independently by Mr. Greg and

Mr. Kay. Some luminous portion of its path was, however, probably

traversed by the meteor before the first flash which drew their attention

to its descent ; and for the whole length of the course upon which the

light-track was traceable which marked its path, a time of flight of about
three seconds may fairly be assumed from these descriptions to be rather

a somewhat insufficient, than in any degree an over-estimated or

exaggerated duration.* The real velocity of the fireball which it gives,

is  25  miles  per  second                                  while that  of  a  meteoric body moving with  the

    A nearer approach to the theoretical meteor speed could scarcely be

expected when the unforeseen and momentary character of the observa-

tions is considered, from which by the united evidence of all the

particulars of the descriptions the meteor-speed is obliged to be finally

determined.*

    The meteor was a very large and vivid one, its light making the

smallest objects visible, at Manchester, and its luminous disc having an

apparent diameter there of quite one-half that of the moon. It presented

two flashes, one previous expansion occurring, before that of its last

outburst, which Mr. Greg regarded as much more brilliant, and as having

shone from the meteor somewhat before it can have reached the middle

point of the above vivid portion of its flight, at a height accordingly of not

    * From Mr. T. Ellison at Colwyn Bay, and Mr. J. E. Walker at Lowcswater,
Cockermouth, Mr. Greg and Mr. Clark (vide ' Natural History Journal ' for September,
1878) received descriptions of the meteor which show that its end point may have
been as far west as 5 or 10 miles off the coast, between Blackpool and Fleetwood, at
a height of some 30 miles over the mouth of Morecambe Bay, instead of 20 miles
over the Ribble mouth near Preston. The meteor then ended its course at an
apparent altitude of 30° or 32°, as seen at both Conway and Loweswater, a little
east of their north and south .meridians. The descriptions at those places answer
very well to this position, although the recorded altitude (55° or 60°) at Loweswater

--perhaps refers to the first and brightest portion of the flight, or may have been

overrated, as is usual in eye-estimations. While the direction at Conway is drawn
as descending a little obliquely from east towards north, which agrees with the
general impression furnished by the other observations, the statement that its course
at Loweswater was descending from S. towards S.E., with a slope of 40° from
horizontal, or from considerably west of the zenith there, cannot be reconciled with

the remaining descriptions, nor even, apparently, with one of the recorded state-
ments of its apparent motion at Whitehaven, that "the position of the meteor
as seen from that town was about due south, and its course about [? from] north-
east." Mr. Walker only saw the end of the meteor's flight askance : but its light-
streak of 10° remaining visible for a minute would not allow the discrepancy of his

description to be thus explained. From such conflicting data it can only be pro-
visionally concluded that the meteor's radiant-point was near the zenith, and that
along the line given by the observers' notes of it near Manchester by the stars (Mr.
Greg's and Mr. Kay's), it was probably less rather than more than 20° eastward
from the zenith.

Iessthan50or 60 miles above the earth's surface, andata distance from Man-

chester of not less than 60 miles. The end point of its flight was about

30 miles distant from Manchester. An observer there (' V. R. ' 'Man-

chester Courier,' August 5th, 1878), describes its light during this last

most effulgent part of its course as " equal to the electric light at Belle

Vue when you stand 30 or 40 yards from it, on the far side of the plat-

form quite as much I should say."  At 45 miles instead of 35 yards the

minated Manchester with a glare equivalent to the mechanical strength of

something less than half this number of horse-powers, expending therefore

    --X i - ' foot-pounds, or 4,224,964,425 foot-pounds of energy

in its brief career ! Moving with a velocity of 25 miles per second, a
single pound- weight of matter possesses 270 - 555 millions of foot-pounds

of energy of motion, so that to account for the fireball's expenditure of

4,225 millions of foot-pounds of energy, it suffices to suppose that

4,225-^-270§, or 15'616 lbs. weight of matter composing its substance was
brought suddenly to rest by the enormous force of resistance of its
collision with the air ! Tbe average pressure of this resistance in a flight
of 70 miles must be 4,225 millions-:- (70 X 5280), or ll,4311bs., and this
pressure of nearly five tons against its front surface would instantly com-
minute and disperse any liquid or pulverulent substance, making it
obvious that the masses of shooting-stars, and of very luminous fireballs
like the present one, are really hard and compact stone, exactly as we find

those of aerolites to be.

     The intensity of the fireball's incandescence or ignition seems to have
been rather remarkable, as the light which it cast was bluish, and was
everywhere compared (about Manchester, at Conway, in Wales, &c.) to
sheet lightning, to the electric and limelights, and to daylight. It is,
therefore, not at all improbable that its powerful glare may have been
generated from a much less expenditure of mechanical energy than that
here represented, and that not only the mechanical action but also the
weight of meteoric substance, and the pressure on its surface here
supposed may be somewhat overrated. The nucleus nevertheless under-
went progressive disintegration all along its track, leaving a long string
or stream of countless red sparks, stars, or beads of fire in its wake, which
remained visible for a short time after the meteor's disappearance. It
did not bnrst and fly to pieces at last, but collapsed and disappeared
rather suddenly, and at places near which it descended to no great
distance from the earth no sound of any audible report following its
extremely brilliant flashes seems to have been perceived.

Somewhat plentiful displays of meteor showers, both occasional and on
the well-known annual dates, have been recorded during the past year, a
list of which is here appended where the date and the frequency of the
meteors and the position and accuracy of their radiant point were suffi-
ciently remarkable to make the observations of special interest, or of any

extracted from an original list of 162 meteor showers seen in the year

1877 ; which was published in March, 1878, by Mr. Denning, in the

' Monthly Notices ' of the Royal Astronomical Society (vol. xxxviii.,

p. 305). The present list includes also some notes of the same, and of
later showers in the year 1878, which Mr. Denning obligingly communi-

cated to the committee. Of the August Perseids, in 1877, some other

descriptions having been received, a short account of the additional

observations since collected is here presented to complete the brief notice

of that shower which was given in last year's Report.

Meteor shower of August, 1877.--Observations at York, by Mr.

J. E. Clark. The sky was often cloudy on the 9th, and watch was only
kept for twenty minutes, in which ten meteors were seen, six of which

were Perseids. On the night of the 10th, the sky, while watched, was

Alittle more than half clear. lull of fifteen minutes occurred, commencing

at 11 o'clock, in which there were seen only two Perseids and three un-
                                                                30m             30m
conformable meteors.               In  the  hour between  ll h       and  12 h                     ,  thirty

Perseids and two unconformable meteors were seen, and twenty of their

tracks were mapped. The principal radiant was not very well defined, a

good many meteors coming from the Andromeda side of Perseus. Several

of the streaks left were very fine and long enduring.

Observations at Writtle, Chelmsford, by Mr. H. Corder. The sky was

watched for four hours on the night of the 10th, and was partly clear.

104 Perseids and eighteen unconformable meteors were seen, the Perseids

appearing at the rate of about twenty-six (equal to forty or fifty in a clear

sky), and unconformable meteors at the rate of about four (equal to seven

or eight in a clear sky), per hour. Forty-eight of the Perseids seen left

streaks, three bright flashing meteors leaving fine reddish .trains visible

for about twenty seconds. The radiant point of the shower was rather

+diffuse, with a mean place at 47° 62°.

On the night of the 11th the sky was watched, partially clear, for

three hours, seventy-six Perseids and eleven other meteors being noted.

Thirty- eight of the Perseids left streaks, their average horary number

was twenty-five, and that of the unconformable shooting-stars four per

hour                               but during the clearest half hour the average horary number of the
                                ;

Perseids reached forty-eight per hour. None were so brilliant as the

flashes seen on the previous night ; but some were quite equal to Sirius,

and one of the largest of these left a forked streak divided into two

branches thus,

third way from a Ophiuchi to a Herculis. The radiant, better defined

than on the previous night, was at +58° 56°. From the two determina-

tions of its place, Mr. Corder suspected a gradual progression of the
radiant-point on the two successive nights.

     The Perseids in this shower were swift. Thirty of them were as

ones orange, and the lesser yellow, the remainder being white. After the
night of the 11th no farther view of the shower was obtained, the sky

being continually overcast.

   --Observations at Bristol, by Mr. W. F. Denning. The sky was overcast

on the nights of the 9th and 11th. The appearance of the shower on the
10th (as described in last year's Report) was somewhat notable, bnt not

above an average intensity of the Perse'id shower. On the 12th the
abundance of the meteors was much less than on the 10th, and did not

greatly exceed the rate of their appearance on the 7th. In long watches
on several of the nights of the shower's continuance, which, excepting
August 5th, were fairly favourable for observations, the following average
horary numbers of shooting-stars were seen, the average rate of appear-

ance of the unconformable meteors being, with little variation, during the
time, about fifteen per hour :

Thirty-two Perse'ids and 159 unconformable meteors were seen on the

uights of August 3rd to 7th, showing the comparative scarcity (1 : 5)

of the meteors of the periodic shower, until very near the principal date

of its occurrence. Mr. Denning's observations during the last few annual

August showers have, in fact, established (as the results obtained in this

year's shower, to be described below, will presently disclose most

clearly) that reputed appearances of the Perse'ids before the 1st of August

are pretty certainly to be ascribed to some neighbouring showers in

Perseus, one at least of which is a very rich one, with a centre at

+32° 53° near 0, only 7° or 8° distant from that of the true Perse'ids near
AV Persei.
                                   star-shower of considerable intensity and restricted to a few

nights only in its total duration proceeded, in 1878, from this radiant-

point on the night of July 31st. Two other Perseus showers in July,

1877 (as was recorded last year in these Reports, for 1877, p. 159), were

also seen by Mr. Denning at +36° 47°, and 47° +45°, with apparent re-

semblances in the positions of their radiant-points to the orbits of the

comets 770, 8, and 1764, ft. Further observations of the last of these
July showers near s Persei, were obtained in August and September,

1877                          and  during      the  long  time  of  its  visibility,  apparently,  in  these

three months, its meteors, like those of the other circum- Perse'id showers

just mentioned, were certainly distinguishable by Mr. Denning from the

true Perse'ids of August 10th. Of these latter he noted 385, together

with 569 meteors unconformable to the true Perseus radiant-point, during

the interval from July 6th to August 23rd.

Continuing his observations in September, Mr. Denning recorded in

July, August, and September, 1877, the paths of 1205 meteors, and

deduced from them eighty-nine radiant-point positions. Of these about

twenty (chiefly in July and August, between the 3rd or 6th and the 16th

or 17th days of those months) were duplicate determinations belonging,

Aapparently, to repetitions of a single shower.                                       radiant-point near o

Cassiopeias, two in Andromeda, two in Cygnus, and two others in Lacerta

and Aquarius (see the accompanying list), were of this description. One

of these, near a Cygni, at 315°+ 50° presents some resemblance in its posi-

tion to the orbit of Coggia's comet, 1874 III (radiant-point, July 21st,

+313° 48°), but the comet's passage through, its descending node was at

such a distance (0 - 285 of the sun's distance from the earth) within the
earth's orbit that the possibility of this meteor shower and the comet
having any real connection with each other is extremely doubtful. Marked
showers east of Perseus were noticed in Camelopardus, Perseus, and
Aries during the morning watches of the Perse'ids on August 10th and
12th (11th and 13th, a.m.), 1877, of which Mr. Denning has since obtained
by observations, and by extensive reductions of other observers' meteor-

catalogues, very excellent and abundant corroborative indications. Among

the showers noted in the second week of September, were two active radiants

-- --one near t, Persei, and one in Ursa Minor, accompanying the former

of which, some traces, apparently of the October Aurigids, nearo Auriga?,

were visible, with a maximum on September 5th. On the mornings of

September 15th and 16th, shooting-stars were very numerous, and

Mr. Denning noted several meteor showers with apparently new radiant-

point positions * from the paths of 117 meteors recorded in nine hours.

   A somewhat extraordinary apparition of a meteor shower in September

last, described as related to him by an observer at Bloomington, Inda.,
by Professor D. Kirkwood in the ' Scientific American,' (transcribed in
the 'London Iron Trade Exchange' of October 6th, 1877), was as

Afollows : " few minutes after 10 o'clock on Friday evening, September

7th, 1877, Mr. John Graham, of Bloomington, Inda., had his attention
arrested by a sudden light in the heavens, and on looking up he saw a

stationary meteor between Aquila and Anser et Vuljpecula, about R. A. 295°,
decl. 15° N. It increased in brightness for a second or more, and dis-
appeared within less than \° east of the point at which it was first seen.

Immediately after the extinction of the first, three others, separated by
intervals of three or four seconds, appeared and vanished in the same

place, with the exception that one disappeared about as much west of

the radiant as the first did east of it. Mr. Graham's curiosity was
 excited, and he continued to watch until after an interval of a few min-
utes a fifth meteor corresponding in appearance to the preceding was seen
in the same place. The meteors were about equal to stars of the first
magnitude. The fact indicates that a stream of meteoric matter was

moving at the time almost exactly towards the observer. Two or three

isolated cases of stationary meteors have been recorded ; the phenomena

 of the 7th inst. are, however, quite extraordinary. I have stated the

observations as given me by Mr. Graham, who pointed out the position
in which the meteors were seen." On the disappearance of streak-leav-
ing meteors, when seen perfectly stationary, it not unfrequently happens

 that the rekindling of the streak, which is a singular property of the
 luminous vapours left on a meteor's track (see the last vol. of these

 Reports, p. 169, for similar examples), presents the appearance of a second
 meteor shining forth, a second or two later than the first oneat the same place.
 In the case of extremely large meteors, whirls and contortions of the

vapours on its track may perhaps concentrate their light into several
 such rekindling centres, since the observer's line of sight is at the same

 time directed along scores of miles of their very feebly phosphorescent

    * A list of these new a.m. showers given by Mr. Denning in ' The Observatory,'

vol. ii. p. 164 (Sept., 1878), is as follows : At 156° + 41°, 130° + 46°, 101° + 11°,
88° + 17°, 87° + 34°, and 73° + 14°. They are nearly all showers (D. 90, 110, 99,

substance. Perhaps the extraordinary succession of stationary meteors

seen by Mr. Graham may admit of some such intelligible explanation.

During evening watches on October 2-4 many fine meteors were again

observed, Mr. Denning counting 127, and noting numbers of their paths,

in intervals extending together over 13| hours.* Two of the brightest

were small bolides, about as brilliant as Venus and Jupiter, which, together

with several others diverged on the night of October 22nd, from a radiant-

+point in the head of Bootes, at 225° 52°. The brightest one of the

shower left a nebulous light streak at its place of explosion and disappear-

ance visible for 3-^ minutes, and drifting some 5° from its first position

before it disappeared. On the following night another Venus-like meteor

leaving a light streak for 15 seconds shot from the direction of a radiant-

+point of less marked activity (D. 92, 1878, at 167°                      75°) midway

between the ' Pointers ' and Polaris. The next conspicuous radiant-

point observed was that of many pretty bright meteors on those two

nights, and on October 4th, from the direction of an exceedingly well-

+defined centre in the head of Camelopardus, at 133° 79°. The shower

remained visible on some following nights, and was an extremely dis-

tinct and certain shower on the first nights of its maximum display. It

agrees in date and position so very closely with the radiant-point of a

stream moving in the same orbit with the comet 1825 II., ?3 (at

+133° 77°, October 7th), that although this orbit passed just transversely

to the plane of the ecliptic, about ten millions of miles inside the earth's

orbit, at the shower date, yet the certainty and exactness of the meteor

shower leave scarcely a reasonable doubt of the meteor- shower's connec-

tion with the comet. The agreement is supported by meteor-showers of
Heis (Ni 6- 18 ) close to the cometary radiant-point in September and
October ; and if the apparent identity can be re-established and con-

firmed by new precise determinations, it will afford a very convincing

argument that the materials of comet's tails may give rise to meteor-

showers, or that at least the orbit of a meteor-shower, shown to agree in

every other element with a non-periodic comet's orbit, may yet differ

very largely from the comet's orbit in its perihelion distance. Another

radiant-point near Polaris was active on the same nights, but lying on the

opposite of the north pole, in Cepheus and in this position a nearly con-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

tinuous shower appeared to be situated from July to October.

    A long watch for shooting-stars was kept by Mr. Denning on the

night of October 8th, 105 meteors being seen, and 95 of their tracks re-

corded in ten hours, the sky throughout being brilliantly clear. The

numbers seen in the four hours preceding 11 o'clock were three, six, nine,

seventeen                                               the numbers seen  between 10h and ll h being the greatest num-
                                                     ;

Aber recorded in one hour during the night.                               note received soon after-

wards from Mr. T. W. Webb informed Mr. Denning of a reported
appearance at Hay, S. "Wales, of many falling stars between 10h 15m

and 10h 45m p.m. on the night of October 8th, as an occurrence which

had attracted some attention. The meteor frequency was quite con-

firmed by Mr. Denning's observations ; but it is yet remarkable that it

did not proceed from an outburst of any individual or special meteor-

shower, as the meteors came from many radiant-points, none of which,

during the time indicated, showed an exceptionally great activity.

  * For particulars of these nights' observations the Committee is indebted to
long and full description in a Bristol newspaper, communicated by Mr. Denning.

Simultaneous showers from Monoceros, Musca, Triangulum, ft Tauri,

fi Persei, and o Aurigas furnished, in fact, during the night, scarcely
more than ordinary numbers of about six or ten meteors each. At
ll h 56m a bolide, about twice as bright as Venus, shot obliquely down-

wards from the direction of one of these radiant-points near ft Tauri,
close to the east horizon, and it appears not improbable that it was iden-
tical with one of two bright fire-balls seen on about the date of this ex-

ceptionally clear October night in France.* Six meteors as bright as

Jupiter, and two as bright as Venus, besides this brilliant bolide, had

been recorded by Mr. Denning among the many shooting- stars which he

(a.m.) by Mr. Denning; and at Writtle on October 17 and 18 (a.m.)
by Mr. Corder. Between 3h 40m and 4h 40m a.m. on October 16th meteors

were  falling  at  the  rate  of forty  or  forty-five  per  hour                          but  not  from

and 18th the horary numbers were also exceptionally large, twenty-five

and thirty-five ; and on these dates, as well as on the 19th and 20th (a.m.)

the Orionids had become much the most considerable and conspicuous

shower. At their greatest rate of frequency on the 18th (and also

on the morning of the 19th) their numbers were nearly equal to those of

the sporadic or unconformable meteors of other simultaneously prevailing

showers, as the following summary of his observations on the above morn-

ings by Mr. Denning will show briefly in a tabular arrangement :

Observer, W. F. Denning."

      Besides the shower in Cancer, contemporaneous showers in Lynx,

and Ursa Major, with the Orionids, were found to be very active.
     With a small number seen on other days, Mr. Corder noted fifty-three

Orionids on the mornings of October 17th and 18th. On the latter morn-
ing their horary rate was fourteen for one observer. Few were observed
before midnight, and the shower seemed to slacken after 3h 30m a.m.

"while, on the other hand, a shower of slow-moving meteors from o Piscium,

which continued all night, was especially active towards morning, when
its radiant was in S.W. The horary number of meteors of all kinds
on the two mornings was about thirty for one observer. The radiant was

+at 89° + 18° on the 17th, and at 95° 17° on the 18th, showing appa-

rently a movement or displacement of some degrees. No meteors equal

to the 1st mag. stars were seen, but twenty-three Orionids left streaks;

they were white, their speed was great, and the streaks were rather per-

sistent. After the maximum of the Orionids had passed, one of the

Ursids occurred, but with a radiant so diffuse as not to admit of being

well determined.

     The following table briefly represents the number of hours of observa-
tion, a.m. and p.m., and the numbers of meteors seen, and of meteor-

     During the last few nights of October, and on November 1st, a bright
and abundant shower of "Muscids," with an exact radiant-point near

t Arietis nearly agreeing in radiant-position Avith the " Muscids " of Sep-

tember 20th-November 17th, 1876, and with the maximum appearances of

that shower on October 15th, 1876, and October 8th, 1877, was observed,
furnishing many bright meteors ; and besides these notes of its marked
display by Mr. Denning, two small bolides, about as bright as Venus,
belonging apparently to the same shower, were seen at Birmingham, and

at Sunderland, on the evening of November 4th, 1877, by Mr. Wood and

Mr. Backhouse.

     Of the various Taurid showers in October and November, 1877, very
few and imperfect indications were observed, although the weather was
not always very favourable for their detection. At Writtle, the state of
the sky only perunitted shooting-stars to be recorded on three nights in
the first half of November, when Mr. Corder saw twenty-four, forty,
and forty-three meteors, " mostly Taurids and Ursids, the latter (as also

accordingly observed.

seconds, where it shone out brightly near the end of its course ; the num-

ber and well-marked radiant-point of these meteors clearly denoting a

slight but yet very distinct return of the November Leonids. It was also

morning of November 14th, 1877, between lh 55m and3h 45m a.m., being

at the rate of thirty per hour. Nearly all were Leonids, a few being as large as

first magnitude stars, with trains which lasted for several seconds. The

appearance of so large a. number, ten or eleven years after the maximum dis-

plays of 1866-67, is quite unexpected. The early part of the night was
cloudy, but before 2h a.m. the sky became quite clear." The interval of

Mr. Backhouse's watch ending soon after 6 o'clock, terminated about an

Ahour before that of the American observers' watch began.                                                                       pretty

bright commencement of the rather stronger Leonid display recorded in

America, as this paragraph describes, must accordingly, during Mr.

Backhouse's observations at Sunderland at a slightly earlier hour, have

been the general character and appearance of this meteor-shower during

the early portion of its time of apparition, in which it appears that a

somewhat notable return cf the Leonids in November, 1877, was visible

in America.

          Two apparitions of the November Andromedes, about equal in intensity

to that of the Leonids, were seen on the nights of November 25th and

27th, 1877, by Mr. Denning and Mr. Backhouse. At Bristol Mr.

Denning relates that, " Observations of the Andromedes were commenced
on the evening of November 25th. Between about 5h 40 m and 7h 10m

(1^ hour) sixteen meteors were seen, of which seven, or nearly one-half, were

+Andromedes, with a radiant-point sharply defined at 24° 45 (near %, to

Andromeda?). They were very slow orange-coloured meteors with short

paths. On the evening of November 27th, between about 9 h and 10 h 30m
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,

the sky was watched for 1^ hour, and ten meteors were seen, of which

two only conformed to the radiant-point of the Andromedes. Thus, so

far as my brief observations allowed me to determine, the shower was

more actively in progress on November 25th than on the 27th, in the

proportion of about three to one.

    "On the evening of the 29th a watch was maintained for three hours, and

twenty-seven meteors were seen, of which none were from Andromeda. There

was, however, an active display of swift white meteors with streaks from

+a radiant point at k Cephei, at 185°                     71°.   On December 1st and 2nd

observations extended over four hours (twenty-eight meteors), but no more

Andromedes were observed. So far as I can judge the shower was at its

best on November 25th. Cloudy weather prevented work on November

26th."

     In a watch of little more than 20m (at 7h 24m and at 7h 42 m p.m.) on

the evening of November 25th, Mr. Backhouse registered two shooting-

stars at Sunderland, both apparently Andromedes. On the night of

November 27th, in a watch of 50m, equivalent to about three-quarters

of an hour in a cloudless sky (about one- tenth part of the sky being on an

average overcast, and slight moonlight prevailing towards the close),ending

at  ll h  30m                   Mr.  Backhouse  observed  eight  meteors,  corresponding  to  an
                             ,

horary rate of frequency of about eleven. Twelve shooting-stars were

registered before midnight. Of these six (one rather doubtful from its

swiftness) were Andromedes, with short courses, not far from the radiant-
point, which was sharply marked (by all but one of their paths) at 28°

+ 46°. Only two were as bright as second or third magnitude stars, of

yellow colour ; their motion was slow, and the nucleus of the brightest

had a short tapering tail.

    From these descriptions it appears that on both the nights of Novem-
ber 25th and 27th, 1877, the horary frequency of the Andromedes was

occasionally as great as that of the contemporaneously occurring sporadic

or unsystematic shooting-stars, and that their radiation on each of those

nights was sufficiently exact to denote a distinct although a very feeble

reappearance of the Bielan shower.

  -- --The Oeminids of December 10th 11th, 1877. A good view of this

annual shower's appearance on the nights of its greatest intensity was

obtained by Mr. Greg, who watched the progressive increase of its bright-
ness from November 27th. The meteors increased in numbers and in
accuracy of radiation until the display reached its maximum on the night

of December 11th, when at one time they certainly succeeded each other,

for one observer, at the rate of one a minute ; and their average horary rate

for one observer on that evening was about thirty-five. Their apparent paths,
even at a distance from the radiant-point were extremely short (not more
than 5°), and but little marked with streaks, rendering it difficult to fix
their radiant-point exactly. This centre of nearly thirty tracks, mapped
on the 9th and 11th, in a somewhat restricted region of the sky near Ursa

+Major, was at 104° 38°, four or five degrees north of the line joining

a, d Geminorum, and in rather higher declination than has hitherto been
usually observed, confirming the supposition which Mr. Greg has been

led to entertain from former observations of this shower, of an elongation

+ +of its radiant-point in declination between about                                      40° N.
                                                                           30° and

decl. The meteors did not vary much in colour or in brightness, presenting

in general the appearance of first or second magnitude stars, bright white,

and moving with considerable velocity. Although Mr. Greg's attention
was specially directed to determining the positions of any co-existing

radiant-points which might at the same time be observable in the con-

stellation Gemini, none such could be detected.

    Mr. Corder's and Mr. Denning's observations of the Geminids near

Chelmsford, and at Bristol, relate principally to the shower's appearance

on the nights of December 9th, 10th, and 12th. It was on the former date

that its meteors first appeared to Mr. Corder to be growing numerous,

only occasional Geminid-meteors having been visible earlier in Decem-

ber, when the sky was favourable for observations. " On the 9th,

however, nearly twenty were seen in about three hours, the first hour
(from 8h to 9h p.m.) producing very few meteors of any kind. One

Geminid, as bright as Sirius, of a beautiful pale emerald-green colour, left

a streak at disappearance. Simultaneously with the true Geminids a

meteor system was active, diverging from 4 Geminorum, supplying finer
and longer meteors. One of these was seen at 8h lom in the north-west,

as bright as Jupiter, of a bluish mauve tint, leaving a long but narrow
streak. At ll h 58m a similar one shot upwards to Polaris, as bright as

Sirius, and of the same manve colour as the former one.

    " The characteristic of these meteors seemed to be their length and

the brightness of the streaks mostly left upon their tracks, while the

true Germinids were short, and seldom streak-leaving. Their radiant

was at 108° + 28°, and this meteor-stream had ceased almost entirely on

the following night.

._  "On the next evening (December 10th), between 7h and ll h 30m
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,

sixty-five meteors were seen, forty of which were Geminids. The hour
from 10h 30m to llh 30m produced twenty-five meteors, almost all from

the principal radiant. Only one was equal to a first magnitude star, and

it was pale green, Yery few of the Geminids left streaks, and they were

mostly very short and small.

     The radiant was diffuse, perhaps owing to the difficulty of mapping
them in the barren part of the sky between Gemini and Polaris where

they frequently appeared. Many radiated from near Castor, and others

from nearer to 6  Geminorum                                                                                   the mean position [nearly midway between
                                                                                  ;

+those stars] being at 107° 35°.
    "A few Geminids were seen on the 12th; the 11th being quite over-

cast.

     Some further account of the shower's prevalence on the latter date, and

--on some earlier days in December, are supplied by Mr. Denning's notes,

who wrote from Bristol : " On the night of December 6th, I found meteors

wonderfully scarce                                                                                      only  thirteen  in  three  hours (!) ;  and  only  two  of
                                                                                                     ;

them were Geminids. Of twenty-three meteors seen in two hours and a

half on the evening of the 8th and morning of the 9th, four were Gemi-

nids. On the morning of the 11th, between 5h 10m and 6h 10m a.m. (l h )
eleven meteors were seen, including two Geminids. On the morning of

the 13th (between storms and clouds), I looked out for about three-quar-

ters of an hour between 4h 45m and 5h 45TM a.m. Meteors were falling

very fast, and I saw twenty-eight altogether, of which six were Gemi-
nids.* In one and a quarter hour, between 5h 15m and 6h 30m a.m. on

the morning of December 14th, twenty-one meteors were seen, but no Gemi-

    * Among these meteors a few fine shooting stars with streaks and very swift

long paths, diverged from a point on the equator in R.A. 166°. This agrees with
a position (T. 2) given by Captain Tupman, although for a rather later date, at
160°+ 3°, Dec. 23-31st and 165°+ 4°, Jan. 8-10th.

nids. The watch on all these mornings was directed towards the eastern
sky, not so much to observe the Geminids as to discover some new showers

in Virgo, Corona, Bootes, &c, which are just visible before daylight in

December ; and of four of these which I observed I believe the following

+ + +positions to be accurate, at 199° 19°, 221°
                                              43°, 230°                       33°, and

195° - 3° (December ll-14th, a.m., 1877).

    +" The radiant point of the Geminids was at 307° 33°, with suspected

+ +neighbouring centres at 102° 45°, 87° 37°, and 111 + 23°. The me-

teors were slow near the radiant, but rapid when far from it. Their

coui'ses are not often marked with streaks, and are almost invariably

short ; in this and other particulars of tie general appearance of the Ge-

minids, I can clearly confirm Mr. Greg's remarks from rny own observa-

--tions of them both this year and last."
     Star-showers of January and April, 1878. -Watches kept at several

places in England for the meteors of January lst-3rd were almost

wholly unsuccessful, a cloudy and overcast state of the sky having

prevailed everywhere on the dates of their expected appearance. Occa-

sional glimpses of clear sky occurred in Kent, however, on the first

three nights of the year, and the January shower was seen, at Hawk-

hurst, with some intensity on the morning of January 2nd, by Profes-

sor Herschel. Seventeen Quadrantids and three unconformable meteors

were registered during the half hour beginning at four o'clock, a.m.,

at the end of which clouds formed and overspread the sky. The meteors

were bright, two being equal to Jupiter or Sirius, and five or six equal to

each of the first and second magnitudes of the fixed stars ; the rest being
as bright as third or fourth magnitude stars ; occasional thin clouds, and

a slight haze which dimmed the stars, perhaps concealed some meteors of

the smallest magnitudes, and caused the radiant obtained from their

recorded tracks to be a little diffuse. Its centre occupied a point at about

+222° 55° in quadrans, near 6 Bootis. This point being nearly in the

zenith, the meteors' courses were short and quick, and that of the brightest

one appeared to be a little curved. They were yellowish- white in colour,

and left no streaks or sparks. During a watch of half an hour on each

of the mornings of January 1st and 3rd, when the sky was clear, no me-

teors of the Quadrantid shower were seen, the maximum of its display

being accordingly confined to the morning of the 2nd.

     The nights of April 19th-21st, 1878, were also very unfavourable for
observations, but a slight return of the " Lyrids " was observed at Bristol

on the nights of April 20th-22nd, by Mr. Denning. Three Lyrids and

three meteors from a radiant near e Herculis were seen in two hours, amid

much cloud, on the 20th ; and in the same time, with very clear sky,

twenty-five meteors (six Lyrids) and twenty- two meteors (three Lyrids)

were seen towards midnight on the 21st and 22nd. An abundance of me-

teors, and a continuance of the Lyrid shower on these latter nights is rare
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and it seems to have been an exceptional feature of the shower in the present

year. The meteors left streaks, and the paths recorded were nearly all

foreshortened near the radiant-point, which was very exactly defined at

+272° 32°. This position, near d and the star 99 (A 2 Bode) Herculis,

is  in  5° less  right  ascension  than  the  Lyrid-centre  (QH               1874)  found
                                                                          2,

by Greg and Herschel, and agrees more exactly with the radiant of the

+Lyrid-comet 18G1 I (at 271° 33°), and with the position found in April,

1869, by Professor Schiaparelli from Dr. Karlinski's observations (at 267°

+ 35°), than other previous determinations a feature also of the April
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

Lyrids of the present year in which their feebly pronounced display seems

to have been somewhat peculiar.*

The next remarkable meteor-shower observations of the present year

Awere those of the July and August shooting-stars, 1878.                                   distinct

shower of Cassiopeiads of those months, coinciding with one already re-

corded by Greg, Heis, and Schiaparelli, at about 12° + 70°, was observed
+in July by Mr. Denning at 15° 70° (thirty-five meteors). Towards the

end of July, having, from foreign catalogues and other sources, obtained

abundant indications of circum- Perseus and other contemporary showers

of the great August epoch, Mr. Denning employed the finest nights

Aafter the moon's last quarter to verify them by his own observations.

meteor was thus observed on July 21st, of a shower near 8 Persei

A strong maximum of this shower, quite confirming the correctness of

Mr. Denning's anticipations of its reappearance, set in on the nights of

July 26th-August 1st, exhibiting a perfectly defined radiant-point 3° or 4°

+south of the star-cluster % Persei, at 33° 52°. Forty-four meteors from

this radiant-point were traced on the nights of July 30th, 31st, and Au-

gust 1st,  alone                           and the whole number of meteor tracks recorded from it
                                        ;

until August 1st was fifty-nine. The maximum took place on the night

of July 31st, when twenty-one of its meteors were observed. They are

short, swift, white shooting- stars, leaving streaks, and by their resemblance

to the true Perseids, or Perse'ids I, fromwhose principal centre their radiant

is only distant about six or seven degrees, these mock-Perse'ids, or

Perse'ids II, have no doubt been mistaken, when abundant in July, for the

earliest meteor-representatives of the true Perse'id display. The shower

was of brief duration, and as short-lived in its departure as in approach-

ing its maximum, for among forty-four meteors seen on the nights of Au-

gust 7th and 8th, when the sky was again clear enough for observation,

not a single meteor of this new Perse'id system was observed. Of the

true Perse'ids the first indications seen were five or six meteors, on the

nights of July 31st and August 1st ; and six meteors among sixteen, regis-

tered on August 7th, were Perseids I.

1878. A number of circum- Lyra showers for the great April-erjoch, deduced from

observed by himself, are presented in this Paper by Mr. Denning. Among the latter

is one suspected near 8 Cassiopeia?, which is perhaps identical with the centre of
divergence of two detonating fireballs seen in Austria on April 10th, 1874, and April

Another rich and important meteor- shower of bright shooting-stars

with long slow courses, with a radiant point near 5 Aquarii at 341°-- 13°,

was seen by Mr. Denning on the night of July 27th, and many more were

recorded from it on the two next nights, while on the last clear night of

observations, on August 1st, its brief but notable and very active display

had entirely disappeared. With the shower of Perseids II, this fine and

conspicuous star-shower of o Aquariads (already recorded, T. 43, on the

same date and with the same radiant position, by Captain Tupman, in the

year 1870,* and seen in August, 1877, at the same place by Mr. Denning),

deserves to be ranked with the Orionids, Geminids, May Aquariads, and a

few other distinct, but not yet much studied, meteor systems, among the

major, or special star-showers of the year ; and to have its date and radiant-
point more frequently examined to discover if its appearance is annual, or

subject to regular or irregular fluctuations.

  --The Perseid shower of August 10th, 1878. The brightness of the moon

until after midnight, followed immediately by that of approaching day-

break, detracted from the apparent abundance of the shower. The sky

was quite overcast on the                       nights of  August 9th      and 11th                                            but cloudless

on the 10th. At Bristol Mr. Denning counted about 130 meteors in a
watch of four hours and a half, between 10h 30m p.m. and 3h a.m. ; thirty-

three meteors being counted in the last half-hour, of which twenty-six were

Perseids. This rate of appearance was less than the half-hourly number

(forty-two or thirty- three Perseids and nine unconformable meteors), be-
                          30 m

although fog, haze, and clouds then slightly dimmed the stars. The

shower's appearance this year was accordingly less active than at the

corresponding time in August, 1877. The paths of seven Perseids, as bright

as the planets Mars and Jupiter, and of five equal to first magnitude stars,

were mapped, and several other bright Perseids were seen, all of which

left persistent streaks. Attention was especially given by Mr. Denning

to mapping the tracks of Perseids near the radiant point, and of these

the foreshortened paths traced backwards were found to diverge from two

centres.

The shower of meteors with long courses, diverging from a radiant near Fomathaut,
seen by Professor A. S. Herschel on the 28th of July, 1865 (see these Reports, vol.

without doubt, one of the regular appearances of this shower, four of whose meteor

paths, traced backwards, intersecting each other accidentally with exactness near
that southern star, gave a false impression of the radiant's position (at 338°-- 28°),
15° south of the true one in declination.

nised by Sckiaparelli as agreeing almost exactly with the radiant-point of

+the Perse'id comet, 1862 III, at about 43° 57° - 5. The second radiant-

Apoint agrees with Heis' position, n of the centre of the Perse'ids
+at 45° 52°, and also with the radiant-point of a more recent comet,

+1870 I, on August 12th, at 43° - 5  53°. It may perhaps be that these

two comets represent two meteor streams which are in simultaneous

activity in the Perseus shower, and in his remarks on this accordance

(here quoted from his description of the Perse'ids of the present year in

'The Observatory,' vol. ii. p. 165) Mr. Denning notices an equally

remarkable coincidence, which he regards as offering even more conclusive

evidence of the latter comet's connection with the Perseus shower, that the

rich and long-enduring shower of the Perse'ids, seen with prolonged inten-

sity on the nights of the lOth-llth* (and with many fine meteors on the

12th and 13th) of August, 1871, happened a year after that comet's appear-

ance, in the same manner that the extraordinary Perse'id shower of Au-

gust 10th, 1863, occurred in the year following that in which the comet

1862 III made its appearance. The two instances of near concurrence

between a comet and a meteor-shower resemble each other very closely,

and there appears, indeed, to be no reasonable possibility of rejecting the

conclusion that the conspicuous return of the August Perse'ids in the year

1871 was not a simple maximum of their ordinary stream, but the result

of a passing contribution to its swarm of shooting-stars by the passage

very near the earth's path of a second meteor-comet, attended by a second

zone or multitude of Perse'ids of August 10th-12th, moving in a slightly

different companion orbit from that of the first or annually-recurring

shower, and of the meteor-comet corresponding to the Perse'ids of August

A10th. strict examination of the August radiant-point, hereafter, will be

most desirable to decide the question if, like the major stream of Perse'ids

+between k Persei and B Camelopardi (at 44° 58°), the fellow-stream at
+y Persei (43° 53°) is an annually recurring one, and forms, like the

ordinary Perse'ids of August 10th, a closed belt or ring of meteors circu-

lating in a continuous stream, or travels in a single, or in detached

clusters, round the sun.

Mr. Corder's view of the Perse'ids, at Writtle ('The Observatory,'

vol. ii. p. 160), was, in point of numbers and in the position of the radiant-
point, very similar to Mr. Denning's. In four hours, between llh 30m and
3h 30m, 113 meteors (of which ninety-seven were Perse'ids) were seen.

The mean horary number (twenty- eight of all meteors, and twenty-four
of Perse'ids) was much exceeded during the hour between 2h 15m and
3 h 15m a.m., when forty-four meteors were observed. Of the ninety-seven

Perse'ids seen, sixty left streaks, and twenty were coloured. One which
appeared at 2h 28m a.m. must have been much brighter than Venus, in its

flash at bursting, as it cast a sensible glare upon a lamplit page. Its

+ +streak remained visible in the sky, from 352° 48° to 341° 40°, long

    * In the map of the meteor-tracks of this shower, seen near the radiant-point on

August 10th and 11th, which is figured at p. 91 of the volume for 1872 of these

Reports, 36 of the 135 meteor-paths there drawn (or 27 per cent.) diverge, as Mr.
Denning has found, pretty exactly from a radiant-point at 42° + 54°. The remainder
of the tracks proceed principally from a radiant region in rather higher declination,

belonging perhaps properly to the true Perse'id comet, while the former point denotes
the fellow-comet, 1870 I. Of the meteor-paths on the nights of August 12th and
13th few were recorded, but of such tracks of them as were noted it would certainly
be a very important utilisation to endeavour to define the exact radiant-point in
Perseus which they exhibit by a similar projection.

enough to record its track exactly. The recorded paths of forty or fifty

Perse'ids laid down in a map gave the radiant- point of the shower most

+accordantly at 43° 56°. Another means of ascertaining it was also

adopted by prolonging the short tracks of several meteors seenjand mapped

near the radiant-point at about lh a.m. backwards, with the resulting

+position, 45°  57°                   and  a  perfectly stationary meteor was  seen  at  47°
                                   ;

+ 58°. The precision of the meteors' radiation from the general radiant-

point was surprising, much more so than on August 10th, 1877, when the

+radiant region was diffuse with a general centre at 47° 62°. The appa-

rent shifting of the radiant-point, then observed, to a more accurate one

+at 58° 56° on August 11th, could not be verified in the present year, as

on that date the sky was quite overcast. Both at Writtie and at Bristol

many meteors were seen on the nights of August 7th and 8th, including
several Perse'ids and some Cassiopeiads. Prom the Perse'ids seen on the

+7th Mr. Denning found a position of the radiant-point at 42° 57°, and
Mr. Corder one at 43° + 55°.

Although not remarkably intense, the radiation of the August Perse'ids,

in the year 1878, yet seems from all these descriptions to have been

unusually exact.

  --Catalogues of meteor-shoivers, and Directions to Observers of Luminous

Meteors. The example first set by Heis of observing the general centres

of radiation of shooting-stars on ordinary nights of the year has borne

abundant fruit during a long period of more than thirty years ; but at the
same time never more rapidly, perhaps, than during the last two or three.

Towards the end of last year was published, as the conclusion of his

own labours in this field of observation and reduction, a full and perfect

compilation, recently projected and finally completed by the late Professor

Heis, of the results of his original or otherwise recorded observations,

and of the calculations and determinations founded upon them, accom-

panied by comparisons with the work of other professional observers

with whom he continued to be in constant communication on this and

other subjects of his long-continued investigations until the last days of

his life. The work was issued, a few months after his decease, to the

astronomical public, as one of the ordinary publications * of the Royal

Observatory of Minister, under the joint editorship of his daughters and

the supervision of one of the great astronomer's thoroughly accomplished

pupils. Of this work the Committee received, in pursuance of a previous

arrangement with Professor Heis, a communication of fifty copies from

the Miinster University librarians, by the directions of the late Professor

Heis' daughters ; and with the assistance of their recommendations the

greater part of these copies were distributed, towards the close of last

year, to a number of British and foreign observers and leading observa-

tories, selected as having been his most active co-operators in the observa-

tion of meteors, and in the collection and discussion of phenomena

relating to the astronomical theory of shooting-stars.

The work comprises, in 180 quarto pages, here and there illustrated

with woodcuts, the apparent paths and brief descriptions of about 13,000

shooting-stars observed under Professor Heis' own directions at Aix-la-

Chapelle and Miinster, and of about 3000 meteors seen elsewhere in Ger-

many, and in other countries. Of this latter number the author's wide cor-

respondence enabled him to receive and to publish many accounts in

the well-known astronomical journal begun and conducted by himself

for a long course of years, the ' Wochenschrift fiir Astronomie,' and fre-

quent references to this weekly journal occur in the meteor catalogue of
the work. The narrative portion, forming the remainder of the volume,

contains the results of calculations and reductions from the catalogue,

lists of stationary meteors, of meteors with serpentine paths, and of dates

of unusual frequency and scarcity of shooting-stars. The introduction

of this part also discusses and explains the practical mode of observing

and the methods of calculation used, by which, with very little change

since their first adoption in the year 1833, the whole of the important

results of the author's forty-three years' observations of meteors presented

in the volume were obtained. Among the many meteors simultaneously

recorded at two or more stations, the heights at first appearance of 246,

and  at  disappearance  of  273,  are  calculated                                                         and  the  following  table,

The most frequent height of commencement is between sixty-five

and seventy miles, and the most frequent height of disappearance of

the meteors appears by this table to be about forty-five miles above the

earth's surface.

   A useful table might be constructed from the nights of the year on

which shooting-stars were noted as unusually abundant, to guide ob-

servers in watching for their extraordinary displays, but the extent and

fulness of this record in the original work forbids a partial summary

to be presented here of its contents, until they can be more thoroughly

examined and arranged to serve conveniently and usefully for such a

purpose. At the end of this appendix a careful analysis is given by Mr.

Greg of the new and greatly enlarged list of Heis' radiant-points, ob-

tained by the author's special method of reduction from the meteor-paths

Adescribed in the catalogue, with which the work concludes.                                                         very large

increase of their number above that of the last earlier list (of eightv-

four showers; see the volume of these reports for 1873, p. 403) pub-
lished by the late Professor Heis, has principally been made in the last

half of the year ; and the co-ordinates of position of a few of the old

showers (which retain their appellations, while numerals and special

symbols denote the new ones) have at the same time been changed and

rectified by the discussions of the newer observations. The Committee

avails itself of this opportunity to present, with the analysis of the

new radiant-list of Heis, that published in 1871, in the German trans-

lation of his work on shooting-stars, by Professor Schiaparelli, the meteor-

showers of which are frequently quoted, and identified with certain meteor-

tracks, in Heis' final reductions. Of this list (with the exception of an

teors and meteorites, drawn up at the request of the Committee by Dr.

W. Flight and Professor Herschel, to furnish both regular and occasional

observers of meteors of every kind with suitable directions as to the pro-

per means and methods of recording them, and for preserving useful

particulars of their various phenomena, is added to these lists with a

view of facilitating their consultation and perusal by those who may
fortunately be observers of star-showers, or who may be desirous of trac-
ing the directions of large meteors from some of the many active radiant-

points with which the sky is found to be more or less thickly strewn at all

the ordinary hours and seasons of the year.

Important lists, both of his own observations of such showers through-

out the year 1877, and of similar showers for the whole year found by

searches and projections of the meteor-tracks in the Italian Meteor Asso-

ciation catalogue of shooting-stars for the year 1872, were published during

the past year by Mr. Denning.* The first of these is a continuation of

his two earlier lists of twenty-seven, and of fifty-two meteor-showers for

the four years ending in March, 1876, and for April-December, 1870,

published in the ' Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,'

vol. xxxvi. pp. 283-285, and vol. xxxvii. pp. 105-115f ; and it includes new

positions and notes of the appearances of 162 meteor-showers deduced

from the paths of 1,929 shooting- stars registered by himself, chiefly in

the last half of the year 1877. Descriptions of the majority of the most

conspicuous of these showers, showing especially the dates of their

maximum abundance, arc given in the accompanying list of ' Remarkable

meteor-showers in the years 1877-78.' The second list contains the posi-

tions of 315 radiant-points deduced by systematic projections of about

4,000 of the 7,500 meteor-paths (omitting about 3,500 tracks observed on

August 3rd-14th) recorded by the Italian Meteor Association in the year

1872. This first catalogue of the Italian Association's observations

falls naturally into thirteen periods separated by void intervals owing to

the brightness of full moonlight ; and grouping two of these into one

(February-March, and November-December) in two cases where the

showers were little distinguishable from each other, Mr. Denning de-

meteor-systems, with well determined radiant-points, most of the dates

and positions of their centres agreeing well with those of formerly -known

showers, occurring                                  in   earlier    catalogues                                                  but  many of them also are
                                                                                                                             ;

new, and a few are apparently rich systems, agreeing in some cases with

cometary dates and radiant-points.

Of these two shower-catalogues, showing where they corroborate

each other and confirm older well-established positions of general radiant-

points of shooting-stars, Mr. Greg has prepared a Table (Table V. p. 358)

--continuing and completing the analysis (Tables I. IV., in the last volume

of these Reports, pp. 180-187) for the first half of the year, which he
made last year of Mr. Denning's observations, and Italian meteor-shower

reductions. The limits of that analysis are now extended, by this

additional table, so as to afford a complete comparative list of the newly

found radiant-positions traced by Mr. Denning, for all the different

months of the year.

As a result of his arrangement at O'Gyalla for collecting observations

of shooting-stars in Hungary (some MS. lists of which at its commence-

ment, seethe note in these Reports, vol. for 1877, p. 165, the Committee

received formerly), Herr N". von Konkoly presented to the Com-

mittee, at the end of last year, two volumes of meteor observations,

containing observed paths and notes of the appearances of 1191 and

1367 meteors respectively, recorded during the years 1871-73, and
1874-76. To assist and promote accurate registration of meteor-tracks,

and the collection of such accounts among astronomers of his own and

other countries, Herr von Konkoly has had drawn and lithographed

(by Carl Schrader, of his observatory at O'Gyalla) two planispheres, or

central projections of the sphere on two planes touching it, one at the

pole, and the other at the equator of the heavens. No stars are entered

on the plates, which contain the meridians and parallel circles only, for
each degree, but a catalogue of them from the north pole to the 30tk
degree of south declination, and full directions for their insertion on the
340 report-- 1878.

blank plates, and a long and valuable explanation of the various means
of mapping, and recording and reducing to their radiant- points (and
even to their real paths and distances) the tracks of shooting-stars, and
of noting the special appearances of fireballs, when any such are seen,
accompanies the plates in a lithographed pamphlet, also drawn up by
Carl Schrader. The spherical radius of the maps is 25 cm. or 9'85 in.,
a little less than the radius, 12 in., to which the six similarly ruled
plates of the Useful Knowledge Society's Atlas, (drawn by the late Sir
John Lubbock) are constructed. But instead of being only 50 cm. square,
so as simply to enclose the sphere in a circumscribing cube (like the
maps just mentioned), the plates are 59 cm. square, and reach at the
sides to 50°, instead of to 45°, and at the corners to 59°, instead of to 55°
from the centre of the map. The cubical projection of the O'Gyalla
maps extends accordingly upon each face, to about 5° beyond the edges
of the cube ; and meteor-tracks prolonged to the edge of either of its
 six maps, admit, therefore, of being easily transcribed in part (and these
prolonged with a straight ruler) upon the next adjoining map. This
kind of projection of the sphere lends itself, therefore, very conveniently
to determining radiant-points of shooting-stars, at whatever hour and
day of the year, and in whatever geographical latitude of the globe, a

sufficient number of their apparent paths may have been observed.

      Besides the large Miinster catalogue of Professor Heis, and Herr von
 Konkoly's Hungarian catalogue of meteor- tracks, two long lists of
 shooting-stars, by Professor Dorna, of Turin, recorded at the Royal
 Italian Observatory of that city, in November, 1867, and August, 1869,
 (presented to the Committee some years ago by the author) have,
in addition, furnished Mr. Denning with some new materials, of which
he has availed himself, to deduce additional lists of meteor- showers,
partly for the special dates of the major annual star-showers of April,
August, and November, and partly in general for the last half of the year.
 This last list, containing ninety-two radiant-points will, it is hoped,
 shortly be published. Of the former lists, one at least, that of circum-
 Lyra radiant-points of April 19th-23rd, was recently described in a brief
 paper, on 'the April Lyrids [in 1878] and contemporary Meteor-showers,'
 in the ' Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,' by Mr.

 Denning.* Among many thousands of paths (chiefly found for this

 date in Dr. Weiss's Austrian Meteor-catalogue, 1867-74) Mr. Denning
 selected about 300, as radiating from centres in Cygnus, Draco, Lyra,
 Vulpecula, etc., and deduced eighteen radiant- positions from them, three

 or four, at least, of which may be regarded as exact and well determined,
 although (from want of proximity, doubtless, to their maximum dates)

 they are yet very inconsiderable showers. Accompanying the principal
 shower in Lyra are two very slender ones, near w and /3 Lyra? ; but in the
 adjoining constellations the principal contemporaneous showers are,
 first, a well-known shower at o Draconis (the Draconids, GK 64,
 224,s) ; secondly, a new, exact and certain shower between and »j Cygni
 (25 4, s), with several other showers in Cygnus, near ip, x, r, \, e, and £

 Cygni, to which one, pretty well confirmed from other sources, may be

 added near s Vulpeculoe. Thirdly, systems near a and j3 Cephei (of
 fifteen or sixteen meteors each) and a weak shower in the southern part

 of Lacerta. And lastly, a well-defined shower in Anser (20 j.s) with two

weak showers near it, in Sagitta, and one in Taurus Poniatovii. Both tlie
Anser- Sagitta showers and the one near Taurus Poniatovii, seem to hare

been noticed previously by Mr. Denning, (Nos. 30, 34, 1877) on April

l<3th-19th, 1877, and by Captain Tupman (T. 35, 34) on May 2nd, 1870,

the comets 1853 II, and 1844 II, which passed at the nodal dates, May

1st, and April 21st, slightly within the earth's orbit at their descending
nodes. Some other accordances of the same kind presented by these new
April showers are pointed out in the accompanying Table.'

o£ questionable determinations of the meteor-showers themselves, rather

the appearance of being accidental coincidences than clear proofs of

real resemblance or of positive identity. The cases of the accordances

(noticed above, pp. 326 and 335) between the comet of 1870 I ?3 , and

the August Perse'id shower in 1871, and of the comet, 1825 II, S

-- +( 0-115, Oct. 7th, 134° 77°) with a briefly enduring meteor-shower,

noted by Mr. Denning on the nights of October 3rd and 4th, 1877, at

+130°  79°, are perhaps exceptions.                                    Mr. Denning wrote that he never

noted a shower better than this rich one during the two nights that

its activity was at its maximum, and that in place and date of its

appearance, its agreement with those of the hypothetical comet-shower

was quite unexpected, and is practically perfect. This shower is un-

noticed in the accordance (No. 49), where the observation properly

belongs                                      but when duly inserted and added there to the previous                          tokens
                                          ;

of resemblance to the comet which showers observed by Heis and

Denning are shown to present, it would be the best marked, and most

certainly verified accordance of any of the nearly positive and deter-

minate ordinary cometic correspondences which are recorded in the list.

Mr. Denning also communicates the following meteor-shower positions as

having escaped notice in some of the other accordances of the list

which are here briefly denoted by their reference Nos., the comet's node,

    Much stress was laid by Mr. Denning and Mr. Greg in two papers
OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  343

read to the Royal Astronomical Society* in Jannary and April last, on
the long-observed duration of some meteor-showers, with stationary
radiant-points. That the centres of divergence of ordinary shooting-
stars in general ocenpy almost fixed positions in the heavens for several
days, or even weeks, together, is indeed conceded by nearly all the observers

who have recorded and discussed their radiant-points. But a much

more strange and extraordinary peculiarity of these showers was believed
to have been noticed by Mr. Denning, that after a first appearance, or
period of prevalence of an ordinary meteor- shower, followed by a lull,
or interval of entire cessation of its action, a radiant-point will again
make its appearance with renewed activity, forming apparently, a repeti-
tion of the original meteor-shower in everything except its date, at an
interval of about three months after its first display. Examples of such
recurrences were traced by Mr. Denning, between August-September and
October-December, between October-December and February-April, and
between April-May and July-August meteor-showers. The end arrived at
hitherto, by continued observations, has been to multiply ceaselessly the
number of new radiant-points, and to discover sub-showers, as tributary
streams in systems which had formerly been held to be thoroughly well
isolated and defined. The multiplicity of radiant-points which thus accu-
mulate from year to year, are chiefly congregated near the meteor-epochs,
of August, November, and April, when it is not unreasonable to expect,
from the numbers which have been recorded, and from the attention
naturally concentrated upon well-known regions of the sky, that fre-
quent repetitions of radiant-points, at intervals of about three months
should, in general, be traceable in different seasons of the year. The
slenderly supported evidences of connection between cometary and
meteor-shower radiant-points, in a multitude of cases where they very

nearly approach each other, is an indication how much chance may have

to do with frequent occurrences of such an apparent resemblance, even
between contemporaneous radiant-points, and in a list of cometary

radiant-points, not unfrequent instances may be selected of recurrences

of identical positions, with periods of one or two, and sometimes of
three or more, months intervening between them. The theoretical
grounds on which the hypothesis of trimestral meteor-showers is shown
to be untenable, were clearly urged, in some apposite remarks appended

to Mr. Denning's paper, by Captain Tupman ; and, indeed, no deep

acquaintance with Physical Astronomy is required, to show that, even if
it should be indubitably established by further observations and re-
searches, no such hypothesis could be derived directly, in the present
state of the science of astronomical perturbations, from any supposed
primitive relation of the orbits or assumed remote or recent origin of
scattered and diffuse, or of still compact and undisintegrated meteor-

showers.

     Of the circum-Perseid showers of August 6th-12th, Mr. Denning also
prepared a list, by pi'ojecting numerous meteors of the periodic dates in
the catalogues of the Italian observers (1872), Heis (1852-72), and von
Konkoly (1871-7G). The positions and numbers of meteors belonging to
each radiant, as collectively determined by one or more of those three

Fine meteors from some of these showers often accompany the Perse'id

display, and will probably be recognised as diverging from certain of

these centres in future observations of the shower.

Mr. Denning has also completed some reductions of various observers'

records of circnm-Leonid and circum-Geminid showers, of which the

following table gives the principal results. All the available meteor-cata-

logues were employed in the reductions.

Mr. Denning draws attention to the long durations shown in this

table, not only of radiant-points in Leo and Leo Minor, quite distinct

(though less apparently so by Schmidt's determination in October) from

the November Leonids                                                                                                    but also of  three  showers in  Cancer,  near  t, /3-;',

and especially near o Cancri, with very fixed radiant-points, as illus-

trating a very commonly occurring peculiarity in such general radiant-

points of shooting-stars, when deduced independently from a variety of

sources. Such a long-continued shower Mr. Denning and Mr. Corder
noted in great activity from July to September, near k Persei (at 47°+ 45°)

distinct from, though very liable to be confused with the Perse'ids.

Close to this shower itself, a series of radiants indeed appears to continue

in prolonged activity from July to December.

With regard to the Taurids of November and December, Mr. Denning

notices that a radiant deduced for December, from the Italian observa-

+tions, (D S. XI, 13, at 64° 15°, 7is), principally marked on December

6th, confirms a subradiant of the showers of Taurids I (60° -f 20°), at

70° + 15° (5js), which he noticed (D'77, 158) between November 25th and

December 13th, 1877, and considers that closer investigation at the end

of November may succeed in distinguishing this new shower from those

Staunton, and endeavoured to sell it. He failed to do so, and threw it

away behind a blacksmith's shop, where it lay several years until it was

used with other loose material to build a stone fence. By reason of its

irregular shape and great weight it soon fell out of the fence, and was
next used by a dentist as an anvil, on which to hammer metal plates,
and for such base purposes as the cracking of nuts ; then it was
again built into a wall round the curbing of a cistern. In 1877 it was
removed to Rochester, IST.Y., and a fragment of it came into Mallet's

possession. It weighs 152 pounds, is 457 cm. in length, and 29'2 cm.

in breadth, and in shape somewkafcresernbles that of a shoulder of mutton.

A sketch of the mass is given in Mallet's paper. The specific gravity of

the iron is 7-688, and the metal when etched, exhibits the Wiedmannstattian

figures "clearly and beautifully." The composition of the iron was

     There can be no doubt that the four specimens found in the same
neighbourhood represent different portions of the same meteoric fall.

     1861, June 28th (June 16t7i,O.S.) 7 a.m. Grosnaja (Grosnja), Banks of
the Terek, Caucasus. Russia*

     Sixteen years ago Abich, who was at the time in Tiflis, sent to Gustav

Rose, in Berlin, a short description of a large fall of meteorites at Grosnaja

on the morning of the above day. The greater number appear to have

fallen into the river Terek ; one fell in the great square in the interior of
the (? Staniza) barrack, entered the ground to the depth of If feet; it

pursued an oblique course through the air, and was distinctly warm when
dug out. The meteorite had the form of a huge hailstone, and was

covered with a black crust.

    Abich, who has taken up his residence in Vienna, placed the stone in
the hands of Professors Tschermak and Ludwig for examination, and the

results of their investigations, together with a detailed report of the
circumstances attending its descent, have been incorporated in the paper
by Professor Tschermak, referred to in the note.

It is stated in the report drawn up by General-Major Kundukof,

military commandant of the Tschetschensk district, that on the night of

the 15th-16th June (O.S.), a barely dark one, there was neither thunder,

wind, nor ram. On Friday, the 16th, the morning was clear and bright

light rain-clouds, which however brought no rain, hung on the western

horizon over the station Mekenskoi, the inhabitants of which were startled

at about seven o'clock by a deafening sound, which continued a long
Aspace of time.

noticed that the sound appeared to come from the west, where the rain-

clouds were, and describes it as resembling that produced when many-

cannon are fired simultaneously, followed by a deafening noise like that

caused by battalion-firing. He observed the fall of one of the stones,

which descended at a low angle, and it was accompanied by lateral bands

of a bluish colour (welcher von Nebenstreifen von blaulicher Farbe

begleitetwar). It fell in the court-yard of a house about two paces distant

Afrom a summer-house, and thirty paces from the bank of the Terek.

soldier's wife, standing on the threshold of the house, drew back in the

greatest alarm as the meteorite struck the ground two paces from her

with all the violence of a bomb-shell, scattering the earth over the wall

Aof the house.      soldier soon probed the hole with a ramrod, and

found at a depth of rather more than a foot fragments of the stone

weighing in all ten pounds. Many heard a second sound, as though the

meteorite burst twice in its descent through the atmosphere, and the

noise attending the fall was observed by persons eight versts distant on

Athe other side of the Terek.    woman who was occupied in washing

clothes, at a spot about 1050 feet distant from the point where the

meteorite struck the ground, heard fragments, which had been detached

by the explosion, fall into the river Terek. The water fizzed just as it

would when brought in contact with a large quantity of heated iron.

The meteorite has a longish rounded form, and has lost the greater

portion of its crust ; in fact, the crust, together with a thin layer of the

enclosed silicate, is very easily removed, and probably dropped off at the

time of the fall. Its actual thickness is much greater than in the case of

the stones which fell at Knyahinya, and about as thick as that of the

Pultusk aerolites.

Professor Tschermak goes on to describe the Vandal treatment to

which the stone was subjected before it reached his house for investigation.

A cast of it had been taken for the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg,

and it had subsequently been sawn in two. It appears, in the first place,

to have been rubbed down with fat, not oil even, and, after the mould was

taken, to have been soaked with potash lye to remove the unctuous layer

the carbonate of potash, which penetrated the porous stone with scarcely

any crust to protect it, next began to effloresce, and the new danger to

which it was exposed had to be compassed by drenching it with water.

It was now ready to pass from the clumsy hands of the modeller to expe-

rience the yet more tender mercies of the lapidary, who, not to be outdone

by his fellow- workman, it is to be conjectured, proceeded to close all the

fissures and lines upon its surface with a black varnish. Long treatment

with alcohol and protracted drying in a steam bath were the next opera-

tions which were made with a view to cleanse it.

   A system of cracks and fissures, arranged like the branches of a tree,

traverses the whole stone, and gives us the impression that they are the

result of the blow which the meteorite received on its fall. The mass of

the stone is brittle, the colour blackish grey with bright points. Thex-e

are many enclosed mineral particles, some almost invisible, others 1 cm.

across, the greater part having a diameter of less than 2 mm. The

matrix is black and opaque even when viewed in a microscopic section,
and many of the enclosed particles are opaque or only translucent in

points. Most of them, however, are transparent, and the majority have

Aa circular or rounded outline.  plate is appended to Tschermak's paper

showing figures of the enclosed minerals. Five distinct ingredients
              OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.         363

could be distinguished. The first is a clear greenish mineral, with in-

complete cleavage along two directions perpendicular to each other, and

Aidentified as olivine.   second in round tough spherules, brownish in

hue and not numerous, with a finely foliated or finely fibrous structure,
was found to be bronzite. Enclosed particles are sometimes made up of

these two minerals, sometimes, but not very frequently, of them together
with a third silicate in long greenish prisms which have the appearance

and angles of augite. The meteorite also contains some magnetic pyrites
(troilite ?), a very little nickel-iron and perhaps a little carbon, to which
the dark hue of the matrix is due.

     Tschermak directs attention to two peculiarities observed in several
chondritic meteorites, and noticeable in this one. The first is the occur-

rence of a crust over the surface of the bronzite spherules, possessing

fibrous structure. This crust is thin, and is distinguished from the

enclosed material by its paler colour ; it has the same fibrous structure,

doubly refractive power, and, in fact, is optically orientated like the en-
closed silicate. It appears to be produced by some agent acting from

without, perhaps heat in conjunction with a reducing gas. The agent

has not caused fusion, but a slight modification of the texture of the sur-

face. The second point which he has observed is the distribution in zones

of the magnetic pyrites in many of the granular enclosed masses. When

a microscopic section is examined by reflected light, it is found that many

are apparently surrounded by a crust of the metallic sulphide, in others

it occupies the centre of the mass in all cases apparently filling up inter-
stices. It seems as if the sulphide had impregnated the rocky mass, and

the absence of all magnetic pyrites in the very compact enclosed particles

and the tough fibrous bronzite chondra, confirms this view. This im-

pregnation Tschermak believes took place after the enclosed mineral

particles attained their present form, and the only explanation which can

be suggested is that this must have happened while the whole tufacious

mass was strongly heated. According to this theory, the enclosed granules

coming in contact with fused magnetic pyrites must have drawn it into

the fine fissures and interstices, in some instances into the cavities of

the granules themselves.

This argues the existence of two definite stages in the formation of

these and similar chondritic structures. First, the production of the

olivinous tuff by the splitting and attrition of the rock when the tougher

particles are rolled and rubbed together till they have a roundish or

spherular form ; and secondly, a subsequent application of heat to the
tuff, accompanied not unfrequently by the reducing action of gases

and vapours.

a small amount of a carbonaceous ingredient, to which, as well as to the

magnetic pyrites, the blackish grey colour of the matrix is probably due.

             Found 1872. Neuntmannsdorf, near Pima, Saxony*

     This mass of meteoric iron was found in 1872, and a superficial ex-
amination of it by Lichtenberger was made in the following year
(' Sitzungsber. der Isis,' Dresden, 1873, p. 4). It is a rounded block of
malleable iron, weighing 25 pounds, and covered with a blackish-brown
crust of oxide. Like the meteoric irons of Ovifak, Disko Island, Green-

land, and many others, it contains chlorine, and in damp warm air rapidly

oxidises and exfoliates. The metal has the grey colour of iron, does not
exhibit the Wiedmann-stattian figures, and has a specific gravity of 6'21.

Geinitz finds the composition of this iron to be

Iron                                      9304
Nickel                                     616
Phosphorus

                                          99-42

     In the iron are many rounded, sometimes elongated, hollows filled

=with a yellowish-brown mineral having the specific gravity 3'98. This

on analysis was found to consist of

Iron                                      63-82
Sulphur                                   37-36

which showed it to be troilite (iron monosulphide), and to accord in
composition with the sulphide found in the meteoric iron of Seelasgen.
One cavity was filled with what appeared to be the same mineral in a
crystalline form. This is the first occasion where troilite has been met
with otherwise than massive.

      --1875, March 31st. Zsaddny, Temesvar Comitat, Banat.\

   We directed attention to the fall of this meteorite in the Report for

the year 1875. Dr. Cohen, of Heidelberg, received some fragments of
the stone from Dr. Babesin, and he has recently published a paper on the
results of the physical and chemical examination of them.

    The crust of the stone has a brownish black colour, and is ^ to \ mm.

in thickness ; it has the appearance as though it had not been subjected
to so intense a heat as that usually developed during the fall of a meteorite.

The finely grained light grey matrix encloses granules of magnetic pyrites
(troilite ?), granules and plates of nickel-iron, and numerous dark grey
crystalline spherules, averaging ^ mm. in diameter ; one little sphere had
a breadth of 3^ mm. They have an excentric-radiate or contorted-radiate

Astructure.    freshly broken surface of the stone is studded with these

chondra, and they are easily removed from the matrix. As regards their

mineralogical aspects, the spherules are found to be of two kinds. One

consists of small prisms of a rhombic mineral which has all the appearance

of a variety of enstatite ; others are found to possess all the properties of
olivine. These two minerals also constitute the greater portion of the

matrix. The augitic mineral occasionally contains opaque granules and

colourless microlites, the olivine pores or cavities, some of which, the

author states, appear to contain fluid. Metallic particles are rarely, if

ever, found in the spherules themselves. An accessory mineral, trans-

parent, pure, and with well-defined edges, is also to be found in the

meteorite. It differs from the rhombic augite in exhibiting no cleavage

fissures, from olivine by the smoothness of its polished exterior, and from

both of them by exhibiting distinct pleochroism with absorption ; one tone

being colourless, the other pale red with a faint tinge of brown. It

appears to be rhombic, and shows a close resemblance to a variety of

hypersthene found by Cohen in a gabbro from South Africa. The Zsadany

stone resembles those which fell on several different occasions at Lance,

Gopalpur, and Pultusk.

By treatment with acid a considerable quantity of the silicate was

decomposed. The analysis of the portions thus separated gave the follow-

ing numbers :

The stone, therefore, appears to consist to the extent of three-fourths

of a bronzite, the remaining fourth being an olivine, in which the equiva-

MgOlents of    : FeO are as3 - 89 : 1, or approximately that which is often

met occurs in meteoric olivines.

     Attention has already been directed to this remarkable fall of aerolites

(see Report for 1876). The total number of stones found is eleven, and
they weigh collectively 34 kilog. Lindstrom finds the total composition

of a portion of one of these stones to be

    1877, May 17th, 7 a.m.--Hungen, between Steinheim and Borsdorf

                                        Provinz, Oberhessen*

    An eye-witness of the fall of one of these meteorites states that, as

he was passing through a wood, on his way from Steinheim to Borsdorf,

he heard a noise as of thunder, although the sky was cloudless, followed
by a humming, hissing, whistling sound, such as would be caused by a
number of stones rapidly rushing among the trees. One stone struck a
pine tree close by him, severed a branch about the thickness of the finger,
and fell at his feet. It was some time before he could convince himself
that the object before him was not alive, but when he at last ventured to
raise it from the ground he found it was cold.

     Buchner visited the locality five months later and found a second stone,
weighing 26 grammes. The first must have weighed more than 86

grammes, and a portion of it weighing 7326 grammes has been deposited

in the mineralogical collection of the University of Giessen. It has an

irregularly triangular and flattened form, and less than one quarter of

the stone has apparently been removed. It should be stated here that

Buchner learned from several who were able to bear witness to the occur-

rence, that the sound attending the descent of the meteorites proceeded

in a direction from N.W. to S.E. The freshly fallen leaves of mid-

October rendered hopeless further search for the other stones which must

have fallen.

The crust of the meteorite is dull black and thin, and exhibits here

and there granules of nickel-iron. The fractured surface displays a grey,

occasionally brownish, matrix, which is traversed by a very thin but very

conspicuous brilliant black band of material ; it runs obliquely to the

flattened side of this stone, and is also found in the smaller mass, picked up

five months later, which evidently never formed part of a larger meteorite.

On another part of the fractured surface of the larger stone, a second

black line, parallel to the first, but less brilliant, is to be seen. Abundant

particles of nickel-iron and troilite are met with; and the crust appears to

consist, to the extent of one-half, of the metallic alloy. Examination under

the microscope shows the ground mass to be colourless and transparent

and to be fissured in every direction. It appears to consist of olivine. Some

olivine spherules are quite conspicuous, surrounded either by the black

material or nickel-iron ; other chondra have a banded or radiate structure,

like those observed by Tschermak in the aerolites of Shergotty or Gopalpur,

and appear to be bronzite ; and lastly, there are spherules of a homogeneous
grey translucent substance, devoid of or rarely traversed by fissures.

Buchner states that the meteorite of Hungen, while a member of the
most common class of meteorites, can easily be distinguished from those

which fell at Agen, Girgenti, New Concord, Kuyahinya, Krakenberg,

Pultusk, and many others which he mentions.

The smaller stone was presented to the Vienna Collection, and forms

the subject of a few notes by Tschermak in an appendix to Buchner's paper.

He describes its characters, which nearly approach those of the Pultusk

meteorites. The black crust has the unusual thickness of 1*5 mm., and

encloses particles of nickel-iron, granules of magnetic pyrites (troilite?),

and even lustreless chondra, which may consist of chromite or picotite.

The transparent minerals constituting the chief mass of the stone are of

three kinds : 1. Olivine, recognised by its rectangular cleavage and few

included minerals, and by its contributing but little to the chondritic

character of the stone ; 2. Bronzite, in granules and aggregated crystals,

showing a prismatic cleavage, the latter being either barred or radiate, or

contorted and forming the greater number of the  chondra                                        and  3.  Diallage,
                                                                                             ;

for such Tschermak believes to be a brown mineral, forming angular

fragments, which are found not to be rhombic and to resemble an augite.
The chromite occurs in granules and in larger crystals than are met
with in other meteorites.

This interesting stone has not yet been analysed.

--1877, June. Cronstadt, Orange River Free State, South Africa.

     All that I have yet been able to gather respecting this occurrence is,
that a shower of stones fell near Cronstadt in June last, in a wooded

district, so that few of them could be collected. One of them is preserved
in the British Museum.

--1877, October 13th, about 2 p.m. Soko-Banja, N.E. of Alexinatz, Servia.*

                  [Long. 20° 53' E. of Greenwich ; Lat. 43° 38' N.]

Doll's paper, which appears in the ' Transactions of the Austrian

Geological Society,' contains two descriptions of the fall of meteorites at

Soko-Banja, drawn from two different sources. The first, taken from the

Servian weekly literary journal, ' Javor,' published at Neusatz, is written

by an eye-witness of the occurrence, who states that the 13th October

was fine, and the sky clear, and that about two in the afternoon a noise as

of thunder was heard resembling batteries of cannon firing briskly. The

sound was followed by a violent concussion of the air, and then a number

of aerolites were strewn over the adjacent region. One, weighing 10

okas (22^ Austrian pounds), fell in front of a house in Soko-Banja, and
was driven deep into the earth ; a second, which touched the ground at

Scherbanowaz, near the Rtanj Berg, weighed 30 okas (G7^ Austrian

pounds), and is the largest mass which was collected. The peasants at

Rtanj state that one which fell in that locality was of the size of a sack

of flour, and that by striking against the rocky surface it was dashed to

fragments. From the second and later report, provided by Ritter von

Stefanowitsch, of an inquiry instituted by some scientific men from

Belgrade, it appears that two explosions, like salvoes of artillery, were

heard, accompanied by a brilliant display of light such as attends the

Abursting of shells.  dense black smoke was observed at a considerable

altitude, which broke up into three columns, and gradually changed to a

white smoke. The noise lasted for some time, and then the sound re-

sembled the firing of musketry. The air appeared to be shaken. Soon

after the explosion commenced a number of meteorites fell to the ground

over an area a mile and a half in length and half a mile in breadth.

The following masses have been collected :

1. One, weighing 23 okas, fell in the village Scherbanowaz, and

penetrated the soil to the depth of four feet. (This is the one mentioned

in · Javor.')

     2. One, weighing 15 okas, fell near the vineyard at Soko-Banja, and
reached a depth of three feet. This appears not to be the mass referred

to in ' Javor.'

3. Two stones found at Blandija.

A4. fragment, weighing 2 okas, was found at Prevalac.
A5. meteorite of small size fell at Gradic (Prevalac and Gradic are

hamlets, west of and close to Soko-Banja).

   A6. number of pieces of various sizes fell at Dugopolje, and several

very small stones are reported to have fallen on the Djeviza Planina.

One fragment, 2 okas in weight, fell on a pear tree, and then de-

scended  to  the  ground                                    a  man who was  under  the  tree  took  it  in  his

hands, and received the impression that the mass was still warm.

The meteorites were sent to the Natural History Museum at Belgrade.

Doll's paper contains two little maps indicating the area over which the

stones were strewn. He describes a small specimen which came into his

possession : the matrix is bluish grey and compact, enclosing spherules

which vary in size from that of a millet-seed to that of a hare-shot, and

which project from the fractured surface. But little nickel-iron or

magnetic pyrites (troilite?) could be seen. He noticed patches of a

brown colour, which he considers characteristic of this meteorite.

      Losanitch, in his communication to the Berlin Chemical Society,
which appeared subsequently, states an interval of 25 seconds elapsed
between the appearance of the meteor and the first explosion, which was
followed by two others. The explosion occurred at an altitude of 7000

metres. The path of the meteor made an angle of 220° 50' with the
magnetic meridian, and followed a course from N.E. to S.W., with a
very rapid descent. The track of the meteor has been calculated by
Kleritj, and the details are to be found in ' Glasnik,' the journal of a

Servian learned society. He makes the entire weight of the stones,

whole and in fragments, to weigh 80 kilog.

     All the meteorites are coated with a black rough vitreous crust,

0*5 mm. in thickness, exhibiting numerous depressions. The interior

consists of spherules of various sizes, some brown, some yellow, cemented
together by an ash-grey material, and presents the appearance of a

trachytic lava. In polished sections, prepared for microscopic examina-

tion, nickel-iron in granules, hackly fragments and filiform particles are
to be recognised. The specific gravity of the meteorite is 3'502. The

meteorite consists of

                                                      Coblentz*

   A correspondent of the ' Coblenzer Zeitung,' dating from " Hohr,

27th December," writes that ou the preceding day two meteorites fell
near the road leading to the former frontier, in the direction of Bal-
lendar, and that the fall was attended by a very characteristic explo-
sion. The editor of the above journal has been unable to gather any
further particulars of the occurrence beyond the fact that the stones fell

in a wood, and could not be discovered.

General Directions, and Instructions to Observers, for Recording Meteors
                                              and Aerolites.

    Much industrious labour and attention has of late years been bestowed

by experienced and eminent astronomers on collecting and discussing
meteor observations, and on deducing from them a great variety of very
important astronomical conclusions. Materials of constantly increasing
interest have in consequence accumulated somewhat rapidly in recent
years towards the extension and development of the astronomical theory
of these bodies, a clear and exact exposition of which, dealing only with
the most positively ascertained and clearly established features of their
history, would here be too wide and extensive a subject to be properly
discussed at length. The astronomical problem of their origin, which is
set before us by the appearances of meteors of the most dissimilar
descriptions, is naturally too extensive and too diversified a question to be
included in a single theory, or to admit of only a single explanation ; and

it is not at present so much to the causes and to the origin of their

occurrence that it is desired to direct particular attention, as to the best

means of observing and describing accurately the various notable appear-
ances which they present, and to the most convenient and effective
 methods to be followed for preserving useful records of their ordinary

 and extraordinary exhibitions.

     The phenomena of luminous meteors may be comprehended, in the

 first instance, under the leading titles or descriptions of a few general and
 appropriate designations (long since introduced, and still very con-
 venient to rate and record them by distinctly, although not completely
 and sufficiently), for the immediate practical purposes of their registra-

as either

I. Telescopic meteors, only rendered visible to the eye by the aid of

telescopes
                                                      ;

different apparent magnitudes of the fixed stars in bright-

III. Bolides and Fireballs, or very luminous meteors, comparable in.

brilliancy to the planets Jupiter and Venus, and to the dif-

ferent phases of the moon, and sometimes even rivalling the

sun by appearing with much splendour in broad daylight

the term Bolides being usually applied to the smaller, and

             Fireballs to the larger kinds
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

IV. Detonating, or "Aerolitic" meteors, fireballs which produce an

audible explosion, like a distant cannon's, a peal of thunder,

or an earthquake's shock, by their concussion with the air
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

and which differ accordingly from the last (as "forked " light-

ning often does from distant or " sheet " lightning) only by the

thunderclap that not unfrequently reverberates from fireballs

of the largest and brightest class                                                                                                                         or finally as

V. Stonefalls and Ironfalls (the latter very rare occurrences), or the

falls of meteorites, either singly or in a shower, it may be, of
many thousands of fragments from a fireball, which, especially

if seen in the daytime when these occurrences are usually

observed, is almost always a large meteor of the last-named

description.

     For each of these different kinds of apparitions it is necessary to
furnish separate and somewhat independent directions and instructions

to enable good and useful accounts of their phenomena to be pre-

served.

I. Telescopic meteors are not unfrequently noticed during astronomical

observations                                                          and some singular records of the occurrence of such                                                                                               bodies
                                                                   ;

byday and by night in dense showers have been placed on record. The

if possible to observe its spectrum, if it is of sufficient brightness and

duration.

     As it has been contended that telescopic meteors are rendered visible

by optical power at vastly greater distances from observers than ordinary

shooting-stars can be seen, and that their apparent speeds and lengths of

path are, under these circumstances, greatly reduced by distance and

rendered inferior to those of the majority of meteors, observations of

small telescopic meteors with short slow courses, if they occur, should be

carefully recorded, in order to determine if they are principally seen at

low apparent altitudes, and moderate real heights only, or with equal

frequency at all angular altitudes above the horizon, and therefore at all

possible heights above the earth's surface to which the use of astronomi-

cal telescopes of the highest powers and apertures enables us to extend

our sight.

     II. Shooting-stars are observable with a certain frequency on all cloud-

less nights. The result of an attentive watch on such occasions to note

their frequency by a few hours' observation, especially if in the absence of

the  moon,  is  of  great  value                            but the  fitful                                                                                                                                                                                                  activities  of many  meteor

showers often combine together to render a rate of frequency concluded

from a single hour's observations deceptive and misleading ; and atten-
tion must be paid to noting the middle-time of the watch to the nearest

quarter of an hour, as upon its lateness in the night, as well as on the
season of the year, depends the average horary number which a single

observer may expect to see.

     In comparison with that of an evening hour at six o'clock, the

number visible in the same morning hour is about double, and nearly as

notably greater for a midnight hour in August or September, than for one

in February or March. For an average midnight hour in the whole year,

Quetelet estimated the horary number visible to one observer in a
European station as about six meteors ; and a greater number than

twelve or fifteen meteors seen in an hour at an average time of night

and season of the year, may be regarded (though not certainly) as indi-

cating an active exhibition of some special meteor shower. It is to the

prominency which such exceptional phenomena sometimes reach as

meteoric spectacles, that the distinction which has arisen between shower

meteors and sporadic shooting- stars is entirely owing; and from the

partial extent of our present acquaintance with the directions, intensities,

and durations of multitudes of weaker descriptions of such showers, in-
numerable shooting-stars must still be regarded as " sporadic " until well-

determined centres from which they appear to diverge accurately can

be definitely assigned to them.

     To note and reduce shower meteors to their radiant-points is a task of

little difficulty to an observer already conversant with the positions of the

principal fixed stars, and of the constellations. But the use of star charts

properly adapted for projecting meteor- paths soon familiarises unpractised

observers with this preliminary preparation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and facility is soon acquired

in drawing upon a map the initial and end-points of a meteor's track, and

in prolonging through these points a straight line backwards on the

map, or tracing, to show by a simple inspection of a number of these
lines their common crossing point, or the focus of emanation of the meteor

shower that they belong to, in the sky. The natural impressions of

direction are of slender use in endeavouring to fix this point correctly by

the eye alone, retracing the meteor's track among the stars themselves ; a

straight wand held up to direct it, soon assuring an observer that the eye
without an assistance of this kind is a very fallacious guide. But by

using for the picture of the stars the same principles of plane perspective

representation which are used habitually for pictures of ordinary objects,

the straight wand and the straight path of the meteor in the sky when
drawn upon the map are also straight lines, and may be prolonged, not
only with greater ease to other parts of the map than in the sky, but also

by a pencil they may be marked indelibly upon the page or sheet, so that

comparison with many successive lines thereupon becomes not a doubtful

and uncertain, but an easy and perfectly unerring operation. In accord-
ance with the most recent practice of Herr von Konkoly, of Komorn, 'in

Hungary, as well as of the late Professor Heis, the Committee has pre-

pared celestial charts in plane perspective, with whose assistance the posi-

tions of the centres of departure of different meteor showers can be easily

vei'ified and investigated by observers, and farther particulars regarding

their intensities and durations may be ascertained.

    As a guide for the selection of meteor showers for special study, the
Committee refers observers to the Key Map and General Catalogue of all

such known meteor systems published by the British Association in the

volume of its Annual Reports for the year 1876, by Mr.  Greg                            where the
                                                                                     ;

relative importance, as resulting from the richness and constancy of meteor-

showers, in returning at the annual epochs of their visibility is stated

and represented. The principal characteristics of the meteors, including

their colour and brightness, the apparent lengths, speeds, and durations of

their nights, and the presence of sparks or streaks in their tracks, have

hitherto been very little noted, and such peculiarities belonging to the

showers, as well as their dates of principal abundance, and the exact

positions of their radiant points, form very important and interesting

subjects of inquiry.

The observation of sporadic shooting-stars is necessarily less attractive-

and suitable to ordinary observers than mapping the apparent paths of
meteors belonging either to the well-known major and " special " or to

some minor annual meteor showers. But as regards the observations,

the method of procedure is the same, with the exception that long-con,-

tinued watches maintained for a whole night are, in general, indispensable

to a successful collection of their tracks by a single observer. Should

no indications of a new shower accidentally occur by unusual frequency

of meteors from a new radiant-point in evening watches of a single
night, yet the detection of such a shower is no uncommon recompense of

an observer's vigilance in a morning watch, or among the meteor-tracks

recorded on a few successive nights. As the same remark applies to the

accidental vision of bolides and fireballs, the same instructions will

suffice, and the same course may be pursued most advantageously by

observers in recording sporadic shooting-stars as in describing large

meteors  that may  be  occasionally  observed ;  and  these in the                      next para -

graph will be more fully indicated and described.

III. Bolides and Fireballs have the singularity among meteors, and the

pre-eminence over shooting-stars of attracting the attention of a great

number of observers. This is also the case with meteor showers when

they are sufficiently abundant to lead to general observations and to con-

clusive determinations of their radiant-points, although poor and scanty

showers escape this identification for lack of a sufficient number of

observations. As, however, by the displacement of his point of view, a

fireball seen by every new observer appears to him in a different part of

the sky, or virtually as another meteor, it follows that both for fireballs

and for very scanty meteor showers the multiplication of observers of

the phenomenon by increasing the number of meteor tracks belonging to

the same radiant-point, suffices, when they are sufficiently exact and

numerous, to fix its place exactly, and to determine the direction from

which the meteor shower or the fireball took its flight. Exactness in

describing a fireball's apparent path by the stars or otherwise is the more

desirable and important, because no doubt exists that any tico such re-

corded appearances of its path must belong to the same meteor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               and that,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

therefore, when prolonged backwards to their intersection, if they are

fairly accurate they will be sufficient by themselves to point out its

radiant-point or the direction and distant origin of its real course with

satisfactory precision. But even a dozen meteors of a poor and scanty

star-shower only afford presumptive evidence of their having a common

direction and radiant-point at the centre of divergence of their tracks,

as scarcely any other evidence but this divergence, in general, exists of

their belonging to a common system ; and to increase its probability a
fresh number of meteors of the same shower must be noted, and must be

traced back to the same centre of divergence. Observations of sporadic

shooting-stars must, therefore, be greatly multiplied (however accurate

they may be), while two accurate observations only of a fireball are

absolutely necessary to determine the exact direction, together with the

height and distance, and the other particulars of its flight. This fortunate

concurrence of two or more simultaneous observations is sometimes

recorded of a shooting-star ; and then the real direction of this meteor

is as certainly determined as that of a fireball, and the orbit of either

(which is the sole clue that we can gain to its astronomical history) is
known as certainly as the orbit of a meteor stream. But such accuracy

of observation as would allow us to depend upon two observations only

is seldom, if ever, reached by observers, either of shooting-stars or fire-

balls, and of the latter class of meteors especially, many scores of accounts

are annually indited by unpractised observers, containing no material

data (or only conflicting ones) of the meteors' courses, while the

accordant notes occasionally furnished of shooting-stars by well-skilled

observers show the difficulty, if not the hopelessness, of arriving by two

observations at anything approaching to the accuracy of instrumental

determinations. With rare exceptions, therefore, a large and abundant

collection of observations is needful for exact comparisons, which it is the

object of the Luminous Meteor Committee appointed for this purpose by

the British Association to obtain, by providing observers with suitable

forms of registry, maps, and instructions for recording the appearances

of fireballs and ordinary shooting-stars. The Committee distributes to

observei's who apply for them printed Forms of Registry and Directions,

as the most convenient and efficient means of assisting them in systematic

observation. For the best means of noting and describing exactly the

appearances of large meteors the Committee also directs attention to a

letter in the ' Scotsman ' (daily newspaper) of May 1st, 1878, by Professor

Herschel, from the full paragraphs of which, pointing out the features

of position and appearance to be recorded, it is not necessary to repro-

duce here a long series of appropriate suggestions, as instructions for

recording large meteors and ordinary shooting-stars will be found

sufficiently illustrated in the Committee's printed Forms of Registry and

     IV. Detonating, or Aiiwlitic Fireballs.--In recording observations on

the passage of a meteor across the sky, the points which it is most desir-
able to arrive at are : such data as will allow of our definitely noting the
direction of its path and its point of extinction, the duration of the
luminous phenomenon, and of individual phases of it, the apparent mag-

nitude of the meteor, the luminosity as compared with other brilliant

objects, and the changes which it may itself exhibit in this respect

during the transit, the duration of the train (or " streak "), and the changes

it may undergo before extinction (whether it fade away simultaneously

along  the entire length, or  break up  into  a  chain  of  luminous  fragments)
                                                                                                                          ;

also,°in cases where the streak is one of great persistence, the manner of

its final disappearance ; again, when the meteor has been observed near

the time of sunrise, or sunset, what change it wrought in the appearance
of the visible train by the increasing, or waning, light of the sky. The

sound attending its passage, if any, and the character of the sound, a,s

regards intensity and duration, whether single and well defined, or a series

ofminor explosions closely following one another. And finally, the time

of appearance, and that of the interval before the explosion is heard.

     While it is barely possible for one observer to record all the data

referred to, he should not fail to note such of them as may have come
clearly within his observation. Other spectators may have remarked
what he may have missed, and their joint observations may enable us to

arrive at a complete physical history of the meteor in question.

  --It is desirable to determine two. points of the track of the meteor, as

far asunder as possible the points of appearance and extinction are to

be preferred--and to indicate the former by reference to some star or
constellation which it overlies, and the latter by some object on the

horizon against which it is projected. In cases where the meteor is seen
in daytime, the data to be arrived at are the point of appearance and its

angular altitude. The former may be estimated by noticing what con-

spicuous object lies vertically below it on the horizon: a village or a

mountain peak. The more distant the object is from the spectator, the

more accurate will be the determination of this element of the observation.

If objects to which reference can be made should be wanting, the

direction may be temporarily noted, and subsequently determined by the

aid of a compass-needle. To learn an angular altitude we dare not

trust general conclusions, however carefully arrived at ; even experienced

observers may be misled in such cases. If a vertical object, say the roof

of a house, ' or the top of a tree, happen to lie in the direction under

consideration, the observer should approach it till the line of sight of the

origin of the course of the meteor skirts the summit of the terrestrial

object. The observer has now to determine how far he is removed from

the object selected, its vertical height above the plain on which both are

situated, and the distance above the ground of his own eye, in order to

be in a position to determine the angular elevation of the point of

appearance of the meteor, the position of which he desires to ascertain.
376 report-- 1878.

     The apparent path of the meteor is often represented by a line like a
bow : in other words, the meteor apparently ascends, culminates, and
then takes a downward course. This motion is, however, for the most
part, as has been stated, apparent only ; and is a consequence of the
varying inclination which a straight line appears to form with the
horizon at different points along its course. The observer should endea-
vour to determine as accurately as possible the apparent inclination at
those points of the meteor's arc, or line of flight, which can be most
readily identified, such as the beginning and the end of the track, or
those where a break in the luminous train occurs, as well as that portion
which lies parallel to the horizon. The point of extinction should
especially be noted, and this is the more readily accomplished from the
fact that the attention has been steadily directed to observing the
luminous phenomena preceding it. In regard to the point of appearance,
it is of importance to determine whether the impression made on the
observer was that he had witnessed the blazing forth of the meteor in the
sky, or whether the meteor had entered his field of vision, and a portion
of its luminous track had not been seen by him.

     It is, moreover, of importance to arrive at a knowledge of the length

of time occupied by the meteor in traversing the sky ; this may some-

times be learned by counting the ticks of a watch, or by advancing in
the direction of the object at a uniform rate, and counting the paces
taken during the observation. It should also be noted whether the
meteor moves onward with an accelerating or diminishing velocity.

     The brilliancy of a meteor larger than the fixed stars of different mag-
nitudes can most conveniently be compared with the light of Venus
or Jupiter ; and in the case of the largest meteors, with the apparent
brilliancy and magnitude of the moon in her several phases. The
colour exhibited by the meteor should also be carefully observed, and
any change of hue along any part of the path should be recorded. The
luminous train left after the disappearance of the meteor is sometimes

very persistent, and often terminates in a cloud, faintly visible. Any

peculiar structure exhibited by the train, or cloud, should be sketched on

paper.

     The sound attending the flight of a meteor usually consists either of
several distinct explosions, or a crackling rolling detonation. The

closest attention should be given, after the extinction of the meteor, for
the arrival of the sound and the length of the interval, carefully noted
with the watch.

     Of the many points which, as has been shown, it is desirable that a

record should be made, an individual observer can obviously determine
but a few ; all those of them, however, to the accuracy of which he can

certify, are of value, since other observers may supply the missing data,
and the whole may be collected.

where it struck the ground, and examine the hole which it has formed.
Determine the .depth, and especially notice the direction of the cavity in
respect to the points of the compass. Ascertain whether the meteorite
was removed from the ground soon after its descent, and whether any
observation had been made at the time respecting its temperature.

Make a note of the material forming the surface layer, and state whether

to the discovery of other meteorites which had fallen at the same time,

shower of stones have fallen some miles asunder, such partially altered

surfaces should be fitted' together, in order to see whether they form

portion of a larger mass. The fall of a light chocolate-brown substance,

resembling amadou, enclosing little brilliant particles of meteoric iron,

may accompany the fall of meteoric stones.

Sixth Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir John Lubbock,

   Bart, Professor Pkestwich, Professor Busk, Professor T. McK.
   Hughes, Professor W. B. Dawkins, Professor Miall, Eev. H. W.
   Crosskey, Mr. H. C. Sorby, and Mr. E. H. Tiddeman, appointed

   for the purpose of assisting in the Exploration of the Settle

   Caves ( Victoria Cave). Brawn up by Mr. K. H. Tiddeman

    (Reporter).

Tour Committee have to report that the Settle Local Committee, with

whom they have the pleasure of co-operating, have spent in the course of

the year, from September 3rd, 1877, down to the end of June of this year
(1878), 169Z. 19s. 10d, of which sum 100Z. was granted by the Association
at the Plymouth Meeting. The remainder of the money has been raised
by private subscriptions. At the request of the Settle Committee Sir John
Lubbock has kindly consented to be Chairman of the Local Committee in
succession to the late Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth.

     The work has gone on nearly all the year from September 3rd,

1877, with few and very short intermissions. On the 22nd of June of
this year owing to the failure of our funds we found it necessary to dis-
continue for a time. Fortunately as it was haytime the workmen could

leave without detriment to themselves. Later on, as the result of an

appeal made, a little money came in and we were able to take the men

back again near the end of July.
     The Committee have to make this year an important announcement,

the correction of a considerable bnt unavoidable error. It is contained
in the following communication from Professor Busk to the Secretary.
--378 beport 1878.

                                                                      32, Harley Street, August 8th, 1878.

  --My dear Tiddeman, I received from Toulouse two ursine Fibulae, of

abnormal size, which in the part corresponding to the "fragment of con-
tention " so closely resemble it, as to leave little room for doubt that the

latter is, or may be, in reality ursine and not human.
    I am disposed, therefore, to acknowledge that my diagnosis of the

Victoria Cave bone was in all probability erroneous, and that, so far as

such an imperfect witness can testify, the preglacial existence of man must

rest upon other evidence.

    I am nnable to leave town for the Dublin Meeting, but shall be glad if
you will make my change of opinion in this matter known. In returning

the Victoria specimen I will also send one of the Toulouse bones, which

are very remarkable, and as regai'ds size widely different from any I have

before seen ; and with relation to their size it is to be remembered that

in your Collection* is one of the largest ursine crania (of the ferox type)

with which I am acquainted.
                                                  With kind regards,

                                                                   Yours very truly,

                                                                               George Bcsk.

     It will be remembered that this bone was found by Professor Busk and
Mr. James Flower to bear the strongest possible resemblance to a rather
abnormal recent human fibula in the Museum of the College of Surgeons,
and was also considered not unlike the fibula in the famous Mentone

Skeleton. It was, therefore, considered an undeniable proof of the exis-

tence of man with the extinct mammals in Yorkshire. Professor Dawkins

supported Professor Busk and Mr. James Flower in this determination,'!'
but we must also add that he was the first to express doubts about it, and
further inquiries and examination instituted by him and Professor Busk
lead your Committee to the conclusion that any arguments based upon its
supposed human character must unreservedly be given up. If it bear an
equally good resemblance to abnormal ursine and human fibulae, it is
clearly not a sufficient foundation upon which to build any views as to
the existence, or non-existence, of man at a remote period.

     In stating this we desire to call especial attention to the fact that this

bone is not the only one found in the Victoria Cave which can be supposed
to have a bearing on the antiquity of man, and his existence in Britain
before the last great cold period had passed away in the North of England.

Many bones found in the Cave cracked and split, as savages split them,

for the extraction of marrow, have been very properly passed by as at best
very doubtful evidence, such fractures possibly owing their existence to
falls of rock upon bones lying on the floor beneath. But we cannot so
easily explain away the evidently artificial marks upon the two small bones
found in the Hyena-bed, and already referred to at length in the postscript

to last year's Report (pp. 218-220).

    Nor even were this evidence to be got over, can we rightly lay aside

the arguments founded on Physical Geology which result from the facts

--partly obtained in the Victoria Cave Exploration. They are these 1. The

existence of certain areas in the North of England where there is abun-
dant evidence of land glaciation of a comparatively late age. In the river-
deposits of these areas the earlier pleistocene mammals are never found

in the open country, and they are equally remarkable for the absence of

palaeolithic implements, although we know that the same mammals, if not

palaeolithic men, have overrun that ground. 2. The existence of other

areas in the South and East where there are not distinct traces of so late

a land-glaciation, but where the remains of the same animals and ot

palaeolithic implements are abundant in the river-gravels in the open, as

Wewell as in the caves.  can hardly suppose that this contrast in the

two areas can be due to the same destructive powers of nature working

with greater intensity in one than in the other, and we are brought to the

conclusion that an agent was at work in the one area which did not

time, did it not happen that the areas bereft of the remains are precisely

those which show the freshest and most extensive traces of land-

glaciation.

remarkable as it consists of exceedingly fine and beautifully laminated
clay, and this high dip is most regular through a considerable distance,
and not only close to the fallen blocks, where it might be thought to have
been produced by their fall. Some of this clay is exceedingly black,

and may possibly be, therefore, derived from the dark Yoredale Shales
overlying the Mountain Limestone, which at the period when the clay was
formed probably covered a much greater area, and nearer to the Cave, than

that which they occupy at present.

     Your Committee is of opinion that, though the labours of the year
have brought us but a small interest for our money, as compared with the
results of former years, the undertaking may be an improving one, and
eventually, if persevered iu, lead to greater results than any lately obtained
by us, and therefore your Committee beg to be reappointed.

     One member of the Committee, Professor W. 13. Dawkins, requests

that his dissent from this Report be distinctly recorded.

Report of a Committee, consisting of Mr. Godwin-Austen, Professor

     Prestwich, Mr. Davidson, Mr. Etiieridge, Mr. Willett, and

     Mr. TorLEY, appointed for the purpose of assisting the Kentish

    Boring Exploration. Drawn up by Mr. Godwin-Austen.

1 REGRET to have to report that during the past year nothing whatever

has been done to warrant an application for anj* portion of the grant

placed at the disposal of the " Kentish Boring Exploration," the more so

as results have been arrived at by private enterprise which certainly

--give the information sought for namely, whether Palaeozoic rocks, and

what might next underlie the chalk formation of some part of the S.E.

of England, as is the case in Belgium and the North of France.

So soon as it was ascertained that at the corner of Tottenham Court

Road and Oxford Street there occurred characteristic upper Devonian

strata at about 1000 feet from the surface, the whole question, and all

that it involves, seemed to be answered, and the supposition of the report

of the Coal. Commission, which as far back as 1871 had indicated the line

of the Thames Valley as that of the course of the said Palaeozoic band,

was proved to be correct.* One single point remained in doubt,

--namely in which direction from the end of Tottenham Court Road

may the mountain-limestone and coal-measure formations be looked for ?

It may be asked, why is it to be certainly inferred that any such sequence

Aobtains at Tottenham.  satisfactory answer, from our acquaintance-

with the physical and geological history of the European area, in early

times, can be given to this.

     The so-called " Devonian " is not in any sense a distinct formation,

except in respect of priority of deposition ; it is simply an early stage of
a series which in progress of time, and over a corresponding area, passed

on to what is known as the " Mountain-limestone series." Across the-

whole of Central Europe the order of succession of this upper Palaeozoic

--series is the same namely, 1st, lower carboniferous or Devonian ; 2ndly,

    * P. 432, qu. 267. " (Mr. Prestwich) : You would be disposed then to carry the
line of probable coal -measures under the valley of the Thames. Answer: Yes," &e.

carboniferous limestone proper ; 3rdly, coal-measures. Whenever one of

these occurs the others follow, excepting where, as in places, the coal-

measures may have been denuded off, or where this may have happened

to the mountain-limestone also.

The angle which the Devonian strata at Tottenham make with the

vertical bore-hole being 30°, it is to be inferred that their general direc-

tion there is east and west.

     The highly inclined position of these Devonian beds was important.

--Had it been otherwise had the beds there been found to be lying
--horizontally the prospect would not have been encouraging ; the two

members of the series above the Devonian might be supposed to have

been denuded off, or to follow in sequence only at some distance

horizontally.

The upper Palasozoic group was not disturbed as we now find it till

after the completion of the coal-measures. This holds good from West-

phalia, across Belgium, and the North of France, and again in the west

of our British area. The preservation of available coal-measures along

this line is dependent on their having been enclosed in deep troughs, the

results of that east and west linear system of foldings and crumplings to
which the whole of this group was subjected. Hence it is that a Devonian

limestone reached in the course of such east and west line, and at a high

angle (30°), implies, first, that the said band of disturbed, strata passes

along at that spot, and next that the order of sequence is pretty sure to

be regular and complete there. In other words, the Devonian beds come
down upon at the Tottenham boring may be safely taken as a continu-

ation of the band which crosses Belgium and the North of France, and are

followed as the band is there by the mountain-limestone and coal-measure

series in a deep east and west fold or trough.

  --One more point remains to be ascertained What is the direction

of the dip of the Devonian beds of Tottenham boring ? and then any
one of the numerous sections which the Belgian and French geologists

have given of their coal- measure band may be taken as a guide as to what

has happened here ; of these, that of the Boulonnais is the best, because
nearest. Supposing that it could have been ascertained with perfect

certainty that the iuclined beds at Tottenham were dipping north, the in-

ference would be that there they had come down on the southern side

of a Palasozoic trough, and that the mountain-limestone series would follow

next. The thickness of this series in the Boulonnais may be taken at about

400 feet                                     and the coal-measure-band                   would  come in at about a quarter of
                                          ;

a mile or less from the corner of Oxford Street.

On the contrary, had the dip been southerly, then the productive coal-

band would occur between Oxford Street and the Thames.

It has been already stated that a single point remains to be ascertained,

and the object of the present communication is to show how and where

that is to be sought for. First, there must be another boring, and next it

must be so near to that at Messrs. Meux's that one may illustrate the

other, and so show the dimensions and positions of the Palasozoic bands

beneath London                                                                           for this purpose the distance from Oxford Street ought
                                                                                      ;

not to be more than a quarter of a mile to the north or south.

The Tottenham boring properly considei'ed suggests that the Franco-

Belgian Palasozoic band with which coal is associated is continued under

London, and is within the narrow limits assigned above. Should such

be really the case, it is not supposed that in any such position it could be
--382 report 1878.

made available ; the object of completing tbe results arrived at by Messra.
Meux is to add to our knowledge of the structure of the whole of the
band at that place. This would lead us to the direction in which it should
be followed both east and west.

      Considering the vast importance of the discovery of productive coal-
measures from the S.E. of England westwards, both with reference to the

present high price of that article in the metropolis and to the many in-

dustries to which it would give rise along its whole course, of which

the line of country from Liege to Douai may serve as an illustration,
the time has come when the results so nearly arrived at at Tottenham

should be completed.

     Half the money spent upon the Sub-Wealden researches at Netherfield

--would long since have settled the theoretical speculation that the coal-

measures might be found along the line of the Thames Valley. No blame

is imputed to the promoters of the boring. During the inquiry of the

"Coal Commission," 1871, much discredit was thrown upon the supposition
of an extension of the Franco-Belgian coal band into our S.E. region by

the chairman, Sir R. Murchison (see p. 429, and reply of Mr. Dickinson *
as to the quality of the Boulonnais coal ; also the evidence of Sir R. Mur-
chison, p. 434, and following).

    As bearing on Sir R. Murchison's objection, which may be succinctly

stated to be, that the formations with which the coal-measures are asso-
ciated do not cross the Channel, and that, if they do, the coal that they
would contain would be worthless, no better than that of the Boulonnais,

I would quote from a recent work of the Abbe N. Boulay,t who refers

the Boulonnais coal to his upper category or bituminous coal.

Probably four-fifths of the area of permeable rocks in the first list would
yield unpolluted water, and would receive into their mass not less than ten
to fifteen inches annually, or a quantity, if six inches only were yielded up
in wells, of no less than 240,000 gallons per day for each square mile of

surface, and in many districts double this quantity, giving a total for
England and Wales far in excess of that required for drinking and manu-

facturing purposes.

     Of the Moorland area it is hardly the province of your Committee to

speak, but they cannot but call attention to the costly legislation that all
extensive gravitation schemes incur, whether taken from natural lakes,
as the proposed Thirlmere scheme for Manchester, or from artificial reser-
voirs, as the proposed supply for Liverpool from the sources of the Severn
and they would call attention to the fact that the Select Committee on

 the Manchester Corporation Water Bill recognised the importance of the
opinion expressed by the Duke of Richmond's Commission in 1868-69,
 " That it appears to ns that the Legislature should always jealously watch
 any proposal for a town taking water from a gathering ground at a
 distance from it, lest by so doing it may deprive other places neai'er to
 such gathering ground of their more natural source of supply."

      Cases doubtless exist, to meet which it will be necessary to go to these
 sources, especially where the populations have been accustomed to soft
 water, and it would be dangerous to suddenly change the character of the
 supply. But in the Midland districts, lying on the Secondary rocks, the
 inhabitants are accustomed to hard water, the quality of which the labours

of your Committee prove might be made, by an efficient system of well-
boring, all that could be desired.

     Professor Hull has described from time to time the marked south-
easterly attenuation of the Triassic and other lower secondary strata, and
has given measurements, from which it appears the beds between Liverpool
and Warwick, 100 miles, thin out the following rates per mile :

        These red beds are absent at Meux's brewery, where beneath 160
   feet of gault occurs the well-known Ammonite interruptus zone, six
   inches ; limestone, 4 feet 6 inches ; lower Greensand, 66 feet, under-
   laid by mottled red and green argillaceous and micaceous shales of
   Devonian age, extending from 1070 to 1144 feet from the surface, or

        In Leicestershire Mr. Plant reports :

        1. That the Lower Lias beds of the Midland districts do not give any
   constant supply of water. The small quantity found at some places is
   very hard, and is generally contaminated with sulphuretted hydrogen,
   arising from the decomposition of the iron pyrites that occur so fre-
   quently in these Lower Lias'shales.

        2. The Rhcetic beds and Upper Keuper marls (where the Upper
   Gypsum bed has been penetrated) yield a good supply of hard water, con-

   taining, besides carbonate of lime, sulphate of lime to the extent of

   100 grains to the imperial gallon. The water is very transparent and very
   palatable, and is admirably adapted for brewing the fine kinds of beer,
   when diluted so as to reduce the proportion of sulphate of lime to about

   forty to fifty grains per gallon.

       3. When the Upper Keuper sandstone is penetrated below the Gypsum

   --beds from which it is separated by a considerable thickness of marl
   --(chocolate colour) impervious to water from these sandstones a great

   supply of water is found, in some places free of lime altogether, either
   carbonate or sulphate, but in others it is still too hard for the profitable
   generation of steam. The water in this sandstone depends upon the

   ^>

   " outcrop " at various places of the bed, where they have a dip of about 5°

   to 8° south-east.

       4. When the thick beds of red and gray marls lying between the

   Upper and Lower Keuper sandstone (Waterstones) are bored through,
   they are generally found quite dry, and free from water ; but as soon as
   the Lower Keuper sandstone is penetrated to any depth, water is always
   found in great abundance and purity. The extraordinary supply in this
   Sandstone is well shown in the Report on the Ellistown Shaft, the beds
   there delivering (at 300 ft. deep) 60,000 gallons per hour for weeks
   together, while the shaft was being sunk, and before the tubbing could

   be put in.
         In another instance, these Waterstones yielded a column of pure limpid

   water from a depth of 670 ft., the column rising 20 ft. above the surface,
   a total of 690 ft.

     The water was struck under this rock in a few inches of a hard slaty
white bed at about 90 yards deep, and rose nearly to the surface.

     Mr. Sinclair states that the core brought up from this bed was so
much broken up that he is unable to say that it was limestone ; but from
the hardness of the few inches penetrated he is inclined to believe that

this was the case.

--ALancashire.  boring of great interest has just been carried to the

depth of 1000 ft. at Bootle, near Liverpool, by Messrs. Mather & Piatt,

for the Corporation of that town.
392 kepoet-- 1878.

      It was stink as an experiment to test the water-bearing capabilities of

tbe New Red sandstone ; it is perfectly straight from top to bottom, and

has the same diameter, 26 in., the whole distance. Cores have been re-
tained at regnlar intervals, and at every slight change of strata, and
have all been examined by your Reporter ; a large number of them have
also been examined by Mr. Morton.

     From the section accompanying the Report it will be seen that more

than 900 ft. passed through the Pebble Beds, a thickness at least one-third

more than they have been known to attain before ; a fact of considerable

importance regarding the well-known water-bearing capabilities of this
stratum. It will be noticed that thick beds of shaley marl which gene-
rally occur at intervals in the Lancashire and Cheshire wells do not occur
in this boring ; some thin seams are present, but the more marked feature
is the boring in the presence of bands of various thicknesses of exceedingly
fine-grained and compact sandstone or rag, which alternate with open

porous hackly sandstones, holding much water, the rag seams acting as
planes of division between the various water horizons. The first of these
planes occurs at 268 feet from the surface, from which point down to
368 feet the beds are interstratified with a number of these hard bands,

and the character of the rock between is very compact, and probably only
moderately porous.

    From 368 to 590, part of the series is very porous, where one of

the compact belts comes in from 590 to 636 feet, below which a good
water-bearing rock comes in, down to 806, where a compact bed of marl

comes in, below which to 830 occur many bands of marl and compact
rock. From this point downwards, the beds are rather softer in grain, and

of an open porous character.
     Pebbles first appeared at the depth- of 415 feet, and were seen for the

last time at a depth of 975 feet, when a decided change in the character

of the sandstone occurred, the grain being exceedingly fine ; but whether
this sandstone is referable to the lower mottled sandstone, or is merely a
fine-grained band in the pebble beds, which in that case are more than
1000 feet thick, cannot be determined without sinking the boring to a

great depth.

     It is a matter of regret that the arbitrary depth of 1000 feet was

fixed in the contract, and was now placed at 1000 feet. Had the pebble
beds not reached the unprecedented thickness now proved, this smaller

depth would have been ample to solve several questions of the greatest
scientific interest and practical value, not merely to the district around

--Liverpool but of national importance First, as to the water-bearing capa-

bilities of rock at great depth ; second, the nature and thickness of the New

Red sandstone, and possibly Permian beds, that underlie the pebble beds in

that area ; third, as to the character and depth of the coal measures under
Liverpool. That they exist there, there is little doubt, but to what part of the
series they belong can only be determined by boring, and your Committee

look forward with much interest to hear that the Water Committee of the
Liverpool Town Council have determined to go on with the work dis-

continued a few days ago on reaching the contract depth of 1000 feet.
For should the boring be left at its present depth, it will add to the list
of deep borings in the country that have been discontinued at the precise
point where the largest amount of information can be obtained.

     The level of the water in the new boring is 51 feet from the surface,
ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.                             393

398 report--1878.

     Between the years 1867 and 1871 the salts had increased 19 - 63 per

cent., and between 1871 and 1878 they had further increased 4064 per

cent. The rate of increase between 1867 and 1871 was 4 - 91 per cent, per

annum, and the rate between 1871 and 1878 was 5 - 81 per cent, per

annum. The difference is to be accounted for by the larger quantity of
water per day that has been pumped out of the well. Since the year

1871, 295,200 gallons daily have been taken out of the well, which is
equal to 88-| million gallons per annum.

    The well had been in use for many years prior to 1867, but in that
year it was deepened, and a bore-hole made to increase the supply of

water.

The inference drawn from this, and like results obtained elsewhere,

was that the Bunter sandstone rock filtered salts out of sea water.

    In the months of March, April, and May this year, I submitted the
inference to the test of the experiment now to be described.

I selected four cubes of Bunter sandstone from the pebble beds in a

quarry in Everton. Each cube measured accurately 12 in. by 12 in., by

13 in. high. The top surface of each cube was dished out 9 in. by 9 in.,

by 1 in. in depth, to form a receptacle into which water could be

poured.

Three of the cubes were thoroughly dried in air, and placed one above

the other in a frame, so that the water poured on the dished part of the

upper one would, after passing through it, drop into the dished top of

the second cube, and after passing through the second would drop on to

the third, and after passing through the third cube, would drop into a

bottle placed underneath to receive the final filtrate.

The first trial showed the water followed the planes of stratification

before passing through the whole thickness of the cube. That cube was

therefore rejected in the experiment. The second trial showed that the

dished part of the cube was cut on the edge of the planes of stratification,

and there was also some evaporation from the sides. The water passed

through this cube in eighteen hours. This cube was also rejected on

account of the defects which I have stated.

In order to prevent leakage through the sides and evaporation, I coated

four of the sides of the two remaining cubes with black varnish, and

closely covered them and the frame holding them with oil-cloth ; by
these means the water passed through their mass under conditions favour-

able to give accurate results. I also cut three cubes measuring 1^ in.

on each side from the same stones (exhibited at the Dublin meeting) to

ascertain the capacity of the sandstone for storing water, the storage

space being the aggregate of the microscopic interstices which exist

between the grains of quartz, of which the sandstone is composed, and

also of the faults and fractures.

The mean result obtained from the three cubes was that each cubic

foot of sandstone would store 0"733 gallon of water.

    Let us now consider the experiment on filtration.

I took from the River Mersey off the Rockferry slip, at half tide ebb,

fifteen gallons of water, and allowed the muddiness to subside before

Afiltering through the stone.      portion of the water was then carefully

run in small quantities into the dished part of the first cube, until it

began to drop from the bottom ; and when two fluid ounces had passed

through, I carefully analysed the quantity of the chlorides left in the

filtrate, and found that 80"8 per cent, had been removed by the filtration.
ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.  399

The water was then allowed to filter through and drop into the second
cube until it passed without any change from the condition of sea water.
The second cube, it will be observed, was partially saturated with the
filtrate from the first cube, and sea water was added continuously, till it
began to drop from the bottom of the second cube, when it was received
into bottles and carefully analysed with the results given in the following

table, namely :

with the quantity pumped. If this quantity should be large, the bottom
of the suction pipe, or, in other words, the apex of the water cone, would

have to be carried down until the base of the water cone is enlarged to an
area sufficient to supply the requirements of the pump. If that area is

partly covered with anything which is impervious, the base of the water
cone would extend wider and wider till it reached some source of water,
and then, like blotting paper, the exhausted rock would absorb it and
pass any excess to the flowing stream which leads to the pump.

     In Liverpool there are several wells within one mile of the docks and
river Mersey, yielding daily several million gallons of water. The yield

has been continuous for many years. The water has become more

brackish each year, some of the wells yield water half as brackish as sea
water, but it has always been a mystery where water less salt than sea
water percolates so largely into them.

     The expriments just described will, I think, dispel the mystery and
give data for calculating the quantity of water freed from salts any given
area and depth of similar sandstone rock would filter.

   --The next question I wished to decide was Is the filtration through

the sandstone a mechanical or a chemical process ? I will give the answer

as follows :

     One of the cubes of stone which I had used as a filter in the first
experiment was allowed to dry in air for a month, and then I poured spring
water into the dished part, as I had done with the sea water. Following
are the results obtained, and given here in tabular form :
       ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND WATERS.                       401

fore, retained in the stone, -whilst the water of solution niters out. Bat if
excess o£ pure water be allowed to run through the stone, the salts are
again taken in solution and carried away by the water. I simply offer

this as an hypothesis which may explain the results obtained in the ex-

periments.

       Report on the Jurassic Bocks.

      The geology of the oolitic districts has determined, as pointed out many
 years ago by your chairman, " the sites of most of the villages. Thus

 along the valley of the Evenlode villages are planted wherever there are

 copious springs combined with a dry situation, circumstances generally to
 be found in the small lateral valleys which are excavated in the oolite

 and lias, and in these most of the villages are grouped. In other parts of

 the district similar advantages have determined the sites of Bnstone,

 Kiddington, Glympton, Wotton, Woodstock, Bladon, Steeple Barton, &c.

 Some of these villages are perhaps as old as the Norman Conquest, and
 have not altered much in size through several centuries." *

      At Trowbridge, a well was sunk to a depth of 160 ft., and an 18 in.
 bore-hole a further 40 ft. ; a salt water spring was met with in the shaft,
 but the water is still brackish, yielding no less than 6 lbs. of common salt
 from 1,000 gallons of water, 3 oz. being the usual average, the hardness
 being 571 parts per 100,000.

      This quantity of salt is of course exceptional ; there are no records
of a good and plentiful supply being obtained from the Lias. In those
 which yield a large quantity, the water is invariably derived from over-

 lying porous gravel.

      At the base of the Inferior Oolites powerful springs are thrown out,
and flow in streams and rivulets. over the Lias plain at their base. The

commissioner gives several examples of clay-land parishes of this
character in the valley of the Severn, which at present do not receive

 their water supply until it has been hopelessly contaminated, with one
marked exception, that of Coaley, near Frocester.

     The common lands of this parish were enclosed under the superin-

tendence of a Deputy Commissioner of the Enclosure Office. The frontages
to the highways were fenced in, and the footpaths to the brooks closed

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the several landowners who benefited by the enclosure in return laid a

two inch iron pipe from the spring through every hamlet in the parish,
and built a small reservoir at the spring head.

      That landowners should be able to charge their property as a land

improvement with the cost of such proceedings as may be necessary for

the provision of pure water to villages and hamlets, is a matter of
great importance, recommended as it is by Her Majesty's Enclosure
Commission, and supported by the Rivers Pollution Commission.

     The well at Witney is at Messrs. Clinch and Co's. Brewery, and is
65 ft. deep. The water, which through the depth of the well has been
tolerably filtered, is derived from the upper part of the Great Oolites.
None of the wells of this district, however, supply water as pure as that
flowing past the town in the Windrush. In this district a good supply
of water might be obtained by carefully constructed wells of sufficient

depth.

     At Bicester, an artesian boring is described by the Geological Survey-
as reaching a good spring at the base iof the Great Oolite, 244 ft. from

the surface.

    It is an interesting fact, that three years before Sir Hugh Myddleton
bought the Hertfordshire chalk springs by the New River to London,

one Otho Nicholson, of Christ Church, Oxford, brought the water of a
small spring to Carfax Cross in that city, issuing from the base of the
Coralline Oolite, on the hills above North Hincksey, a distance of two
miles across the valley of the Isis. The spring still yields 10,000
gallons daily but the supply was cut off and the cross removed in 1787.

      The following are some of the more important springs in the Oolite
district, about Oxford, given by Messrs. Pole and Bravender in their

evidence before the Royal Rivers and Pollution Commissions.

     The boring was followed by another a few years later, in the hope of
obtaining water, at St. Clement's, but unfortunately a salt spring was
reached at 420 ft., which is still flowing. The beds passed through,
according to Professor Prestwich, were probably the Oxford Clay and
Great Oolite, and the analysis- of the water from the artesian well at

St. Clement's, Oxford, by Mr. W. F. Donkin, February, 1876, was pub-

from organic impurity, the amount in some cases being as low as -047

012 part in 100,000, or # 008 grain per gallon, in Garner's spring, North-

ampton. In fact, " unpolluted spring water from the Oolites is unsur-
passed in its comparative freedom from all kinds of organic impurity."

     The oolitic rocks are very porons, absorbing and holding enormous
volumes of water, which are again delivered as springs usually of great
size. As water-bearing rocks are equal, if not superior, for the purifica-
tion and storage of water, the oolitic rocks are equal, if not superior, to
the chalk itself. But this vast store of magnificent water is rarely used
by communities until it is hopelessly polluted. The analyses show that

great care should be exercised to cut off surface contamination in deep
wells, and that shallow wells are absolutely unsafe.

    An area of no less than 6671 square miles is occupied by the oolitic

rocks of England, with an annual average absorption of not less than

10 in. of rainfall, a figure probably much below the real average.
     Professor Hull describes the two chief sources of springs among the

Cotteswolds, at the base of the Great Oolite, or Stonefield slate, at its

junction with the Fuller's Earth, and at the junction of the Upper Lias
clay with the overlying sands. To the latter horizon belong the seven
springs forming the source of the Thames. Smaller springs issue in the
district at the base of the Lias marlstones and the upper surfaces of
forest marble clays.

     Gloucester is partially supplied by springs in the flanks of Robin's

Wood Hill, thrown out by the Lias, which, with the surface drainage of

1,500 acres, are collected in a reservoir holding 62,000,000 gallons. The
water is nineteen and a half degrees of hardness, which could be reduced
to three and a hah by Clark's process.

     Three springs at Cheltenham are collected along the flanks of the hills
in bricked wells, and conveyed to the reservoirs at Hewlett's Hill and
Leckhampton, together holding 35,000,000 gallons. Above 300,000

gallons are daily delivered. The water is much softer than most oolitic

springs, the hardness being only 15 - 0, of which 6 - is permanent ; that of
Haydon, near Cheltenham, is no less than 45' 7, of which 13 - 4 is per-
manent.

     The saline springs of Cheltenham rise, according to Professor Hull,
like the water in artesian borings, along planes or fissures in the Lower
Lias, and are probably from water percolating through salt-bearing Keuper,
which outcrops at high elevations, as first explained by Sir Roderick

Murchison.

Bath is supplied with water by no less than eighteen private compa- ·

                        ;

Lias. The water derived from the Beacon springs is described as the best

by the Royal Commissioners ; but even this is not quite satisfactory, and it

is a remarkable fact, pointed out by them, that the thermal springs of Bath,

like the cold water, contain a large amount of organic impurity (see table,

p. 404).                                                                                J-^

These waters have been tapped in a well at Kingsmead Street, at the

junction of the Keuper and Penarth beds. They were believed by William

Smith, and later by Sir Charles Lyell, to rise from subjacent carboniferous

rocks at a great depth. They give off, according to Dr. Daubeny, a

daily quantity of 250 cubic ft. of nitrogen gas as well as carbonic acid gas.

Lithium, strontium, and copper have been determined in their waters by

        A very useful table, giving the thicknesses of Triassic and Jurassic

\ strata of the Bristol and Bath area, is given by Mr. Bristow in his evi-

       dence to the Royal Coal Commission, which has been added to by Mr.
      H. B. Woodward, and reprinted pp. 408-410.

The Great Oolite, at Bath, consists of the following series :

                             fl. Course shelly limestone              "j Feet.

                         [ 3. Tough brown limestone
B. Fine freestone                                                     J
C. Lower Rags. Course shelly limestone
                                                                         10 to 30
                                                                         10 to 40

    The good freestone is very soft, when first obtained, containing much

moisture, amounting sometimes, it is said, to one gallon of water per cubic

foot.

     The Bradford clay, a local thickening of the clayey beds of the over-
lying Forest marble, reaches its greatest thickness at Farleigh, where it
reaches forty to sixty feet. The Forest marble around Bath is a hundred
feet thick, in the Cotteswolds not more than fifty.

     The Cornbrash-ruffly limestones reach a thickness of more than forty
feet, and are overlaid by 300 to 400 feet of Oxford clay.

     The coal rag only appears in the Bristol area, as Longleat Park, it
underlies the Kimmeridge, which reaches a thickness of sixty-five feet at
Maiden Bradley.

     In the oolitic outcrop, ranging between Crewkerne, through Bath to

Wotton-under-Edge, described by Mr. H. B. W. Woodward, the coal rag,

when present in water bearing the Oxford clay, form the impermeable
layer, as does also the Cornbrash and the upper sandy beds of the Forest
marble, which are held up by the clayey beds beneath.

    The outcrop of the Cornbrash, between Witham Friary, South Brew-
ham, and Hardway to Wincanton, is marked by a line of villages, due, as

pointed by Professor Buckman, " not only to the fertility of the Corn-

brash, but to the resemblance that this porous rock, resting on the imper-

vious Forest marble, is a collecting ground for water, which is kept up by

the latter rock."

     The labours of Professor Judd, in Lincolnshire, enable the following

classification of the bed at the base of the oolites to be adopted :
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                i

     The Lincolnshire oolites are absent in the eastern and southern por-
tions of the Midland district, and the Upper Extension series which
form the base of the great oolite series rest directly upon an eroded
and denuded surface of the Northampton sands, when the Lincolnshire

oolites are present, however, they, too, are found to be eroded, proving
them, like the Northampton sand, to be of inferior oolite age.

     The basement beds of the Northampton sands rest in Rutland, and
South Lincoln, on an eroded surface of Upper Lias clay, and generally
consisting of ironstone oolitic rock, forming a bold escarpment, " The
Cliff," stretching away for ninety miles through Lincolnshire to York-
shire, at the base of which copious springs arise, at the junction of
the lias, the beautiful Eleanor Cross at Geddington is over one. Springs
are thrown out in a similar situation at Pipwell, where there is the
remains of an old reservoir.

     At Blatherwyche Park Inlier, one well sunk to the Northampton
Sandrock yielded a good supply, but another was strongly impregnated

with sulphurated hydrogen.

     At Collyweston, a number of wells have been sunk through the thick
beds of the Lincolnshire oolites, into the 'red-rock,' or ironstone, which
itself supplies the large quantities of water used in the working of the

' Slate pits.'

     To this horizon are due the springs of Wolthorpe, collected in a reser-

voir for the supply of Stamford.

     Very copious springs are also given off by the base of the ironstone of

Easton, used for the supply of that village.

     Near Stamford, a futile attempt to find coal was made by the late

ON THE CIRCULATION OF UNDERGROUND -WATERS.                                                                                 411

Marquis of Exeter, and a depth reached of 500 ft., but the Lias was not

penetrated, the- upper clay being above 140 ft. thick.

Water occurs on the same horizon, in the Uppingham outlier, issuing

from a blue calcareous rock, forming the base of the Northampton sands,

at Lyddington                                                                    springs also issue at Bisbrook.
                                                                              ;

The upper portion of the ironstones are much peroxidized, and readily

pervious to water, and are called " kale " by the well-sinkers, the com-

pact lower portion (carbonate of iron), is the water-bearing horizon, but

the well-diggers consider it safer to penetrate it, and reach the Lias, "blue

bind," to prevent failure during droughts.

Professor Judd states, the capacity for the absorption of rain, of the

Northampton sands and over-lying oolite limestone, is " practically un-

limited, for not only do many of the streams flowing over the boulder clay

instantly disappear underground, by means of swallow holes, when they

reach the junction of the clay and limestone or sand," but drains ai'e

carried into them, and artificial swallow- holes produced that never fail

even in the heaviest rainfalls .

This water is given off in copious springs on the top of the lias, and

though containing much temporary hardness, are never chalybeate.

The Northampton sands average twenty to thirty ft. in thickness, and

seldom reach more than forty, the over-lying Lincolnshire oolite at

Stamford is eighty ft., gradually thickening from thence northwards, and

thinning out entirely southwards at Harrington and Maidwell, and east-

wards, near Wansford tunnel.

     These analyses show, in the words of the. Commission, " that the oolitic

rocks are not inferior to the New Red Sandstone, in the energy with

which they oxidize and destroy the organic matter present in the waters
percolating through them."

     Though the waters so derived are generally hard, it is chiefly of a
temporary character, capable of being softened by Clark's process, so as

to average 6° - 8 instead of 20o- 6.
     The oolites yield in springs and deep wells, water which is " bright,

sparkling, and palatable," and " excellent for drinking and all domestic
purposes, except washing," for which latter purpose, the addition of lime

renders it fit.

     It is noticeable that the temporary hardness of the deep well waters
is higher than that of the spring water, where care has been taken.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Jas. R. Napier, F.R.S.,

    Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S., W. Froude, F.R.S., J. T. Bottomley,
     and Osborne Reynolds, F.R.S. (Secretary), appointed to in-

     vestigate the effect of Propellers on the Steering of Vessels.

Since the Meeting of the British Association held in Plymouth last year,
the Committee have had the satisfaction of receiving reports of the trials
of various English and foreign steamers, made by the owners and officers
of the steamers, without any further instigation from the Committee than
that contained in their circulars. These reports all show that those by

whom the trials were made have become convinced of the importance of

                                                               EE2
--420 eepoet 1878.

the facts which, they have observed. And, indeed, the mere fact of the
trials having been undertaken shows that the importance of the effect of
the reversed screw on the steering while the ship is stopping herself is
beginning to be recognised. This is further shown by the fact that one
of the trials was undertaken at the instance of the Court of Mr. Stipen-
diary Yorke, in order to ascertain if the captain of the s.s. Tabor had been
justified in starboarding his helm in order to bring his vessel round to
starboard after his screw was reversed.

      All these trials, without a single exception, confirm the results

obtained in the previous trials made by the Committee. But this is not
the most important purpose which this year's trials serve. For, as re-

gards the general effect of the reversed screw on the action of the rudder,
the trials already, reported, particularly those of the Hankoiv (see last
year's Report, p. 201), are conclusive, and leave nothing to be desired. But

the previous trials were all made with fast vessels at their full draught, their
screws being well covered, and the conditions of the weather being most
favourable. The trials this year, on the other hand, appear, for the most
part, to have been made with vessels in light trim ; and in two instances
the wind was blowing with considerable force. The result of these cir-
cumstances on the behaviour of the vessels is very decided, and coincides
remarkably with the effects deduced by Professor Reynolds from his
experiments on models (see Report 1875, i., p. 145), viz., that when the
screw is not deeply immersed and froths the water, it exerts, when reversed,

considerable influence to turn the vessel independently of the rudder;
the vessel turning to starboard or port, according as the screw is right or
left handed, which effect (and this seems to be the point most generally

unknown) nearly disappears when the screw is so deeply immersed that

it does not churn air with the water.
     Neither the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, nor the Elder Brethren

of Trinity House have taken any further notice of the results communi-
cated to them by the Committee.

     The Marine Board of South Shields has, however, taken considerable
interest in the question, has invited captains to make trials, and Mr. J.
Gillie, the Secretary, was present at the trial of the Tabor ordered by
the Court, and reported the results to the Committee.

      There have been numerous collisions during the year. In almost all cases
the practice of reversing the screw has been adhered to. In many, if not
in all instances where this has been done, the evidence goes to show that
the vessel in which the screw was reversed did not turn in the direction
in which those in charge of her were endeavouring to turn her. In two
important cases this fact was fully apparent even to those in charge of

the vessel. And in one instance the owners and captain of the vessel

 attributed the failure to steer to its true cause, namely, the reversal of
 the screw ; although in both cases those immediately in charge of the

 vessels contended that the rudder was not handled according to their

 directions.

      The first case was that of the Menelaus and the Pilot schooner
 on the Mersey. The Menelaus was in charge of a first-class pilot, and
 this steamer, in broad daylight, ran into and sank the Pilot schooner,
 which was dropping up the river with the tide. The pilot in charge con-
 tended that, owing to the wheel chains having got jammed, his orders
 were not attended to. The jamming of the chains was denied by the
 owners, and the fact that they subpoenaed the Secretary of the Committee
          THE EFFECT OF PROPELLERS ON THE STEERING OF VESSELS. 421

to give evidence at the trial may be taken to indicate the cause to which

they attributed the collision. The case, however, was only in part heard,
for after the evidence for the plaintiffs a compromise was effected, and
the pilot withdrew all assertion that the wheel chains had been jammed,
thus admitting that the failure to steer had been brought about by the

reversal of the screw.

     The other case is the well-known accident to the Kilrfurst. In this
it is admitted that the order was to starboard the helm and reverse the
screw of the Konig Wilhelm, and this order was avowedly given with
the view of bringing the vessel round to port. All the experiments of
this Committee, however, go to prove that with a reversed screw and a
starboard helm such a vessel as the Konig Wilhelm would have turned
to starboard rather than port. This was what, according to all the
evidence, did actually happen, and was the final cause of the catastrophe.
But it appears that those in charge of the Konig Wilhelm arrived at

the conclusion that the men at the wheel (and these would be many),

although they all aver that they heard the order and obeyed it, in reality
turned the wheel the wrong way. Considering, therefore, that it was

not one man but a number of men at the wheel, and that the vessel

behaved exactly as she would have behaved had the order been obeyed,

as the men say it was, the conclusion of the Court seems to be most

improbable, and, for the sake of future steering, most unfortunate.

    The Committee are now of opinion that the work for which they were

originally brought together has been fully accomplished. The importance
of the effect of the reversed screw on the action of the rudder has been

fully established, as well as the nature of its effect completely ascertained.

Also for two years the Committee have urged the results of their work
upon the attention of the Admiralty, and the various marine boards, and

although they regret that as yet they have failed to obtain the general
recognition of the facts brought to light which their vital importance

demands, they consider that this will surely follow, and that as a Com-
mittee they can do no more than publish the reports of the trials, and the
conclusions to which they have been led.

     Full accounts of the experiments made previously to this year have
been given in the two previous Reports, and those which the Committee
have received this year are given at length at the end of this Report. The
following is a summary of the conclusions which have been established

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

and it is interesting to notice that the conclusions drawn by Professor
Reynolds from experiments on models have been fully confirmed by the
experiments on full-sized ships :

Summary of the Results of the Trials of the Effect of the Reversed Screw

              on the Steering during the time a vessel is stopping herself.

     It appears both from the experiments made by the Committee, and from
other evidence, that the distance required by a screw steamer to bring
herself to rest from full speed by the reversal of her screw is independent,
or nearly so, of the power of the engines, but depends on the size and
build of the ship, and generally lies between four and six times the ship's
length. It is to be borne in mind that it is to the behaviour of the ship

 during this interval that the following remarks apply.
      The main point the Committee have had in view has been to ascertain

how far the reversing of the screw in order to stop a ship did or did not
 422 eepokt-- 1878.

 interfere with the action of the rndder during the interval of stopping y
 and it is as regards this point that the most important light has been thrown
 on the question of handling ships. It is found an invariable rule that,
 during the interval in which a ship is stopping herself by the reversal of
 her screw, the rudder produces none of its usual effect to turn the ship,
 but that, under these circumstances, the effect of the rudder, such as it is,

 is to turn the ship in the opposite direction from that in which she would
 turn if the screw were going ahead. The magnitude of this reverse effect

 of the rudder is" always feeble, and is different for different ships, and
 even for the same ship under different conditions of loading.

      It also appears from the trials that, owing to the feeble influence of

 the rudder over the ship during the interval in which she is stopping, she

· is then at the mercy of any other influences that may act upon her. Thus

 the wind, which always exerts an influence to turn the stem (or forward

 end) of the ship into the wind, but which influence is usually well under
 control of the rudder, may, when the screw is reversed, become para-
 mount and cause the ship to turn in a direction the very opposite of that
 which is desired. Also the reversed screw will exercise an influence,

 which increases as the ship's way is diminished, to turn the ship to star-

 board or port according as it is right or left handed ; this being particu-
 larly the case when the ships are in light draught.

   --These several influences the reversed effect of the rudder, the effort

--of the wind, and the action of the screw will determine the course the

 ship takes during the interval of stopping. They may balance, in which
 case the ship will go straight on, or any one of the three may predominate

 and so determine the course of the ship.
      The utmost effect of these influences, when they all act in conjunction,

as when the screw is right-handed, the helm starboarded, and the wind
 on the starboard side, is small as compared with the influence of the
 rudder as it acts when the ship is steaming ahead. In no instance has a
 ship tried by the Committee been able to turn with the screw reversed on
 a circle of less than double the radius of that on which she would turn
 when steaming ahead. So that, even if those in charge could govern the
 direction in which the ship will turn while stopping, she turns but slowly

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

 whereas in point of fact those in charge have little or no control over
 this direction, and unless they are exceptionally well acquainted with the
 ship, they will be unable even to predict the direction.

       It is easy to see, therefore, that if on approaching danger the screw

 be reversed, all idea of turning the ship out of the way of the danger
 must be abandoned. She may turn a little, and those in charge may
 know in which direction she will turn, or may even by using the rudder
 in an inverse manner be able to influence this direction, but the amount
 of turning must be small, and the direction very uncertain.

      The question, therefore, as to the advisability of reversing the screw

 is simply a question as to whether the danger may be better avoided by

 stopping or by turning ; a ship cannot do both with any certainty.

      Which of these two courses it is better to follow, must depend on the

 particular circumstances of each particular case, but the following con-

 siderations would appear to show that when the helm is under sufficient
 command there can seldom be any doubt.

     A screw steam-ship when at full speed requires five lengths, more or

 less, in which to stop herself ; whereas by using her rudder and steaming
 on at full speed ahead, she should be able to turn herself through a quadrant,
        THE EFFECT OF PROPELLERS ON THE STEERING OF VESSELS. 423

without having advanced five lengths in her original direction. That is
to say, a ship can turn a circle of not greater radius than four lengths
more or less (see Hankoio, Valetta, Barge) ; so that, even if running at full
speed directly on to a straight coast, she should be able to save herself by
steaming on ahead and using: her rudder after she is too near to save her-
self by stopping ; and any obliquity in the direction of approach, or any
limit to the breadth of the object ahead, is all to the advantage of turn-
ing, but not at all so to stopping.

     There is one consideration, however, with regard to the question of
stopping or turning which must, according to the present custom, often
have weight, although there can be but one opinion as to the viciousness
of the custom. This consideration is the utter inability of the officers in

charge to make any rapid use of the rudder so long as their engines are
kept on ahead. It is no uncommon thing for the largest ships to be

steered by as few as two men. And the mere fact of the wheel being so
arranged that two men have command of the rudder, renders so many

turns of the wheel necessary to bring the rudder over that, even where
ready help is at hand, it takes a long time to turn the wheel round and
round so as to put a large angle on the rudder.

     The result is that it is often one or two minutes after the order is
heard before there is any large angle on the rudder, and of course under
these circumstances it is absurd to talk of making use of the turning
qualities of a ship in case of emergency. The power available to turn
the rudder should be proportional to the tonnage of the vessel, and there

is no mechanical reason why the rudder of the largest vessel should not

be brought hard over in less than fifteen seconds from the time the order

is given. Had those in charge of steam-ships sufficient control over the
rudder, it is probable that much less would be heard of the reversing of

the engines in cases of imminent danger.

     Right-handed screw. Speed of ship 13 knots. Signalled to engine-
room " Stop." "Full speed astern" 20 seconds after first order. Engines

moving astern. Helm put hard a-starboard. Head commenced moving

to starboard and went from N. 20 E. to N. 50 E. in 1^ minute. The

Wevessel had by this time stopped going through the water.  then got

up full speed ahead, stopped, put the helm hard a-port, and reversed

full speed. The vessel had stopped going ahead in 1^ minute, and the
head had gone to starboard from N. 30 E. to N". 50 E. At 2£ minutes
the head stopped going to starboard, and at 2\ minutes the ship's head
was going to port. The vessel was going astern through the water

before her head stopped going to starboard.

     The draught of water was 9 feet 2 inches and 12 feet 10 inches. The

centre of propeller is 7 feet 1 inches above bottom of keel, and the pro-

peller is 13 feet in diameter, so that the top of the blade was 9 inches out

. of the water.

                                   Remarks by the Committee.

     The screw of this vessel being right-handed, its tendency when
reversed would be to bring the vessel's head to starboard, and, owing to
--424
report 1878.

the screw being partially out of water, this tendency would be consider-

able. Accordingly we find that the direct effect of the screw prevailed
over the influence of the rudder, and when the screw was reversed the
vessel turned to starboard for all positions of the helm. The reversed
effect of the rudder was, however, very apparent, for the vessel went to
starboard while stopping much faster with the helm starboarded than

with the helm ported.
     The same phenomena exactly will be seen in the trials of the next

four vessels.

   --Sir, Being a subscriber to the ' Navy ' I perused an article in No.

124, vol. v., of that journal (Oct. 7, 1876) regarding experiments on the

turning of screw steamers.

    The same inspired me with great interest in the matter it treats of,
and caused me to instruct the captains of my three steamers, Martha,

Marietta, Susanne (of which I subjoin the necessary particulars at foot),

to make the experiments in question. This has been done, and the

results obtained communicated to the Nautical Associations here and at

other German ports. Being indebted to you, as the promoter of these

experiments, for the idea, I consider it my duty to acquaint you with the
results of the experiments made by my captains, and venture to enclose a

translation of the report on same. I need not state that any comments

you might favour me with, or a few lines stating whether the conclusions

arrived at correspond to your own, would be most highly esteemed.

                                 I am, Sir, your most obedient,

On the Steering of Steamships with Right-handed Screws, ivhen the vessel is

                                 going ahead, but her engines reversed.

     The experiments made by Professor Reynolds, of Manchester, in refer-
ence to the correct steering of screw steamships, when going ahead with
the propeller working astern, and the results of the trials made with the

steamer Melrose, which have been published in the ' Glasgow News,' have
induced us, the undersigned, to try the three chief manoeuvres in question

with the steamers which we command. We subjoin a statement of the

results obtained, accompanied by sketch and explanation.
     As screw steamers differ from each other in respect of model, construc-

tion, and size of propeller and helm, draught of water, &c, there is
naturally a difference in the degree in which they deviate from a straight

course when making these movements. We would, therefore, recommend

every master to make experiments with his ship, with a view to ascertain-
ing in what way the helm should be handled in all conceivable emer-

gencies.

      I. Ship going ahead, propeller working astern, rudder amidships.
     Result. The stern turns to the right.
     Explanation. The rotation of the screw to the left presses the stern to
the left, and consequently the stem to the right ; the helm, which is amid-

                                                                .

ships, is thus neutralised, and must be regarded merely as a prolongation

of the ship.

     II. Ship going ahead, the screw working backwards and the helm
hard a-starboard.

     Result. The stern turns very decidedly to the right.
     Explanation. The rotation of the screw to the left presses the stern to
the left, and consequently the stem to the right ; the starboarded helm is
subjected to a pressure of water from behind, so that the after part of the
ship is doubly impelled to the left, the fore part being also with correspond-

ingly greater force pressed to the right.

     III. The ship going ahead, propeller working astern, helm hard a-port.
     Result. The stern inclines slightly to the left.
     Explanation. The rotation of the screw to the left presses the after
part of the ship to the left ; on the other hand, the ported helm is under a

pressure of water from behind which impels the stern to the right. The
operation of these two forces being of opposite nature, the vessel only
deviates slightly from the straight course, and then mostly with the stern

to the left.

     But as soon as headway is lost the force of the screw asserts itself so

much more that, in spite of the helm being ported, the stern turns to the
left and the bow to the right ; they turn in the same directions in a
stronger degree when the helm is amidships, and strongest of all when
the helm is starboarded. From the moment the ship begins to go astern
the screw must be regarded as the fore end or bow of the ship. After the
propeller, on the order " Full speed astern" being given, has made some few

revolutions, there comes a short period during which the helm can be
moved to either side with almost the same facility as when the vessel is
lying stationary, after the expiration of which it almost immediately
becomes necessary to use considerable force to work the helm. This is
due to the circumstance that immediately after the screw has made the
426 bepokt-- 1878.

first backward revolutions the pressure of water in front on the helm
ceases, causing so-called deadwater at the helm ; whereas an increasing
pressure of water on the helm from behind results as soon as the backward
revolutions of the screw begin to gain in rapidity. The pressure on the
rudder from behind, in spite of the vessel's headway, is presumably to be
attributed to the fact that the masses of water thrown forward by the
screw must immediately be replaced, causing a correspondingly powerful
suction, and consequently a current of water acting on the rudder. The
conflict between the contending masses of water is clearly visible also on
the surface on both sides of the ship (particularly on the right side).

   We beg to hand these results of our observations to the Nautical

Association of this town for distribution amongst other masters, and trust
that they will likewise communicate the result of their experiments with

their respective ships, in order that the data thus collected may be of ser-

vice to the seafaring community.

           C. Strbeck, do.  s.s. Martha.

  --N.B. The altered operation of the screw being in the main to be

attributed to the fact that the backward revolutions transmute the
pressure of water on the helm coming from in front to a pressure coming
from behind, it is, when carrying out this manoeuvre, of the greatest im-
portance that the helm should first be turned after the screw has com-
menced to revolve backwards.

                    From the ' Sloping and Mercantile Gazette.'

   In connexion with the Board of Trade inquiry recently held at South
Shields, before Mr. Stipendiary Yorke, into the collision between the
Tabor steamer, of Sunderland, and the brig William and Ann, of Seaham,
which happened in the River Thames, on January 25 last, some experi-
ments have been made on board the Tabor, at the mouth of the Tyne,
on the peculiar effects of the rudder and screw when reversed while the
ship has headway, to turn the ship's head to starboard of her course. As

far as I am aware, the first public intimation of any similar trials

having been made appeared in the Report of the British Association for
the year 1876. The Report gives an account of certain experiments made
on the Clyde by Professor Osborne Reynolds, Sir William Thomson, Mr.
James R. Napier, and others. These experiments were undertaken to
verify certain trials made upon models by Professor Reynolds, which he
had brought under the notice of the Association the previous year at

Bristol. An able article on the subject, from the pen of Sir Travers

Twiss, appeared in the ' Nautical Magazine,' last year ; so that nautical

men should now be aware that they cannot always depend upon the action
of the rudder and screw when reversed while the ship has headway.

     Almost all experienced officers of the navy and merchant service are
doubtless well acquainted with the manoeuvring of screw vessels under
steam, but it is thought that junior officers and others might not have
had opportunities of acquiring information of this kind. There is a
marked difference in the results observed on the Clyde and those noticed
at the mouth of the Tyne, inasmuch as in none of the trials detailed below
         THE EFFECT OF PROPELLERS ON THE STEERING OF TESSELS. 427

did the ship's head swing to port of her course, but invariably to star-
board. I would have preferred to wait until these differences had been
either accounted for or explained by further experiments before placing
the facts before your readers ; but an imperfect account of the trials having
appeared in the local newspapers, it was thought desirable to publish the
facts just as they were obtained, and to reserve for a future letter further

remarks, and a description of a series of similar experiments made by
direction of the Local Marine Board on board the Gervin steamer, off
the Tyne in August last year.

     "While the inquiry in reference to the Tabor collision was pending,
Captain Henderson, the Secretary to the British Shipmasters' and Officers'
Protection Society, suggested to the owner of that ship the importance of
trying some experiments on the effect of the rudder and screw when
reversed. Mr. Westall, the owner, immediately gave instructions to his
manager to place the ship, which was then in the Tyne, at the disposal of
of Mr. Torke. That gentleman, thinking that it was a point of some

interest to mercantile and nautical men to have the matter settled by

actual trial, requested Messrs. Gillie and Tate, the Examiners to the Tyne
and Wear Local Marine Boards, to accompany the ship to sea, and have
the experiments carried out under their inspection.

    On the 19th inst. the Tabor was unmoored from Shields Harbour,

and at 2 p.m. proceeded to sea in charge of a pilot and Captain Mankin.
There were also on board Rear- Admiral Powell and Captain Nicholas, the
Nautical Assessors ; Mr. L. V. Hamel, Solicitor to the Board of Trade
Captain Henderson, Secretary to the British Shipmasters' and Officers'
Protection Society, and Mr. Roche, their, solicitor ; Alderman Peckett,
of Sunderland ; Captain Mail, manager for Mr. Westall, the owner, and

others.

     The ship was run out to sea three or four miles so as to be out of the
way of passing vessels. The Tabor is a screw steamer of 520 tons
register. Her length between perpendiculars is 208 feet ; breadth, 27'8
feet ; depth, 14' 8 feet. She is propelled by two engines of 90-horse power
combined, and at the time of the trial had in about 200 tons of water
ballast. Her draught of water forward was 6 feet 6 inches, and aft 10
feet 4 inches, she being nearly in the same trim as she was at the time
the collision happened. Her screw is right-handed, and four blades ;.
diameter, 12 feet pitch, 17 feet. The top of the blade was about 2 feet

                                                                                                           ;

out of the water when the blade was parallel with the sternpost. The

direction of the wind was S. by W. ^ W. ; force 4 to 5. The sea was

perfectly smooth. The weather being a little hazy, and the marks upon

the land indistinct, a dumb card could not be used to measure the angles
made by the ship's head, but the bridge compass, being in excellent con-

dition and not sluggish, was used for this purpose. Mr. Tate and Mr.
Hamel noted the time, the change in the ship's head was observed by Mr.
Gillie, who also took down the notes, and Mr. Roche noted the time it took
to stop and reverse the engines. The ship's head previous to commenc-
ing the whole of the trials was steadied at W.S.W., and the engines were
kept going full speed ahead, the ship making 8 knots an hour as shown
by the patent log. The fore and main trysails were set during trials
1 and 2 ; there was no canvas set during trials 3, 4, and 5.

   --Trial No. 1 (helm hard a-starboard). At 3.43 p.m., while the ship

was going full speed ahead, the order was given to stop and reverse the
engines to full speed astern, at the same time the helm was put hard to
428 keport-- 1878.

starboard, both operations being done simultaneously, and completed in 12

seconds from the time of tbe order being given. In 40 seconds ship's

head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 10 degrees ; in 1 minute 30 seconds
ship's head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 34 degrees ; in 2 minutes
45 seconds ship's head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 67 degrees, and
the ship's way through the water ahead was completely stopped.

     Trial No. 2 (with helm hard a-port), the ship's head being brought to

--W.S.W., going full speed, all other conditions as in trial 1. In 40 seconds

ship's head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 12 degrees ; in 1 minute 30
seconds ship's head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 23 degrees ; in
2 minutes 45 seconds ship's head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 42
degrees, and the ship's way through the water ahead completely stopped.

     Trial No. 3 (with helm amidships), fore and main trysails taken in,

--all other conditions as before. In 40 seconds ship's head fell off to star-

board of W.S.W. 15 degrees; in 1 minute 30 seconds ship's head fell
off to starboard of W.S.W. 50 degrees; in 2 minutes 45 seconds ship's
head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 79 degrees, and way stopped.

     Trial No. 4 (with helm hard a-starboard), being trial No. 1 repeated

--with no canvas set, all other conditions as before. In 40 seconds ship's

head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 7 degrees; in 1 minute 30 seconds
ship's head fell off to starboard of W.S.W. 45 degrees; in 2 minutes 45

seconds ship's head fell off to starboard of W.S.W 78 degrees, and way

stopped.

     Trial No. 5 (with helm hard a-port), being trial No. 2 repeated with

--no canvas set. In 40 seconds ship's head fell off to starboard of W.S.W.

16 degrees ; in 1 minute 30 seconds ship's head fell off to starboard of

W.S.W. 34 degrees ; in 2 minutes 25 seconds ship's head fell off to star-
board of W.S.W. 45 degrees. At this point the engines were stopped by
mistake, but the ship's head appeared to be fixed at W.N.W., and she
had very little, if any, way through the water ahead.

     The practical result of these trials, as far as the Tabor is concerned,
is to show that when she is going full speed ahead in ballast trim, if her

engines are stopped and reversed, her head will go to starboard of the
course she is steering. The helm seems to have very little effect, the
results obtained with the helm hard a-starboard and when it was amidships

being very much alike. With the helm hard a-port the ship's head still
went to starboard, but the angle described was much smaller than that
made when the helm was amidships or a-starboard. I will not at present
trespass any further on your space, but perhaps you will allow me to add
that the experiments made with the Cervin steamer, with a draught of
22 feet, go a long way to show that, in ships of her class, similar results

 to those detailed above will follow under similar circumstances.

Local Marine Board, South Shields, February 22, 1878.

                                  Remarks by the Committee.

     It will be seen that the results in this case are very similar to

those obtained in the case of the North-Western. The right-handed
screw only partially immersed gave the vessel a strong bias to starboard.
But in this case, in addition to the direct effect of the screw, the effect of
the wind, which was of force 4 or 5, was to bring the vessel round to
windward, which happened in all cases to be to starboard
THE EFFECT OF PROPELLERS ON THE STEERING OF VESSELS. 429

      In the next vessel reported, the Cervin, it will be seen that the
screw was well immersed, and hence would probably exert no great in-

fluence when reversed to turn the vessel to starboard. At the commence-
ment of all the trials, however, the wind was blowing with force 5 on the
starboard side of the vessel, and the effect of this would be to cause the
vessel, as long as she had way on, to turn to windward, and this, it will be
seen, is what happened; in every case the vessel's head turned to wind-
ward. Here also the reverse influence of the rudder was apparent, for
the vessel turned faster to starboard with the helm starboarded than with

it ported.

                                                                                                                                                                                                         August 25, 187T.

4. On the Effect of Variation of Pressure on the Length of Disruptive
    Discharge in Air. By J. E. H. Gordon, Assistant Secretary of tlw

      British Association.-^

     The author has worked with a 17-inch induction coil, and with sparks varying
from 6 to 10 inches at atmospheric pressure, and up to over 36 inches at low

pressure.

    Two " aurora tubes " were used, and the method of working was to allow the

discharge to take its choice of two paths, one short at high pressure, and the other
longer at lower pressure, and thus to compare the resistance to discharge at the
different pressures. In the tables which accompany the paper, experiments at 55
different pressures, ranging from 2'42 inches to 29 - 7 inches, are given.

     The general results deduced are
     (1) From a pressure of about 11 inches to that of the atmosphere, Harris's^

mately true.

     (2) No law can be said to be more than approximately true, as when the electric

density has almost reached tHe discharging limit, any slight accidental circumstance

will cause the discharge to take place.

of air is required to produce a spark than at higher pressure. This is not incon-
sistent with Sir William Thomson's result, namely, that a greater electromotive
force per unit length of air is required to produce a spark at short distances than
at long.*

5. On the Absorption Spectrum of Chlorochromic Anhydride. By Gr.

     Johnstone Stonet, M.A., F.B.S., Secretary to the Queen's University

     in Ireland, and J. Emerson Reynolds, M.D., F.C.S., Professor of

      Chemistry in the University of Dublin.

The authors described and exhibited the absorption spectrum produced by the

vapour of chlorochromic anhydride O(C 2 201 2 ). This spectrum is of pecidiar

interest from its having supplied information as to the duration and character of a

motion within the molecules of the vapour (see ' Philosophical Magazine ' for

July, 1871). The spectrum consists of lines very regularly distributed over the

orange yellow and green, bordering a more refrangible region of complete absorp-

tion. The lines are found to be equally spaced when plotted down on a map of

oscillation-frequencies, and the intensities of the successive lines are such as to

form definite patterns. From the positions of the lines, of which 105 had been

examined, it has been ascertained that they are to be referred to one motion in

the molecules of the gas, since they are all either its harmonics or such quasi-

harmonics as, for example, occur when an elastic rod is made to vibrate trans-

versely, most of which cannot be distinguished by observation from true
Weharmonics.
              further learn from the positions of the lines that this motion,

on the more probable supposition that the lines are its true harmonics, is

repeated 810,000,000,000 times every second in each molecule. And from the

succession of intensities we learn that this molecular motion is in some way

related to that of a particular point on a violin-string when vibrating under

the influence of the bow, viz., a point nearly but not quite two-fifths of the

length of the string from one end (see ' Philosophical Magazine,' loc. cit., p. 47).

6. On the Floio of Water in uniform regime in Rivers and in Open Channels
        generally. By Professor James Thomson, LL.V., D.Sc, F.B.S.

     The communication of which the following is an abstract was made to the
Mathematical and Physical Section, in order to offer for consideration there a new
theory of some of the phenomena of the flow of water in rivers and in open
channels generally, which formed the subject of a paper just before sent to the
Royal Society. The author stated that during a great part of the present century
experimental investigations had been accumulating, made on some of the largest
rivers in the world, and on aqueducts and on small artificial channels, which tended
strongly to show that usually the velocity of flow at and near the surface of a
river is less than the velocity at some depth between the surface and the bottom.
They seem to show that for descent from the surface towards the bottom the
velocity first increases till a maximum is attained, and farther down goes on di-

minishing for approach towards the resisting bottom. Now this has appeared very

generally, even to the investigators themselves who have carried out the experi-

ments, to be a very perplexing result, because it has seemed, through various modes
of consideration, that the surface and upper portions of the current, being farther
distant from the resisting bed, should be expected to be less influenced by its
resistance, and should, therefore, flow faster than the parts intervening between
them and the bottom. The principal object of the paper was to offer a new theo-

retical view explaining and accounting for the observed phenomenon which now

appears to be highly probable, if not absolutely ascertained through experiments, and

which these theoretical considerations of the author go to confirm. He says that

if we watch the surfaces of flowing rivers, or of tidal currents flowing in narrows
or kyles, we may often have opportunity to observe very prevalent indications of
rushes of water corning up to the surface and spreading out there. He considers

that these proceed from the bottom, being driven upwards in consequence of
impulses arising through the scouring action of the current along the bed. Thus
the water so arriving to the surface and spreading out there is composed largely of

--the deadened water from the bottom deadened as to forward motion by the

intense fluid friction at the bottom. The superficial layer, thus always fresh from
the bottom, becomes in its turn overflowed by new supplies from the bottom, and so
it gradually descends to enter into the middle body of the stream. At the same

time it is perpetually under the accelerating influence of the earth's attraction, in
Virtue of its downhill flow, and so it attains increase of velocity beyond that which
it had at the surface.

                  7. Note on the Pecletic Action of Soap*

             By Professor W. Stanley Jevons, F.B.S.

Since the publication, in the ' Quarterly Journal of Science,' for April 1878, of

the author's paper on the so-called Brownian movement of microscopic particles,

which he proposes to term Pedesis, it has been suggested that soap would form a

good critical substance for experiment in relation to this phenomenon. Soap con-

siderably reduces the surface-tension of water, in which it is dissolved without
much affecting, as is said, its electric conductibility. If, then, pedesis be due to

surface-tension, as some physicists assert, the motion would be killed, or much

lessened, when soap is dissolved in the water. The experiment having been tried

with china-clay, red oxide of iron, chalk, bariuni carbonate, &c, gave the opposite

Aresult; the pedetic motion appeared to be increased and facilitated.  similar

result was obtained by experiments upon the suspension of china-clay in dilute

solutions of soap ; it wTas found that soap distinctly prevented the precipitation of

the suspended powder, and this result was obtained even in the presence of 1 per

cent, of sodium carbonate.

The author believes that these results are in favour of his own opinion that

pedesis is a phenomenon of electric origin, and can only go on in liquids of high

electric resistance. He also points out that the detergent action of soap is probably

due to the increase of pedetic action, which causes particles to become detached

and suspended in the soapy liquid. Only in this way can we understand the

utility of combining an alkaline salt with stearic or other fatty acid. So far as the

action of soap depends on the alkali, it would be more active in the absence of the

other constituent, which he therefore infers is only needed to maintain the pedetic

and suspensive power of the water. The author believes that this is only one of

many phenomena which may be explained by the study of pedesis ; and he pro-

poses to follow up the inquiry with regard to several substances tending to increase

the motion.

       8. Motions produced by Dilute Acids on some Amalgam Surfaces.
                                     By Robert Sabine.

     The author finds, when a drop of very dilute acid is placed upon the clean and
newly-filtered surface of a rather rich amalgam of some metal which is positive to
mercury, that the drop does not lie still as it would do upon pure mercury, but sets

itself into an irregular jerky motion. This is the case with copper, zinc, antimony,
tin, and lead amalgams. But if instead of these amalgams, those of platinum,

-- --gold, and silver are used these latter metals being negative to mercury the drop

of acid water lies quite still. The acids tried were : sulphuric, hydrochloric,
oxalic, and acetic, which behaved similarly, but in different degrees.

    When the experiment is made in an atmosphere of oxygen, the movements

upon the amalgams of the positive metals are increased ; hut in hydrogen, carhonic
acid, nitrogen, and coal-gas, the motions are instantly arrested.

     The author concludes that the motions result from an alternate play of deoxi-
dation of the mercury underneath the acid by electrolysis, due to the currents of
small floating particles of the positive metal, causing the drop to contract, and of

oxidation of the surface outside the acid-drop, causing it to re-expand.

two dissimilar fluids is due to a tendency towards some chemical combination of

the two, it is easy to see that if \ De the electrical charge corresponding to each

which approximates towards the quantities ohtained by other methods.

                               By J. R. Wigham, M.R.I.A.

    I. Gas Guns as Fog Signals.
     The author mentions the importance to navigation of audible fog signals, ajid
origin of gas guns. The important peculiarity of this mode of fog signalling, is that
the gun may be placed on an isolated rock at sea, probably inaccessible in most
weathers, and perhaps almost too small to hold an ordinary gun, and charged and
loaded from a position on shore. The gas gun is unaffected by the action of water.
As a practical illustration a small gun was fixed in the College Park, and charged
and fired from the lecture room. The sound of the gas gun was equal to that of
an 18 pounder. The flash of the gas gun is very useful as a fog signal, being more

vivid than that of gunpowder.

     The United States Lighthouse Board was the first to introduce the Siren as a

fog signal. The author alluded to the action of Dr. Tyndall and the Trinity
House, Sir William Thomson and Sir Richard Collinson. The Irish Siren is less

complicated and less cumbrous than those heretofore used. An Irish Siren was

exhibited on the lecture table, and sounded at the conversazione of the Royal
Dublin Society on Thursday, the 15tb inst.

      Friction between Surfaces Moving at High Velocities. By Douglas

        Galtok, C.B., D.C.L., F.R.S., Sfc.

The author of this paper has heeu recently engaged in making some experiments

upon the co-efficient of friction when the surfaces in contact move at high veloci-

ties, in  connection with  the action of brakes  in  use  on  railways                                           and the  results
                                                                                                              ;

which have been arrived at appear to present some interesting features in respect

of the laws which govern the co-efficient of friction.

The experiments were made to ascertain the friction between the brake blocks

and the wheels of a railway carriage.

The levers which move the brake blocks w-ere fitted with dynamometers to show

first, the pressure which was applied to force the blocks against the wheel; and

secondly, the force or tangential strain exerted between the wheel and the block

when the latter is pressed against the wheel.

The dynamometers used were adaptations of Richards' indicators, which act by

water pressure, which transfers the pressure to cylinders fitted with pistons to

which a pencil is attached, so as to register the pressure over a travelling sheet of

Apaper, as is used with steam indicator diagrams.         dynamometer on a similar

principle was attached to the draw bar so as to register the force exerted during-

the experiment in drawing the carriage.

The speed was also recorded on the diagram by means of the Westinghouse

speed indicator, which also acts by water pressure, and depends for its action on

the speed of revolution of the axles.

   --The carriage or van fitted with the apparatus had two pairs of wheels one

Apair of wheels was fitted with brakes, whilst the other pair was free.                                                   speed

indicator was attached to each pair of wheels, so that the speed of the carriage

could be ascertained at any time, independently of the speed of the braked wheels.

To check the Westinghouse speed iudicator, two of Stroudley's speed indicators

were also attached to the van ; but these do not register automatically.

The distribution of the weight of the van between the two pairs of wheels

was obtained, as well as the weight of the wheels and axles themselves.

In order to ascertain the weight thrown on the braked wheels during the pro-

gress of the experiment, a dynamometer fitted to the springs of the van showed

the weight at every moment carried on the unbraked wheels, from which informa-

tion it was easy to deduce the weight on the braked wheels.

The apparatus was designed by Mr. Westinghouse, and constructed under his

supervision by the Brighton Railway Company,. through whose assistance these

experiments were carried into effect.

The effect of applying the brake to the wheels is twofold. So long as the
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  439

wheels to which brakes are applied continue to revolve at the rate of rotation due
to the forward movement of the train, the effect of the brake is to create retarda-

tion by the friction between the block and the wheel ; but when the pressure

applied to the blocks causes the friction to exceed the adhesion between the wheels
aud rail, the rotation of the wheels is arrested, and the wheel becomes fixed and
slides on the rail, being held in its fixed position by the brake blocks.

   --Therefore the experiments give the co-efficient of friction 1st, between the

brake blocks and the wheel, which is equal to

                                                           the tangential force

                                                 friction of the brake blocks

                                             weight upon the wheels
      It has been generally stated that there is no difference in the co-efficient of
friction observed in the case of bodies at rest, i.e., in a condition of static friction,
and the co-efficient of friction in the case of moving bodies, i.e., in a condition of
kinetic friction ; but Mr. Fleeming Jenkin, in his paper read before the Royal
Society in April, 1877, upon the friction between surfaces moving at very low
speeds, alludes to the fact that in all cases where a difference in the co-efficient of
friction is observed between static and kinetic friction, the static friction exceeds

 the kinetic.

      Coulomb also points out in his experiments that in the case of static friction
the co-efficient of friction increased with the time during which the bodies had been

at rest.

     The experiments of Coulomb, Rennie, Morin, and Jenkin were made with bodies
moving at comparatively low velocities.

     The following table shows the mean results obtained from a large number of
the experiments made with the apparatus above described, upon the action between

--the cast-iron brake blocks and the wheels fitted with steel tvres :

slide on the rail was nearly 27,000 lbs. ; whilst at 20 miles an hour, a pressure of
about 10,300 lbs. was found sufficient to obtain the same result.

     The strain on the drawbar showed that the retarding force or the tangential
strain between the brake-blocks and the wheels followed very nearly the same law
of variation. That is to say, in order to produce a degree of friction on the wheel
at 50 miles an hour, which shall exert a retarding force on the train equal to that
at 20 miles an hour, the pressure applied to the brake blocks at 50 miles an hour
must be nearly two and a half times as great as that required at 20 miles an hour ;
and a still greater pressure is required for higher velocities.

     Therefore, whilst a comparatively low pressure woidd make the wheels slide at
low velocities, it was difficult to obtain any sufficient pressure to make the wheels
slide at velocities over 60 miles an hour.

     The figures given in the above tables must at present be accepted as only
provisional, until an accurate mean has been obtained from the diagrams, which
are not yet all worked out. But it may be assumed as an axiom that for high
velocities a brake is of comparatively small value, unless it can bring to bear a
high pressure upon the surface of the tyre almost instantaneously ; and it should

be so constructed that the pressure can be reduced in proportion as the speed of

the train is reduced, so as to avoid the sliding of the wheels on the rails.

     I must add that these experiments were made upon the London, Brighton,
and South Coast Railway, who, through their General Manager, Mr. Knight, and

Locomotive Engineer, Mr. Stroudley, gave every assistance in the construction of the
van and the running of the train. The apparatus was mainly devised by Thomas
Westinghouse, and constructed under his immediate supervision, and he assisted
mainly in the experiments, &c. The earlier experiments were also made with

the sanction of Mr. Horace Darwin.

     The authors gave an account of several investigations and experiments! made by
them during the past year upon the unequal stresses which arise in gas when
polarised, that is, in which the molecular motions are not alike in all directions;
and especially in the case where the polarisation arises from heat traversing the
gas, as within radiometers, and in the gaseous layers which support spheroidal
drops, those which protect the hand from a dangerous burn when dipped into
melted metal, and many others. In such cases the molecular motions are not

alike in all directions, and cause the stress within the gas directed across the layer

to exceed the transverse stresses by an amount which may be called the Crookes's,

or polarisation stress.
     The investigation of this stress by a direct mechanical consideration of the

molecular motions had been much facilitated by employing the conception of a

and with sides that reflect molecules by the same law that a polished surface

reflects light. By employing this conception Mr. Stoney had shown that for small

differences of temperature, and with a heater and cooler that are large, flat, parallel,
and at a fixed distance asunder, the polarisation stress will vary nearly as

    By a wholly different method, first suggested by Mr. Fitzgerald in a letter to

Clausius has calculated the stress across the layer, Mr. Stoney had obtained the
following symbolical expression for the difference between these stresses, that is,

    By applying the same method of investigation to the general case of gas

polarised in any way, Mr. Fitzgerald had obtained the expressions for the most
general stresses that can arise, radial and tangential, and had shown them to be
identical in form with the corresponding equations given by Maxwell in his electro-
magnetic theory of light.

     And, finally, by attending to the conditions indicated by the theory, Mr. Moss
had succeeded in keeping spheroidal drops in existence for upwards of an hour and

a half, and had ascertained that spheroidal drops may be supported on air

devoid of vapour. This last very important confirmation of the theory was estab-
lished by experiments on melted paraffin at temperatures at which separate experi-
ments had shown that no evaporation could be detected after a prolonged exposure

                      By G. Johnstone Stoney, M.A., F.B.S.

     In the course of the experiments referred to in the last communication a
tendency in spheroidal drops to travel about over the surface of the liquid on which
th«y rest had to be checked. This motion, where it was not simply due to con-
vection currents in the supporting liquid, was traced to differences of surface
tension, and may, by suitable arrangements, be made very swift. Thus, if sphe-

roids of spirit of wine or ether be floated on a surface of warm water, the heavy
vapour pouring down from the floating drops will, as is known, very much diminish

the surface tension of the water wherever it comes in contact with it ; and, as it

cannot be made to pour down quite symmetrically all round, the drop finds itself
on one side of the position of minimum tension, and is accordingly hurried along
one radius of the rapid surface current which travels outwards in all directions
from this point. The consequence is a very beautiful spectacle, the drops dashing

about with an appearance of great sprightliness.

 7. Sur une nouvelle Methode de Photographie Solaire et les Decouvertes
       qu'elle domie touchant la veritable nature de la Photosphere* Par Dr.

          J. Janssen.

     M. Janssen expose devant l'auditoire des specimens des photographies solaires
qui sont obtenues a l'Observatoire de Meudon.

      Oes specimens comprennent

     1° Une contre-e"preuve positive sur verre d'lm cliche ou l'image solaire a 30

 centimetres de diametre.

      2° Des tii-ages sur papier, de grandissements qui donneraient a l'image solaire
 l m 50 c de diametre.

      3° Des tirages sur papier, de grandissements de cliches originaux a une echelle
 qui donnerait 4 metres et demi de diametre a l'image solaire.

      Oes specimens demontrent qu'on obtient actuellement a Meudon les details de
la granulation solaire comme les lunettes astronomiques ne pourraient les donner,
 resultat qui justifie ce que M. Janssen avait annonce" il y a une annee environ, a
savoir, qua regard du soleil, la photographie etait un moyen tout nouveau de

 decouvertes.

      Les principes sur lesquels repose la methode qiu a permis d'atteindre ce resultat

 sont les suivants :

   --1° Une plus grande perfection des proeedes photographiques, Le collodion est

sensibilise avec des iodures et des bromures comme a l'ordinaire, mais le coton poudre

 doit etre prepare a haute temperature pour donner une couche d'une finesse suffisante.

Le developpement se fait au fer, mais lentement, et on termine par un renforcement
ik l'acide pyrogallique et au nitrate d'argent.

      2° 1? augmentation des dimensions de. Vimage solaire qui a ete porte"e successive-
ment de 10 a 12 centimetres de diametre qui etaient les dimensions ordinaires, a,
15, 20, 30, 49 centimetres et au-dela.

   L --3° 'achromatisme chimique de I'Ohjectif. Cet achromatisme a ete calcule pour

rounir en un faisceau, les rayons d'une region etroite du spectre situe pres de G.
M. Janssen a constate en eft'et que dans les tres courtes poses, ces rayons sont
les seuls actifs. Cette condition est tres importante pour la nettete des images

solaires.

      4° Enfin la duree de la pose qui a aussi une influence capitale sur le resultat.

--^ ^^C'est en reduisant cette duree de a de seconde, qu'on a pu obtenir les

granulations de la photosphere.

    Oomme il a deja ete annonce, l'examen des photographies montre que la surface

solaire est couverte d'une granulation ge"nerale. Les formes, les dimensions, la
distribution de cette granulation ne sont pas en accord avec les idt5es qu'on
s'dtait formees de ces elements de la photosphere, d'apres l'examen optique. Les
images photographiques ne confirment nullement l'idee que la photosphere soit
constituee par des elements dont les formes constantes rappelleraient des feuilles de
saule, des grains de riz, etc.

      Ces formes qui peuvent se rencontrer accidentellement en tel ou tel point, ne sont

que des exceptions, et ne peuvent etre considerees comme exprimant une loi generale

de la constitution du milieu photosphtSrique. Les images photographiques nous
conduisent a des idees beaucoup plus simples et plus rationelles sur la constitution
de la photosphere.

   --Formes des elements granulaires. Si l'on e"tudie la granulation dans les point3 ou

elle est le mieux formee, on voit que les grains ont des formes ties variees, mais qui
se rapportent plus ou moins a la forme sphdrique. Cette forme est generalement
d'autant mieux atteinte que les elements sont plus petits. Dans les grains tres
nombreux, ou les formes sont plus ou moins irregulieres, on voit que ces grains sont
formes par l'agregation d'elenients plus petits rappelant la sphere. La meme, ou la
granulation est moins nette et oil les grains paraissent tStire"s, on sent que la sphere
a t& la forme premiere des elements, forme plus ou moins niodihee par l'effet des

forces qui agissent sur ce corps.

    La forme normale des elements granidaires de la photosphere parait done se

rapporter a la sphere, et les figures irregulieres paraissent s'y rattaclier encore,

soit que l'ele'nient ait 6t6 constitue par des corps plus petits, soit que ce meme ele-

ment se trouve plus ou moins defornie par l'effet de forces etrangeres agissant sur le
milieu ou il est plonge\ II resulte encore de ces considerations une consequence

tres importante, c'est la preuve decoulant du fait meme de la grande variety des

formes des elements granulaires, que ces elements sont constitu6s par une matiere
tres mobile qui cede avec facilite aux actions exterieures. L'etat liquide ou gazeux
jouit de ces proprietes; mais en ayant egard a, d'autres considerations que nous
developperons plus tard, on est conduit a admettre pour les granulations un etat
tres analogue a celui de nos nuages atmospberiques, c'est-a-dire a, les considerer

comme des corps constitutes par une poussiere de matiere solide ou liquide nageant
dans un milieu gazeux.

   --Origine des granulations. Si la coucbe solaire qui forme la photosphere etait

dans un etat de repos et d'equilibre parfait, il resulte de sa fluidite, qu'elle formerait
une enveloppe continue autour du noyau solaire. Les elements granulaires se con-
fondraient les uns dans les autres, l'eclat du soleil serait uniforme dans toutes ses
parties. Mais les courants gazeux ascendants ne permettent pas cet etat d'equilibre
parfait. Ces courants brisent et divisent cette couche fluide en un grand nombre
de points pour se faire jour ; de la, la production de ces elements qui ne sont que des
fractions de l'enveloppe photospherique. Ces elements fractionnaires tendent a
prendre la forme spherique par la gravite propre de leurs parties constituantes ; de
la la forme globulaire qui, comme on voit, ne correspond pas a un etat d'equilibre
absolu, mais seulement relatif, celui ou la matiere photospherique, ne pouvant se
constituer en une couche continue, est divisee en elements qui tendent a prendre
individuellement leur figure d'equilibre. Mais cet etat d'equilibre individuel des
parties est lui-meme assez rarement realise ; en des points nombreux, les courants
entrainent plus ou moins fortement les elements granulaires, et leur forme globulaire
d'equilibre est alteree, jusqu'a devenir tout-a-fait meconnaissable quand les mouve-
ments deviennent plus violents.

     Ces mouvements, dont la couche gazeuse oil nagent les elements photospheriques

est incessamment agitee, ont des points detection. La surface solaire est ainsi

divisee en regions de calme et d'activite relatives, d'oii resulte la production du

reseau photospherique. En outre, dans les points memes d« calme relatif, les

mouvements du milieu photospherique ne permettent pas aux elements granulaires
de se disposer en couchede- niveau, d'ou. resulte l'enfoncement plus ou moins grand
des grains au-dessous de la surface, et par suite, en egard au grand pouvoir absor-
bant du milieu ou nagent ces elements, la grande difference d'edat des grains sur les
images photographiques.

     Ainsi, une premiere etude des nouvelles photographies nous conduit deja a.
modifier beaucoup nos idees sur la photosphere, et l'ensemble des donnees qu'elles
nous fournissent nous conduit a, cette idee si simple sur la constitution des elements
photospheriques et sur les transformations qu'ils eprouvent par Teffet des forces
auxquelles ils sont soumis.

     Tirons encore cette consequence du fait de la rarete relative des grains les plus
brillants dans les images photographiques, que le pouvoir lumineux du soleil r6side

principalement dans un petit nombre de points de sa surface. En d'autres termes,

si la surface solaire etait couverte entierement par les elements granulaires les plus
brillants qu'elle nous montre, son pouvoir lumineux serait. d'apres une premiere
approximation sur laquelle nous aurons a revenir, de dix a vingt fois plus con-

siderable.

     II est encore une grande question sur laquelle les faits precedents jettent un
jour nouveau : c'est la question si souvent debattue de la variation du pouvoir
lumineux du soleil. II est evident que les taches ne peuvent plus etre considerees
comme formant l'element principal des variations que l'astre peut eprouver, et
qu'il faudra desormais considerer le nombre et le pouvoir lumineux variable des
elements granulaires qui peuvent jouer ici un role preponderant.

      J'ajouterai enfin que l'etude des dernieres photographies montre que la surface
photospherique est dans un etat d'agitation extreme, que les elements granulaires
subissent les transformations les plus rapides a l'epoque actuelle qui est cependant

celle d'un minimum de taches, ce qui tend a demontrer que l'activite" solaire ne

s'arrete jamais, mais qu'elle prend seasiblement des formes differentes pendant les

penodes de maximum et de minimum.

     M. Janssen se reserve de revenir sur la nature precise de ces mouvements des
elements de la surface photospherique qui ont une si grande importance pour la
constitution du soleil.

succeseivement et celui de 1 seconde ne consiste qu'en une bande etroite de rayons

un peu moins refrangibles que G.

     Ces experiences ont ete faites avec des appareils en quartz et en spath.

    On a etudie a ce point de vue les collodions sensibilises avec les iodures et
bromures de Potassium, Ammonium, Cadmium, Lithium, etc., employe's isoiement
ou associes. Les spectres n'ont pas la meme etendue pour ces diverses substances,

mais le principe de la reduction a une bande subsiste toujours pour les poses tres

courtes.

     Ainsi le principe dont il s'agit est general. Cette importante propriete a des
consequences the"oriques et pratiques importantes. Relativernent a, ces dernieres il

en resulte qu'on peut obtenir des images photographiques toierables avec des lentilles
pourvu que le temps de Taction lumineuse soit tres court, ce qui est le cas pour le

soleil. On voit de plus que Tachromatisme des objectifs photographiques peut etre

obtenu beaucoup plus rigoureusement que celui des objectifs pour la vision,

puisque les rayons qu'on doit superposer n'appartiennent qu'a un point tres limite

de spectre.

    La lunette photographique solaire de TObservatoire de Meudon a ete" construite

d'apres ces principes.

9. Quelques remarques sur V eclipse totale et la Gouronne.

                         Par Dr. J. Janssen.

     M. Janssen rappelle une idee e"rnise dans son rapport sur Teclipse de 1871, idee
qu'il a deVeloppee au Congres de Glasgow.

     D'apres cette idee la couronne etant formee au moins en grande partie par des "·az
dans lesquels figure Thydrogene, les jets protuberantiels qui depassent la chromo-
sphere, doivent augmenter 1'importance de cette atmosphere coronale, et surtout
doivent lui donner, avant qu'ils se soient dissipes, une apparence tourrnente'e et

irreguliere.

Ces grandes colonnes^hydrogenees peuvent expliquer les apparences de trainees

lumineuses presentees si souvent par la couronne pendant les eclipses totales.

Lorsque ces jets protuberantiels sont tres nombreux et tres puissants, ils doivent

en outre troubler considerablement Tetat statique du fluide coronal, et la couronne

ne peut alors presenter Taspect d'une atmosphere en equilibre. La constitution et

ATaspect de la couronne doivent done varier suivant la frequence et l'importance des
protuberances.                Tepoque du maximum des jets protuberantiels, qui est a pen

pres celle du maximum des taches, Tatmosphere coronale doit, toutes choses eo-ales

d'ailleurs, presenter un aspect moins regulier, et reveler un etat plus trouble.
446 report-- 1878.

    Au contraire, a, l'epoque ou les phenomenes extraphotospheriques se calnient et

presentent leur minimum (Taction, le milieu coronal peut reprendre une figure

relativement plus reguliere et se rapproclier davantage des conditions d'ime atmo-

sphere en equilibre.
      Si nous possesions des dessins tres exacts de la figure de la couronne pendant

les eclipses totales des derniers siecles, il serait bien interessant de les etudier a ce

point de vue.
      Mallieureusement les descriptions et les dessins que nous poss^dons ne sont

gendralenient pas assez fideles ni assez prdcis pour servir tres utilement a cet objet.

    Cependant on peut considerer comme confirmaut l'idee e'mise, les observations
precises de l'eclipse de 1842 analysees par Arago. On voit en effet que la couronne

etait alors formee d'anneaux concentriques nettement terminees, ce qui indique un
6tat relatif d'equilibre. Or, l'annee 1842 6tait une epoque de minimum.

    En 1871, la couronne presentait au contraire un aspect tres tourmente que j'ai
decrit dans mon memoire. Et cette annee etait line epoque de maximum.

     Ajoutons maintenant que la couronne pendant la derniere eclipse de Juillet
1878, d'apres les premieres relations publiees, aurait <5te trouvee tres basse et d'un
aspect tout different de celui de 1870 et 1871. Nous sommes encore dans la
periode minimum, puisque les taches solaires sont encore actuellement si rares, cette
observation semble done confirmer encore l'idde que nous avons e"niise dans le
memoire de 1871 et developpee au Oongres de Glasgow.

     Nous comptons revenir sur ce point, mais nous devons faire remarquer que si
pour nous, l'aspect et la constitution de la couronne sont en dependance
avec les phenomenes protuberantiels, il ne faut pas oublier cependant que la
couronne peut encore emprunter une partie de ses aspects a des matieres cosmiques
circulant autour du soleil dans ces regions, et venant compliquer ainsi les apparences

de l'atmosphere coronale.

10. On a Neiv Form of Receiving Instrument for Microphone. By W. J.

     Millar, C.E., Sec. Inst. Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland.

Tbe author, having been engaged in experiments upon the transmission of sound

by wires without the aid of electricity or magnetism, had his attention more

particularly directed to the connection between the strains produced in the bodies

experimented upon and the sounds emitted. These experiments having been

carried out with copper wires, it occurred to the author, after the announcement of

the Microphone of Professor Hughes, that, since a magnetic needle, arranged as a

galvanometer, has certain definite motions due to the flow of the electric current,

then if the needle -wereflxed, instead of moving it would be thrown into a state of

strain, and it would then give out sounds corresponding to the changing condition

of the current. To test this, a few yards of covered copper wire were passed

lengthwise, in galvanometer fashion, along a small bar magnet ; sounds were imme-

diately detected on breaking contact, when the magnet was pressed to the ear.

These sounds were much re-inforced by placing the magnet against the shallow lid

of a pasteboard box, or by placing it on a piece of tin.

   A horse-shoe magnet with two or three yards of the same wire (about No. 30)

laid lengthwise along one of its limbs, and with the lid of a tin box placed on the

--flat sides of the ends of the magnet, made an excellent receiver speaking, singing,

&c, being easily rendered audible.

   A small form of receiver was exhibited by the author at the meeting, consisting

~ ^of a bar magnet 3 inches long, inches broad, and about inches thick. About

6 yards of No. 30 covered copper wire are passed backwards and forwards length wise

along the magnet, galvanometer fashion ; the magnet is placed in a shallow paste-

board box, and a couple of pieces of tin are laid above and below the magnet (as

this appeared to still further strengthen the sounds) ; the lid is then placed on, and

the whole is thus rendered an easily portable pocket instrument. With this instru-

ment, speaking, singing, whistling, besides other Microphone phenomena, are readily

Aobtained.  single Leclancbi cell, weakly charged, was used ; a rough form of

microphone being used as transmitter, consisting of two pieces of carbon, touching

slightly                                one of the  connecting wires  resting  over an upright msteboard box  into
                                     ;

which the sounds were directed.

  The                                   author also stated  that  he had  found  that  sounds  could be  obtained

_

without a magnet, the receiver being simply a piece of tin around which a few
yards of copper wire is wound. An arrangement of this kind was exhibited with
which various microphone phenomena had been obtained ; the sounds, however,
being much reduced in loudness.

            2. On Edmunds' Electrical Phonoscope. By W. Ladd.

    An instrument for producing figures of light from vibrations of sound. It

--consists essentially of three parts an induction coil, an interrupter, and a rotary

vacuum tube.

   --The action of the instrument is as follows : Sounds from the voice or other

sources produce vibrations on the diaphragm of the interrupter, which being in
the primary circuit of the induction coil, induce at each interruption a current in
 the secondary coil similar to the action of a contact-breaker or rheotome. There-
fore each vibration is made visible as a flash in the vacuum tube. The tube
 revolving all the time at a constant speed, the flashes produce a symmetrical figure
as the spokes of a wheel, or as in the Gassiot star. The number of spokes or radii
 are according to the number of vibrations in the interrupter during a revolution of
 the tube, and the number of vibrations being varied to any extent according to the
 sounds produced, the figures in the revolving tube will be varied accordingly. The
 same sounds always produce the same figures, providing the revolution be constant.
 In case of rhythmical interruptions being produced in a given sound, as in a trill,
 most beautiful effects are noticeable, owing to the omission of certain radii in

 regular positions in the figure.

      The uses of this instrument are the rendering visible of sounds, and showing
 the vibrations required in their production, and is a mode of confirming by sight an

 appeal to the ear.

      3. On Byrne's Compound Plate Pneumatic Battery. By W. Ladd.

      This battery is the invention of Dr. Byrne, of Brooklyn, U.S. A. The chief features
 in this battery are a compound negative plate, and a simple mechanical means for
 preventing polarisation. The negative plate consists of the extreme negative
 element platinum, backed up by a plate of copper to reduce the resistance ; the
 copper being protected by a thin sheet of lead, to prevent any local action that
 might occur owing to holes in the platinum, which would allow the exciting fluid
 to attack the copper, and a thicker sheet of lead on the back of the copper which
 is japanned. So a plate in section would show as consisting of, first, a sheet of
  platinum, then thin lead, then copper, and last, the thick japanned lead, the whole
  being soldered together to form a solid plate.

      The batteries are built up with a zinc plate and two of the compound plates
  the exciting fluid being a bichromate of potash and dilute sulphuric acid solution.

       This battery would soon become polarised but for the injection of air between
  the plates, which action appears simply mechanical and not chemical, various gases
  producing no different effects.

      "When the air is pumped in, the most extraordinary effects may be produced,
  the " quantity " being much more than that of any other battery of the same size.

     It is much used in the States for surgical operations, its extreme portability

and control rendering it peculiarly useful in this direction.
     The platinum loop can he raised to any temperature, and kept at the same

simply by the action of the foot on the bellows, leaving both hands at liberty for
operating, there also being an entire absence of fumes or other disagreeable smells.

   A battery of four small cells will heat 9 inches of No. 16 platinum wire to

redness.

           A4. Diagonal Eyepiece, for certain Optical Experiments,

                                  By Professor G. Forbes.

   A diagonal eyepiece usually consists of a piece of plane unsilvered glass in the

eyepiece, inclined at an angle of 45° to the axis of a telescope, so that light can be
sent through the object-glass, while the telescope can still be used for direct vision.
In experiments on the velocity of light, the light which has been thus sent out
is itself examined through the telescope after reflection, and it is required to have

this light as intense as possible. The diagonal glass must play two parts, which
are in a certain sense contradictory. It must reflect as much light as possible
through the telescope, and it must let as much as possible of the return light
pass through to the eye. But at the time of emission the plane glass really allows
only jLth of the whole light to pass through, and on its return j|ths are allowed

~to pass. Hence, on the whole, only a, or - 06, of the light is received. Fizeau

and Oornu used double plane mirrors of microscope glass, thus doubling the
reflection, and the latter found that he got '16 of the whole light. But this in-
creases the evil caused by defects in the transparency of the glass, the imperfection
of the polish, and the presence of dust, which, however insensible in ordinary cir-
cumstances, produce a luminous field, which is very troublesome when powerful
lights are used. To remedy this the author used a plane silver mirror, with a hole
in the centre of such a size as to permit half of the light falling on the object-

glass to pass through. In this way half of the light is sent out, and half of the
return light illuminates the eye ; so that we utilise "25 of the light, and we have

a perfectly dark field in the centre of the hole. This is theoretically four times as
powerful as an unsilvered glass reflector, and practically the darkness of field
makes it ten times as good.

A5. Clock with Detached Train. By Professor G. Forbes.

In the course of some experiments still progressing, the author has used a clock

to give electric signals every second. It was made by E. Dent and Co., and has a

train of only one wheel and one pinion. This clock only goes for one hour, but

serves the purpose for which it was made. To make it go for a longer time, it was

driven by a weight hung by a pulley on an endless chain in the usual way, and a

common 5s. Swiss alarum clock was attached, which was connected with the chain,

to wind it up continuously. This answers so well that a similar construction is sug-

gested as not only the cheapest but also the best form of a clock with escapement.

It consists of a pendulum and escapement with no train whatever, with an endless

chain or thread passing over a pulley on the axis of the scape-wheel, and also over

that of a secondary clock, hanging between them in a festoon which supports the

weight by a pulley. The secondary clock gives the hours and minutes, and the

Weclock without train shows the seconds.  thus have a clock without the errors

introduced by a train. It is a gravity escapement without the locking friction.

6. An Instrument for Indicating and Measuring the Fire-damp in Mines*
                                By Professor G. Forbes.

    The instrument exhibited consists of a resonator of variable dimensions, and a
timing-fork of definite pitch. The resonator is a metal tube 1 inch in diameter

and 15 inches long, in which a piston slides so as to regulate the length of the
tube. This tube is fixed in a block of wood, to which is attached a tuning-
fork, whose points are just above the open end of the tube. The tuning-fork is
sounded in any convenient way, and the piston is moved out and in, until the
proper length is found, which is indicated by the resonator intensifying the

sound of the tuning-fork. With practice the length can thus be determined
with an accuracy of at least 1 in 250. But the length of resonator depends
upon the density of the gas, a light gas requiring a longer resonator; and by
reading off on a scale the position of the piston we judge of its density. In
this manner 1 or 2 per cent, of fire-damp mixed with common air can be detected.
Barometric pressure produces no difference. The temperature correction is made
by reading off a thermometer of the proper dimensions in place of reading off a
fixed mark on the piston. The only error is by the presence of dense carbonic
acid gas. But carbonic acid gas tends to destroy the explosive character of fire-

damp, and it appears that if the presence of carbonic acid prevented the instru-
ment from indicating fire-damp it would certainly be sufficient to prevent the

explosive character of the fire-damp.

7. On Certain Phenomena Accompanying Rainbows*
    By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, D.Sc, B.A.

The author narrated several instances of rainbows, seen chiefly in Switzerland,

where radial streaks of light devoid of colour were observed within the primary

and without the secondary bow. The explanation suggested was as follows : The

wedge-shaped radial streaks are beams of sunlight, which become visible by diffuse

reflection from particles of matter in their path, just as the apparently divergent

beams of sunrise or sunset become visible. These " beams " being practically parallel

to one another, appear to converge in the point exactly opposite the sun by perspec-

tive ; or, in fact, just as the parallel beams of sunset appear divergent. Since the

rainbow has for its centre the point opposite the sun, such beams must have posi-

tions radial with respect to the bow. They resemble, therefore, the Rayons du

Crepuscule occasionally seen in the east at sunset. They had never been observed

Acrossing the dark space between the primary and secondary bows.  similar

phenomenon of rays might be sometimes seen in sunlight when the shadow of the

observer fell upon a slightly turbid lake or river.

    8. New Magnetic Figures. By Silvanus P. Thompson, B.A., D.Sc,

        Professor of Experimental Physics in University College, Bristol.

    The author desires to draw the attention of the Section to the series of magnetic
figures exhibited, which has recently been completed. The figures are permanently
secured on glass by a process described in recent communications to the Physical
Societies of London and Paris ; and they have also been photographed as trans-

parencies for the lantern.

     It is believed that the figures assumed by iron filings in magnetic fields of many
different kinds, in the series now produced, will be found of great use in the study
and teaching of known laws of magnetic and electrodynamic action, and also in

the experimental determination of the action of magneto-dynamic and electro-
dynamic systems and machines. Faraday discovered that the lines of force traced
out thus by iron filings possessed a significance hitherto disregarded, and revealed
indeed the very seat of the attractions and repulsions taking place between
magnetic bodies. The method had indeed been imperfectly employed by Mus-
schenbrock at an earlier date, but it only became really fruitful in the hands of
Faraday. The author has applied Faraday's reasoning to the figures produced by

                                    * < Philosophical Magazine,' October 1878.

electric currents traversing conductors in various circumstances, and finds that
from the figures alone nearly all the recognised electrodynamic, magneto-dynamic
and magneto-electric relations can he deduced or verified.

     The series of figures now presented illustrate amongst other matters the

following actions :

  (1.) The attraction (or repulsion) of magnets by magnets.
  (2.) The attraction (or repulsion) of currents by currents.
  (3.) The attraction (or repulsion) of magnets by currents.
  (4.) The rotation of magnets by currents.
  (5.) The rotation of currents by magnets.
  (6.) The rotation of a magnet round its own axis under the influence of a current.
  (7.) The repulsion by a current of its own parts.
  (8.) The mutual inductive action of solenoids and magnets, and of magnets and

               magnetic matter.
  (9.) The flow of currents in conductors and conducting media.
(10.) The action on magnets of magnetic media.
(11.) The action of magnetic instruments, magnetometer, galvanometer, electro-

               dynamometer.
(12.) The action of magneto-electro machines.
(13.) The magnetic properties of cobalt and nickel.

     The figure illustrative of the lines of force surrounding a current has been
previously given by Faraday, Guthrie, and Barrett. Those illustrative of the
attraction and repulsion of parallel currents by Faraday, but imperfectly. Those
illustrative of flow of currents in conductors by Kirchhoff, Guthrie, and Carey
Foster and Lodge. Those illustrating the action of the galvanometer and the

Gramme machine were suggested to me respectively by Mr. C. W. Cooke and

Mons. A. Niaudet. The photographs have been executed directly from the filing-
figures by Mr. Robert Gfllo, of Bridgwater, of the firni of F. York and Co., of
Notting Hill, the eminent manufacturers of photographic transparencies for the

lantern.

9. On Dimensional Equations, and on some Verbal Expressions in Numerical
        Science. By Professor James Thomson, LL.D., _D.Sc, F.B.S.

In recent years attention has been given, more than before^ to relations among

standard quantities of variable things, to be taken as units for use in giving nume-

rical expression to various quantities of those things. The quantity of each dif-

ferent variable thing selected as a unit might be, and often has been, arbitrarily

chosen, independently of the quantities chosen for units of other things. But

great advantages as to convenience and facility are attainable by making a

methodical connection among the quantities to be selected for the units of the

various things, so that when some of the units are arbitrarily selected, the others

will be derived from them in some good systematic way.

     The units thus arbitrarily selected are called fundamental units ; and the others
obtainable from them by the systematic method are called derived units.

Teaching on this subject is given in the early pages of Professor Clerk

Maxwell's 'Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism,' and in Professor Everett's

'Treatise on the Oentimetre-Gramme-Second System of Units.' The subject is
important ; but much of the nomenclature and notation hitherto used is very con-

fusing and unsatisfactory.

I now wish to propose some amendments, or new modes of expression, which

appear to be commendable.

     Instead of saying, as is done in Professor Everett's very useful treatise,

     " The unit of acceleration varies directly as the unit of length, and inversely

as the square of the unit of time ;"

I would propose to say

     The change-ratio of the unit of acceleration is the product of the change-ratio of
the unit of length and the inverse second power of the change-ratio of the unit of

time.

                            GO 2
--452 report 1878.

The meaning of the new name, change-ratio, may be given by the following

--definition.
     Definition. In respect to changes of any variable, the change-ratio is the

ratio of the new value to the old, for any change from one value of that variable to

another.

     Further, in Everett's treatise, the relation already referred to among the units
of length, time, and acceleration, is stated in some other ways, which I will next

cite:

                                                            length"
" The dimensions of acceleration are (..l. ime^y2 ·

                                                                          unit of length ,,
" The dimensions of the unit of acceleration are 7
                                                                          -,  »                                   '

                                                                                 time') 2

Instead of either of these, I would substitute this
_ .,,.«-,. change-ratio of unit of length
-- --Chang6e-ratio
          01  unit  of  acceleration = s-r                           - 7. rr ,.,. ,,
                                   (change-ratio 01 unit 01 time)-*

This expression states clearly and correctly all the truth which is meant to be con-

veyed by the previous statements.

    In order now to be enabled to speak, in language brief and free from

ambiguity, of any numerical expression whatever, whether whole or fractional,
greater or less than unity, or unity itself, I shall use the word numeric, which I

recommend for general use, to comprise all the meanings which at present are con-
veyed in common use, but with much of troublesome ambiguity, by words or
phrases such as number fraction, number or fraction, number and fraction, number

                                                                                                             ,

or proper fraction or improper fraction. I recommend that, as soon as possible,

the word number should be restricted to its only proper signification, which is often
at present designated in an objectionable way by the two words " whole number"

but which is often also expressed, and really properly so, by the single word

number*

    Now we have no right to speak of dividing one quantity by another of a dis-

similar kind, except, merely for brevity, in the case of dividing the numeric

expressing the one quantity by the numeric expressing the other quantity, after we

have fixed upon units of the two things. Thus we have no right to speak of unit

of length divided by unit of time, nor to employ, unless perhaps for brevity, and
under an implied protest, such a notation as

                        Unit of length

                                                         Unit of time

    Further, we have no right to speak of " second power of unit of time," nor of
"square of unit of time." The warns power seems admirably well suited (whether

by deliberate design entirely, or partly by good chances) for its uses in reference to

what are called powers, whether integral or fractional, of any numerics, as for

instance

                        X XX23     2 - 13        &c,                 &c.
                              ,
                           ,  X*,             .

      * Thus, for instance, in the public regulations for Post Office Savings Banks,

issued by authority of the Postmaster-General (' British Postal Guide '), the intima-
tion is made that " At these banks deposits of one shilling, or any number of shillings,
will be received," this being, however, subject to some restrictions, which need not

be mentioned here, merely assigning limits to the amounts that will be accepted

from any one person. Now the words here quoted would convey a false statement

of what the Post Office authorities really mean to announce, if the word "number "
were allowed to mean a fractional numerical expression. The announcement is
obviously framed on the presumption that the word "number " in it can only mean
legally what in the present paper is referred to as its only proper signification, that,
namely, which is commonly designated as "a whole number " or "an integer." If
an intending depositor, understanding the word " number " in the extended sense in
which it is very often, and also quite authoritatively used, would offer a deposit of
7i*., his offer would be refused, as it would amount to Is. id., which is not contem-
plated in the regulations as an amount to be accepted as a deposit.

     More examples to the same effect might be cited from usages in practical
business affairs ; and also from usages of scientific writers in arithmetic and in other

branches of mathematics, but the one here given may suffice.

and also for its uses in cases such as

                              or 2, ar 3, x-*, or 213, &c.,&c;

in any of which x may denote any numeric whole or fractional.

Such expressions as the square of the unit of time are not to he approved of.

That expression, for instance, is too like such comhinations of words as a square

second, or a square minute. It is not really quite so unreasonable, however, because

there is a good meaning sometimes intended though badly expressed, when the

square of the unit of time is spoken of, that unit being then regarded as a variable,

and the' true meaning being usually just what may be distinctly stated as the second
Apower of the change-ratio of the unit of time.
                                                                                                                                                                                      second is essentially a constant

quantity of time ; and the square of a second, a second squared, and the second power

of a second of time, are all of them essentially meaningless conjunctions of words.

    It is to be observed that anv ratio is a numeric, or may be treated as such to

any degree of approximation we please ; and so we can have the second power or

any other power of a change ratio ; and we are entitled properly to write as a frac-

tion any power of any change-ratio divided by any power of the same or of any

other change-ratio. That fraction will be itself a numeric, and may properly form

one side of an equation having a numeric for its other side.
     It follows, then, under the views already offered, as to legitimate and illegiti-.

mate modes of expression and notation, that such notations as

                                                            , yard _ 1                                                                                                                foot

                                                            (minute) 2 ~ 1200 (second)2'

which is given in Dr. Everett's Treatise (page 4), as a very expressive notation now-

becoming common, are not commendable, and are such as it is desirable promptly

Weto reject.                                       might quite rightly note that

                                                              yard_ 1 /minute\ 2
                                                            1 foot ~ 1200 V second/

but it would be illegitimate to pass from this, by imitation of a real algebraic pro-

cess, so as to write

                                                            , yard 1 (minute) 2

and thence further to make a pseudo-multiplication of both sides by foot, and a
pseudo-division of both sides by (minute) 2 , and so to bring out the seeming equa-

tion above objected to.

     The name dimensions of units is subject to a distressing ambiguity. It might :
mean the greatness or smallness of them and indeed a dimensional equation is for

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the very purpose of telling how the greatness of some units changes in accordance-
with changes made in the greatness of other units. This is not, however, the idea
which is attached to the word dimensions in dimensional equations. It is mentally

associated rather with such notions as the three dimensions in space, length,

breadth, and thickness (not to say also with the fanciful notions, so often now put
forward, of a fourth dimension in space, or a 2|th, or 4§th, or an infinite number of

other alleged dimensions in a dreamland space, not found in our world or conceived

in our brain). It has, in fact, to do with change-ratios, or powers of change-ratios
of quantitative units, whereby the magnitudes of the various units are mutually

connected, and some of them specified by reference to others. There is, I may re-

mark, for instance, in Dr. Everett's book, one article on Dimensions of Units, and

another on Dimensions of the Earth. Now the word dimensions in these two cases

has totally different meanings.

10. On Lead and Platinised Lead as a Substitute for Carbon and Platinised
    Silver, in Leclanche, Bichromate, and Smee's Batteries. By Edward
     T. Hardman, F.C.S., 8fc.

The chief objections to carbon as a positive plate are: (1) the difficulty of

preparation                                        (2) the  limited size of the plates                                                                                                (3)   their brittleness ;  and (4) th«

difficulty of ensuring perfect connection. As to the last, it often occurs that the
exciting solution makes its way upwards through the porous carbon and gradually
destroys the metallic connections, except when the cell has been very carefully

constructed. Inconveniences like this in a Leclanche electric bell battery induced

the author to substitute pieces of gas-pipe for the carbon, and this answered

admirably for months. The addition of a little hydrochloric acid occasionally to

the exciting solution of ammonium chloride being necessary.

  --Double Jluid Bichromate Battery. Ordinary sheet-lead is an effective sub-

stitute for carbon in this battery. Like all bichromate batteries, it is not constant,

requiring frequent renewal of the bichromate. The lead is practically unaffected.

  --Platinised Lead, Single Fluid Bichromate, and Smee's Batteries. Unprepared

lead is tolerably effective for the ordinary bichromate battery, but its power is

enormously increased when the surfaces are roughened, and thinly coated with

Aplatinum.                              single cell with plates about 3 inches by 4 inches will heat 4 inches

of platinum wire of about 20 gauge, and fuses the hair-like platinum wire used

sometimes to explode gunpowder.

    It is equally effective as a Smee battery. The results appear to be quite as

powerful. It answers capitally for working medical coils. The platinising is

readily effected by a process described by the author.*

    In conclusion, the author points out that large batteries can be thus constructed

very cheaply by any amateur, and that the size of the cell is almost unlimited, as

it  is easy to                          get  any sized sheet of lead                                                                                                          while with carbon cells of large size  the

plates require a multiplicity of connections.

    It is recommended to withdraw both plates from the exciting solution when

out of use. After being immersed some months, the platinum coating seems to

suffer a little, but can be easily renewed.

    Platinised lead has been recommended for Grove's battery by Callan,t but has,

I believe, never been tried in the forms I have mentioned.

11. On a Neio Form of Electro-Registering Apparatus. By Denny Lane.

    In many forms of registering apparatus the friction of the tracing point upon the

paper is so great that it cannot be overcome by the motive force of the index of the

instrument to be registered. It is proposed to move the registering pencil by inde-

pendent mechanism actuating an arm which is always kept parallel with the index.

The index is placed between two small screws on the independent arm, the ends of

j^which are so placed as to be distant                                                                                                                                        of an inch from the index, while the latter

Ais exactly parallel with the registering arm.                                                                                                                                voltaic current enters the index,

and so long as both arms are exactly parallel no current can pass to either screw.

j--If, however, the index moves                                                 of an inch, it touches one or other of the screws,

and the current is completed to one or other of two electro-magnets. This

electro-magnet attracts an armature which releases the detent of a fly train.

The train coming into action shifts the registering arm until it becomes again

parallel with the index, when the current ceases and the detent again holds the

train. By this mode the registering arm is always maintained parallel with the

index, and consequently the pencil which it carries registers the position of the

index                              but  the  motive  power is  derived from the                                                                                               springs or weights      of  the  fly  train.
                                ;

The only work which the index has to do is to make contact with one or other of

the two screws.

    Instead of wheel trains, hydraulic or pneumatic apparatus may be employed to

raise or lower the registering arm, the operation of each 'being controlled by inlet

and outlet valves wrought by the armatures of electro-magnets.

and trouble incident to the preparation and development of sensitive papers are

avoided.

     The system can also he applied to the regulation of clocks driven by revolving
pendulum or other continuous motion. The index hand may he moved by an
oscillating pendulum, and the independent hand moved by a revolving pendulum.
If the revolving pendulum train goes too slow, contact is made and the current can
be made to diminish friction on a revolving disc ; and if the train goes too fast,
the friction can be increased by the current until the two movements become
isochronous. In fact, any angular or rectilineal movement can be repeated with
any required force without imposing any sensible friction on the originating

apparatus.

                12. On an Isochronic Pendulum. By Denny Lane.

   --Every dynamic effect can be expressed by three factors weight, space, and

time. If successive events can be made exactly similar, they must occupy the
same time, and time can be measured by counting the number of such events.

     The oscillations of a pendulum are the events that are most generally employed
for this purpose, but the successive events are not exactly similar, in consequence of

variations of five kinds :

      1. Variation in temperature causing change in length of pendulum.

     2. Variation in density of the air in which pendulum moves.

      8. Ditto in viscidity of the air.

     4. Change in arc of oscillation.

     5. Change in impulse given in order to maintain arc.

      It has been the habit hitherto to introduce compensations in order to counter-
balance these variations, or some of them. I propose, instead of compensating for
variations after they have arisen, to prevent the variations from occurring, or at
least to confine them within limits so narrow that they shall not affect the time of
the oscillation.

     1st. To prevent variations of temperature the pendulum is enclosed in a case
which is kept at a constant temperature, the case being surrounded by a fluid kept
always at the same heat by a thermostat. This thermostat is a vessel filled with
an expansible liquid, like alcohol, which by variation in volume raises or depresses
mercury contained in a bent tube. The upper surface of the mercury in one leg

of the bent tube acts as a valve to increase or diminish the supply of coal-
gas to a burner, and maintains at a constant temperature the fluid sur-
rounding the pendulum case, and therefore the pendulum itself. Thus variation in
heat is prevented.

     2nd. The pendulum case is hermetically sealed, the sides being rigid, and thus
any change in the pressure of the air contained is prevented.

     3rd. The air remaining at the same temperature and pressure, any variation in

its viscidity is prevented.

     4th. All the retarding forces being equal, the arc must be equal if the impulse
given to maintain the arc remains constant.

     5th. The impulse is given to the pendulum by the intermittent action of an
electro-magnet, which is active as the pendulum descends, but loses its magnetism
as the pendulum rises. This impulse should remain the same if the current which
produces it remains the same, and this can be effected in three different ways.
Every electric current depending directly on the electro-motive force, and inversely
on the resistance, if the electro-motive force and the resistance remain the same or
retain the same ratio, the current is constant.

     (a) It is proposed to maintain the current the same by a vibrating regulator,
consisting of an adjustable armature, attached to a balance, and placed above an
electro-magnet included in the main circuit. As the current passes it attracts the
armature, which, as soon as the current ceases, is again drawn away by the action
of a counterpoise on the other end of balance. The intermittent current, therefore,
keeps the balance in vibration until the current falls below a certain fixed point,
when the vibration ceases. So long as the vibration lasts, a small funnel attached
--456 eepoet 1878.

to the vibrator diverts from a regulating cell of the battery a minute stream of

exciting fluid ; but if the vibration ceases this small stream passes on to the battery,
and so increases its power until the vibrator is again set in motion and diverts the

exciting fluid. Thus the current is continually restored to the right point, and the

impulse continues to be the same.

      (b) If the electro-motive force varies, the current can be maintained constant
by causing the resistance to vary in the same ratio. This can be effected by a very

light pendulum, having the same period as the main pendulum. Any variation in

the current wili change the arc of the light pendulum, before the heavy pendulum

is sensibly affected, and this variation of arc can be made to vary the resistance in

a solid or fluid portion of the current.

    Two vibrators may be employed, with counterpoises slightly different. If the

current is in the normal state, the light vibrator acts, but not the heavy one. If

the current be too strong, both vibrators act ; if too weak, neither. · The action of
both may be made to introduce resistance or diminish electro-motive force. The

inaction of both may diminish resistance or increase electro-motive force, so as to

restore the current to its normal condition.

(c) The variations of the arc can be confined within very narrow limits by the

Afollowing contrivance.  permanent magnet attached to a pendulum, by its

attraction for two small magnets attached to a balance or unstable equilibrium,

causes the latter to oscillate so as to make contact when the pendulum is at the

extremity, and break contact when at the middle of the arc ; the current so opened

passes through an electro-magnet placed below the pendulum, which terminates in

an armature. The current being made1 slightly stronger than is necessary for a

given arc, its oscillation increases until the permanent magnet attached to it brings

into action a balance similar to the former, but placed somewhat further from the

centre of oscillation. The action of the balance opens a second path ' for the

current, which is thus shunted from the electro-magnet, diminishes the impulse

given by the latter, and so reduces the arc again.

It is, therefore, concluded that if by any of the modes above mentioned, or any

other system of rheostal, the current be maintained constant, the impulses will be

equal, and the arc must be constant ; or, again, if the variation of the arc be kept

within very narrow limits, the time of oscillation will remain constant, and the
pendulum will remain isochronic.

      13. The Temperature of the Earth Within. By William Morris.

     The state of this question amounts to this : that we know, nor, by the methods

 hitherto pursued, can ascertain absolutely nothing of the heat of the earth within.*

      The following is a method to ascertain the temperature of the earth within,
 and, furthermore, to establish a permanent system of observation on the tem-
perature and ejectric state :

      Place one of two suitable uncompensated chronometers (provisionally so-called)
at the bottom of a (special) bore. This chronometer is to be actuated from surface
 apparatus electrically, so as in its inaccessible, buried position, to be maintained
permanently in motion, and in turn to control electrically a clock at the surface
which will indicate to an observer the time (that is, revolutions in given time),
kept below ; being susceptible to temperature, the movements of this chronometer
will be inter-dependent with the temperature below. The second of the pair,
placed on the observatory wall, with a standard thermometer hanging by it, will
indicate time (revolutions in given time) inter-dependent with the known tem-
perature of the observatory. Knowing the temperature of the observatory, and
comparing the inter-dependent time registered by the observatory chronometer
with that of the chronometer at the bore-bottom as represented by the clock
electrically controlled therefrom, we can tell readily whether the temperature of
the observatory is higher or lower than that affecting the buried chronometer.

     The electric cables can be used to lower the chronometer into the bore.

value respecting the general conditions of the earth within. Bores- in the higher
strata will give results interesting chiefly as compared with those from the deeper
rocks, and in connection with the phenomena of earthquakes and volcanos. Stations
in insular and continental, below and above sea level, and in different geological

systems, should be chosen.*

3. On a Neiv Form of Tangential Equation.^ By John Casey, LL.D., F.R.S.,

  M.R.I.A., Professor of Mathematics in the Catholic University of Ireland.

1. The tangential equation of a curve is a relation among the co-efficients in the

equation of a variable line, which being fulfilled the line must be a tangent to the

OYcurve. Thus, let be the origin, OX,  the axes, and let a variable line MN, in

any of its positions, make an angle with OX, and an intercept v on it, then the
                   <fi
MNequation of
               is

                   x + y cot (f> -- v = o.

From this it follows that if v and be given, the position of the line is fixed, and
                                                                                                                                (f>

also that any relation between v and <p such as

will be the tangential equation of a curve which is the envelope of the line.
     This form is remarkable for the facility with which it can be transformed into

all the known forms of equation, and also for the simplicity of the formulae which

it gives for metric purposes, such as rectification, curvature, &c.

     "We give here an outline of the transformations, &c, of which it is capable.

For example, the intrinsic equation of the evolute of the catenary is

                        ,".F(<£)=c/ tan <pd(p.

    This also appears from equation (11).

and by supposing n negative we have the first positive pedal of the nlh in-

volute.

    11. By reversing the reasoning in art. 9 we have tbe following theorem:
    If p = F(cp) be the polar equation of a curve, the tangential equation of its first

negative pedal is

                                  F(fl)                                              ( 18)

                                   sin cp'

    Hence the tangential equation of the first negative pedal of a conic section
from any point in its plane is

    (a  cos  2     + 2b  sin  cp  cos  cp  +b  sin  *<p)v2  sin                2
               <p                                                                <p

        +f+ 2{g cos cp            sin <p)v sin cp + c = o.

    12. The equation of the line whose envelope is the negative pedal is

                   X sin <p + y cos cp -- F(<£) = o.                                 (19)

    Hence the negative pedal is the result of eliminating cp from the equations

             x = (d>) sin cp + F'(<p) cos cp,
             y = ¥(cp) cos <p-F'(<£) sin cp.

Rectification of Bicircular Quartics.

F(15.) Being given a conic       (called the focal conic) and a circle J (called the

circle of inversion), it is known that a bicircular quartic is the envelope of a

variable circle whose centre moves on F, and which cuts J orthogonally. It is

proved in my memoir on " Bicircular Quartics " that there is a fourfold generation

of the curve, -viz., there are four focal conies, F, F', F", F'", and these are con-

focal, and the corresponding circles of inversion J, J', J", J'", are mutually ortho-

gonal. The rectification of the quartic depends on the following geometrical

theorem. In a bicircular quartic there exists a series of inscribed quadrilaterals
DAABCD, whereof the sides AB, BO, CD,
                                                        pass through the centres of the four

circles J, J', J", J"', respectively ; or, as it may be expressed, the pairs of points

(A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A) belong respectively to the four modes of generation.

Now consider the quadrilateral ABCD, and giving it an infinitesimal variation, we

have four infinitesimal arcs, AA', BB', CO', DD', which we shall denote by ds,
ds% ds", ds'", respectively ; now let the radii of the four generating circles which

touch the quartic at the four pairs of points (A, B), (B, 0), (C, D), (D, A) be p, p',

p", p'", respectively.
462 keport-- 1878.

Again let CV, C,V, be two consecutive tangents to the focal conic F of the

CVbicircular quartic, and let OAB, OA'B', he two perpendiculars to CV, CV' from
the centre of J. Now, if CV,   intersect the generating circle in RR', it is

evident from geometrical considerations that

hut RR' = pd&                    RR' = £(BB'-AA'),       consecutive  tangents to F).
Hence we have
                   (dd heing the angle hetween two

                                         ds'-ds = 2pdd,

and from the three other focal conies and circles of inversion we get three other

equations, viz. :

                                ds'-ds"=2P ' ay
                               ds"-ds'" = 2p" d6"

                               ds'"-ds =2p'" dff".

Hence we have four equations for determining any of the four quantities ds, ds',

ds", ds"', in terms of the four quantities pdd, p'dd,' p"d8," p'"d6,'" each of which
is separately expressible as the differential of an elliptic integral.

4. On tlie Eighteen Co-ordinates of a Conic in Space.
   By Wm. Spottiswoode, F.B.8., Sfc, fyc, President.

The six co-ordinates of a right line may he derived from the equations of the

two planes of which it is the intersection, by eliminating each of the co-ordinates

Wein succession.   may proceed in like manner with the equations of a conic in
--space. Let the equations be

                   =(a, b, c, d, f, g, h, I, m, n) (x, y, z, t) 2 o.
                                 ax + /% + yz + bt = o.

Then eliminating x, y, z, t, in turn, we should obtain four forms which may be

written thus :

                             (CC, BB, FF, BF, OF, BC) (y,z,ty = 0,
                           (AA, CC,GG, CG, AG, OA)'(s, x,tf = Q,

                          (BB, AA, HH, AH, BH, AB) (x,y, 2 = 0,
                         (FF, GG, HH, GH, HF, FG) (x, y, z) 2 = 0.

AThe 18 quantities A, BB, ·· , the values of which are easily calculated, are " the

18 co-ordinates of a conic in space."

    If we represent the three equations

by the formula     AAa + AB/3 + ACy = 0,
                   BAa + BB/3 + BGy = 0,
                   OAa + CB/3 + CCy = 0,

                     (A,B,C)(a,/3,y)=0.

                     A,B,C

The 18 co-ordinates will satisfy the 12 equations

(A,H,G)(o,/3, r) = 0, (H,B,F) (a,5, y) = 0, (G,F,C) (a,^,8) = 0.
A,H,G                          H,B,F
                                                         G,F,C

Eliminating a, /3, y, 8, from these we obtain the following identical relations

between the 18 co-ordinates, viz. :

 o, o, o, HH,FH,BH, GG,FG,CG, AA,BA,CA = 0.
HH,GH,AH, o, o, o, GF, FF, CF, BA, BB, CB.

HG,GG,AG, HF,FF,BF, o, o, o, CA,CB.CC.

HA,GA,AA, HB,FB,BB, GC,FC,CC, o, o, o.

These conditions are nine in number ; and, as we are concerned only with the ratios

of the co-ordinates, the total number of independent co-ordinates will be

18 -- 9 -- 1 = 8, as it should be.

--result which M. Soraoff claims to have been the first to establish* that the

existence of equal roots in Lagrange's determinantal equation of small oscillations

does not affect the stability of the system. It is further shown that the same con-
clusion holds for a certain system of differential equations of the first degree having

also a physical application.

mNow, by suitable transformation of this latter system it is shown that when

roots of the determinental equation are equal, the common value being k, the cor-

mresponding system of £s involves -- 1 arbitrary parameters. Hence in this case,
mon the one hand, distinct integrals of the oscillation system are merged in one

mmeters implicitly involved in its left-hand member, is equivalent to                                                             distinct

integrals.

     The occurrence of equal roots in the determinantal equation therefore only

diminishes the number of distinct vibration periods, without affecting either the
periodic form of solution or the number of distinct integrals.

   A second method is employed by the author, based on the theory of orthogonal

   9. On Halphen's New Form of Chasles's Theorem on Systems of Conies
        satisfying Four Conditions. By Dr. T. Archer Hirst, F.B.S.

     The theorem in question is expressed by the formula
                                              n = +afx /3i>,

where p and v are the characteristics of the system of conies satisfying four of the
five conditions, and a and j3 are numbers which depend solely upon the fifth con-
dition. Amongst the n conies given by the formula degenerate ones are, of course,
included, provided they satisfy the five conditions.

    From Halphen's new form of the theorem, however, these degenerate conies are
excluded, and the result is the number of proper conies which satisfy the five

conditions in question. Halphen's paper will be published shortly in the ' Proceed-

ings of the London Mathematical Society.'

10. On the Laiv of Force to any Point when the Orbit is a Conic.

                By J. W. L. Glaisher, M.A., F.B.S.

1. Sir W. R. Hamilton, in the 'Proceedings ' of the Royal Irish Academy for

1846 (vol. iii., p. 308), proved that if a body be attracted to a fixed point, with a

force varying directly as the distance from that point, and inversely as the cube of

the distance from a fixed plane, the body will describe a conic, of which the plane

intersects the fixed plane in a straight line, which is the polar of the fixed point

with respect to the conic. The author showed that if the distance of any point

from the fixed point         be denoted by r, and if the perpendicular from any

Ppoint upon the fixed plane be denoted by p, so the law of force to is, ac-

cording to Sir W. R. Hamilton's law, ^ ,then the periodic time is i--p$, where
                                                                                                                          3

p denotes the perpendicular from the centre of the orbit upon the fixed plane.
For example, if the plane of motion is parallel to the fixed plane, p is constant,

It follows also that all the orbits having their centres in the same plane parallel to
the fixed plane are described in the same periodic time.

     2. Considering only the case of motion in the plane of xy, and combining the

above theorem with formulae given by MM. Darboux and Halphen (' Comptes

Rendus', t. 84, pp. 760-762, 936-941), it follows that if the orbit

13 On Certain Linear Differential Equations. By the Rev. Robert Harley,

                                                          F.B.8.

By an ingenious application of Murphy's theorem, Mr. Eawson has shown that

            n

hraical equation

                                    ym + ayr + bx = o. . . . (a),

                    dx              a(m -- r) ax                          m

                        dx m -- r dx

Mr. Rawson has also shown how the " differential resolvent " of (a) may he calcu-
lated hy means of the equations (/3) and (y), when particular values are assigned

mto and r. The object of this paper is to show, first, that Mr. Rawson's differen-

tial equations may be readily derived from the algebraical equation, without the aid

of Murphy's theorem, by a process suggested by Professor Oayley ; and, secondly,

that Mr. Rawson's results may be generalised and presented in a compact symbo-

lical form.                                                                                 (1)
     It will be convenient to deal with the equation

mwhich is unaltered when a, are interchanged with b, r.                                     Differentiate (1) with

respect to x, and multiply the result into y", then

                        (amym+n~ x             +  bi-y  r+n  ~  r     y'  + cy"  = o,

                                                                   )

where differentiation is denoted by an accent ; but

                                 myn~l (aym + brf + ex) y' = o;

whence,  eliminating     m+  n  ~\  we  have

                                        y

which, summing for any number if the roots of y, gives

                                    b \m -- r                            m-r "/

which case each of the differential equations reduces to an order lower by unity
than itself, in accordance with the theory of differential resolvents. The author

noticed other cases in which, for particular values of n, the differential equations

admit of reduction.
     The passage from the symbolical to the ordinary form of linear differential

equations was shown to involve no practical difficulty.

To prove this, consider the partial differential equation

                         dx2 ~ av ~x'i dh'i                                                                                         l'

A particular integral of this is

                                            _ +y ea*J(.x" xh)

for from this value of v we obtain at once by differentiation
                                                                                                             w

whence we see that (2) isi satisfied.

     Let the above value off v be expanded in ascending poweirs of h, so that

the form 4m + 8 enumerated separately.

  --I. Prime-pairs. By a prime-pair is meant a pair of primes separated by only

one  number                                  thus, 11  and  13, 17  and  19, 29  and 31, &c, are prime-pairs.  It is
                                          ;

clear that as the number of primes decreases as we ascend higher in the series of

numerals, the number of prime-pairs must decrease also, and the object of the

enumeration was to examine 'u rapidity of this decrease. The enumerations

relate to the first hundred chiliads (100,000 numbers) of each of the six millions

over which Burckhardt's and Dase's t ables extend ; and the number of prime-pairs

is 69, &c. Thus, for example, the number of prime-pairs between 7,070,000 and
7,080,000 is 54 ; and between 8,090,000 and 8,100,000 is 43.

     The total number of prime-pairs between and 100,000 is 1225 ; between
1,000,000 and 1,100,000 is 725 ; . . . and between 8,000,000 and 8,100,000 is 518, as
shown in the last line of the table ; and it is interesting to compare these with the
numbers of primes between the same limits which are respectively 9,593, 7,216,
6,874, 6,397, 6,369, 6,250. The numbers of prime-pairs are thus rather less than
one-tenth of the numbers of primes in the same intervals. It should be stated that

among the prime-pairs 1 and 3, 3 and 5, 5 and 7 are counted (2 being ignored),
and that among the primes 1 and 2 are both counted. In the 600 chiliads, the
greatest number of prime-pairs contained in any one chiliad is 36 in the first
chiliad ; while one chiliad (8,014,000--8,015,000) contained no prime-pair. For

viii. pp. 28-33 (June, 1878).

rise to the same period, though the commencement is made in each case at a

different place.

     Considering periods in which the digits and their cyclical order are the same

(though the commencement may be made at a different place) as the same period,
we see that 39 has four periods, each containing 6 digits. In general, the number q
(supposed prime to 10) will have/ periods each containing a figures, a and/being

connected by the equation af= (f> (q), where <f> (q) denotes the number of numbers less

than q and prime to it. Calling the period to which - belongs, the leading period,

if the remainder q - 1 belongs to the leading period, the two halves of each period

will be complementary, while if it does not, the periods will form pairs, the periods

in each pair being complementary to one another. The theory is rendered much

more simple if all the periods be considered, than if attention be confined to the

leading period.

    The author had formed a table showing the values of a and/ for each number

           ^

prime to 10 up to 1000: this table was obtained by counting the number of

periods and the number of digits in each period in Henry Goodwyn's ' Table of

Circles                                   (1823), which  gives  all  the  periods  of  the                                      numbers  prime  to  10  up  to  1024.
                                       '

The table was verified by multiplying the values of a and /, which, in every case
was found to be equal to<ji(q). Other such tables that have been given have

usually related only to primes, and to the number of digits in the period. There is

a table of periods in vol. ii. of Gauss's ' Werke,' pp. 412-434, but it is less complete

than Goodwyn's. With regard to the number of figures in the periods of numbers,

Qit is known that if the periods of the primes N, P, . . . contain respectively
NPQn, p, q . . . digits, then
                                                                . . . has a period of a figures, a being the least com-

mon multiple of n, p, q . . . . The demonstration does not apply to the case of the

Npower of a prime. Generally, it is found that N* has a period of «N digits, 3 of
NnN2 digits, &c, but for an obvious reason this is not true when = 3, and also it
Nis not true when = 487 ; for 487 has a period of 486 digits and 4872 has also a

period of 486 digits. It is, however, true for all other primes less than 1000, so

Qthat if N, P, be. . . any primes, each less than 1000 (3 and 487 excepted), the

period of N'P^Q*. . . contains a digits, a being the least common multiple of wN"-1                                                                                   ,

Desmarest ('Theorie des Nombres,' 1852, p. 295), who seems to have determined

by actual division that no other prime up to 1000 possessed the same property.

In the event of a prime p being a factor of its period, we have 10p-1 = 1 (mo&.p2).
By Fermat's theorem, we know that 10?-' = 1 (mod. p), but the theorem throws no
light upon whether 10"-1 = 1 (mod.^u2). The question was proposed by Abel in t. iii.

p. 301 of the same volume, who showed that 3 ,0 =1 (mod. II 2), 1428 = 1 (mod. 292),
and 1836 = 1 (mod. 372 ). (See also Jacobi's ' Canon Arithmeticus ' (1839), p. xxxiv).

Desmarest, in fact, obtained a solution of the congruence a?-l =l (mod. p") for

x = 10, viz. =10486 1 (mod. 4872 ). The fact that only one value of p should occur up

to 1000 for which the congruence is satisfied is not remarkable when the diminu-

tion of the probability of a number being a factor of its period, as we ascend in the

series of primes, is considered. Regarding the period merely as a number taken at

random, we can see how small is the chance that a large prime should leave a zero

remainder when divided into its period ; but there is no reason to suppose that

there  are  not values  of  p  for  which       lO?-1 = 1       (mod.  p3       &c.

17. Elementary Demonstration of the Theorem of Multiplication of Determi-

nants. By M. Falk, Docens of Mathematics in the University of TJpsala.

     The present article is intended to give a rigorous demonstration of the im-
portant theorem above mentioned, founded upon the same elementary principles
(elimination between two systems of equations) as the demonstration which is
given by Brioschi in his excellent Treatise on Determinants, and is reproduced by
Schellbach in his German translation of this work. To the demonstration of
Brioschi, I think one must object that it is incomplete, as taking no account of the
numerators of the two quotients, from the equality of which that of the denomi-

nators is concluded.

    In the following we use the notations

                        {(uv)       =  uv       +  u2v2  +

     1) Developing the determinant of the left member, the following identity
becomes immediately proved :

                                                                                                                              lb &

                                                                                                     y» y*

     Thus the theorem holds for determinants of the second order.

     2) Suppose the theorem hold for determinants of the --(n l) st order, i.e., sup-

pose that

(6) A^D.a;

then it shall he proved that

                                                                            A = DA.

     Now, Aj  being  a  certain                minor of A,                       we denote                by     Av    A      ...,   A,,  the  minors of A
                                                                                                                          2,

which correspond to the constituents of its first column. Then, by a known pro-

perty of determinants, we have the identities:

                           QjAj                +         /3jA            +  yi A 3      +     ...,   +  , Kl A,,  =  A,
                                                                      x

                           =a.jAj +                                      +              +            +
                                                          A.                7.1A3             ,...,       KoA,i      o,

    Multiplying these equations by «,,«._>, a 3 ,...,a,, respectively, and adding them, we
obtain the first of the next following equations. In the same manner, the others

are obtained by using as successive multipliers the constituents of every one of the

other rows in D. By the notations (1) we thus get

18. Un the Motion of Two Cylinders in a Fluid. By W. M. Hicks, M. A.

     The motion of two infinite parallel cylinders in an infinite fluid, and the motion

of one cylinder inside another full of fluid, were considered. In the second case,

when the inside cylinder (rad = b) moved as a pendulum about the axis of the
bounding one (rad = a), it was shown that the time of vibration was changed in the

ratio

                 (t7h^{ M+3M>832~S }>

Mwhere M,    x   are the masses of unit of length of the cylinder, and of the fluid

displaced thereby ; x = a -- b and L depends on the distance between the centres.

     In the particular case where the inside cylinder touches the outside throughout
the motion it was shown that

                                    L = l + 2.t-2-^logr(l + .r)

tables of which function are given by Legendre and De Morgan.

The more general problem was then discussed, and formulas obtained for the

motion of an infinite fluid in which two cylinders rest, and in which a source of

fluid exists. Thence the velocity potential for any motion of the cylinders was

deduced, and the kinetic energy of the fluid. It was shown that (w, vf ; v, v',
being the velocities along and perpendicular to the line joining the centres of the

cylinders), the kinetic energy was

             PV2T = Pi*2 + (tto2 + P) v2 +          2 + (wb2 + P>'2 + 2L(w' - im'),

   4. On the Tides of the Southern Hemisphere and of the Mediterranean.
           By Capt. Evans, R.N., and Sir William Thomson, LL.D.

    On the coasts of the British Islands and generally on the European coasts of the

North Atlantic and throughout the North Sea, the tides present in their main fea-
tures an exceptional simplicity, two almost equally high-waters and two almost
equally low-waters in the twenty-four hours, with the regular fortnightly inequality
of spring tides and neap tides due to the alternately conspiring and opposing actions
of the moon and sun, and with large irregular variations produced by wind. Care-
ful observation detects a small " diurnal " inequality (so called because it is due to
tidal constituents having periods approximately equal to twenty-four hours lunar or
solar), of which the most obvious manifestation is a difference at certain times of
the month and of the year between the heights of the two high-waters of the
twenty-four hours, and at intermediate times a difference between the heights of
the two low-waters.

     In the western part of the North Atlantic and in the North Sea this diurnal
inequality is so small in comparison with the familiar twelve-hourly or "semi-
diurnal " tides that it is practically disregarded, and its very existence is scarcely a
part of practical knowledge of the subject ; but it is not so in other seas. There
is probably no other gi-eat area of sea throughout which the diurnal tides are
practically imperceptible and the semi-diurnal tides alone practically perceptible.
In some places in the Pacific and in the China Sea it has long been remarked that
there is but one high water in the twenty-four hours at certain times of the month,
and in the Pacific, the China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the West Indies, and very
generally wherever tides are known at all practically, except on the ocean coasts
of Europe, they are known to be not " regular " according to the simple European
rule, but to be complicated by large differences between the heights of consecutive
high-waters and of consecutive low-waters, and by marked inequalities of the suc-
cessive intervals of time between high-water and low-water.

    On the coasts of the Mediterranean generally the tides are so small as to be not

perceptible to ordinary observation, and nothing, therefore, has been hitherto gene-
rally known regarding their character. But a first case of application of the
harmonic analysis to the accurate continuous register of a self-recording tide-gauge
(published in the 1876 report of the B.A. Tidal Committee) has shown for Toulon a
diurnal tide amounting on an average of ordinary midsummer and mid-winter full

and new moons to nearly -- of the semi-diurnal tides ; and the present commu-

                                         o
nication contains the results of analysis showing a similar result for Marseilles ; but,
on the other hand, for Malta, a diurnal tide (similarly reckoned), amounting to only

-- of the semi-diurnal tide. The amount of semi-diurnal tide is nearly the same in

4£ . .

the three places, being, at full and new moon, about seven inches rise and fall.
     The present investigation commenced in the Tidal Department of the Hydro-

graphic Office, under the charge of Staff-Commander Harris, R.N., with an exami-
nation and careful practical analysis of a case greatly complicated by the diurnal

inequality presented by tidal observations which had been made at Freemantle,
Western Australia, in 1873-74, chiefly by Staff-Commander Archdeacon, It.N., the
officer in charge of the Admiralty Survey of that Colony. The results disclosed

very remarkable complications, the diurnal tides predominating over the semi-

diurnal tides at some seasons of month and year, and at others almost disappearing
and leaving only a small semi-diurnal tide of less than a foot rise and fall. These
observations were also very interesting in respect to the great differences of mean
level which they showed for different times of year, so great that the low-waters
in March and April were generally higher than the high-waters in September and
October. The observations were afterwards, under the direction of Captain Evans
and Sir William Thomson, submitted to a complete harmonic analysis, worked out
by Mr. E. Roberts. Not only on account of the interesting features presented by

this first case of analysis of tides of the southern hemisphere, but because the
south circumpolar ocean has been looked to, on theoretical grounds, as the origin of
the tides, or of a large part of the tides, of the rest of the world, it seemed
desirable to extend the investigation to other places of the southern hemisphere for
which there are available data. Accordingly the records in the Hydrographic Office
of tidal observations from all parts of the world were searched ; but besides those of
Freemantle, nothing from the southern hemisphere was found sufficiently complete
for the harmonic analysis except a year's observations of self-registering tide-gauge

at Port Louis, Mauritius, and personal observations made at regular hourly, and
sometimes half-hourly, intervals for about six months (May to December) of 1842,
at Port Louis, Berkeley Sound, East Falkland, under the direction of Sir James
Clark Ross. These have been subjected to complete analysis.

     So also have twelve months' observations by a self-registering tide-gauge
during 1871-72 at Malta, contributed by Admiral Sir A. Cooper Key, K.C.B.,

     Tide-curves for two more years of Toulon (1847 and 1848), in addition to the
one (1853), and for Marseilles for a twelvemonth of 1850-51, supplied by the
French Hydrographic Office, have also been subjected to the harmonic analysis.

     These results, both for the southern hemisphere and the Mediterranean, will
form the subject of a paper which Captain Evans and Sir William Thomson hope
to communicate to the Royal Society in the course of the coming session. In the
meantime the numbers resulting from the harmonic analysis are submitted without
further comments to the British Association for comparison with those for other
places in previous Reports of the Tidal Committee. Those of them which represent
the most important of the diurnal and semi-diurnal tides are shown in the following
table, which includes also for immediate comparison the results for Toulon, 1853.

     It in every case denotes, as in previous tables of the British Association Com-
mittee, the range of the particular tidal constituent on either side of mean level ;
so that 2-R is the whole rise from lowest to highest of the individual constituent.
(In comparing results with those shown in the Admiralty Tide Tables, it must be
borne in mind that in the latter it is the rise above the level of ordinary low water

spring tides that is given as " heights."

c (technically called the epoch) is the angle, reckoned in degrees, which an arm

revolving uniformly in the period of the particular tide has to run through till high

  --Definition of e* To explain the meaning of the values of e given in the

perigee.

     The value of e in each case above means the number of 360ths of its period
which the corresponding tidal constituent has still to execute till its high-water

from the instant when the ideal star crosses the meridian of the place. Thus if
n denote the periodic speed of the particular tide in degrees per mean solar hour,

its time of high-water is -» reckoned in mean solar hours after the transit of the

ideal star.

     In this definition, and in the table of results, the following notation is em-

ployed : f

     1 to denote the mean inclination of the moon's orbit to the earth's equator

during the time of the series of tidal observations included in each instance.

     v to denote the mean right ascension of the ascending node of the moon's orbit
on the earth's equator during the same time.

     y to denote the angular velocity of the earth's rotation.
     a- to denote the mean angular velocity of the moon's revolution round the

earth.

     rj to denote the mean angular velocity of the earth round the sun.

     or to denote the angular velocity of progression of the moon's perigee.

    _" Speed " means the angular velocity of an arm revolving uniformly in the
period of any particular tidal constituent ; each angular velocity being reckoned in
degrees per mean solar hour.

   8. On the Precession of a Viscous Spheroid. By Gr. H. Darwin, M.A.,

                                 Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

      I have teen engaged for some time past in the investigation of the precession of
 a viscous spheroid, with the intention of seeing whether it would throw any light

on the history of the earth in the remote past. As some very curious results have

 appeared in the course of the work, I propose to give an account of part of them to

 the British Association.

     The subject is, however, so complex and long, that no attempt will be made

 even to sketch the analytical methods employed.

     In a paper of mine, read before the Royal Society in May last, a theory was

 given of the bodily tides of viscous and imperfectly elastic spheroids; and this
 paper formed the foundation of the present investigation.

      For convenience of diction, I shall speak of the tidally disturbed body as the
earth, and of the disturbing bodies as the moon and sun ; moreover, in all the
numerical applications, the necessary data were taken from these three bodies.

    An analytical investigation proved that

     The action of the sun and moon on the tides in the earth is such, that the obli-
quity to the ecliptic and the lengths of the day and month all become variable

the alteration in the length of the year remains, however, quite imperceptible.
      The effect of the internal friction called viscosity is, that the bodily tides in the

earth lag, and are less in height, than they would be if the earth were formed of a

perfect fluid.

    A general explanation was then given as to how the lagging of the tides pro-

duces the effects above referred to.*

    And it appeared therefrom that when the viscosity is such that the bodily tides

do not lag by very much, there is an increase of the obliquity to the ecliptic, a
retardation of the earth's rotation, and a retardation of the moon's mean motion.

     In this general explanation it was assumed that the lagging tides were exactly
the same as though the earth were perfectly fluid or elastic, and as though the
tide-raising moon were more advanced in her orbit than the true moon, whilst the
moon which attracts the tidal protuberances was the true moon. That is to say, it
was assumed that the tides raised were exactly the same as though the earth were
perfect fluid, save that the time of high tide is late, and that the tides are reduced

in height.

    Now, although this serves in a general way to explain the phenomena which

result from the supposition of the earth's viscosity, yet it is by no means an

accurate representation of the state of the case.
     In fact, the internal friction sifts out the whole tide-wave into its harmonic

constituents) and allows the different constituents to be very differently affected as
regards height and phase.

     Thus the lagging tide-wave is not exactly such as the general explanation sup-
posed, and the nearer does the spheroid approach to absolute rigidity the greater
does the discrepancy become.

     The general explanation is a very fair representation for moderate viscosities

                                      * See 'Nature,' September 26, 1878.

but for large ones it is so far from correct that the tendency for the obliquity to

vary may become nil ; and for yet larger ones the obliquity may tend to decrease.

shows that there is a great variety of positions of dynamical equilibrium, some of
which are stable and some unstable.

Although there is all this variety with respect to the change of the obliquity,

yet the tidal friction always tends one way, namely, to stop the earth's rotation.

    It was shown in the general explanation that the effect on the moon is a force

tangential to her orbit accelerating her linear motion, and thus indirectly retarding

her angular motion. But it appears that for a very great degree of stiffness, and

for large inclinations of the earth's axis to the ecliptic, this force on the moon may

be actually reversed ; so that the retardation of the moon's motion may actually

be replaced by an acceleration. To a terrestrial observer, however, unconscious of

the slackening of the earth's diurnal rotation, it would be indifferent whether the
moon were undergoing true retardation or true acceleration ; for in every case there
would result an apparent acceleration of the moon's mean motion.

It is obvious from what has been said that we have the means of connecting

the heights and lagging of the bodily tides in the earth with an apparent secular

acceleration of the moon's mean motion. I have applied these ideas to the supposi-
tion that the moon has an apparent secular acceleration of 4" per century, and I

find that if the earth were a homogeneous viscous spheroid, then the moon must

be undergoing a secular retardation of u"'Q per century, while the earth (considered

as a clock) must be losing 14 seconds in the same time. Under these circumstances,

the effective rigidity of the earth must be so great that the bodily diurnal and semi-

diurnal tides would be quite insensible ; the bodily fortnightly tide would, however,

be so considerable that the oceanic fortnightly tide would be reduced to one-seventh

of its theoretical amount on a rigid nucleus, and the time of high water would be

accelerated by three days.

The supposition that the earth is a nearly perfectly elastic body leads to very

different results                                                             which, however, I must now pass over.
                                                                           ;

From this and various other considerations I arrive at the conclusion that the

apparent acceleration of the moon's motion affords no datum for determining the
amount of tidal friction on the earth.

Sir William Thomson has made some interesting remarks about the probable

age of the earth in connection with tidal friction, and he derived his estimate of

the rate at which the diurnal rotation is slackening principally from the secular

acceleration of the moon. He fully admitted that his data did not admit of pre-
cise results ; but if I am correct in the present conclusion, it certainly appears that

his argument must lose part of its force.

The investigation of the secular changes which such a system would undergo is

surrounded by great mathematical difficulties, but I think that I have succeeded in

surmounting them by methods, partly analytical and partly arithmetical.

In a communication of the present kind it would be out of place to consider the

methods employed, and I will therefore only speak of some of the results.

There are two standards by which we may judge of the viscosity in the present

problem ; first, the ordinary one, in which it is asserted that it requires so many

pounds of tangential stress to the square inch to shear an inch cube through so

much in such and such a time ; and secondly, when the viscosity is judged of by

the amount by which the behaviour of the spheroid departs from that of a perfectly

Afluid one.  numerical value for this sort of measure is afforded by the angle by

which the crest of the tidal spheroid precedes the moon, when the obliquity to the

ecliptic is zero.

    Now it appears that if the earth possessed a viscosity which was not at all

great, as estimated by the tidal standard, yet the materials of the earth, when

--considered in comparison with the substances which we know, would be found to

be a substance of very great stiffness stiffer than lead, and perhaps nearly as stiff

as iron. I see, therefore, no adequate reason why some part of the changes, which

will be considered presently, should not have taken place during geological history.

     The problem was solved numerically for a degree of viscosity which would

make the changes proceed with nearly a maximum rapidity; estimated by the
                                                    112
--484 kepobt 1878.

tidal standard, this is neither a very great nor a very small viscosity, for the crest

of the semi-diurnal tide precedes the moon hy 17° 30'.

     I found, then, that if the changes in the system are tracked hack for 56 million

years, we find the day reduced to 6 hours 50 minutes, the obliquity to the ecliptic

9° less than at present, and the moon's period round the earth reduced to 1 day

14 hours.

     This very short period for the moon indicates of course that her distance from
the earth is small. As the moon goes on approaching the earth, the problem
becomes much more complex ; and for periods more remote than 56 million years
ago, I abandoned the attempt to obtain a scale of times. The solution up to this

point shows that the times requisite for these causes to produce such startling

effects are well within the time which physicists have admitted to have elapsed

since the earth existed.

    From this point in the solution the parallel changes of the obliquity, day and

month, were traced without reference to time.

It appears, then (still looking backwards in time), that the obliquity will only

continue to  diminish a little more beyond  the point already reached                                                                                                                      for when the
                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

month has become equal to twice the day there is no longer any tendency for the

obliquity to diminish, and for yet smaller values of the month the tendency is to

increase again.

    From this we learn that when the day is equal or less than half the month,

the position of the earth's axis at right angles to the plane of the moon's orbit is

one of dynamical stability. The whole decrease of obliquity from the present value
back to the critical point, where the month is equal to twice the day, is 10°.

    From this point in the solution back to the initial state to which the earth and

moon are tending, the obliquity to the plane of the lunar orbit was neglected. I
then found that the limiting condition, beyond which it was impossible to go, was
one in which the earth and moon are rotating, fixed together as a rigid body in 5
hours and 40 minutes. This condition was also found to be one of dynamical in-
stability, so that if the month had been a little shorter than the day, the moon
.aiust have fallen into the earth ; but if the month had been a little longer than the
day, the moon must have receded from the earth, and have gone through the series

of changes which were traced backwards up to this initial condition.
    This periodic time of the moon of 5 hours 40 minutes corresponds to an interval

of only 6,000 miles between the moon's centre and the earth's surface. Moreover,
if the earth had been treated as heterogeneous instead of homogeneous, this interval

between the primeval earth and moon would have been yet further diminished, as
also would be the common periodic time. The conclusion, therefore, appears to me
almost irresistible, that if the moon and earth were ever molten viscous bodies, then
they once formed parts of a common mass.

     With respect to the obliquity of the ecliptic, the question is one of considerable

difficulty ; but on the whole I incline to the view that while a large part of the

obliquity may be referred to these causes, yet that there remains an outstanding

part which is not so explicable.
     Besides the results of which the outlines have been given, I have obtained some

others which, as I believe, will aid in the formation of a modified edition of the

--nebular hypothesis such as some of the changes to which an annular satellite

would be subjected.
     One of the collateral results which appeared in considering the secular changes

of such a system fas the earth, moon, and sun, was that a large amount of heat
would have been generated in the interior of the earth by means of friction. If,
then, it is permissible to suppose that any considerable part of these changes have

taken place during geological history, Sir William Thomson's problem of the secular
cooling of the earth would require some modification.

    The magnitude of the undertaking has not allowed me time as yet to apply

these ideas to the questions of the eccentricity and inclination of the orbit of the

satellite, nor to the cases of other planets besides the earth.

    I think, however, that I see in Asaph Hall's wonderful discovery of the Mar-

tian Satellites a confirmation of this theory. Their extreme minuteness has, I
                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  485

think, preserved them as a standing memorial of the primitive period of rotation of
that planet. The Uranian system, on the other hand, appears, at least at first sight,

a stumbling-hlock.

     It is easy to discern in the planetary system many vera causae, which tend to

change its configuration ; but it is in general very hard to give any quantitative

estimate of their effects.
     It will have been seen that, in the investigation of which I have given an im-

perfect account, free scope has been given to speculation, but that speculation has
been governed and directed in every case by appeal to the numerical results of a
dynamical problem, and I therefore submit that it stands on a different footing from
the numerous general speculations to which the nebular hypothesis has given rise.

9. On the Limits of Hypotheses regarding the Physical Properties of the Matter
   of the Interior of the Earth. By Professor Henry Hennesst, F.E.S.

    The author pointed out that every hypothesis of a philosophical character must
conform to the condition of not being in contradiction to observed facts. The known
physical properties of solids, liquids, and gases were referred to, and the bearings
of such properties on the problems regarding the earth's structure were indicated.
Mathematical inquiries, which started from supposing an incompressible liquid en-
closed in a compressible and elastic envelope, could not lead to conclusions at all

invalidating the opinion held by the author. He supported his views by deductions

drawn from the observed properties of solids and liquids, and not from hypotheses
of unreal and impossible properties of these substances such as formed the basis of
the elaborate and learned mathematical labours of Sir William Thomson and
Mr. Darwin. The views he had long since maintained in opposition to the con-
clusions of the late Mr. Hopkins regarding the earth's solidity had been discussed
in a manner satisfactory to the author in the Academy of Sciences of Paris,* when
he had formally laid his views before that scientific body, and his subsequent
studies had led him to maintain the correctness of his original views respecting the

earth's internal fluidity .f

10. On the Climate of the British Islands.
   By Professor Henry Hennessy, F.R.S.

The author laid before the Section the results of- the discussion on temperature

observations made at a great many stations in Great Britain and Ireland tabulated

in isothermal groups. He pointed out the lines of equal temperature over the

British Isles deduced from these observations conformed to the same general law

--as that which he had communicated to the Association at former meetings namely,

that the isothermal lines are similar to the coast lines, and that some of the former

may be even closed curves. He showed that an untrue representation of tempera-

ture would be produced by introducing the artificial correction of 1° Fahrenheit

for every 300 feet above the sea level derived from observations in balloons ; and

he explained that it was owing to this untenable mode of altering the results of

observations of temperature that some recent maps deviate from those he had

originally produced. Among the absurd consequences of this artificial alteration

of observed results, he remarked that actual temperatures were in some instances

raised from 43° 6' to 47° 3', from 43° 3' to 47° V, from 42° 2' to 46° 6', and from

A44° 4' to 48° 8'.  map of the distribution of plants would in these cases present

a semi-alpine or semi-arctic flora in contact with isothermal lines corresponding to

the flora of temperate regions. He maintained that the general law of distribu-

tion of temperature in islands surrounded by warm water currents, which he had

            2. A New Form of Polariscope.

By Professor William Grylls Adams, M.A., F.B.S.

This instrument has been constructed by Mr. S. 0. Tisley, on the principle com-

municated by the author to the Physical Society of London (see ' Proc. Phys. Soc.'

Vol. i. p. 152, and 'Phil. Mag.,' July 1875). The advantages gained by it are--
(1) an extensive field of view ; (2) an accurate means of measuring the rings and

the separation of the optic axes in biaxal crystals.

The polarizer is a Nicol's prism, capable of giving a clear parallel beam of

polarized light 2\ inches in diameter ; this beam falling on a system of lenses, is

brought to a focus at the point where the crystal is placed. The beam, after passing

through the crystal, is rendered parallel again by another system of lenses, and

passes through a similar Nicol's prism and another lens for focusing upon the

screen. The peculiarity of the instrument consists in the arrangement of the two

-- --central lenses, one on either side of the crystal. These two lenses are plano-

convex very nearly hemispheres and, with their flat surfaces inwards, form the

two sides of a box to hold oil or a liquid ; they are so placed that their convex

surfaces form portions of the same spherical surface. The crystal is placed in the

box at the centre of curvature of the spherical surfaces of the two lenses.

For measurement, the crystal is immersed in oil, and adjusted to its right posi-

tion by a cup and  socket  motion the                           box  and  the crystal with  it  is then turned

about an axis at right angles to the direction of the axis of the beam of light, and

thus, either of the optic axes of any crystal may be made to coincide with the

centre of the field of view, the angle through which the box is turned being

measured to minutes by means of a circle attached to it, and a vernier attached to

Athe fixed stand supporting the instrument.                               table-polariscope on the same prin-

ciple has also been made by Herr Schneider, of Vienna, from the description given
in the ' Philosophical Magazine.' By means of these instruments, both optic axes of

topaz are brought well into the field of view at the same time ; and by turning the
circle which carries the box any two directions in the crystal within an angle of 96°

of one another can be brought into the centre of the field of view, and the angle

between them accurately measured. The field of view is only limited by the in-

ternal reflection at the plane surface of the lenses next to the rotating lenses.

A3. New Determination of the Number of Electrostatic Units in the Electro-
     Magnetic Unit. By W. E. AyRton and J. Perry. Telegram and
     Letter to Sir W. Thomson from Professor W. E. Ayrton.

                                                                       The Red Sea, August 3.

    My Dear Sir William,--From Singapore I sent you the following telegram

on the 13th July from Professor Perry and myself.
     " Kindly inform British Association that air-condenser measured magnetically

and statically gives mean value ratio of these units (29-80) twenty-nine point eight

nought ohms ; Foucault's velocity light."
     In the autumn of this year 1 propose communicating a full account of this

investigation to the Physical Society, or the Society of Telegraph Engineers, or

otherwise as you may advise ; but I thought that, as the British Association Com-

mittee had for so long busied itself with the determination of electrical units, you
might deem the result of this investigation of Mr. Perry and myself worthy of a
preliminary notice at the meeting of the Association to he held this year at Dublin.
Not being "sure that I should arrive in Europe in time to reach Dublin at the com-
mencement of the meeting, although I hope to be present during the last three or
four days, I took the liberty of sending you the telegram quoted above.

    The result we have obtained for "v" is the more interesting, inasmuch as,
without any bias being given to any one of our experiments, the mean value is

identically the same as that obtained by M. Foucault for the velocity of light,
whereas all previous determinations of the number of electrostatic units in an
electromagnetic unit have led to results differing considerably from Foucault's

velocitv.

     It appeared to Mr. Perry and myself that the method best suited for the accu-
rate determination of " v " consisted in measuring the capacity of an air-condenser
1. electromagnetically, by the swing of the needle of a ballistic galvanometer ; and
2. electrostatically, by a measurement of the linear dimensions of the condenser,

since the equation connecting these capacities

     $ = v*S,

s being the absolute electrostatic capacity,

S,,  ,, electromagnetic capacity,

leads to an equation involving only the square root of a resistance.

    Two difficulties of course presented themselves in this investigation-- difficulties
that it took us many months to overcome, labouring as we were under the disad-

vantage of experimenting in a country like Japan. They were

    1. To obtain a large air condenser, of which the plates had sufficiently true

surfaces that the electrostatic capacity could be accurately measured, at any rate

when the plates were not nearer than half a centimetre to one another.
     2. To obtain a galvanoinetric arrangement of sufficient sensibility to measure the

small capacity of such an air condenser, and sufficiently ballistic that the air

damping should be almost inappreciable.

    A full description of the condenser we employed (and which had a guard ring,

and all the different arrangements we could think of for obtaining accurate results)

will accompany the account of the investigations to which I have referred. It is
sufficient here to mention that the errors arising from the surfaces of the condenser

plates not being true planes were practically eliminated by capacity experiments

being made with successive adjustments of the condenser-plates, a different set of
points in the upper plate being each time brought to the fixed distance from the

lower plate.

     The arrangement of a ballistic galvanometer to fulfil the two conditions men-
tioned in (2) was very troublesome. I made several astatic needles, none of which

satisfied us, and we were beginning to fear my departure from Japan would

necessitate the abandoning of the investigation. At last, however, an astatic

combination containing (40) forty small magnets (and of which a description will
accompany the paper) gave satisfactory results, and I obtained threo excellent sets

of observations on June 18, June 23, and June 25, when my departure put an

these three days were

      Final mean                2980

It will be observed that the greatest difference between any one of the three daily

means and the final mean is only about half per cent. The final number 298*0

million metres per second (and which represents the mean of ninety-eight discharges

of the air condenser) may, I think, be regarded as correct to, at any rate, one per

per cent., and is exactly equal to M. Foucault's velocity of ligbt.

In the astatic combinations I employed prior to June 18 I used eight needles,

and weighted the lower set of needles with pieces of brass, so as to give it a barrel

shape, but the results were unsatisfactory, as there was either not sufficient deli-

cacy or else too much damping. Consequently, all the numbers obtained prior to
June 18 have been abandoned. On June 18 were made the first set of expe-

riments with the  forty-magnet  astatic  combination                                                   the idea of this arrangement
                                                                                                    ;

being to make an approximately spherical mass of little magnets all slightly sepa-

rated, from one another, and all previously magnetised to saturation. As it would

have been too difficult to make this entire sphere all of magnets, I finished it oft

with segments cut from a little wooden sphere. But the half Napierian logarithmic

decrement was 0-12095, and we thought this too high. Consequently, in the inter-

val from June 18 to June 23, I took this astatic combination down and replaced the

segments of the wooden sphere by segments of a small leaden hemispherical shell.

This diminished the half Napierian logarithmic decrement to 0-07825, and with a

periodic time of 39'5 seconds I obtained most consistent results. But on the other

hand, the close agreement of the results obtained on June 18 and on June 25,

leads one to conclude that the wooden segments were quite satisfactory, and that

replacing them with the leaden shell was unnecessary.

The table on the accompanying sheet gives the value of the most important

constants employed. The battery consisted of 382 perfectly new Daniell's cells in

series, and the galvanometer had a resistance of 20,000 ohms. All resistances were

compared with a new German-silver wire box, recently received from Messrs.

During the last twelve months we have been hard at work with the determination

of the electromotive force of contact of metals and liquids, using a new apparatus.

Some of the results are, we venture to think, most interesting ; for instance, the

electromotive force of contact of hot and cold mercury, no other conductors being in

contact with either mercury ; the electromotive force of contact of a cold metal and
hot mercury, no third conductor being in contact with either, &c, &c. The deter-

mination of the electromotive force of contact of the pairs of constituents of Mr.

4. On Apparatus employed in Researches on Crookes's Force.
                    By Richard J. Moss, F.C.S.

The author exhibited and described the apparatus which had been employed by

himself and Mr. (J. J. Stoney, F.R.S., in their researches on Crookes's Force. Early

in 1876 they devised a means of ascertaining the existence of a reaction between the

blackened vanes of a radiometer and the sides of the surrounding glass envelope.

A flat piece of elder-pith with one side blackened was attached by one end to the

Ainner surface of a small flask.  light glass arm suspended in the flask from a

silk fibre carried a disk of thin microscope glass which could be brought opposite

the blackened pith, and within a millimetre or two of it. When the flask was

exhausted it was observed that the pith when illuminated repelled the glass disk,

even when the tension of the residual air was equal to 7 m.m. of mercury.

Having obtained this result, another apparatus was constructed, with the view of

obtaining comparative measurements of the force at various tensions with a given

distance between the glass and the pith ; and at various distances with a given

tension of the residual gas. This apparatus is figured and described in the ' Proceed-

ings of the Royal Society,' 1877, p. 553. It was found that in an atmosphere of
hydrogen a Crookes's force was manifested at a distance of even 10 m.m., when the

tension of the residual gas was as much as 5 m.m. of mercury. Within certain

limits the force was found to vary about inversely as the tension ; and at a given

tension the variations produced by alterations in the distance between the pith and

the glass were nearly inversely as the distance until it exceeded 20 m.m. (half the

diameter of the containing tube), when the force remained almost constant, even at

a distance of 100 m.m., the maximum of which the apparatus admitted.

            5. On Spheroidal Drops. By Richard J. Moss, F.C.S.

     According to Mr. G. J. Stoney's recently published theory of the spheroidal state,

the drops are supported by the pressure which is exerted between hot and cold
surfaces when they are within a certain distance from one another, depending on the
490 keport-- 1878.

length of the free path of the molecules enclosed between the surfaces, and on the

difference of temperature of the latter. By duly observing the conditions of this

theory it was found possible to support a spheroid of ether on a surface of the
same liquid for upwards of an hour and a half. The author has shown * that the
supporting layer of gas need not necessarily consist of the vapour of the spheroid,
or of the liquid upon which it floats; since melted paraffin, which showed no
diminution in weight even when heated for an hour in vacuo at the temperature of
boiling water, readily yields spheroids at ordinary atmospheric tensions when its
temperature is 80-90° C. If the drops are kept cool by means of a gentle current

of air, they continue to float for a considerable time.

   A group of class-cubics thus constituted may be thus denoted by line co-

ordinates :

where d is the parameter of the group, (a, /3, y) the satellite-point.

    When2. there are inflexional cubics in the group, the locus of the satellite-

point may be thus found, by equating the invariants to zero.

If this equation be arranged according to the powers of a, its highest term is

                                                    -y(27) 2 (/32              +2) 4a ,0 .. .

The curve has four loops at each of its three foci and their antipodes, at which

the tangents intersect at right angles. It is petal-shaped, like the Rhodonese of

Abbate Guido Grandi. (Gregory's ' Examples of the Ditf. and Int. Calc.,' fig. 49.)

    3. There are seven critic lines at the most.

--For a critic value, S 3 -r I                           J     = o. This function will be found to be of the

seventh degree in the parameter (d).

    The theorem may be also thus established.
    By partial differentiation with respect to the variables (p, q, r),

                          a             2  +    2   +  r2 )    +     2p(ap        +  @q      +  yr)    +   2dqr     =   o.

                                  (p          J

                          /3           2   +  '$*   +  r2)        +  %q(ap        +  $q      +    yr)  +   2dpr     =   o.

                                  (p

                          7       (P*      +    2   +r      )  + 2>'(aP + /3?                +  yr)    + 2dpq = o.

                                              Q

Hence the critic lines are determined symmetrically by cubics with collinear

foci (2>,q,ap-Pq).

Their common tangents are seven by a well-known theorem (Salmon's ' Higher

Algebra,' Art. 248.)

A4. moveable point (P) lies on AD, arcs (or in piano, right lines) connect
P BPCwith two other points B, C : the envelope of the bisector of the angle
                                                                                   is one

Rof the preceding cubics. Similarly, the bisectors of the angles AQC, BRA, if Q,

move on BD, CD, envelope the other cubics, which determine the critic lines by

their mutual combination. This is an extension of a theorem of Pliicker.

ABC5. In the most general case, where               may have any position on the sphere,

the critic lines are thus determined :

          V-
          apP    op   +  crR  ~=  apP   -   ffg  +        =  apP  +  6jQ  -  crR'

                                                    e?-R

P= Rwhere
          ap - bq cos C - cr cos B, and Q, have similar values. But the equation

and form of the locus of the satellite, when there are inflexional values in the

group of class-cubics, is not here determined.

    6. By reciprocating, the critic centres of a group of spherical order-cubics are

determined to be seven by the intersecting cubics

6V - 2aa (aa + 6/3 cos c + cycos, 1)

In piano, as is well known, these degenerate into three critic centres, formed
by the intersection of three hyperbolae. For then cos a=cos 6 = cos c = l :

6V = 2(aV + 26c/3y cos a) = 4 A*, and the cubics become hyperbolae :

7. On a Cubic Surface referred to a Pentad of Co-tangential Points.
                            By Henry M. Jeffery, M.A.

   A1. cubic surface may be generated as the locus of the foci in involution of

all the transversals, concurrent in a fixed point, which meet a system of quadrics or
conicoids, intersecting in a quadro-quadric curve. This is an extension of Cremona's

method of generating plane cubics to solid geometry. Dr. Salmon's process leads
to the same analytical expression. In such a system of conicoids, the locus of the
conic curves of contact of enveloping cones, with a common vertex, is a cubic

surface.

2. All the pole planes of the fixed point, with respect to the conicoids, intersect

in a straight line PQ, which is one of the 27 lines on the cubic. If the system of

conicoids be referred to their self-conjugate tetrahedron, and if the fixed point be

E, the centre of the inscribed sphere (1,1,1,1), the five triple tangent-planes through

PQ Etouch the cubic in the four vertices of the tetrahedron and in                 the centre.

APQConsider any pair of lines, as AP, AQ, forming a triangle                 with PQ. Then,

APQbeside the original plane  through each of the lines AP, AQ, four more triple

tangent planes can be drawn : in all nine such planes. The same is true of the

PQplanes through the pairs of lines at B,C,D,E, which constitute with              triple

PQtangent planes. Thus the 45 planes are exhibited. Again, besides the line        and

PQthe five pairs of intersecting lines, which meet        in ten points, there are 16 lines,

which may be determined in five different ways. Eour of the five triple tangents

AQthrough each of the lines AP,         (exclusive of the common plane APQ), deter-

mine 8 lines each, the number required. The same process may be used with the

same results, if the triple planes through the lines intersecting in B,C,D,E be used.

The arrangement of these planes and lines, whose discovery by Professors Cayley

and Salmon constituted an epoch in Solid Geometry, may be compared for simplicity

with Professor Schafli's double-sixers, and Dr. Hart's cubical system of grouping.

3. The analogues to Maclaurin's theorem on tetrads do not present themselves.

But points on the cubic may be thus multiplied.
    Transversals through a fixed point P on the cubic pass through the vertices

A,B,C,D,E, which constitute the pentad of co-tangential points, and intersect the

pairs, the points of intersection lie on the curve and are four, Q,R,S,T ; and six

other points are constituted on the curve by the intersections of AB', A'B

AC, A'C ; AD', A'D ; BO', B'C ; BD', B'D : and CD', CD. Call these six points

line of a fixed plane tangent planes are drawn to the conicoids, the envelop of the

focal planes in involution of the system is a cubic class-surface.

5. The above equation may be obtained as the eliminant of a conicoid of the

system, and the pole-plane of a fixed point.

This is Dr. Salmon's method (§1), which seems capable of generating surfaces of

any order or class from a surface of the next lower order or class.

generality.

Professor Cayley's notation is adopted for the minors of the determinant :

    The following relation subsists between the minors, as has been pointed out.

(' Quarterly Journal of Mathematics,' vol. xv.)

                                          23.41 + 31.42 + 12.43 = o.

It will be convenient to denote by a, 6, c, d, the sums of certain minors :

                                   rt = 12 + 13 + 14: 6 = 21 + 23 + 24.
                                c = 31 + 32 + 34: d = 41+42 + 43.

Then it will be seen that                       a+ 6 + c+ d = o.

                                                23a + 316 + 12c              =o.

Hence the cubic under discussion may be written

This may assume the more tractable form :

This ternary quadric may be resolved into linear factors if

                                                                                           1-V±^-            1i£!±in         2

where 14/? = 12 + ph, 14? = 13 -- pg.

     This quartic yields four values of the parameter p, so that the equations are
determined to eight triple tangent planes through A, since g, h have each two

values dependent on the values of u.

The two preceding linear factors denote the traces on the co-ordinate plane

DABC, or rather the planes through                                                               and those traces of a pair of lines which
AP --intersect in
                     or AQ. The four values of p yield sixteen in all eight which
meet in AP, and eight in AQ.

To complete the investigation of the equations to the lines on the cubic, it

would be necessary to combine another form of a tangent plane :

                                     12/3 + y (13 + ph) + 8(14 + ph) = o.

    By proceeding as above, the rejection of the known factor Jcy + hd, leads to]the

conic of intersection:

                                                                                 ;-f)

The actual solutions of these quartics has not been attempted, since the auxi-

liary cubic is  cumbrous                                                 although we             may infer     from     the circumstance,                                                     that the

8. A New Form of Trap-Door Electrometer. By Professor Barrett.

        9. On Unilateral Conductivity in Tourmaline Crystals.
By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson and Dr. Oliver J. Lodge.

     The authors regarded the phenomena of pyroelectricity as exhibited by the
tourmaline and other crystals as of the utmost significance in the theory of the
relation of electricity to the particles of matter. Dr. Lodge had read a paper at
the British Association Meeting at Glasgow on a mechanical model illustrating the
flow of an electric current through a circuit of molecules. (See Phil. Mag., Nov.

and Dec. supp. 1876.)

The considerations therein advanced had led the authors independently to con-

clude that the phenomena of pyroelectricity could be explained if it could be shown

that such crystals as were pyroelectric possessed unilateral conductivity (§ 25 of

above paper). The term " unilateral conductivity " had been given by Dr. A.

Schuster to a phenomenon of some obscurity observed by him in certain cases, and

which formed the subject of a communication to a former meeting of the Asso-

--ciation. The term " unilateral conductivity " was defined as follows : If the con-

A Bgreater when the flow was in the direction from to than when the flow was

Bin the direction from to A, then such a substance was said to possess unilateral

conductivity.

     It had been argued by the first-named of the authors of the paper that if the
tourmaline possessed a unilateral conductivity for electricity, it would also be
found to possess unilateral conductivity for heat, since the researches of Tait and
Kohlrausch had shown that the two conductivities are comparable in almost all
points of analogy. The experimental research, therefore, had divided itself into

--two branches a thermal and an electrical.

     Owing to the difficulty of procuring suitable specimens of tourmaline crystal
a delay of some months occurred, but eventually this difficulty was overcome
through the kindness of Professor N. Story Maskelyne. Other crystals had also

been procured from France.

The method first suggested for comparing the two heat-conductivities as

measured in opposite directions along the axis of the crystal was that of De

ASenarmont.  slice of the crystal was cut with parallel faces containing the

crystallographic axis, and having been covered with a film of wax, or with Meusel's

double iodide of copper and mercury, was heated from a point by a hot wire.

When the experiment was rapidly made, the elliptical isothermal line marked

out by the melted wax or the blackened iodide, was found to be displaced from the

centre, and this displacement was towards the-analogous-pole ; showing that while

the temperature was rising, the conductivity in that direction was greater than in

the opposite direction. When, however, the experiment was done slowly with a

thicker crystal, so that thermal equilibrium was gradually attained, no such

unilateral effect could be observed. Rough preliminary experiments snowed the

unequal semi-axes minor to have a ratio of about 10 to 12, but there was con-

siderable discordance between the various results.

   A calorimetric method was next adopted to measure the flow of heat across a

thin wall of tourmaline cut normally to its crystallographic axis. The thin slice

was fixed between two similar portions of glass tubing, either end of which could

therefore be made to hold a weighed quantity of mercury whilst steam was blown

up into the other. In this way the heat which passed upwards through the crystal

when one surface was maintained at 100° could be measured in either direction.

Experiments were made alternately, the times required to heat the mercury

through a given range of temperature being compared in the two cases. To

eliminate error, after half the experiments had been made the crystal slice was

itself reversed between the glass tubes. The results, which exhibited as fair

agreement with one another as could be expected, showed, as before, that the con-

ductivity for heat was greater towards the analogous pole so long as the temperature

of the crystal was rising.

In respect of the electrical conductivity, time had only permitted a few preli-

Aminary experiments. The slice of crystal was heated in a steam bath.        five

microfarad condenser was charged through the crystal for one minute with 10 or

12 Daniell's cells, and the condenser was then discharged through a sensitive

Thomson galvanometer of 7000 ohms resistance. The limit of the very slight swing

was accurately observed, and then the operation was repeated with the tourmaline

electrically reversed. This was repeated alternately. When the temperature was

rising a difference between the two swings was perceived ; also when the tempera-

ture was falling there was a difference in the other direction. But these must have

Whenbeen chiefly due to the electromotive force, so-called, of the crystal.  the

temperature was steady not the slightest difference could be perceived. The authors

would wish, before being satisfied with this result, to heat the tourmaline to higher

--temperatures, and to try a much higher electromotive force say that of 1000 cells.

                          By Sir William Thomson, F.B.S.

                           with reference to the direction of swinging, in correcting the com-
pass by magnets, according to Airy's first method. In the Reports of the Liverpool
Compass Committee, and in Mr. Towson's 'Information for Masters and Mates
regarding Ships' Magnetism,' instances of perplexing changes in the compass are
given, and are referred to the same cause. The " sluggishness" of ships' magnetism,

according to which it depends generally in part on the influence experienced some

time before the time of observation, and not wholly on the influence at the time,

seems to have been first definitely noticed and discussed scientifically by Sir

Edward Sabine, in his analysis of the results of the magnetic observations in the

Antarctic exploring expedition of Sir James Eoss, in the Erebus and Terror

in the years 1839-48.

The practical rule and caution given above is of great importance in the navi-

gation of iron ships. The amount of the error which may be found cannot be pre-

dicted for ships in general, nor for any particular ship, except after much experience
Aand careful observation.
                           small effect of two or three degrees,* such as that

referred to in the Admiralty Manual as found in M. Gaussin's experience, may be

observed in the course of quietly swinging a ship by hawsers or steam tugs. If the

ship under weigh is steamed round on the different courses, the amount of the

" Gaussin error " may generally be greater than if she is hauled round by warps

but we must not be sure that it will be so, because the shake of the screw, which

enhances the magnetization on the east or west courses, may shake it out again be-
Afore the observation is made on the north or south courses.
                                                              good practical rule

in correcting the compass is, after having got it quite correct on the north and

south course, correct just half the error which is found after that on the south or

north course in the regular swinging of the ship.

     The warning at the head of this article is particularly important for ships of
war after firing guns when on easterly or westerly courses, if the course is then

changed to north or south, and particularly if after the firing the change of course

is effected under canvas, without the shaking of the ship's magnetism produced by
the engines and screw.

     The warning is also very important for ships steaming through the Mediter-
ranean eastwards or westwards, and then turning south, through the Suez Canal

or north round Cape St. Vincent ; and for ships steaming eastward from America,
and then turning northwards or southwards into St. George's Channel.

      11. On the Electrical Properties of Bees' Wax and Lead Chloride.
                  By Professors J. Perry and W. E. Atrton.

    Professor Ayrton commenced by noting the close way in which investigations

in the various branches of physical science were linked one with another, and by
remarking that experiments on electric absorption ought to have no less interest for

the scientific engineer than those on the increasing strain of materials under con-

stant mechanical stress had for the electrician. He next explained how, in conse-

quence of the absorbed charge in water being immeasurably greater than the
surface charge, the direct method of determining experimentally the specific induc-
tive capacity employed by Mr. Perry and himself, in their experiments on ' Ice as
an Electrolyte,' failed to give the result equal to the square of the index of refrac-
tion for light of infinitely long waves, and he suggested that the method recently
employed by Mr. Gordon for measuring the specific inductive capacity of solids
with very rapidly reversed charges might possibly, if applied to water, give an
answer approximately more equal to the square of the index of refraction how-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

ever, he was inclined to think that, since Mr. Gordon's method for solids °-ave

(after the application of the proper correcting factor for the thickness of the
dielectric) numbers closely agreeing with the received specific inductive capacities,

there existed no known method for correctly ascertaining the electric capacity of a

liquid.

     For although a condenser might be made of opposed metallic plates separated
by a space almost entirely filled with a liquid dielectric, which did not, however,
touch either plate, and although, according to the ordinary nomenclature, the two
plates in such an arrangement would be said to be insulated from the water and

from one another, still, as explained in their paper on the ' Viscosity of Dielectrics,'

a succession of rapidly reversed charges would he accompanied hy true electric

conduction                                          in  fact, that  it  would  be  well  worthy  of consideration whether the

explanation of the result which Mr. Gordon had brought to their notice at this

meeting, viz., that his new method of measuring specific inductive capacity of solid

--dielectrics had given the old results, might not be found to consist in this conduction
   this viscous conduction he might term it, although in reality there was but one

--kind of conduction, the conversion of electric energy into heat for this conduction

would occur unequally in the two apparently balanced condensers, since the two

dielectrics varied in viscosity, consequently the balance of capacities was not a

real one.

Nevertheless Professor Ayrton thought it highly important that careful experi-

ments should be made, both with constant and with rapidly reversed charges, on

the inductive phenomena observed in such a water condenser as he had described.

The abnormal rise in the specific inductive capacity of bees' wax, on solidifying,

which the experiments of Professor Perry and himself had shown, coincided with

an increase in the index of refraction ; he regarded this as furnishing an important

addition to the experimental proof of Professor Clerk Maxwell's electro-magnetic

theory of light, and he hoped that some of those philosophers of Trinity College,

Dublin, who had so successfully turned their attention to the elucidation of the

molecular vibrations causing Crookes's force, would give their views on the molecular

vibrations accompanying wave motion and electric induction.

    He thought that the experiments described in the paper on bees' wax and lead

chloride showed, in a sufficiently satisfactory way, that, where the resistance of an

electrolyte diminished by electrification, it was due to the electromotive force
employed being sufficiently great to decompose the damp in the pores of the elec-

trolyte ; but, in view of the fact that the resistance of water itself increased by

electrification, it seemed to follow that the products of the decomposition of the

damp must act chemically on the solid electrolyte and cause deterioration, and
hence a smaller specific resistance. But if there were deterioration we should

expect that the specific resistance of the material would steadily diminish day by

day, a result that was not obtained in the experiments of Professor Perry and
himself, on bees' wax at any rate, as will be seen on examining the table given

in their paper in the 'Philosophical Magazine 'for August. He therefore concluded

that further experiments on electrolytes, in which resistance diminishes by electri-
fication, were necessary to make the explanation quite complete.

                  12. Theory of Voltaic Action* By J. Brown.

     The author described some experiments made with a Volta's condenser having
plates of iron and copper, and with a ring half of copper and half iron, which
show that the difference of electric potential of these metals when in contact

depends on the atmosphere surrounding them.
     "While in the ordinary atmosphere iron is positive to copper, in an atmosphere

of hydrogen sulphide copper is positive to iron. These effects are explained by
the chemical theory of electricity, as due in the first-mentioned case to the superior
chemical affinity of the iron for the oxygen of the watery vapour, and other oxygen
compounds present in the air ; in the second, to the greater affinity of the copper
for the sulphur of the hydrogen sulphide.

        13. Mutual Action of Vortex Atoms and Ultramundane Corpuscles.

                              By Professor G. Forbes.

    It is well known that amongst the numerous theories which have dealt with
the form of an atom, there is only one which is in accordance with the properties

   A* description of the experiments is given in the 'Phil. Mag.,' August, 1878.

which we know atoms to possess. It was originated by Sir William Thomson,
whose conclusions, based on the reasearches of Helmholtz on fluid motion, may he

briefly summarised.

     According to this view the whole of space is filled with a frictionless fluid, and
material atoms are portions of this fluid, having a species of rotational motion,
which, as Helmholtz proved, must continue for ever.

   mThe best analogy to this universal plenum and to these vortex atoms is the

behaviour an atmosphere of « smoke-rings," such as may be blown from the
mouth of the smoker of tobacco, from the funnel of a locomotive, or from the

niouth of a cannon. Such smoke-rings have remarkable properties, which are
due, not to the smoke, which merely renders them visible, but to their internal

motions.

     Such "vortex rings" can travel with great rapidity. They can vibrate, they
can rebound from each other with perfect elasticity, and, supposing that such action

takes place in a frictionless fluid, they would be' no less indestructible than un-
beatable by mechanical means.

    It is also well known thatLe Sage of Geneva conceived a kinetic theory of gravi-
tation, which has been adopted by Sir William Thomson. According to Le Sage, the
whole of space is filled with small particles, which he calls ultramundane corpuscles,
flying with enormous velocity through every point of space in every direction,
lhese penetrate even the void spaces between atoms, so that of those which shower
upon the earth perhaps not more than 1 in 10,000 have their velocity diminished
by collision. The others pass right through the earth. Owing to these collisions,
however, a smaller number of ultramundane corpuscles are to be found moving in
the direction from the earth than towards it. Thus the earth acts as a shield,

protecting surrounding bodies from the shower of ultramundane corpuscles in that

direction.                                Hence  the  moon, and  bodies  on the  earth's surface, are battered by ultra-

mundane corpuscles most in the direction towards the earth. This force, driving

bodies towards the earth, explains terrestrial gravitation. Similarly, all bodies are

                                                      °ther with a force varying as the product of the           masses,
                                                      supposes ultramundane corpuscles to be vortex rings
                                                                                                                 with no
mhole the centre and elongated, like a serpent rushing forwards and always turning

inside out, spitting its inwards out at its mouth, and absorbing its skin at the other
end. Collisions with vortex atoms would not result in a destruction of velocity
and consequent enormous generation of heat, but energy of translation is con-
verted into some other form of energy, perhaps energy of vibration.

    However artificial these hypotheses may appear at first sight, the more they
are studied the more satisfactory are they. They are the only suggestions of the
kind which are in any way tenable, and they serve at least the part of working
hypotheses Some remarkable and unforeseen consequences follow from the co-
existence of such vortex atoms and ultramundane corpuscles as Thomson has con-

when it is not vibrating (the analogue of a cold atom), the needle is caused to

being attached to a tuning-fork of definite period of vibration.
      It appears, then, that the co-existence of such vortex atoms and ultramundane

corpuscles as Sir William Thomson has devised leads to the conclusion that hot
bodies must emit radiations which may be absorbed by cold bodies. The question
naturally arises, Can this action be the keystone to a new theory of light ? Can
the phenomena of reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, and polarisation be
explained by this kind of action ? In answer to these questions it can at present
only De said that the germs of a complete theory of light do exist in this speculation.

--President of the Section. Professor Maxwell Simpson, m.d., f.r.s., f.c.s.

                     THURSDAY, AUGUST 15, 1878.

Professor Maxwell Simpson gave the following Address :

My position here is a highly honourable, but by no means a comfortable one.

Naturally, you expect to hear from me something new about the science which

occupies the attention of this section, and I have the miserable feeling that I must

Howdisappoint you.   can I possibly find a fact in chemistry with which you are

not already acquainted ? If, in order to cater for you, I go to France, Germany,

Russia or America, I find the abstractors of the Chemical Society have been there

before me, and have swept everything of value into their Journal. Chemists are

now jiepj perfectly acquainted with the progress of science in every part of the world,

and therefore the raison d'etre of this address, so far as announcing the discoveries

of the year is concerned, has passed away. I therefore propose, instead of giving you

a concentrated essence of the last twelve numbers of the ' Journal of the Chemical

Society,' to bring before you the claims of this science to a place in general education,

and the claims of original research to a place in the curriculum for higher degrees in

our Universities. .

I have been devoted to chemistry all my life. It has been my business and my

pleasure. The longer I live the more deeply am I impressed with the advantages

to be derived from its study, and I am anxious that these advantages should be

shared by the rising generation.

Whether we take into accoimt the value of the knowledge acquired, the dis-

cipline of the intellectual faculties in acquiring that knowledge, or the effect on the

character, surely we have a right to give the study of this science a prominent

place in our schools and colleges. It woidd be difficult to over-estimate the value

and extent of the knowledge we derive from chemistry. Without it we can know

nothing about the air we breathe, the water we drink, or the food we eat ; we can-

not understand the processes of combustion, respiration, fermentation, putrefaction,

or the endless chemical changes which are continually in operation around us, and
which affect our lives for good or for evil. In a word, the whole of the phenomena

of nature must for ever remain to us, more or less, an inscrutable mystery.

Again, is it not desirable that we should have some acquaintance with the

chemical arts, from which we derive so many of our comforts and luxuries?
Should we not know something of the arts of photography, dyeing, metallurgy

something of the manufacture of glass and china, and of the thousand beautiful

things that are constantly in our hands ? Not only is the knowledge we obtain

from chemistry very considerable in itself, but it furnishes us with a key, which

enables us to unlock vast stores of knowledge, contained in several other sciences

these are, Physics, Geology, Mineralogy, Physiology, and I may now add, Astro-

nomy. Physics and chemistry are so intimately connected that it is difficult to say
502 REPOiiT-- 1878.

where the one begins and the other ends. The help that chemistry gives to physics is

shown by the numbers of chemists who have distinguished themselves as physicists.

--I may mention a few belonging to our own time Andrews, Bunsen, Faraday, Frank-

land, Graham, Guthrie, and Eegnault.

With regard to mental discipline, the mind of the student is exercised* in both

the inductive and deductive methods of reasoning. His original faculties are stimu-

lated by the consciousness that he can in many cases readily test the worth of his
ideas by experiment. With inexpensive apparatus and a good balance, the intelli-

gent student can make out for himself some of the laws and many of the facts of the
science, and it may be, also, add to them. He glides insensibly from the known

to the unknown. Indeed his spirit of inquiry, demands, in most cases, to be curbed

rather than spurred. Some students are constantly finding out new methods of

analysis or discovering the precious metals in impossible places.

    The readiness with which we can cross over into the terra incognita of chemistry,

and make little explorations there, constitutes in my opinion the great charm of this

science, and, to a great extent, its value as an educational agent. What I wish to

insist upon is, that the student of chemistry can reach the field of original work

sooner than the student of most other sciences. Once he commences original re-

search, the developement of his intellectual faculties rapidly progresses. His imagi-

nation is daily exercised in propounding new theories, and devising experiments in

order to ascertain their truth or falsehood. And what more valuable intellectual

training can there be than the habit of subjecting our ideas to the test of inexorable

experiment ? In the world outside chemistry, we are, alas ! too ready to take
things for granted. The chemist's motto is, Prove all things. The ancients adopted

a different method: they assumed certain principles and reasoned from them.

They therefore did little in science.

Chemistry promotes in a remarkable manner accuracy, thoroughness, and cir-

cumspection. An organic analysis requires six weighings : if any one of these is

Ainaccurate, the results are worthless.  qualitative test carelessly applied may

cause us, in a research, to waste months in the pursuit of a phantom or Will-o'-the-

Wisp which can have no corporeal existence. If we have to employ absolute

alcohol in our experiments, we must not be satisfied with going through the cere-

mony of making it absolute, but we must assure ourselves that it is absolute.
Unless we are sure of every step in our research, our results become doubtful, and

therefore of ho value.

On the circumspection, also, of the original worker large demands are made.

The avenues by which error may creep in and vitiate his results are very numerous.

These he must foresee, and endeavour to close up. Laboratory work teaches us to

use our senses aright, sharpens our powers of observation, and prevents us from

reasoning rashly from appearances. It also promotes manual dexterity, and trains
the hands to work in subordination to the head.

Perhaps in no other science is the student so deeply impressed with the order

and economy of nature, the immutability of her laws, and the exactness of her

operations. These impressions will, no doubt, in after Hfe impart seriousness to his

character, and save him from the adoption of many a wild theory.
    I come now to the effect of original work on the character. Many virtues are

necessary to the chemist--courage, resolution, truthfulness, and patience. He is

often obliged to perform experiments which are attended with great danger, and no

man can hope to fight long with the elements without carrying away many a scar.

Sometimes fatal accidents occur. Many years ago, Mr. Hennel, of the Apothecaries'

Hall, London, lost his life by the explosion of a fulminating powder which he was

preparing for the East India Company. And many of us recollect the sad death of

young Mr. Chapman, a distinguished chemist whom I had the pleasure of knowing,

who was literally blown to atoms while working in the Iiartz Mountains on a new

dynamite which he had himself discovered. I must tell the ladies, however, that

accidents are not always so disastrous, but that often one may escape with merely

the loss of an eye. But the chemist must uot be discouraged by fear of accident,

neither must he be disheartened by the temporary failure of his experiments, nor at

the slowness of his processes. Bunsen was obliged to evaporate 44 tons of the

waters of the Durcheim springs in order to obtain 200 grains of his new metal,

Caesium. It took Berthelot several months to form, by a series of synthetical
operations, an appreciable quantity of alcohol from water and carbon, derived from

--carbonate of baryta. Many years ago, in the laboratory of Wurtz my honoured
--master a poor student, whom I knew, was carrying from one room to another a

glass globe, which contained the product of a month's continuous labour, when the
bottom of the globe fell out and the contents were lost. Nothing daunted, he re-

commenced his month's work, and brought his research to a successful issue.

    Above all things, the chemist must be true. He must not allow his wishes to bias
his j udgment or prevent him from seeing his researches in their true light. He must

not be satisfied that his results appear true, but he must believe them to be true

and having faithfully performed his experiments, he must record them faithfully.

He may often be obliged to chronicle his own failures and describe operations that

tell against his own theories, but this hard test of his truthfulness he must not

shrink from.

But I must not weary you with the virtues of the chemist. If I have succeeded

in showing that the pursuit of this science tends largely to develope the intellect
Weand discipline the character, I think I have done something for chemistry.
                                                                              are

told by Bishop Butler that " habits of virtue acquired by discipline are improve-

ment in virtue, and improvement in virtue must be advancement in happiness."

I am glad to see that the importance of original research as a part of higher

education is at last beginning to be recognised in this country. The Royal

University Commission at Oxford has recently recommended that candidates for

the higher degrees in science shall in that University be required in future to work out

an original investigation. In Germany, whereeducation has been so long and so well

understood, original work has been, for at least the last half century, a sine qua non

for a degree. Another admirable rule exists in that country, the adoption of which

in Great Britain might go far to wash out the stain from our islands, of not having

contributed our fair quota to the advancement of human knowledge. It is this

the Germans make a point of securing invariably, that their scientific chairs shall
be filled by men who have already distinguished themselves by their discoveries.

The professor, on his appointment, naturally desires to continue his investigations,

and endeavours to secure, and usually succeeds in securing, the assistance of his
pupils. This is a mutual advantage. The professor is able to do more work for

science, and the student, on his part, learns to conduct for himself an original in-
vestigation. Hence there is always a rising generation of original workers in Ger-

many, who turn out papers more or less meritorious with the rapidity of a Walter's

press. They are stimulated by the hope of one day arriving themselves at a pro-
fessor's chair, the path to which they are well assured is only through the toilsome
field of original work. But I must not wrong the German student by the impli-
cation of a purely selfish motive in his work. His labour is one of love, and his

ambition, for the time at least, is bounded by the desire to do something for science.

And from a multitude of such enthusiasts the great professors come. Great moun-

tains are only found in mountainous countries.

     I find myself insensibly led to speak of the encouragement of research in this

country ; and although it has been very largely discussed in scientific circles, I will

venture to add a few words. To promote original work here, I believe it is indis-
pensable that our professors should be well paid. It woidd save them from the

necessity of supplementing their incomes by commercial analyses, and thus enable

them to devote their spare time to original work. And to secure that they shall
have spare time, I would like to see in every laboratory a competent assistant, who

would be able occasionally to take up the professor's lectures, should he be engaged

in important work. There are many around me who know how very exacting
original investigation is, and how necessary it is, at times, to be able to work on
without interruption ; bits and scraps of time being of no value. I am glad to see

that the Oxford Commission also recommends the appointment of well-paid assist-
ants. Well-paid professorships and well-paid assistantships would be attractive
prizes for our students to work up to ; and if it were clearly understood that the only

way to these prizes was through original investigation, we should very soon have an

army of zealous and competent workers.
     The plan of appointing a staff of original workers unconnected with teaching
504 report-- 1878.

has been proposed ; but I do not approve of it. The original worker is, as a rule, the
best teacher, and the rising generation of students should not be deprived of the
advantage of his instruction. Moreover, as I said before, the professor may be
greatly assisted by bis pupils.

     No doubt the Government grant fund does a good deal for science, but the field

of its operations is, under present conditions, limited. Professors, as a rule, are so
occupied with teaching that they cannot avail themselves of the fund ; and of those

students who might be competent and willing, very few can afford to do so. Instead
of trusting to the precarious and insufficient support of the fund, they must endeavour

to settle themselves permanently in life.

     It is much to be regretted that the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, with

such splendid revenues at their disposal, should contribute so little to the advance-

--ment of physical science. I hope the day is not far distant when the fellowships

or at least a few of them which now go to reward young men for merely passing
a good examination, shall be given xuithout examination to men who shall have ad-
vanced human knowledge in any department. At present, a fellowship of 250/. or
300/. a year, lasting ten or twelve years, and in some cases for life, may be obtained

--on showing proof of a good memory or, at most, a capacity for assimilating other
--men's ideas. To make discoveries to follow out a new train of thought, and estab-

lish it by experiments specially devised to that end, has been left not only without
reward, but almost without recognition, in our two principal seats of learning. Is
it to be so always ? The world at large, ignorant as it is, has a sounder instinct on
this subject, and the man who makes the humblest addition to the stock of know-
ledge in the world rarely fails to receive the world's respect and honour.

     The suggestions I have ventured to make could not, of course, be well carried
out unless the Government take into its own hands the appointment to all scientific
chairs. Of this I think I see indications. I believe that sooner or later the Govern-
ment will assume the supreme direction of education in this country. It has already
taken primary education under its control, and quite recently, herein Ireland, inter-

mediate education to a great extent. And does the .appointment of so many

University Commissions not show a disposition on the part of the Government to
assume the direction of higher education also ?

  3. On the Amounts of Sugar contained in the Nectar of various Flowers,
                           By Alex. S. Wilson, M.A., B.Sc.

      Nectar, the sweet-tasted liquid found within the cups of insect-fertilised
flowers, is of service to the plant possessing it by affording an inducement whereby

 nsects are attracted to visit the flowers. By this means cross-fertilisation is

effected, as bees, butterflies, and other insects, in their search for the nectar, bring
with them pollen from other flowers adhering to their bodies which they deposit
on the stigmas. Mr. Darwin has shown experimentally what an additional amount
of vigour is thus conferred on the resulting seeds in contrast with the degenerat-
ing effect of continuous inbreeding or self-fertilisation. Very often this sweet
fluid is exuded from special glands, but in other cases from portions of the flower
that do not seem to have been specially adapted for this purpose. Morphologically,

nectaries may represent very different structures, but not unfrequently they are of

 the nature of an aborted organ such as a petal or stamen. It is a disputed point

among physiologists whether this saccharine matter is a true secretion or simply

an excretion of'eflete matter from vegetable cells--a bi-product of the chemical
changes taking place within these cells. Nectar is, of course, the source

whence the bee derives honey, but it also affords sustenance to many different kinds
of insects as well as humming-birds. The bright colours of flowers, as shown by
Sir John Lubbock's experiments, serve for the guidance of insects to them, and
the odours which they emit fulfil the same end. The markings on a flower's petals,
too, always converge'towards the nectar. The importance of these guides to insects
will be apparent from the following estimations, which show how indispensable it
is that as little time as possible should be lost by an insect while collecting honey.

It must be remembered, also, that in order to protect the nectar from rain, it is
usually contained in the least accessible part of the flower. The formation of
nectar is observed to take place most freely in hot weather. So great, however, is
the economy of the plant, that it is only "formed at the time when insects' visits
would be beneficial, i.e., when the anthers are shedding their pollen or when the
stigma is mature. Biologists believe that the visits of bees, butterflies, and other
insects have in past time exercised an important influence in modifying the size,
shape, colour, &c, of flowers. The following determinations are of interest as
showing to what extent this action goes on, and as a help towards ascertaining the

value of this factor:

that the statements which exist in the different standard works on chemistry, as to

chlorine having no action on those salts, are not correct, at least, as regards several

of the nitroprussides, which he has made the subject of investigation ; for he has

found that some of them are immediately, and others after long exposure to its

influence, more or less acted on by that substance, even when they are excluded

from light. When, however, they are subjected to the combined action of chlorine

and the sun's rays, they are soon completely decomposed, the principal product

being an oil-like matter, which appears to possess all the properties belonging to the

Ncompound known under the name of chlorocyanic oil (C                                                                                                                          4C1 U), ferric chloride,

The following nitroprussides, viz., those of potassium, sodium, barium, calcium,

zinc, iron and silver, were found to be thus decomposed, when exposed to the com-

bined action of chlorine and sun light, and it is probable that other nitroprussides

would be similarly affected.

The only one of those salts, however, which the author has observed resisting

this action is that of copper, which has remained apparently unaffected after some

weeks' exposure to its influence.

5. The Adulteration Act in so far as it relates to the Prosecution of Milk-

    sellers. By Ernest H. Cook, B.Sc, F.R.C.S., Lecturer upon Experi-

     mental Physics at the Bristol Trade and Mining School.

     The object of this paper is to call attention to the unsatisfactory state of the law
relating to the prosecution of milk-sellers. In many cases innocent vendors have
been fined, and also, we may be sure fraudulent dealers have gone unpunished. Not-

withstanding that milk-sellers are constantly being fined for selling an inferior

article, yet milk continues to be the chief adulterated article of food. The Act has

Wepractically failed to deter the sophistication of this article.                                                                                                              can only explain

this by the fact that milkmen find that they are fined whether they sell a pure

article or an adulterated one. It pays them best to adulteratS, and they do so. In
proof of this two cases are mentioned. In the first several analysts have certified cer-

tain samples of pure milk to be adulterated, and in the second a sample of milk
obtained from a cow fed on desiccated grain was certified as skim-milk. The

records of our police courts tell us that milk-sellers are constantly being fined for
selling milk which they declare most emphatically to be pure and unadulterated.

Three courses are open to us to explain these anomalies :
     Firstly. To place implicit reliance on the analyst, and therefore to disbelieve the

deliberate statements of the farmers and milk-sellers.
     Secondly. To believe the farmer, and therefore to consider the analyst wholly at

fault.

     Thirdly. To reconcile both by attributing the poverty to a variation in the

article.

In most cases the third will be found to be the true explanation.
Notwithstanding the statement of Professor Wanklyn, milk is a substance which

varies greatly in quality. In the author's experience he has found as great a

difference as 18 per cent, in the value of pure milk, and Dr. Voelcker has published
analyses in which a much greater difference occurs. It appears that milk is subject

to four different kinds of variation, viz. :

   Aa. variation owing to the food.
   A/3. variation owing to the season.
   Ay. variation owing to the animal.
   A8. variation owing to health.

Illustrations of these are given in the paper. In consequence of these variations,

analysts, if they wish to determine if a sample of milk is adulterated, take, as a
standard, the lowest percentage of solids or " solids not fat " which pure milk has
been found to contain. This is the principle of the course adopted, but it is open to

the following objections:
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  507

     Firstly. Each analyst being allowed to fix this percentage himself, we have
different standards employed, and consequently may have a milkman fined in one
town for selling an article which a neighbouring analyst may declare pure.

     Secondly. The percentage fixed upon cannot be the lowest contained by pure

milk, because we do not know it. The amount found by Dr. Voelcker (93 of
solids) is the lowest at present known, but a lower number may be found.

     Thirdly. This lower limit is so low that with an ordinary sample a considerable

amount of watering may take place without the possibility of detection.
     For many obvious reasons it is necessary to remedy this state of things. One

method only appears to offer a chance of success, briefly, this is to buy and sell milk
by quality instead of by quantity. The difficulty of introducing this practice is

--more imaginary than real. One easy method is as follows : Divide the milk into

two qualities, first quality and second quality. The former will include all milk

containing 12 - per cent, of solids or 9-0 per cent, of " solids not fat " or more, and may

be sold, say, at 4d. per quart. The latter will include all milk containing less than

these numbers, and may be sold at '-'^d. per quart. If a sample of first quality milk

be sold which, on analysis, does not contain the stated quantity, the vendor will be
fined. The great difficulty here is in making the division into two qualities. In
order to do this effectually, some simple instrument capable of making a rough

analysis is required. At present such an instrument does not exist, but we may

rely on one being forthcoming if the need be felt.

     In conclusion, the following advantages are claimed for this method :
     1. The analyst not being called upon to decide upon the purity of the article,
but simply whether it contains a certain percentage of solids or of " solids not fat,"
cannot make such deplorable mistakes as at present.
     2. The vendor will not be fined unjustly.

      3. It will tend to stop adulteration because a better price can be obtained for a

better article.

    An4. article of greater constancy will be supplied to the public.

1. Notes on Aluminium Alcohols. By Dr. Gladstone and Alfred Tribe.

     In 1876 the authors described the joint action of aluminium and iodine on

alcohol, and two aluminium ethylates which resulted from it. They now showed

that a similar reaction takes place with methylic alcohol, especially when the

aluminium is rendered more powerful by conjunction with deposited platinum ; arid
that an analogous aluminium compound is still more readily formed from amylic

alcohol. These two substitution products had not yet been prepared in a pure con-

dition, but the authors had succeeded in preparing the butylic compound in a satis-

factory manner. This aluminic butylate is a solid body at the ordinary tempera-

ture, but melts when heated, and is capable of distillation. It is very soluble in

anhydrous ether or benzole, from which it separates on evaporation, but without

crystallising. It is decomposed by water, butylic alcohol and alumina being pro-

Hduced.
     Its composition was found             to                be  Al (C      O) . ' There is also evidence of

2. On the TSsti/niation of Mineral Oil or Paraffin Wax when mixed with

               other Oils or Fats.* Bij William Thomson, F.R.S.E.

     Mixed oils are now often used for lubricating purposes, and a common mixture

composed of mineral oil with some animal, vegetable, or fish oil is extensively

used, and it is an important point to be able by analysis to determine the amount

of mineral oil which such mixtures contain ; and as I could find no published pro-

cess to effect this, I devised, after much work, the following, which I found by

--repeated tests to give accurate results : Some of the sample is boiled with an

alcoholic solution of caustic soda, which converts all the animal, vegetable, or fish

oils into soap. This is then mixed with sand, evaporated to dryness on the steam

bath, the residue placed in a bottle and washed with petroleum spirit, which has

been previously distilled at a temperature not exceeding 190° Fahr. This dissolves

out the mineral oil, leaving the soap insoluble. The spirit is now distilled off from

the spirit solution in a large flask, and after thus evaporating off the bulk of the

spirit, the concentrated solution is transferred to a smaller flask with a hole blown

in its side, into which is fitted a cork carrying a thermometer and a glass tube
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the thermometer should touch the liquid, going nearly to the bottom of the flask,

which is placed on a sand bath and heated at a temperature not exceeding

220° Fahr., and dry air blown into the flask through the tube in the cork, to

remove the last trace of spirit, and the residue of mineral oil weighed and cal-

Aculated on the weight of original mixed oil taken.                         small correction must be

allowed for an amount of unsaponifiable oil which so-called saponifiable oils always

contain, but this is about 0"6 per cent, of the saponifiable oil found.

3. On the Action of Heat on the Selenate of Ammonium * By Dr. Edmund
    W. Davy, Professor of Forensic Medicine, Boyal College of Surgeons,

      Ireland.

     The author read on behalf of his colleague Dr. Charles A. Cameron and
himself a paper containing the results of some observations which they had con-
jointly made on the action of heat upon the selenate of ammonium. The study
of the effects of that agent on the sulphate of ammonium, having in the hands of

different chemists led to interesting results, the authors thought it desirable to insti-
tute some experiments on the selenate of that base, to ascertain whether any corre-
sponding products would be obtained by its exposure to heat, selenic and sulphuric

acids agreeing so closely in their properties, and this subject being hitherto unin-
vestigated as far as they were aware.

Some selenate of ammonium, after thorough drying at 100° C, was heated in a

bath of paraffine, the degrees of temperature to which it was exposed bein°- indi-

cated by a thermometer. It was found that when the salt was heated to° about
180° C.,_the evolution of a minute quantity of ammonia could be readily detected,

and finding that the amount evolved increased with the rise of temperature the
heat was gradually raised to about 250° C, when the development of ammonia be-
came much more abundant, whilst at the same time water and selenium be^an to
                                                                                                                                                                           °
be separated.                                                                                                                                                                              ·

   _ This temperature was then continued as long as ammonia was evolved, and till
acid vapours made their appearance, when the heat was withdrawn.

    On examining the residue after this treatment, it was found that the selenate of
ammonium had been completely decomposed, selenium and selenious anhydride

being the remaining products. Wishing to ascertain if any gaseous matter was

evolved during the decomposition, some selenate of ammonium was heated in a tube
filled with mercury, when a considerable volume of a gas not absorbed by water
was obtained, which on examination was found to be nitrogen. It should also be
stated, that the salt was observed to have acquired a strong acid reaction, before its

final breaking up at the highest temperature to whicb it had been exposed in the

paraffine bath                                                      indicating the formation                     of  an  acid salt in the first sta°-e of                  its  de-

composition by heat. From the results of those and of other experiments made by
the authors, they have come to the conclusion, that when selenate of ammonium is
heated it first resolves itself into ammonia and an acid selenate of ammonium and
that this salt, on further heating, breaks up into selenium, selenious anhydride water

and nitrogen, and that the reactions which occur in the process may probablv be

expressed by the following formulas :

acid salt formed, like as in the case of the sulphate, of that base when similarly

4. A New Method of Alkalimetry. By Louis Siebold, F.C.S.

    The method recommended by the author consists                                                                                                 in the reverse application oi
Liebigs process for estimating hydrocyanic acid, and                                                                                              is based on the fact that the

volumetric determination of an alkaline cyanide by means of silver nitrate is in no-
wise affected by the presence of free hydrocyanic acid. From the volume of silver
solution used, the quantity of alkali may be as readily calculated as that of the
cyanogen. If the applicability of this process for alkalimetric purposes were con-

fined to the estimation of caustic alkalies, nobody would, in the author's opinion,
think of using it in preference to the process commonly used ; but he wished to

show that it might with great advantage be applied to the determination of alka-
line carbonates. From 0'5 to 1 gramme of the potassium or sodium carbonate should
be dissolved in about 100 c.c. of distilled water, the solution mixed with an excess
of hydrocyanic acid (10 to 20 c.c. of acid of Scheele's strength ), and then deci-
normal solution of silver nitrate added from a burette until a permanent opalescence

is produced. The reaction occurs in accordance with the following equation :

            K 0O              +  2HOy  +  AgN0                =  KAgCy                   +  KNO               +  00,.
                 2s                                        3                          2                  s

     The first drop used in excess causes a precipitation of silver cyanide. "Whereas
under ordinary circumstances hydrocyanic acid is incapable of decomposing alka-

line carbonates, it effects a complete decomposition in the presence of silver nitrate.

The mixture does not require boiling, and the whole operation may be performed

within a few minutes.
     If after the end of the titration the mixture is boiled, and the addition of

decinormal solution of silver nitrate proceeded with, this time using potassium
chromate as an indicator, the volume of silver solution required to ensure complete
precipitation of the silver cyanide will be exactly equal to that used in the first

titration.

                              KAgCy,   +  AgNO                =  2Ag0y  +                KN0               .
                                                           s                                            3

     This second reaction might then, if desired, be used as a check on the determi-
nation. In the presence of chloride, the volume of silver solution used in the
second experiment will be greater than that used in the first, the difference between
the two being exactly that required to precipitate the chloride. In this manner a
determination of the chloride might be readily combined with that of the alkaline

carbonate.

     The following results were quoted to show the great accuracy of the process :

    The author gives the following reasons why for. the essay of samples of potash or

soda he considers this process as better than the one usually employed :
     1. The solution does not require boiling, and the operation therefore requires less

time -than the usual process.

     2. The change from absolute clearness to an unmistakable turbidity as produced
by a single drop of the reagent is more striking than that of the colour of litmus
brought about by a drop of normal sulphuric or hydrochloric acid.

     3. The test solution being a deci-normal one, the results obtained are more
accurate than those obtained with standard normal mineral acids.

    4. With but- little additional trouble, and without having to operate on fresh
sample, the process may be readily coupled with an accurate determination of the

chloride present in the alkaline carbonate.

     In concluding, Mr. Siebold stated that he was at present engaged in experiments
showing a still wider range of useful applicability of this process ; and that the re-
sults of these experiments he hoped to be able shortly to lay before the Chemical

Society.

              1. Notes on Water from the Severn Tunnel Springs.

              By William Lant Carpenter, B.A., B.Sc, F.C.S.

   GThe plans for the construction of this tunnel had been fully described to Section

at the Bristol (1875) Meeting, by its engineer, Mr. Charles Richardson. By the

summer of the present year, the trial heading, part of which was to form the per-
manent drain of the tunnel, had been driven more than half way across under the
Severn, which was 2\ miles wide at that point, and had successfully passed under

the remarkable channel of the " Shoots." In driving through the pennant rock
several springs had been met with, some of which had since run dry. In the

opinion of the engineer, no Severn water could find its way to these springs, the

source of which he thought were the "backs "in the pennant. The author' had
analysed water from four springs, and from the Severn at various states of tide, and
from deep land wells in the neighbourhood, the results of which led him to believe
that by far the greater portion of the water flowing from these springs was derived
from the Severn. Details of the analyses were given.

2. On the Thetines* By E. A. Letts, Professor of Chemistry, University

     The experiments were undertaken as a sequel to the research made by Professor
Crum Brown and the author on dimethyl thetine and its compounds, and with

--a view_ to the thorough investigation of the thetines as a group the phenomena

attending their formation, the action of heat and oxidizing agents on them and the

difference in their properties as the series is ascended. Incidentally the action of

bromacetic acid on certain hydrocarbon sulphides, and the action of bromaeetic and
iodacetic ethyl ether on sidphide of methyl were studied.

salt in its constitution. They are not attacked by nitrous acid; and the cyanate
when heated, undergoes no molecular change, but merely splits up into the base'
and the usual polymer of cyanic acid, cyanuric acid.

     In spite of the failure of these attempts, the author regards it as probable

that picoline is metbyl-pyridine from the following consideration :--The amount of
heat evolved in the formation of these bases is probably very high. That heat,

added to the amount evolved by the combination of the base with an acid, is likely
to be greater than the total number of heat-units evolved during oxidation of
the base ; hence these bases are unoxidisable in acid solution. But when oxidised
in alkaline solution, the amount of heat evolved by oxidation is supplemented by
that arisino- from the combination of the resulting acid with the alkali, and then
exceeds the heat evolved during formation of the base. The presence of nitrogen

therefore gives great stability to the molecule, and prevents the methyl-groups
H N0from being oxidised to carboxvl groups, as is the case with toluol, xylol, &c. At
least  three        acids  of the  formula   C          5     have been discovered, and it is pro- ·

a, fi, and y, dicarbopyridenic acids. The a-acid is obtained by oxidising picoline
or lutidine, and the last two from lutidine.

     G. Nitric Acid ; its Reproduction from the lower Oxides of Nitrogen.

                                By Bernard C. Molloy.

     In treating in this short memoir of the economic use of nitric acid, it would be

well to state t>y way of preface why it is considered worthy of such attention.
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                                           513

We are aware in the first place that it is the highest oxide of nitrogen known,

that, parting so easily and freely with its oxygen as it does, it stands highest in the
list of oxidising agents, and consequently amongst the most useful chemical re-agents

in manufacturing enterprises.

     There are two drawbacks in some cases fatal to its use : one is the high price
of the acid; and the other the injurious and malodorous gases which are evolved
during the deoxidation of the acid. The object, therefore, in these researches has

--been twofold firstly, to introduce the greatest possible economy in the use of nitric

acid ; and secondly, to get rid of the malodorous and injurious gases which are

evolved. In effecting the former the latter has been successfully attained.

    To make this operation clear it will be well to recall for a moment the severa

oxides of nitrogen.

     There are five compoimds of nitrogen with oxygen, containing respectively
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 volumes of oxygen to 2 of nitrogen, viz., taking them in the as-

cending order of the oxygen

   H NIf water be added to the fifth or highest oxide, we have nitric acid 2 2 G, or

2HN03 .
    When any oxidisable substance is presented to nitric acid, the nitric acid parts

with a portion of its oxygen to combine with the substance to be oxidised, and the

nitrogen is evolved, combined with the remaining oxygen as lower oxides of

nitrogen.

     Under the most favourable conditions not more than fifty per cent, of the oxygen
contained in the nitric acid can be used for the purpose of oxidation. In many

cases, however, the percentage is as low as twenty. Moreover, a fresh supply of

the acid will be required for each successive operation.

    Now it will be evident that if sufficient oxygen be made to combine with these

lower oxides of nitrogen, nitric anhydride will be formed, which, when combined

with water, reproduces nitric acid. To effect this reproduction economically, the

" means " employed must themselves be economical in order to be useful.

   We will deal with the gases evolved during the deoxidation of nitric acid.

These gases will be composed of a mixture of lower oxides of nitrogen, which will

be of a deep brownish red colour, caused by the presence of nitrogen peroxide.
These gases or fumes are conducted into the chamber or towers where they are to

be reoxidised. These towers consist of closed chambers about, for ordinary pur-

poses, thirty feet high and three feet in diameter. Their form and material may be
varied, but they may be constructed of glazed earthenware pipes or a slate. The

tower rests in a reservoir, into which the reconverted acid falls and from which it is

afterwards drawn. Into the sides of the tower may be fitted sight-holes glazed
with glass, so that the quantity of the gases may be roughly judged by the depth

of the colour inside the tower. The top of each tower is of a conical form, and in
the centre of the cone is fixed a jet, through which steam and hot water are forced.

This jet is so arranged as to be capable of being easily and accurately adjusted in

order to cause a cloud or spray of very finely divided hot water of about a tem-
perature of 100° 0. to fall slowly through the tower or chamber. Atmospheric air is
allowed at the same time to enter the tower. The construction of the jets should

be so arranged as that the quantities of hot water and the admission of air may be
regulated at will. As is obvious, the tower should be gas tight, except as hereafter

described. Now the gases or fumes coming from the vessel in which the nitric acid
is being used will gradually rise till the tower is charged. When so charged the

jet is brought into action ; steam and hot water are turned on into the jet in such

proportions as that the steam will strike and divide the water into a minutely

divided spray, the steam itself being condensed in the water, so that a misty spray

of hot water slowly falls down through the tower.

In its descent the particles of hot water come into contact with the oxides of

nitrogen.  The nitrous anhydride (N2       3)  and         nitricoxide                  (N        2 ) are under these
                                                                                               2

conditions immediately oxidised by the ah- (admitted and drawn in through the air
Nholes or through the jet) into peroxide of nitrogen 2 4 . The several reactions may

be combined thus :           N N O 2N+

This peroxide of    nitrogen      (N       4) is quickly      absorbed by the spray and decom-
                                        2

posed by it into nitric oxide and nitric acid. The nitric acid is dissolved by the

hot water of the spray and carried down into the reservoir at the foot of the tower.

The nitric oxide remains undissolved by the spray, but is oxidised as fast as pro-

duced by the air into peroxide, which in turn becomes split up into nitric oxide

and nitric acid, the latter being collected as before in the reservoir. The re-action

may be approximately shown thus :

                             6N2   + 2H    = 3N            2  +  8HN0                .
                                                        2                         3
                                  42

Eventually, therefore, the lower oxides of nitrogen becoming oxidised by con-

tact with air into the higher peroxide, and this in turn becoming absorbed by the
spray and divided into nitric oxide and nitric acid, which latter is always dissolved

and carried down, and the reactions being successively continuous, the whole of the

original nitric acid, when used and operated upon under these conditions, will be

regained.                                                                                         ...

Practically the whole of these reactions occur simultaneously, so that the nitric

acid is reproduced from the lower oxides as soon as they are generated.

This process places another weapon in the power of the manufacturer, and ren-

ders available for many purposes a re-agent at present limited in its application.

In conclusion, I will only add that in no single instance has the process failed or

even varied in its results.

    7. On some Substances obtained from the Boot of the Strawberry.
                             By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F.C.S.

     The author has found in the root of the strawberry certain substances closely
allied with some that are contained in the cinchona barks. The principal of
these is called Fragarine, and can be obtained in large quantities by a process which
with cinchona bark yields the product called Cinchona red. There exists in the
strawberry root a kind of tannin, closely allied to quinotannic acid, and when
its solution is boiled for some time with hydrochloric acid, it decomposes into
glucose and fragarine, which is precipitated as a reddish brown amorphous
substance, highly electrical by friction, taking a reddish purple colour with alkalies,
yielding nitro- and chloro-compounds of a yellow colour, and a conjugated acid with
sulphuric acid. On being heated, fragarine yields water and is decomposed
without fusion, yielding much charcoal and a white sublimate, soluble in water,
which is, apparently, pyrocatechin ; its solution gives a green colour with salts of
iron. Melting potash decomposes fragarine with production of dark brown sub-
stances and a little protocatechuic acid, which can be isolated by ether from the

 acidulated solution, and also colours iron salts green.
      Whilst fragarine is being produced by boiling with hydrochloric acid there

is diffused through the laboratory a veiy agreeable odour of essence of cedar.

 The root also yields a product very similar to quinovic acid.

 8. On a new Mineral White Pigment. By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F.O.S.

    For many years past attempts have been made by several chemists to discover
some new mineral white of a less costly and less dangerous nature than white lead.
Very little success seems to have attended these researches until quite lately.
First, the oxide of zinc produced by the combustion of the metal in the air was

found to have certain properties which allowed it to be used as a non-poisonous
substitute for carbonate of lead. But its production is very costly, and its cover-
                                           TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                                      515

ing power or " body " is not comparable with the latter. Next, an ingenious white
or stone-coloured paint was economically produced from oxide of antimony by

Dr. Stenhouse, which appeared to answer very well in certain circumstances. I
myself have made a great number of experiments with the view of utilising some
of the artificial silicates, such as those of lime, magnesia, and zinc, &c, which
possess a very brilliant white colour, by submitting them to a great variety of
treatments ; but I have been unsuccessful in imparting to them anything like the
" body " of white lead ; they all become more or less translucid when mixed with

oil, like pure silicic acid itself, whatever mechanical treatment they may have pre-

viously undergone.

     "Whilst occupied with these researches I learned accidentally that Mr. Thomas
Griffiths, of Liverpool, had obtained a new pigment, the basis of which was the
white sulphide of zinc, and on submitting this new product to examination I

found, with considerable astonishment, that it surpassed the ordinary white lead
in every respect, in colour, in resistance to the weather and gaseous emanations,
and in durability ; moreover, that it was not destructive to the health of the work-

men who manufacture or who use it. Mr. Griffiths has been experimenting, I
understand, for about ten years upon the best means of producing this new mineral
white upon a large scale, and has, apparently, now brought its preparation to a

state of perfection which has gone beyond the most sanguine expectations.

   A salt of zinc, which may be the sulphate or the chloride, is precipitated

by a soluble sulphide ; the latter being either sodium, calcium, or barium sulphide,
or a mixture of them precautions are taken to avoid the precipitation of any

                                                                                                        ;

black sulphide of iron, if perchance the zinc solutions contain a little of that metal
the bulky product is collected, dried, and transferred to a furnace, where it is
calcined for some time at a cherry red heat. During the calcination it is carefully

stirred to bring each portion successively in contact with the air ; it is then raked

out whilst quite hot into vats of cold water, where it is levigated, and afterwards

collected and dried.

     The result is a white pigment of exquisite beauty. Its covering power, when

mixed with oil, is greater than that of any substance hitherto discovered, being
about 25 per cent, higher than that of the same weight of pure carbonate of

lead.

    According to my analysis, this new product is really an oxy-sulphide of zinc,

the composition of which varies somewhat according to the length of the cal-
cination and the heat attained. Hence it is a difficult matter to get it exactly of

the same composition at each successive operation. Nevertheless, this is attained
quite closely enough for practical purposes. The best product appears to correspond
in composition as nearly as possible to the formula, 5ZnS + ZnO. But occa-
sionally a larger quantity of oxide is produced and the product by means im-

proved thereby.

     In some experiments which I made for the purpose of testing the capabilities
of this new white pigment, as compared with the old zinc white (oxide of zinc),
and white lead (pure carbonate of lead), I was perfectly surprised at the results,

my own experiments made with the view of discovering a substitute for the latter

having proved such utter failures, and I look upon this new oxy-sulphide of zinc

pigment as one of the most interesting products hitherto derived from mineral

chemistry. As it possesses much more covering power than the old zinc white, or

oxide of zinc, it is considerably more economical than the latter. As to white

lead, it has only one recommendation as a colour, namely, its great " body " or

covering  power                            but it is liable  after a time to  saponify the oil, producing  a soap
                                        ;

which is more or less translucid ; moreover, it is darkened by gaseous emanations

and it is detrimental to health. The new product possesses none of these draw-

backs. It has all the covering power of white lead, combined with permanency

in colour, and resistance to the saponifying influence of the oil, and is a much finer
white. Nothing more is requisite but to ensure for it a constant composition, and

I have little doubt that this difficulty will be overcome in the course of a short

time.

   The following Papers were read :                                             By Oliver J. Lodge, D.Sc.

1. On a Simplification of Graphic Formula;.

In the graphic formulae of a compound the elements are ordinarily represented

by their chemical symbols (capital letters), and the connection between the atoms

Nowby straight lines joining the letters.                                 graphic formulae are of most use in

organic chemistry, where the principal compounds consist only of the elements

C, H, 0, and N, whose atomicities are generally 4, 1, 2, and 3 or 5 respectively. In
Nany formulas, therefore, four bonds generally radiate from the letter ;
                                                                                                                                                    is the

meeting-place of three or five bonds,                            according  to  circumstances                                                       two bonds meet
                                                                                                                                                 ;

at each 0, and a single bond terminates at every H. Supposing then that the
letters were omitted and the bonds joined together, the position of the atoms would
still be apparent as the meeting-place of a definite number of bonds, and therefore

the letters are unnecessary.

     The simplification proposed in the paper is the omission of the usual symbols
used to denote the atoms, and the joining of the bonds in such a way as clearly to

define the atomicities, and therefore the natures of the several atoms. Formulae
so drawn become reduced to a sort of geometrical diagram ; and conversely any

12geometrical diagram represents some real or imaginary chemical compound.
     For instance, in the accompanying figure

                                                                                            345

may be dotted, to indicate that the monad is not hydrogen, e.g., Secondary propyl

pirical formulae will or should be written alongside ; and the element intended by

the dot in any particular case will therefore be clear. Other details and numerous

illustrations are given in the paper. The constitution of a body is thus exhibited in

a very compact form which appeals to the eye and impresses itself readily on the
memory. The formulae of even complex bodies are very rapidly drawn, for a few

strokes, instead of representing but a single atom, as H, represents a whole group

the formulae to pieces. At the same time the symbols denoting the different radicals

are such as arise naturally, and are not arbitrary and intrinsically meaningless such

as even Et must be held to be ; and they may always be analysed whenever required.

2. On the Detection by means of the Microphone of Sounds which accompany

     the Diffusion of Gases through a thin Septum. By W. Chandler

     Robert's, F.B.S.

     The author pointed out that the passage of a gas through a porous septum
was undoubtedly due to molecular motion, and as any facts -which bear on
molecular movement are of much importance, he exhibited and described
various forms of apparatus, by the aid of which the passage of hydrogen through

thin septa of paper and graphite might be studied with the microphone. He indi-

cated the several points which appeared to be in favour, as well as those which
were against the view that the vibrations of the molecules of the gas could
actually be detected, and he stated that further experiments were in progress.

7. On some Peculiarities of the Vartry Water, and on the Action of that Water
    upon Boiler Plates. By Charles R. C. Tichborne, LL.D., Ph.D.,

      F.C.S.-

The water of the river Vartry, from which we get our supply in Dublin, has

been repeatedly analysed, therefore I will not trouble the section with a detail of

myits composition. It will be sufficient for  purpose to remind the section of its

general composition, which may be stated to consist of

Organic matter of a peaty nature, 1"6 to 2 grains per gallon.

Mineral matter                                2£ grains per gallon.

The mineral matter chiefly consisting of chlorides of the alkalies, and the alkaline

earths in equal proportions.

     The hardness is nearly all permanent, as there is but a trace of carbonates
present. The point I wish to draw attention to, however, is the presence of nitrates
and nitrites. The first are always present, the latter occasionally in the summer
and autumn months. They were present when last tried on the 3rd of August.
I have never seen any published analysis which mentions the existence of these

acidulous radicals. As my object is to determine the condition of the nitrogen

 salts, and as heat seems to reduce nitrates when occurring in this water, I had re-
 source to evaporation by the aid of a vacuum and sulphuric acid ; the test I used

mybeing the brucia test, an extremely delicate one if properly applied. For

 nitrates 1 used a thin starch solution, made with a little dilute glycerine to keep
 it, and a solution of tartaric acid preserved by a little salicylic acid. The iodide of

potassium being carefully purified from iodate, the solutions keep very well, and
are reliable. The iodide should be dissolved as required. The Vartry water does

                                                       _

not give indications with the tests as a rule without concentrating it. I subjoin

the results of my experiments on the 3rd of August :

     1. Water evaporated to ^ at 100° 0. gave a very striking indication of nitrites,

besides nitrates.

2. Evaporated in a vacuum to 5 it gave no indication.

3. Evaporated in vacuo to \ it gave an indication of nitrites and nitrates.

In January 1878, the Vartry gave no indication of nitrites, but contained, as

Weusual, nitrates, and gave an indication on evaporating to one-half.                                    see by

these observations that evaporation tends to reduce the nitrates. Also that from

fermentative action changes occur at certain periods of the year, which result in

the reduction of nitrates to nitrites.

   We see also that these nitrates and nitrites are present in very minute quantities.

I have never found 0-1 of a grain per gallon said to be present in Loch Katrine

water                               the highest amount  I  have  ever found     being 0-06,  determined  by  the

aluminium process. But still, when these salts are rapidly concentrated, as they

are in the feeding of high-pressure steam boilers, the nitrogen salts become very

--serious items of corrosion, owing to the ease with which the acidulous radicals are

dissociated at high temperature, e.q.

                                    HNaN0                  =  NaNO,,  +  0.

                                    2NO + Fe                  =  N2

                                                                 FeO + 2 0.

I exhibit a boiler plate, which is not eaten away by the corrosive action of

water, but the corrosion is determined by the steam of the Vartry water. I also

exhibit glass corrosion produced by the same means.

 Some experiments were instituted in sealed tubes which bear strikingly upon

^

this subject, and which I now beg to place before the section.

  --No. 1. In this experiment distilled water was boiled in a tube and a piece of

          _

bright wire inserted. The tube was then sealed, after the air had been exhausted.

It is now some months old, and it will be observed that there is comparatively no

Weaction.                           are to infer, therefore, from this experiment, that at ordinary tempera-

Wetures water is without the slightest action upon iron in vacuo.                            all know how

rapidly iron is oxidized in the presence of water containing air.

No. 2 is iron sealed up in vacuo with Vartry water, and submitted to high-

pressure steam at 301bs. to the square inch. The action is sharp and well marked,

theresults being the production of ferric oxide in considerable quantities, and mag-

netic oxide. The latter can be recognised on applying a magnet outside the tube.

The third tube was a similar experiment with pure water, containing l- grain

per gallon of nitrate of potassium. This also was sealed in vacuo. The results

are almost identical with the second experiment, only that more magnetic oxide

seems to have been formed. The fourth experiment was one in which a nitrite was

substituted for the nitrate. Here nothing but ferric oxide was formed of a peculiar

bright colour, and in scales.

That the corrosion of the boiler plate mainly proceeds from the nitrogenous

molecules, I think there can be little doubt. But the quantity of these acidulous

radicals being very small, any of the alkaline preservations would remedy this

corrosive action. If, however, neglected, these nitrogenous acidulous radicals would

almost certainly lead to mischief, and therefore they are imminent sources of

danger.

 520 report--1878.

      As the last meeting of the Association in this city took place twenty-one years

 ago, it would at first sight appear that in opening our proceedings I might with
 propriety dwell on the progress which has been made within that period in the
 development of the geology of Ireland. I must, however, remind you that it is

 only four years since the Association held its meeting in what I may almost call
 the neighbouring town of Belfast, when the accomplished chief of the Geological

 Survey in Ireland presided over this section, and delivered an address in which
 some of the more interesting features of the country, especially those of the

 volcanic district of the north-east of this island, were discussed. During the
 present year, moreover, he has published his comprehensive work on the Physical

 Geology and Geography of Ireland, which I commend to you as far more likely to

 call your attention to the characteristic features of the country and the latest
 discoveries with regard to its geology than anything I could compile.

      In addition to this, there has appeared during the present year another inte-
 resting volume, which records the impressions of a highly intelligent foreign

geologist on visiting this country. I mean the ' Aus Irland ' of Dr. Arnold von

Lasaulx, Professor of Mineralogy in the University of Breslau. For this volume,
in which shrewd remarks on the country and its inhabitants are mingled with
geological observations and valuable comparisons of the Irish formations with

those of other countries, we are indebted to the meeting of the British Association

having been held two years ago at Glasgow, which attracted the author to visit the

British Islands.

     So much having lately been published upon the geology of this country, I shall
content myself with making a very few general observations with regard to it, and

propose subsequently t J touch briefly on some of those questions which, within the

last twelve months, have occupied the attention of those who are engaged in the

advancement of our science.

     As to the geology of this country, I may observe that we are here assembled

just on the edge of that great central plain which forms so important a feature in

the map of Ireland, and which stretches from Dublin Bay on the east coast to
Galway Bay on the west, with hardly a portion of it attaining to an elevation of

three hundred feet above the sea, over a tract of country nearly one hundred and
fifty miles in extent in almost every direction.

     The boundaries of this great plain and those of the Carboniferous Limestone
almost coincide, so that we have here the somewhat remarkable feature of a forma-
tion which in England is of such a character as to have received the name of the
Mountain Limestone, constituting in the neighbouring island nearly the whole of
the plain country. In some of the north-western counties, however, as for instance
Fermanagh and Sligo, it assumes its more mountainous character. Nearly the
whole of this central plain is overlain with boulder clay, limestone gravel or middle
drift, and extensive bogs, so that the subjacent rock is but occasionally seen. In
several places detached bosses of Old Red Sandstone rise through the limestone,
and there is also good reason for believing, with Professor Hull, that the whole of
the area was at one time covered with the upper members of the carboniferous
group, including the true coal measures, of which unfortunately but small patches
remain, and those upon the margin of the plain. From the absence of the upper
Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Cainozoic formations over the area, Professor Hull has
arrived at the conclusion that the surface remained in the condition of dry land,
while that of England was being submerged beneath the waters of the sea, over
the bed of which nearly all these formations were deposited. To a certain extent,
however, he leaves it an open question whether some of the Mesozoic strata which
occur over the north-east of Ireland may not have been deposited over the centre
and south. The amount of denudation over this central area has, no doubt, been
such that the chances of even Professor Judd finding traces of these latter deposits
appear at first sight to be but small ; but whether the whole of this vast amount of
denudation is due to the wasting influence of rain, rivers and other sub-aerial agents
of erosion, is a question which I venture to regard as at all events open to discus-
sion. It appears to be the case that in some parts of the north of Ireland the
whole of the upper Carboniferous beds had been denuded before the deposition of

stone                        and if this amount  of  denudation  had  taken place in pre-Permian times in

the north, there seems a possibility of the same haying been the case in central

Ireland. If so, it is possible that some traces of the later deposits may yet be
found on the central plain. Certainly, if we are still to regard the white chalk as a

deep-sea deposit, the cretaceous rocks of the north-east of Ireland must have at one
time extended farther south than they do at present, and somewhere or other there
must have been shore deposits of that period formed further south than the Upper

Greensand of Antrim. The careful investigations of Professor Judd have largely

extended our knowledge of the Secondary rocks of the western coast and islands

of Scotland, and he has been able to show that the Jurassic series of the Western

Highlands could not have had a thickness of less than three thousand feet. It is

therefore hard to believe that with such a development in so closely neighbouring

a district, the deposits of the same age in Ireland can have been restricted to their

present area.

Professor Judd considers that the amount of denudation in the Scottish High-

lands since the Mesozoic and even the Miocene period has been enormous, and that

the great surface features of the Highlands were produced in Pliocene times. It
seems therefore possible, if not probable, that so long a period of exposure to sub-

aerial influence as that assigned to the central plain of Ireland by Professor Hull,

would have resulted in a more uneven land surface than that which we now find.
At all events, the history of this remarkable physical feature is one which is of

high interest, and can hardly as yet be considered as closed.

    With regard to the mountainous districts surrounding the central plain, we

shall, I believe, have the opportunity of visiting some parts of the Wicklow

Mountains, a district from which a portion, at all events, of the native gold of
Ireland was procured in ancient times, as indeed it continues to be. Of the
abundance of gold in this country in early times, a glance at the magnificent col-

lection of ancient ornaments preserved in the Museum of the Eoyal Irish Academy

will serve to give an idea. Even in times more recent than those in which the
bulk of these ornaments were made, gold was an important product of this country,
and I am tempted to quote a few lines from an early English poem, < The Libell

of Englishe Policye,' witten in the year 1436. In treating of the commodities of

Ireland, the author says that the country is

                             " So large, so gode, and so commodious

Sir William Wilde has observed that the south-western half of Ireland has

yielded a greater amount of gold antiquities than the north-eastern, and probably

this would hold good with regard to the production of the metal itself, though it

has been found in the counties of Antrim, Tyrone, and Deny, as well as in those of

Dublin, Wicklow, Wexford, and Kildare.

The north-east of Ireland possesses, however, another geological feature peculiar

to itself in that great expanse of volcanic beds which formed the subject of Pro-

Myfessor Hull's address to this section at the Belfast meeting.                                                                                                                                                         only object in
now mentioning them is again to call attention to their containing the only remains

of a Miocene flora which are to be found in this island. Analogous beds were

detected in the corresponding basalts in the Island of Mull by the Duke of
Argyll in 1851. With the exception of the Hempstead beds of the Isle of Wight,
522 eeport--1878.

which should probably be classed as Oligocene, and the Bovey Tracey beds of
Devonshire, these are almost the only deposits of Miocene age in the British Isles.
The contrast presented by the scarcity of deposits of this period in Britain with
their abundance in the north-west, centre, and south of France, Switzerland, and
generally in the south of Europe, is striking. Instead of thick deposits covering
hundreds of square miles of country, like the Miocene beds bordering the Pyrenees
or those of the great system of the Auvergne, we have small patches owing their
preservation either to volcanic outbursts having covered them up, or to some
favourable circumstance having preserved them from total denudation. Whether

we are to assume, with the late Professor Edward Forbes, that the general dearth

of these strata in the British Isles arose from the extent of dry land which pre-
vailed during the long interval between the Eocene and Pliocene periods, or whether

we assume the former existence of widespread marine deposits which have since
been entirely removed, the case is one not without difficulty. At all events, the

absence of representatives of this period within the Biitish area has a tendency to
prevent a due appreciation of the enormous extent of the Miocene period being
generally felt in this country. Nor, generally speaking, do we, I think, take a fair

estimate of the remoteness in time to which we must date back the commencement
of that lengthened period. Professor Haughton, judging from the maximum ob-

served thickness of each successive deposit, has calculated that a greater interval

of time now separates us from the Miocene period than that which was occupied

in producing all the Secondary and Tertiary strata from the Triassic to the Miocene

epoch, and, without endorsing the whole of my accomplished friend's conclusions,
I incline to concur in such an estimate. When it is considered that the Ballypalidy

beds of Antrim and the Lough Neagh clays are the sole representatives in Ireland
of two periods of such length and importance as the Miocene and Pliocene, their
high interest will be more apparent, and I trust that no opportunity of minutely
studying them will be neglected.

     There is one other point with regard to Irish geology on which it will be well to
say a few words, though it is of a negative rather than a positive character. I mean
the absence, so tar as at present known, of Palaeolithic implements in this country.

It is true that Professor Hull, in the book to which I am so much indebted, speaks

of a raised beach on the Antrim coast as containing worked flints of that rude
form and finish known as Paleolithic but this is a slip of the pen, by which the

                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

author has fallen into the not uncommon error of applying a term which is merely
significant of the age of the implements to their external character. However
rude may be the workmanship of the flint implements found atKilroot, they belong
to the Neolithic, and not to the Palaeolithic period. So far as I am aware no example
of any implement belonging to the age of the mammoth, rhinoceros, and other mem-

bers of the post-pliocene fauna has as yet been found in Ireland. Indeed, the
remains of Elephas primiyenius and its associates are of exceedingly rare occurrence
in this country, though they have been found with those of bear and reindeer in the
Shandon Cave near Dungarvan. It is, of course, impossible to foretell what future

researches may bring to light ; but judging from analogy it seems hardly probable

that until ancient river-gravels containing the remains of the post-pliocene group

of mammals are found in this island, veritable Palaeolithic instruments will be
discovered. The association of the two classes of remains is so constant that we
may fairly assume that the animals formed the principal food of the Palaeolithic

hunters, and that any causes which lead to the absence of the one class will lead to

the absence of the other also.

     There is, however, one member of that old quaternary group which is far more

--abundant in Ireland than it is in England or on the continent of Europe the
--megaceros which has rightly received the appellation of Hibernicus.

     I hope that we may have an opportunity, under the guidance of Mr. Kichard

Moss, of seeing some of the remains of this " antlered monarch of the waste " in
the position in which they were originally interred, and it will be an interesting
question for consideration whether these remains can be regarded as of the same
geological age as those of the English caves and river-gravels, or whether they do
not for the most part belong to what Professor Boyd Dawkins has termed the Pre-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  523

 historic period. It seerus by no means improbable that this gigantic stag survived
 iu this country for ages after he had become extinct in other lands, and that the

 view held by Professor Hull of his extinction being due to persecution by man is
 correct. If this be so it would seem to follow that the human occupation of

 Ireland is of far more recent date than that of the sister country.

     And this brings me to one of those questions which have of late been occupying

 the attention of geologists. I mean the date which is to be assigned to the imple-
 ment-bearing beds of Palaeolithic age in England. Dr. James Geikie has held that

 for the most part they belong to an interglacial episode towards the close of the
 Glacial period, and regards it as certain that no Palaeolithic bed can be shown to
 belong to a more recent date than the mild era that preceded the last great sub-

 mergence.
      His follower, Mr. Skertchly, records the finding of Palaeolithic implements in

 no less than three interglacial beds, each underlying boulder clays of different ages
 and somewhat different charac ters--the Hessle, the purple, and the chalky boulder

 clay. This raises two main questions, first, as to how far Dr. Croll's theory of the

 great alternations of climate during the Glacial period can be safely maintained
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

 and secondly, how far the observations as to the discovery of implements in the

 so-called Brandon beds underlying the chalky boulder clay can be substantiated.

Another question is how far the Palaeolithic deposits can be divided into those of

modern and ancient valleys, separated from each other by the purple boulder clay,
and the later of the two older than the Hessle beds. It would be out of place here

 to discuss these questions at length. I will only observe, that in a considerable

number of cases the gravels containing the implements can be distinctly shown tobe
of much later date than the chalky boulder clay, and that if the implements occur
in successive beds in the same district, each separated from the other by an enormous
lapse of time, during which the whole country was buried beneath incredibly large
masses of invading ice, and the whole mammalian fauna was driven away, it is a

very remarkable circumstance. It is not the less remarkable because this succession

of different Palaeolithic ages seems to be observable in one small district only, and

there is as close a resemblance between the instruments of the presumedly different
ages as there is between those of admittedly the same date. I have always main-

tained the probability of evidence being found of the existence of Man at an earlier

period than that of the post-glacial or quaternary river gravels, but, as in all other

cases, it appears to me desirable that the evidence brought forward should be tho-

roughly sifted and all probability of misapprehension removed before it is finally
accepted. In the present state of our knowledge, I do not feel confident that the

evidence as to these three successive Palaeolithic deposits has arrived at this satis-

factory stage. At the same time it must be home in mind that if we make the

Palaeolithic period to embrace not only the river gravels but the cave deposits of
which the south of France furnishes such typical examples, its duration must
have been of vast extent.

    In connection with the question of Glacial and Interglacial periods, I may

mention that of climatal changes in general, which has formed another subject to
which much attention has of late been given. The return of the Arctic Expe-
dition, and the reports of the geological observations made during its progress,
which have been published by Captain Fielden, one of the naturalists to the Expe-
dition, in conjunction with Mr. De Ranee and Professor Heer, have conferred

additional interest on the question of possible changes in the position of the poles
of the earth, and on other kindred speculations. Near Discovery Harbour-, about
latitude 81° 40', Miocene beds were found containing a flora somewhat differing

from that which was already known to exist within the Arctic regions. "The
Grinnell Land lignite," say the authors of the report, " indicates a thick peat moss,

with probably a small lake, with water lilies on the surface of the water, and reeds
on the edges, with birches, poplars, and taxodiums on the banks, and with pines,

firs, spruce, elms, and hazel-bushes on the neighbouring hills." "When we consider

that all of the genera here represented have their present limits at least from

twelve to fifteen degrees farther south, while the taxodium is now confined to

Mexico and the south of the United States, such a sylvan landscape as that
524 eepoet--1878.

described seems entirely out of place in a district within six hundred miles of the
pole, to which indeed, if land then extended so far, these Arctic forests must have
also extended in Miocene times. Making all allowance for the possibility of the
habits of such plants being so changed that they could subsist without sunlight

during six months of a winter of even longer duration, I cannot see how so high a

temperature as that which appears necessary, especially for the evergreen varieties,
could have been maintained, assuming that Grinnell Land was then as close to the

North Pole as it is at the present day. Nor is this difficulty decreased when we

look back to formations earlier than the Miocene, for the flora of the secondary and

Palaeozoic rocks of the Arctic regions is identical in character with that of the

same rocks when occurring twenty or thirty degrees farther south, while the corals,
encrinites, and cephalopods of the carboniferous limestone are such as, from all
analogy, might be supposed to indicate a warm climate.

     The general opinion of physicists as to the possibility of a change in the posi-
tion of the earth's axis has recently undergone" modifications somewhat analogous

in character to those which, in the opinion of some geologists, the position of the
axis has itself undergone. Instead of a fixed dogma as to the impossibility of

change, we find a divergence of mathematical opinion and variations of the pole
differing in extent, allowed by different mathematicians who have of late gone into

the question, as for instance the Rev. J. F. Twisden,* Mr. George Darwin,t Pro-
fessor Haughton,} the Rev. E. Hill,§ and Sir William Thomson.|! All agree in the

theoretical possibility of a change in the geographical position of the earth's axis
of rotation being affected by a redistribution of matter on the surface, but they do
not appear to be all in accord as to the extent of such changes. Mr. Twisden, for
instance, arrives at the conclusion that the elevation of a belt twenty degrees in

width, such as th^it which I suggested in my presidential address to the Geological

Society in 1870, would displace the axis by about ten miles only ; while Professor
Haughton maintains that the elevation of two such continents as Europe and Asia

would displace it by about sixty-nine miles ; and Sir W. Thomson has not only ad-
mitted, but asserted as highly probable, that the poles may have been in ancient
times " very far from their present geographical position, and may have gradually

shifted through ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or more degrees without at any time any

perceptible sudden disturbance of either land or water."

    I am glad to think that this question, to which I to some extent assisted to

direct attention, has been so fully discussed, but I can hardly regard its discussion

as being now finally closed. It appears to me doubtful whether eventually it will

be found possible to concede to this globe that amount of solidity and rigidity

which at present it is held to possess, and which to my mind at all events seems to

be in entire disaccordance with many geological phenomena. Yet this, as the

Rev. 0. Fisher ^[ has remarked, is presupposed in all the numerical calculations

which have been made. I am also doubtful whether, in the calculations which

have been made, sufficient regard has been shown to the fact that a great part of
the exterior of our spheroidal globe consists of fluid which, though of course
connected with the more solid part of the globe by gravity, is readily capable of
readjusting itself upon its surface, and may, to a great extent, be left out of the
account in considering what changes might arise from the disturbance of the
equilibrium of the irregular spherical or spheroidal body which it partially covers.

It appears to me also possible that some disturbances of equilibrium may take place

in a mysterious manner by the redistribution of matter or otherwise in the interior

of the globe. Captain F. J. Evans,** arguing from the changes now going on in

terrestrial magnetism, has suggested the possibility of some secular changes being
due to internal, and not to external causes ; and if it be really true that there is a
difference between the longest and shortest equatorial radii of the earth, amount-
ing to six thousand three hundred and seventy-eight feet,tt such a fact would appear

to point to a great want of homogeneity in the interior of our planet, and might

suggest a possible cause for some disturbance of equilibrium.
     I have mentioned Professor Haughton among those who, from mathematical

considerations, have arrived at the conclusion that a geographical change in the

position of the axis of rotation of the earth is not only possible but probable. In

a recent paper, however, he has maintained that, notwithstanding this possibility

or probability, we can demonstrate that the pole has not sensibly changed its posi-
tion during geological periods. He arrives at this conclusion by pointing out that

in the Parry Islands, Alaska and Spitzbergen, there are Triassic and Jurassic de-

posits of much the same tropical character, and then by a geometrical method
fixing the north pole somewhere near Pelrin, and the south pole in Patagonia,

within seven hundred miles of a spot where Jurassic ammonites occur, shows that

such a theory is untenable. In the same way he fixes the pole in Miocene times

near Yakutsk, within eight hundred miles of certain Miocene coal beds of the

Japanese islands. These objections are at first sight startling, but I think it will

he found that if, instead of drawing great circles through certain points, we regard

those points as merely isolated localities in a belt of considerable width, there is

no need of fixing the pole of either the Jurassic or the Miocene period with that
amount of nicety with which Professor Haughton has ascertained its position.

The belt may indeed be made to contain the very places on which the objection is
founded. Still the method is a good one, and I hope that as our knowledge of
foreign geology extends it may be still further pursued. There is, however, one

farther consideration to be urged, and that is as to the safety of regarding all de-
posits of one geological period as contemporaneous in time. Although an almost

identical flora may be discovered in two widely-separated beds, it appears to
me that chronologically they are more probably of different ages than absolutely
contemporaneous; and, inasmuch as the duration of the Miocene period must

--have been enormous, there would be time if once we assume a wandering of the

--poles for such wandering to have been considerable between the beginning and

end of the period.
      I must not, however, detain you longer upon this phase of geological specula-

tion, but will advert to a subject of more practical interest, the discovery of

Palaeozoic rocks under London. So long ago as 1856 the Kentish Town boring

had shown that immediately below the Gault red and variegated sandstones and
clays occurred, which Professor Prestwich regarded as probably of Old Red or

Devonian age. The boring of Messrs. Meux and Co. has now shown that under

Tottenham Court Road, at a depth of little more than nine hundred feet from the
 surface, there are true Devonian beds, with characteristic fossils, and that Mr.
 Godwin-Austen's prophecy of the existence of Palaeozoic rocks at an accessible
 depth under London has proved true. Professor Prestwich, from a consideration
 of the French and Belgian coal-fields, inclines to the belief that in the district

north of London carboniferous strata may be found. Unfortunately the expense
 of conducting deep borings, even with the admirable appliances of the Diamond

 Boring Company, is so great that I almost despair of another experimental bore-
 hole like that carried out in the Wealden district under the auspices of Mr. Willett,
 being undertaken.

      In the department of theoretical geology I would call your attention to some
 experiments by M. Daubr6e, of which he has given accounts at different times to
 the French Academy of Sciences. In these experiments he has attempted to re-
 produce on a small scale various geological phenomena, such as faulting, cleavage,
jointing, and the elevation of mountain chains. Although the analogy between

work in the laboratory and that on the grand scale of nature may not in all cases

 be perfect, yet these experiments are in the highest degree instructive, and reflect
 no little credit on the ingenuity of the distinguished chief of the Ecole des Mines.

      "With regard to recent progress in palaeontology, I must venture to refer you to
 Professor Alleyne Nicholson's inaugural address lately delivered to the Edinburgh
 Geological Society, but I cannot pass over in silence the magnificent discoveries in
 North America, which are principally due to the researches of Professors Marsh,
 Leidy, and Cope. The diceratherium, a rhinoceros with two horns placed trans-
--526 report 1878.

versely, and the dinoceras, somewhat allied to the elephant, but with six horns,
arranged in pairs, are as marvellous as some of the beasts seen by Sir John
Maundevile on his travels, or heard of by Pliny. But perhaps the most remark-
able series of remains ever discovered are those which so completely link the
existing horse with the eohippus and orohippus, and still farther extend the pedi-

gree of° the genus equus, which had already been some years ago so ably traced by

Professor Huxley.

     Of these American discoveries, as well as those made in the Tertiary beds of
Europe, M. Albert Gaudry has largely availed himself in his recent beautiful
volume on the links in the animal world jn geological times, a work which will
lon°- be a textbook on the inter-relation of different orders, genera, and species.

I am tempted to make use of some portions of M. Gaudry's own analysis of the

book, which he communicated to the Geological Society of France. Beginning
with the marsupials of the close of the Secondary and beginning of the Tertiary
period he shows that they are succeeded by such animals as the pterodon, the
hycenodon, the proviverra, and arctocyon, which present a mixture of marsupial and

placental characters, and to some extent justify a theory of the transition from one

order to the other. He next examines the "marine mammalia, and points out that,

so far as at present known, they make their appearance later than those of the

land, and that the examination of the pelvis of the halitherium tends to support
the idea of the mammals, such as the sireniaDS, which at the present day have no

hind limbs, being descended from terrestrial quadrupeds, for those limbs in the

halitherium are much less reduced than in its recent successors, the dugong and

manatee. After tracing the numerous links which are to be found between the
extinct and living pachydermata, he proceeds to show that, notwithstanding the

great distance between them and the ruminants, transitions may be seen. The

earliest ruminants were devoid of horns and antlers, but possessed upper incisors,

and by a comparison of the molars of different genera it may readily be conceived
how the large bosses of the omnivorous teeth of the pachyderms gradually shaded
into the small crescents of the teeth of the ruminants. At the same time the

passage from the heavy and complicated extremities of the limbs of the pachyderms
to the simpler and lighter feet of the ruminants can be traced. The history of the
horse family is also discussed, and the descent of existing proboscidians from the
mastodonts is shown to be probable, though the previous forms from which the nias-
todonts and dinotheria are derived are as yet unknown. Nor can the origin of the
carnivora as yet be suggested, though passages between the six existing families of

the order may be observed. In conclusion, M. Gaudry devotes a chapter to the

quadrumana, and thinks that palaeontological observations tend to diminish the

isolation in which these mammals now stand with regard to the other orders.
     One of the most important features insisted on by M. Gaudry is that to

which I have already alluded--the development of the complicated molars of most
mammals. His view is that by a comparison with early and with foetal forms the

probability maybe shown of these compound teeth being made up of what in

-- --earlier forms were simple teeth or, as he has termed them, denticules which

have coalesced in the same manner as have some other parts of the normal bony
skeleton. In the compound teeth the denticules in some cases preserve their

original conical form, as in the pig tribe ; in others are elongated transversely, so as

by their junction to form ridges, as in the tapirs ; while in others, again, they are
drawn out into longitudinal crescents, as in the ruminants. Between these forms

there are of course, innumerable transitions. They do not, however, appear to me

to affect 'the importance of M. Gaudry's observations, which must be regarded

as of the highest value in all attempts to trace the inter-relation of different forms

of mammalian life. I must not, however, detain you longer on this subject, as I
trust that I have said enough to show the importance and interest of this book.

     The discoveries of early forms of birds with teeth do not come within M.
Gaudry's province ; but Professor Marsh has largely added to our knowledge of
these remarkable forms. The Tertiary Odontopteryx toliapicus from Sheppey,
described by Professor Owen, seems rather to be endowed with bony tooth-like
processes in the jaw, than with actual teeth, and the head of the Arqittwnis from
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                         527

the same locality is at present unknown. But the Hesperornis and Ichthyornis from
the cretaceous beds of America possess veritable teeth, in the one case set in a
long groove in the jaw, and in the other iu actual sockets. Such intermediate, or,
as Professor Huxley would term them, intercalary forms, tend materially to bridge
over the gap which at first sight appears to exist between reptiles and birds, but
which to many palaeontologists was far from being impassable, long before the
discoveries just mentioned. The amphicoelous character of the vertebrae of
ichthyornis presents another most remarkable peculiarity, which is also of high
significance. I hear rumours of the discovery of another archceopteryx in the
Solenhofen Slates, which is said to present the head in a much more complete con-
dition than that in which it occurs on the magnificent slab now in the British
Museum. As yet, I believe, the jaws have not had the matrix removed from

them ; but should they prove to be armed with teeth, it will to me be a cause of

satisfaction rather than surprise, as confirming an opinion which some fifteen years

ago* I ventured to express, that this remarkable creature may have been endowed

with teeth, either in lieu of or combined with a beak.

     I must not, however, detain you longer with any of these general remarks,

which are, moreover, becoming somewhat egotistic, but will now proceed to the

business of this Section, in which I hope that more than one paper of great value

and interest will be forthcoming.

2. On the Ancient Volcanic District of Slieve Guttion. By Joseph Nolan,
                M.B.I.A., #*c, of H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland.

     Slieve Gullion is a somewhat isolated mountain situated some few miles north
of Dundalk, and west of the picturesque hilly country lying between the bays of
Dundalk and Oarlingford. The rocks which mainly compose it are massive dolerites
and elvanites, which have been erupted through granite of Lower Silurian a<*e.
From evidence obtained in a neighbouring locality, there is every reason to believe

that the period of this eruption was about the close of the Palaeozoic epoch. On

the west and south of the mountain the elvanite forms a remarkable dyke-like ridge,
when it changes in its character from a granitoid rock to a felstone porphyry.
Simultaneously with this change, suggesting conditions of less intense heat and
pressure, a remarkable fragmental rock makes its appearance. It is here almost
altogether composed of granite pieces ; so much so that it might be taken for a
disintegrating condition of that rock, but that the base is not crystalline. Its
mechanical character is confirmed on tracing the ridge further, where the granite
gives place to Silurian slates and grits. Here there is a mixture of slate and granite
fragments, and still further in the slate district it is almost altogether composed of
slate debris. At all these places the fragmental rock is intimately associated with,
the porphyry, so that where both are 'well exposed in sections it is impossible to
draw any line of demarcation between them, the lower part of the former gradually
acquiring the character of the latter, by the appearance in increasing quantity of
fragments of porphyry, until it ultimately passes into that rock.

    That we have here something analogous to volcanic agglomerate we can scarcely
entertain a doubt. Nevertheless, it differs very much from the usual type of that

rock, as it is, except in the deepest portions, mainly composed of pieces of non-

that we have here the result of an ordinary eruption, where lava is ejected, and we
are forced to believe that it was altogether aeriform. From the great extent of

country over which the agglomerate occurs, it is not improbable that the explosion
which accompanied the protrusion of the nearly horizontal dyke affected a con-
siderable area at the same time, disrupting and triturating to powder the overlying
rocks, the vast volume of which, falling back into the opening, together with the
rapid consolidation of the igneous mass consequent upon so great a disengagement
of the interstitial vapotir, combined to check the volcanic activity before it could

produce scoriae or lava.
     Another point of interest in connection with this district is the evidence it

affords of the connection between the plutonic and the volcanic rocks. This is not
indeed as fully exemplified here as in other districts, as, for instance, in the Western
Isles of Scotland, where Professor Judd traces all the gradations from granite to

pumice and scoria, yet it is sufficiently illustrative of the principle when we find
plutonic rocks graduating into others which by their protrusion have produced me-

chanical accompaniments.

3 Notes on the Glaciation of Ireland, and the Tradition of Lough Lurgan.

                 By W. Mattieu Williams, F.R.A.S., F.O.S.*

In comparing the vestiges of ancient glaciation (especially those of Norway

and Ireland) with the deposits of existing Alpine glaciers, the author has been

much impressed with the very general fact that, although the " till " and other

varieties of boulder clay are of unquestionable glacial origin, they are unrepresented

by the moraines, &c, of the glaciers now existing in the temperate zones ; and on

the other hand true representatives of recent Alpine moraines are very rarely

found among the ancient glacial deposits.

    An explanation of this is offered. Living Alpine glaciers (with a few ex-

ceptions) terminate on mountain slopes, and are sources of mountain torrents.
These torrents wash out, carry away, and afterwards deposit as a distinct alluvium
the material corresponding to the clayey matrix of the ancient drift, leaving
behind only the boulders and smaller stony particles to form the stony heaps of

modern moraines.
     The remarkable absence of such moraines on the very long and remarkably

"·lariated coast line and mountain slopes of Scandinavia is explained by the fact

that the glaciers of that region originated in a great neve, covering the table-land

fields which overflowed down their boundary valleys into the sea.
     The great central plain of Ireland is compared to such a fjeld. During the

glacial epoch it was covered with ice, was a great neve or glacier source, and its
outlet glaciers flowed on all sides over the surrounding mountain barriers down

their seaward slopes into the ocean and terminated there, leaving the bulk of their

mineral burdens in the sea.
     Glaciers thus outthrust upon the waters under a climate in which the annual

snowfall exceeded the annual thaw, would be thinned from below and grow from
above, and thus extrude their mineral matter downwards instead of upwards, as in

Alpine temperate-zone glaciers.

They would present a further inversion of such glaciers, by bending upwards

by flotation as they advanced, instead  of  downwards by gravitation                                                                                                      and their cre-
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

vasses would therefore be formed at the lower instead of the upper surface of the

ice, and would gape downwards instead of upwards.

As they became thawed below by the friction of their advance they would

accumulate a vast amount of debris at their base, effecting far more erosion than
the clearer ice-bottom of modern Alpine glaciers. Thus, more fine slimy im-
palpable powder or clay material would be formed, and this, in its slimy condition

     * The views of the constitution of ancient glaciers, and the formation of boulder
clay, contained in this communication, are more fully discussed in a paper on ' The
Great Ice Age and the Origin of the Till,' published in the ' Quarterly Journal of

Science ' of April, 1877.

 would be thrust forward so long- as the glacier exerted considerable pressure by its
 gravitation. But as it thinned out, this pressure must have gradually diminished
 until it became nil, when the depth of water and thinning of the ice effected
 approximate flotation. Then the mud, &c, would be deposited, and the shallowed
 sea woidd form a submarine plain of the neutral depth over which the glacier would
 just lightly slide and thus form a striated pavement of till.

      If the conditions remained constant, this deposit would continue level as we see
 it at Bodo and other places in Norway ; but if climatic or other conditions fluctuated,

 the varying advance and recession of the glacier and its varying pressure would
 produce a ploughing up of the soft material into submarine ridges such as abound
 in the Irish bays that are mouths of the great glaciated valleys, and are also found
 so abundantly on and near the coast.

     The islands of Clew Bay are specified as striking examples of this.
      Having lately met with an account of a tradition which describes a great fresh-
 water lake on the present site of Galway Bay, and having already noted many of
 these long ridges of till in that Ray, the author revisited Galway with the object
 of further examining them in reference to the tradition which states that the fresh-
 water lake was converted into a bay by the sea breaking through the boundary or

 bar that had previously separated the fresh from the salt water.
      The general result of this exploration of both shores of the Bay and several of

 its islands was, that tbe existence of such a barrier or of a series of such barriers

 appears very probable; but their position does not indicate so large a lake, as the

 traditionary Lough Lurgan which is described as one of the three great lakes of

 Ireland.

      The outermost barrier probably stretched from the cliffs of Barna (which are
formed by the sea washing away one of these ridges of till and exposing a fine
perpendicular section about 50 feet thick) to Aghinish Point, meeting the Kilcro-
gan promontory on the way, when this ridge of drift extended much farther west-
ward, as its present truncated headland of till indicates that it must have done.

      These, and other minor headlands of till, all the obvious remains of promontories
that have been cut off, are connected by a bar that stretches obliquely and irregu-

larly across the Bay from Barna, in County Galway, to Finvarra Point, in County

 Clare.

      The promontories and island ridges do not extend fairly, across the Bay, but lie
in a direction from E.N.E. to W.S.W. They are still so numerous and extensive
as to visually overlap each other and present the appearance of an inner bar, en-
closing the inner bays of Galway and Kinvarra. This occurs when they are viewed
from the shore of Salthill, about 2 miles from Galway.

   A minor bar is well seen from the railway on leaving Oranmore station on the

way to Galway. The till cliff of Eoscarn Point is there seen opposed to a similar

cliff on the opposite side with a channel cut between them.
     If the ancient barrier was nearly as high as the present cliffs of Barna, the

waters of the traditionary lake must have backed over a large area of the flat land

around Galway, and it may even have been continuous with Lough Corrib.

     Another form of drift which covers a large area of the central limestone plain
of Ireland is described as analogous to that which covers the Dovrefjeld, the Fille-
fjeld, and most of the other Norwegian fjelds, and which the author has described
in detail in 'Through Norway with Ladies,' pages 50 and 238, as the material

which subsided when the great neve of the Great Ice Age finally thawed away.

It is neither boulder clay nor loose stony moraine material, but an intermediate
agglomeration of sand and gravel with boulders that are more angular than those

of moraines or boulder clay, and show little or no signs of striation. The name of
boulder sand or glacier gravel is suggested. It occurs, commonly as a thin
layer spreading over the limestone and occasionally as long humpy ridges, and

is connected with the formation of Eskers.

4. Notice of some additional Labyriuthodont Amphibia and Fish from the
        Coal of Jarrow Colliery, near Castlecomer, County of Kilkenny, Ireland.

      By William Hellier Baily, F.L.S., F.G.8., M.B.I.A., fyc, Acting

        Paleontologist to the Geological Survey of Ireland.

     The Geological Survey having recently acquired a number of specimens from
Jarrow Colliery, near Castlecomer, through the kindness of Mr. J. Dobbs, the pro-
prietor, and Mr. A. McLuckie, manager of the colliery, consisting of amphibian
reptiles and fish, in addition to those previously collected from the same colliery,
at the request of Mr. Hull, Director of the Survey. The following short descrip-
tion of these interesting specimens was given by Mr. Baily.

     This series of fossils consists of more than 50 specimens, all belonging to the
vertebrata, 25 of them being amphibia, 20 fish, and the remainder of doubtful

character.

     The largest amphibian is one already described by me as Anthracosaurus JEdyei

in a paper read before the Royal Irish Academy, January 13, 1873. These remains
indicate an animal which must have been from eight to ten feet in length ; they
consist of a triangular-shaped head, under jaw, and other portions of the skull, not
however in a good condition for study, together with a group of twelve well-defined
vertebrae and ribs in much better preservation than those before obtained.

     The other amphibian remains I have identified with the following geneva and
species, described by Professor Huxley in the ' Transactions of the Royal Irish
Academy, vol. xxiv. (Science), pp. 351, &c. :

     Keraterpeton Galvani, of which there are four specimens.
     Ophidei-peton Brownriygii, two specimens.
      Dolichosoma Emersoni, three specimens.
      Erpetocephalus rugomis, one specimen.
     There are others evidently amphibian, including two heads, which I have not

yet succeeded in identifying possibly some of them may belong to one or both of
                                                                                                                   ;

the two genera alluded to by Professor Huxley, but not figured, under the names
of Dichospondylus and Brachyscelis.

     The fish remains include a fine example of what I believe to be Megalichthys
Hibberti. This great sauroid is here represented by a specimen three feet seven

inches in length, the extremity of the tail being deficient.
     Another fine fish, referred to the genus Ccelacanthus, appears to be allied to

C. granulatus Agassiz, hitherto confined to Permian strata, only the caudal ex-
tremity having previously been known. The skeleton of this fish is very complete,
its length being 22 inches, and breadth at commencement of ventral fin six inches.

     In this collection there are also some groups of ribs and other bones, which corre-
spond with those of a large fish from the same colliery, named Gampylophuron by

Professor Huxley, but which may possibly be identical with the fish we have

referred to Megalichthys Hibberti.
     Several specimens of the defence spines of cestraciont fish, Gyracantkus

formosus, A.g.,* and a single palatal tooth of Ctenodus, complete the list of fish
which have been identified. There are also several detached bones and fragments
in this collection of vertebrate remains at present undetermined.

     * G. formosus and G. tuberculatus I believe to be identical, as suggested by

Agassiz.

5. The Relative Ages of the Raised Beaches and. Submerged Forests of

                Torbay. By W. Pengelly, F.R.S., F.G.S., 8fc.

Near Hope's Nose and Berry Head, the northern and southern horns of Torbay,

Devonshire, there are fine examples of a raised beach about 30 feet above the

level of the existing tidal strand ; whilst along the central shores of the bay, at

Tor Abbey, Paignton, Godrington, and Broad Sands, there are exposed at low

water, more or less frequently, considerable accumulations of clay, with

stumps of trees rising vertically, and having roots and rootlets ramifying through

the mass. In short, Torbay presents admirable studies of the raised beaches and

submerged forests found so frequently at intervals along the entire coasts of

Devon and Cornwall, and affords evidence, so far at least as the bay is concerned,

that during the formation of the beach the country was about 30 feet lower than

at present, whilst at the time of the forest growth it was not less, but may have

been much more, than 80 feet higher than now ; and that, in each case, the move-

ment was so uniform and so tranquil as not to destroy or to modify the approxi-

mate horizontality of the areas. It has always been admitted that the beaches and

the forests cannot have been coeval ; and there has been a prevalent but not an '

unchallenged belief that the beaches are the older. The object of this paper is to

afford proof, through evidence hitherto overlooked, of the correctness of this

chronology.

The parish of Paignton, forming the central shore of the bay, is terminated on

the north-east by a narrow gulley, through which a rivulet reaches the sea. At

this point the sea cliff is no more than 20 feet high ; as it extends towards the

south-west it gradually reaches 55 feet, and thence, with a gentle declivity, it

descends to within a foot or two of the sea-level, at about -25 mile from the

rivulet. Beyond this, the coast for a considerable distance is a sandy plain,
covered with greensward a very few feet above high-water level. The cliff" just

mentioned consists of two zones ; the lowermost being the well-known Trias of
South-Eastern Devon, whilst the uppermost belongs to a much more recent

formation.

             mm2
532 report--1878.

A study of the upper zone shows that the materials are remarkably angular,

and consist of fragments of grit derived from Devonian beds at no great distance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

that they are very loosely aggregated, have no approach to a stratified arrange-

ment, but lie with their longest axes at all angles to the plane of the horizon ; that

-- --the accumulation never more than a few feet thick is thinnest where the cliff is

highest ; that the contour of the surface on which it lies is very much the same as

that of the present surface ; and that stones so prevalently angular and so lacking

in arrangement could never have been subjected to the rolling and assorting power

of the sea ; in other words, that the accumulation is of sub-aerial origin. When,

however, the Torbay raised beaches were formed, and the country was 30 feet

lower than at present, the greater part  of the Paignton cliff was submarine                                                                                                                                      hence
                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the bed of angular stones must have been lodged in its present place at a period

subsequent to the elevation of the beaches.

On following the coast towards the sandy plain on the south-west, the bed of

angular stones passes under a bed of clay. This superposition, distinct and unmis-

takeable, is exposed for a distance of nearly 400 feet ; and the clay, occupied with

stumps and roots of large trees, is finally covered with a thick accumulation of

peat, traceable, especially after violent gales, in all directions, and to the low-water

line ; forming, in short, a well-marked remnant of the Torbay Submerged Forest.

The clear superposition proves, beyond a doubt, that the period of the forest growth

was subsequent to that of the formation of the bed of angular stones, which,- as

already shown, was in its turn subsequent to the era of the elevation of the

beaches. The facts show, moreover, that since the beach era the Torbay district

has never been at so low a level as it was at that time.

6. Experiments on Filtration of Sea Water through Triassic Sandstone*

                                By Isaac Roberts, F.G.S.

    7. On the New Geological Map of India. By V. Ball, M.A., F.G.S.

     The last occasion when the subject of the geology of India was prominently
brought before this Association was during the meeting at Dundee in 1867, when
the late lamented Dr. Oldham described the general features and sequence of for-
mations as then known. To his memory a just tribute has already been paid by
the President of the Section and Professor Hull. Of him, on the occasion of his
leaving India, it was well said by the present Superintendent of the Survey, Mr.
H. B. Medlicott, F.RS., " Where he has sown others have reaped."

      Since the year just alluded to considerable progress has been made, and the

map now exhibited shows the state of our knowledge up to a twelvemonth ago,
when it was sent to press. From its small scale of 64 miles to the inch it is but

little more than an index, and merely indicates the limits of the principal forma-
tions. For large tracts of India, however, maps, showing the minor details and

subdivisions already exist.

     Some idea of the magnitude of India may be gathered from the fact that a
portion of country equal to Ireland, big as it looks on the map opposite on the
scale of one inch to a mile, would make but an inconsiderable gap were it removed
from the map of India.

     This map is intended to illustrate a manual of the geology of India, which is
now being prepared by the two senior members of the Survey, Messrs. Medlicott
and Blanford. The publication of this work, which will take place towards the

end of the present year, will, it is expected, place Indian geology on a more stable
and externally intelligible footing thau it has hitherto enjoyed. In Europe it is
hoped to prove the means of enlisting the interest and critical aid of geologists in

elucidating many of the peculiarly perplexing questions connected with the subject

    * Incorporated in the Report on ' Underground Waters.' See Reports, p. 397.

of homotaxis. In India it is hoped that the work will incite local amateurs to
aid our small staff. In former times much good yeoman's service was done by
amateurs, whose observations were incorporated in Greenough's well-known map.
But in the India of to-day it would be difficult to name half a dozen amateur geolo-
gists. The causes of this scarcity of volunteers are not difficult to explain. There

is now more pressure from official duties, and the facilities for making short runs

to Europe during periods of relaxation are vastly increased.
     The details of the geology of India are far too complicated to be disposed of in

a speedy review like the present. The more especially as some of our palaeontolo-
gists have attempted to establish minute correlation of horizons with those recog-
nised and established in Europe. Hence have arisen what are known as " palreon-

--tological contradictions " the marine faunas, where existing, not always pointing

to the same conclusions as the floras.

   --Broadly speaking, it may be said that there are two geologies in India that

of the Himalayas and adjoining tracts, and that of the Peninsula proper. The

former conforms in general characters with that of Europe, but the latter is very

much sui generis, unlike, at least as regards many of the formations, the geology of

any other well-known tract on the earth's surface. It is on this account that a

duplicate arrangement of the index has been found to be necessary.
     The author then gave a brief description of the principal Peninsular forma-

tions, and pointed out their leading characteristics and probable correlation with

European rock systems. He indicated on the map the position of the principal

coalfields, and stated that the total area of actual coal measures was possibly not
less than 30,000 square miles. The position of the coalfields in reference to that
of many of the large cities was most unfortunate, and as regards the southern
and western parts of India native coal was generally undersold by English and

Australian.

     Regarding the Talchir boulder bed, he was anxious to retract an early opinion
of his which had recently been quoted by the President of the Geological Society
of London. The glaciation of some of the boulders since found was as distinct as it
was on the boulders exhibited to the meeting by Mr. Williams in connection with

his paper on the glaciation of Ireland. And recently, as also on a former occasion

some years ago, he had come upon a boulder deposit in the Talchir series, which
was full of masses of Vindhyan quartzite which must have been carried for 50 or
60 miles from the nearest possible source, and had in all probability been ice borne.

    With some remarks on the nature and distribution of laterite, the author con-

cluded his brief sketch.

1. On the supposed Radiolarians and Diatoms of the Carconiferous Bodes. '
                     By Professor W. C. Williamson, F.B.S.

At the meeting of the British Association in 1872, Mr. Carruthers described

some small objects to which he gave the generic name'of Traquairia, and which he

Aconcluded were Radiolarian skeletons.       characteristic series of these objects

having been obtained. by the author, he felt compelled to reject Mr. Carruthers'
determination as to their nature. They are small spherical bodies, from which pro-

ject numerous slender and apparently muricated branching prolongations, which

have at a superficial glance the appearance of spines, but which were shown to be

something very different. The entire sphere is encased in a structureless membrane,

of which the supposed spines are tubular, thin-walled, cylindrical extensions, and

which in turn give off numerous symmetrically-arranged tubular branches, which

probably ramified in a mucilaginous (?) investment. Within this outer membrane
were one or two other capsular membranes, the innermost of which was found, in

several examples, to be filled with cells that bore every indication of being vege-

table tissues, being absolutely undistinguishable from similar cells found in the

interiors of macrospores, and of cryptogamic sporocarps found associated with the

Traquairia?. These combined features led the author to regard the germs as

belonging to the vegetable rather than to the animal kingdom, and to represent a

cryptogamic form of reproductive structure.

The author further described the minute organisms found in some of the moun-

tain limestones of North Wales, and which have been regarded as Radiolarians by

some geologists. These appear to be wanting in true Radiolarian characteristics,

but most of them seem rather to have been hollow, calcareous spheres. It is the

opinion of Professors Roscoe and Schorlemmer that the substitution of carbonate

of lime for silica in these organisms is a most improbable occurrence, and one that

can only be deemed possible in the case of organisms whose originally siliceous com-

--position is beyond the reach of doubt which is very far from being the case in the

instances referred to.

Some time ago, Count Castracane announced a discovery of numerous remains

of marine and fresh-water Diatoms in the siliceous ash remaining after coal had

been subjected to certain chemical processes, of which the Coimt recorded the

method. Dr. Roscoe permitted Mr. Smith, one of his able assistants, to make for

the author similar preparations of thirty examples of Yorkshire and Lancashire

coals, prepared according to Count Castracane's directions, in Dr. Roscoe's labora-

tory, under the eye of that distinguished chemist. There is every guarantee for the

correctness of these preparations, but none of them exhibit the least traces of

Diatomaceous structures. Hence the author concludes that, so far as his experience

enables him to judge, there are as yet no evidences of the existence of either

Radiolarians or Diatoms during the Carboniferous age.

                2. On some Fossils from the Northampton Sands.
                        By John Evans, D.C.L., F.B.S. , 8fc.

     These fossils from the ironstone beds of Duston, near Northampton, are casts
of lithodomous borings originally made in lumps of coral, impressions of which
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  535

they still bear on their outer surface. In the interior, the presence of the shells

is still to be traced. Their history appears to be that the cavities made by the
boring shells were first filled with limonite, subsequently converted into carbonate
of iron and eventually into hematite. Last of all, the enclosing coral has been
entirely removed by the infiltration of water charged with carbonic acid. This last
process has probably taken place since the emergence of the beds from below the
sea-level. The Northampton sands have been fully described by Mr. Samuel

--Sharp, F.G.S., in the 'Quart. Journ. of the Geological Society.' Vol. xxxiv.

     The following Papers were read :

           1. On the Metamorphic and Intrusive Bodes of Tyrone.
  By Joseph Nolan, M.B.I.A., fyc, of H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland.

     The rocks described in this paper occupy the central parts of County Tyrone,
extending from Omagh eastwards and north-eastwards towards Slieve Gallion.
They consist for the most part of an amorphous green hornhlendic rock, in the midst
of which is a wide lenticular tract of micaceous gneiss and schist. The author
shows that these two classes pass gradually into each other, and that even among
the amorphous hornhlendic rocks traces of schistose structure can generally he

observed, while local transitions into schist frequently occur. Gradations into
more crystalline rocks were also noted and described, those of a hornhlendic cha-
racter passing into a felspathic variety in which little or no hornblende occurs,
while quartz and orthoclase are developed, so that a coarse quartz porphyry is pro-
duced, passing ultimately into granite.

     It was also shown that some of the granite was intrusive during the period of
the Old Red Sandstone and its association with metamorphic rocks of Lower
Silurian age explained on the hypothesis that the intrusive granite was due to re-
metamorphism at the later period, so that portions of the already crystalline rocks
were completely fused and became irruptive. That metamorphic action in this
district continued up to and even after the Old Red Sandstone age seems to have
been the opinion of the late General Portlock, who in his ' Geological Report on
Londonderry with Parts of Tyrone,' &c, has described these rocks and their

relations to each other at considerable length. He did not seem to have considered
the granite to be intrusive, but merely a metamorphosed condition of what we
now call the Lower Carboniferous Sandstone, which was then classed with the
Old Red formation.

    2. On the Origin of Crystalline Rocks. By T. Sterky Hunt, F.B.S.

        3. On some Neiu Areas of Pre-Cambrian Bochs in North Wales.
                             By Henry Hicks, M.D., F.G.S.

      In addition to the areas of pre-Cambrian rocks already described by the author,

he now includes amongst that ancient group the following, which he has recently

explored, accompanied by Professor Torell, of Stockholm, and Mr. Tawney, of
Cambridge, and during part of the time by Professor Hughes, of Cambridge, and
Dr. Sterry Hunt, of Montreal.

     1. Some cupriferous schists with their associated green bands (intrusive green-
stone of the Survey), and including Robel Fawn, to the north of Dolgelly.

     2. The so-called ' intrusive felspathic porphyries and Greenstone breccias,' in
the neighbourhood of Pwllheli.

     3. The so-called intrusive syenitic (Rhos Hirwain Syenite) and felsitic masses
and the associated schists which together form the extremity of the promontory of
Caernarvonshire, and also Bardsey Island.

     4. The so-called ' intrusive felspathic porphyries ' in the neighbourhood of
Llanfihangel and Nevin.

     5. The granite and felstone of the Eifel range, and some masses of felstone

to the north.

     6. The so-called ' altered Cambrian,' to the soutli of Glyn Clifon.
     7. The ridge of granite and the whole of the so-called altered Cambrian rocks

in Anglesea.

     In these areas it was found that the rocks resolved themselves into three very-
well-defined groups, and as the author had already recognised that these groups
formed part of three distinct formations at St. David's, unconformable on one
another, he proposed to divide the rocks of North Wales in the same manner.

     The lowest beds are like his Dimetian at St. David's, and consist chiefly of

granite or granitoid gneiss rocks.

     The next in ascending order is the great felsitic group, and for this he proposes
the name Arvonian* since it forms so large a part of the mountains in Caernarvon-

shire.

     The third includes most of the so-called altered Cambrian beds, and consists
chiefly of schists, or schistose rocks, and is usually a highly chloritic group. This
he associates with the Pebidian of St. David's.

          4. On " Gervus Megaceros." By William Williams.

The " Cervus Megaceros," commonly called the " Irish Elk," whose remains often

occur in the marl beds under the peat bogs of Ireland, appears to have been drowned

by miring in the stiff clay forming the beds of lakes which were once very numerous

in the country, but which have since silted up, and are now occupied by peat bogs.

The author, having been engaged for ten weeks making excavations in search of

these remains in the Bog of Bally betagh, ten miles from Dublin, had arrived at the

following conclusions--1st, that the animal had lived after the first glacial epoch,

as he found the remains  resting                            on  the  lower  boulder  clay                        2nd,  that the clay in
                                                                                                              ;

which he found them seemed to indicate a temperate climate, as it was mostly com-

posed of vegetable matter, indicating very little degradation of mineral matter from

the surrounding hills ; 3rd, the clay last mentioned is covered with a bed three feet

thick, containing hardly any vegetable matter, it being almost all mineral. He

concludes that this bed of clay was produced by ice action degrading and wearing

down the hills. That it is glacial he infers

1. From its texture, it being ground granite.

2.  From  its  quantity                                     an ordinary mild climate would not wear down the hills
                                                         ;

to produce such a bed, and as it is at a level of 800 feet it has not been imported

from the drainage of other places.

3. From having found a reindeer's antler in this bed, be infers that a sub-arctic

climate must have prevailed at time of its deposit.

4. From the broken state in which the antlers are found, he cannot conceive

any force wbich would have been sufficient to break one of these beams of hard

sound bone three inches in diameter, unless the vertical pressure of immense masses

of ice, while the antlers were embedded in the lower clay ; running water could

not do it ; for the teeth have not their corners broken off, nor are the tracks of the

blood-vessels in the antlers ground off or water worn.

Hence he infers that the animal lived after the deposit of the lower boulder

clay, and previous to that of the upper boulder clay, or that it lived inter-glacial

and may have been exterminated by the last ice period.

           5. On the Bodes of Ulster as a Source of Water- Supply.
   By William A. Traill, M.A.I. , H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland.

     The author referred to the backward state of the study of hydro-geology in Ire-
land, and to the acknowledged necessity for larger and purer supplies of water for

    * From the Roman name Arvonia, and from which the present name of Carnarvon

is derived.
538 eeport--1878.

many towns in Ulster. In too many cases the present supplies were derived from

--the uncertain and dangerous sources of shallow-surface wells, situated within the

habitable area sources universally condemned as scarcely possible to be free from

pollution.

  --The two great systems of water supply were contrasted that by catchment

basins with reservoirs, and that by deep wells or borings. The author strongly

advocated the latter, where geological formations would warrant a trial. He
showed that many towns in England were successfully supplied by artesian wells
i >r borings into the Chalk or New Red Sandstone formations.

     The rocks of Ulster were then reviewed with . special reference to their
suitability for rendering water by boring, and the best localities for such operations

enumerated.

    Among the formations which did not possess the essential conditions necessary for

success were mentioned the Lower Silurian rocks which comprise the greater portion
of the counties of Down, Louth, Armagh, and Monaghan, and the granitic tracts of
Newry, Slieve Croob and Mourne, in which localities the catchment basin system
had to be adopted, as was the case for the Newry water supply.

     In the same category were placed the granitic and metamorphic tracts of Done-
gal and West Londonderry.

  --The New Red Sandstone in England one of the chief formations in which to

--bore for water- occupies in Ulster a very limited surface area, being for the greater

part overlaid by other formations. Artesian borings in these rocks had proved
successful, as at the " Cromac Springs " in Belfast, while in other cases they had
been unsuccessful, from a wrong selection of sites.

     The Chalk and Hibernian Greensand formations were shown to be the great

water-bearing strata of Ulster, occupying a very extensive area in the counties of
Antrim and Londonderry, but overlaid by other formations, such as the Tertiary

basalts. . The Mesozoic rocks form a geological basin, the basaltic area occupying
the centre, with the Chalk and Greensand cropping out almost continuously along
its margin, and underlaid by the plastic clays of the Lias or Keuper marls. The
occurrence of this basin was clearly demonstrated by the elevations and dip of the
chalk around its margin, and its deep-seated existence inside, as at Templepatrick
and other places. The presence of large quantities of water in the Cretaceous beds
was apparent everywhere, from the number of large springs along the outcrop, and
the constant outpouring of water where the lip of the basin was low, resulting
in frequent landslips, as at Garron Tower, Carnlough, Glenarm, Whitehead and

other places.

     The existence of water held under hydrostatic pressure within the basin was.
also evidenced by the numerous large perennial springs occurring in the basaltic

plateau.

     The sequence of the formations within this area and the occurrence of water-
bearing strata were then enumerated. Below the so-called upper basalt there
exists the first great water-bearing stratum at the ferruginous lithomarge bed of
the iron-ore measures. For potable purposes it is too highly charged with hydrated
oxide of iron. The lower aluminous bed is also water producing, of a purer
quality, but less plentiful ; the districts where these occur are, however, compara-

tively small.

     By boring through the overlying basalt within this extensive basin the chalk

--and greensand could readily be pierced--if within the area of the lower basalt, at

no great depth and where, undoubtedly, a plentiful and pure supply of water
would be obtained.

     The districts where such, with every prospect of success, might be attempted
would be approximately along the valley of the river Bann, or near Ballymena,
Ballymoney, Coleraine or Antrim. The districts of Cookstown, Dungannon and
Moneyniore were differently situated geologically, but the formations were favour-
able, and water had been proved in the bore-holes for iron ore in that neigh-

bourhood.

     The author strongly advocated, for certain localities in Ulster, the adoption of
deep wells or borings for the purpose of obtaining water supplies.

6. On the Occurrence of certain Fish Remains in the Coal Measures, and the

    Evidence they afford of their Fresh-water Origin* By James W. Davis,

     F.G.S., L.8., Hon. Secretary of the Yorkshire Geological and Poly-

       technic Society.

   A few miles south-west of Leeds, in the district of Morley and Adwalton,

there is a bed of cannel coal which is extensively wrought. It occurs about 130

yards above the silkstone or blocking coal ; the latter forming the base of the

middle coal measm-es in the West Riding of Yorkshire. An average section of the

bed of cannel or stone coal is as follows :

Black shale

     In the cannel coal, and more numerously in the impure cannel above and below
it, there occur numerous fossil remains of fish. They consist of both elasmo-

branchs and ganoids, but by far the most common are specimens of Ccelacanthus
lepturus, Ag. The extent and seeming method of deposition of the cannel coal

--viz., in a series of small inland lakes, at times dried up, and at others more or

less filled with water taken in conjunction with the internal anatomy of the
( Velacanthus and the frequent occurrence of the fossil bones of Labyrinthodonts,
lead to the inference that these swampy pools were very similar to those*found in
Africa and Australia at the present time, where Lepidosiren and Ceratodus inhabit

their muddy beds, and during the dry season, when the ponds and streams are

dried up, are enabled, by the action of a lung-like air-bladder, to exist either out

of the water or buried in the mud until the rainy season again enables the fish

to breathe in the ordinary manner by gills. The Ccelacanthus are similarly pro-

vided with a swim bladder, whose walls have been erroneously described as osseous,

which, so far as can be ascertained, served an exactly similar purpose to that of

the Lepidosiren now existing. These facts, together with others cited in the paper,

point to the conclusion that the strata were of subaqueous, and in all probability

freshwater origin.

     7. On the Discovery of Marine Shells in the Gomrdsier Beds of
                  Northumberland.^ By G. A. Lebouk, F.G.S.

     The author described the circumstances of the find, which took place in the first
instance near the village of Whittonstall, in South Northumberland, at the begin-

ning of the present year (1878). He then adverted to some hitherto unrecorded

previous observations of marine forms in the Lower Coal Measures in the neighbour-

hood of Wylam and Prudhoe, by Mr. G. C. Greenwell, F.G.S. The species

altogether were the following :

     A, from Whittonstall (four localities) :

            Aviculopecten papyraceus.

          Av. sp., two forms not sufficiently well preserved for specific determination.

            Orthoceras sp., a small elegant form.
           Encrinite stems, decomposed in every case.

     Mr. Lebour then described the Gannister beds of the district, discussed their
relations to the overlying and underlying members of the Carboniferous series, and

concluded that, north of the Tees, the lines defining the division stratigraphically
were purely arbitrary.

The following Papers were read :

    1. On the Influence of "Strike " on the Physical Features of Ireland.
By Edward T. Hardman, F.G.S.,F.E.G.S.I, Geological Survey of Ireland.

Although not often mentioned in geological works, the influence of " strike " in

determining the lines of direction of the principal physical features of a country is

recognised by most geologists, but in few countries is the relation so distinctly

shown as in Ireland. The author was led to pay attention to this subject on
reading Mr. J. F. Campbell's paper ' On the Glaciation of Ireland,' * in which that
gentleman assumes that the south-west and north-east trend of some of the
mountains of Ireland is due to the glacial action of a huge ice sheet passing over
Ireland from the south-west of Scotland. After some years' examination, how-

ever, the author has found that in most cases the trend of the hills, and course of

rivers, &c, are determined by the strike alone ; and he now wished to place the

--facts noted before the section :
     (1) Mountains. The Donegal highlands trend to the south-west, along the line

of strike of the ancient crystalline stratified rock. The basaltic plateau of Antrim

follows in outline the windings of the outcrop of the underlying chalk, and, conse-

quently, the strike of the basalt upheaved with it. The Mourne Mountains and

Slieve Croob also coincide in direction with the stratified rocks on their flanks,

except where joints or faults have given rise to minor lateral valleys, e.g. Car-

linsrford Lou«h. Adherence to the line of strike is also seen in the hills forming

the flanks of the Wicklow Mountains, in the Kilkenny and Tipperary coal-fields,

the Comerao-h and Knockmealdown Mountains, and is most remarkably shown in

that series of flexured carboniferous, old red sandstone, and Silurian rocks forming

the hills of Cork and mountains of Kerry, the axes of which stretch from Dun-
garvan (Co. Waterford) to Cape Clear and Bantry Bay. Its influence is again

shown in the shaping of the high ground forming the Munster coal-field, and

finally in the  mountainous  district  of  Connemara                                                         although  here,  in  places,
                                                                                                          ;

obscured by the action of faults. The Twelve Pins, Muilrea, the mountains

flankino- Killarney harbour, and the country northwards around Nephin Mountain

are striking examples. Towards the central plain the isolated mountains of old

red sandstone and Silurian rocks rising through the carboniferous limestone, viz.,

the Slieve Bloom Mountains, the Devil's Bit, and the Galtees, conform to the same

rule, the axis in strike and direction being parallel.

    (2) Rivers. In the North of Ireland especially, many of the rivers follow the

windings of the strike. The Suir follows the line of strike for eighty miles, only

beginning to cross it about ten miles from the sea. The Blackwater runs along the

strike for seventy miles of its course, crossing it for only sixteen miles. The Lee is

directed by the strike for some fifty miles of its length, as is also the Bandon
River for the greater part of its course, while tbe Shannon may be traced along the

--strike of the beds for by far its greatest distance.
     (3) Inland Lakes. Most of the lakes are conformable to the strike in their
o-reater outline, tbe smaller details being determined by the jointing. Of these may
be mentioned Lough Neagh. Loughs Corrib and Mask, Lough Erne (most notably),
Lou"h Allen, Lough Derg, and the far-famed Lakes of Killarney.

    (4) Sea Loughs, Bays, 8,-c--Tbe majority of these may be included :--Lough
Foyle, Belfast Lough, Strangford Lough, Lough Larne. The most notable ex-
ample's are those in the south-west :--Roaring Water Bay, Dunmanus Harbour,

                * ' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.,' Londou, May 1872.
542 REPORT 1878.

Bantry Bay, Kenmave River, and Dingle Bay ; also the mouth of the Shannon,
Galway Bay, and Clew Bay. Further north the principal hays and indentations

--along the line of coast stretching from Broadhaven to Donegal Killala Bay, Sligo
--Bay, and Donegal Bay have heen excavated in their great outlines along lines of

strike.

     In conclusion, the author pointed out that nature had adopted the least expen-
sive method of working, since it is always easier to excavate along a line of strike
than across the tedding. Usually cleavage, or incipient cleavage, is induced along
the line of strike hy the forces which upheaved the rocks, and denudation is most

easily effected therefore in that direction.

2. On Hullite, a hitherto ujidescribed Mineral; a Hydrous Silicate of pecu-
      liar composition, from Carnmoney Hill, Co. Antrim, ivith Analysis. By
      Edward T. Hardman, F.C.8., H.M. Geological Survey. With Notes

       on the Microscopic Appearances, by Professor E. Hull, M.A., F.R.8.

   --Part I. This mineral occurs in abundance at Carnmoney Hill, near Belfast, in

the basalt forming the old neck of a Miocene volcano. It has never been described
or analysed, and has been referred to on the survey maps, and labelled in the survey

collection as Obsidian, doubtless from its black colour and waxy lustre. In
physical character it somewhat agrees with the Chlorophaeite of Macculloch, but
is entirely different in composition, which more resembles that of Delessite. From

this, however, it differs essentially in colour, hardness, streak, and specific gravity.

--It appears, on the whole, to belong to the ferruginous-chlorite group, however.
      Physical characters. Colour, velvet black. Hardness, about 2. Brittle.
Lustre, waxy, dull ; streak olive brown. Before blowpipe, with difficulty fusible
at edges to a black glass, which in some specimens is magnetic. Very slightly

affected by strong acids, but decomposed when boiled in the powdered state in
strong H.Ol. Occurs, filling amygdaloidal cavities in the basalt of Carnmoney
Hill, near Belfast, and Shane's Castle, Lough Neagh.

     It will be noticed that there are striking differences in the composition of the

new mineral from the others. The large amount of water in Chlorophseite, and the
fact that it appears to have been obtained by difference, seems to throw some

doubt on the analysis.

That given above does not agree with any known types of silicate. Supposing it

     Its low specific gravity and its resistance to the blowpipe are remarkable, con-

sidering the large amount of iron.

    The author proposes to name this mineral Hullite, after Professor Hull, who
has done much valuable work in elucidating the microscopic mineralogy of the

basalts of Ireland.

   --Part II. Microscojric structure of the Basalt. Professor Hull describes the

microscopic appearance of the mineral, and of the rock in which it occurs. The
basalt contains short prisms of augite imbedded in a paste of plagioclase felspar, a
great deal of olivine, and the mineral described above in abundance. Under the
microscope, the latter is of a dark amber brown colour, nearly opaque. It per-

meates the whole rock, filling the interstices, and enclosing the other minerals. It

does not polarize, and is, therefore, not crystalline, but assumes very much the

character of amorphous chlorite, being apparently, like it also, a secondary

mineral formed after the consolidation of the rock.
     The rock contains an abundance of olivine, not seen in such quantity in any

other basalt of Antrim, and hardly ever so fresh and unaltered. In most cases
the outer form only is preserved ; but here it is as fresh as in the lavas of

Vesuvius. From this it might be inferred that the rock was comparatively recent,

did we not know it to be older than the Glacial and Pliocene periods.

             3. The Progress of the Geological Survey of Ireland.

              By Professor Edward Hull, M.A., F.E.8., Director.

                        (With the Sanction of the Director-General.)

     The author gave a short account of the progress of the Survey from its com-
mencement in 1832, under the late General Portlock, R.E., down to the present
day, stating that the whole country south of a line drawn roughly from Lame,
on the coast of Antrim, to Sligo, had been surveyed, while 160 sheets of the.
geological map on a scale of 1-inch to the statute mile had been published.

     Along with these had also been issued 78 separate Explanatory Memoirs,
describing the structure and palaeontology of 12B sheets. It had also been found
necessary to revise the geology of the Leinster and Tipperary Coal-fields, the
Carboniferous trap-rocks of County Limerick, and the south-east portion of the
country, including part of Wicklow and Wexford. The coal-fields of the North of
Ireland had also been surveyed, and published on maps both on the " 6-inch " and
41 1 -inch " scales ; and it was also intended that the districts of County Antrim,
containing the pisolitic iron ores, should be illustrated by maps on both scales.
The tract still remaining to be examined included the greater portion of the
counties of Donegal, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Sligo, and Antrim.

                         5. The Geological Relations of the Atmosphere.

                            By T. Steret Hunt, LL.D., F.R.S.

       The author began by noticing the inquiries of Ebelmen into the decomposition

  of rocks through the influence of the atmosphere, resulting in the fixation of car-
  bonic acid and oxygen, and discussed the question at length, with arithmetical

 data. He inquired farther into the fixing of carbon from the air by vegetation

 with liberation at the same time of oxygen both from carbonic acid and from the ·
 decomposed water, the hydrogen of which with carbon forms the bituminous coals
 and petroleums. It was shown that the carbonic acid absorbed in the process of

 rock-decay, during the long geologic ages, and now represented in the form of car-

 bonates in the earth's crust, must have equalled probably two hundred times the
 entire volume of the present atmosphere of our earth. This amount could not, of
 course, exist at any one time in the air : it would at ordinary temperature be lique-

 fied at the earth's surface. When came this vast quantity of carbonic acid which

 must have been supplied through the ages ? The hypothesis of M. De Beaumont,
 who supposed a reservoir of carbonic acid stored up in the liquid interior of the
 planet, was discussed and dismissed. The gas now evolved from the earth's crust
 from volcanic and other vents was probably of secondary origin and due to carbo-

 nates previously formed at the surface.
      The solution of the problem offered by the author is based upon the conception

 that our atmosphere is not terrestrial, but cosmical, being a universal medium

 diffused throughout all space, but condensed around the various centres of attrac-
 tion in amounts proportioned to their mass and temperature, the waters of the
 ocean themselves belonging to this universal atmosphere. Such being the case, airy
 change in the atmospheric envelope of any globe, whether by the absorption of the
 disengagement of any gas or vapour would, by the laws of diffusion and static
 equilibrium, be felt everywhere throughout the universe, and the fixation of car-
bonic acid at the surface of our planet would not only bring in a supply of this gas
from the worlds beyond, but, by reducing the total amount of it in the universal

atmosphere, diminish the barometric pressure at the surface of our own and of

all other worlds.

     This conception of a cosmical atmosphere of which our own forms a part is not
new, but was put forth by Sir William R. Grove in 1843, and is developed in the
very learned and ingenious work of Mr. Mattieu Williams, on ' The Fuel of the
Sun,' and has lately been noticed by Dr. P. M. Duncan in its geological bearings.

Ebelmen, in 1845, pointed out that the greater weight of an atmosphere charged with
carbonic acid would increase the temperature due to solar radiation at the earth's
surface, and greatly modify atmospheric phenomena. Tyndall, by his subsequent re-
searches on radiation, showed that certain gases, in amount too small to affect con-
siderably the barometric pressure, might influence powerfully climatic conditions,
and suggested that in the former presence, in the atmosphere, of moderate quantities
of a gas like carbonic acid might* be found a solution of the problem of the cli-
mates of former geologic ages. According to the author, the amount of this gas,
which, since the advent of life on our earth, has been subtracted from the univer-

sal atmosphere," although it may not have sufficed to diminish by more than a

small fraction the pressure at the earth's surface, would account for all the con-
ditions of geological history so far as temperature and climate are concerned.

    He maintains that while we have evidence of a warm or sub-tropical climate
prevailing over the Arctic regions from the Carboniferous down to the Lower Creta-

ceous times, and a gradual refrigeration up to the temperate climate of the Miocene

age, we had for the first time in the Pliocene age the evidence of Arctic cold, which,

with some variations, has continued until now. Since that date geographical varia-

tions have caused and may again cause local climatic changes of considerable mag-

nitude ; but no such changes could permit the existence, over continental areas

within the Arctic circle, of such tropical vegetation as we know to have once
flourished there. Geographical changes, as Dr. F. Campbell Dawson and others

have so well pointed out, might lift large areas into the region of perpetual frost,
and thus give rise to local glacial phenomena, and may, moreover, account for con-
                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                    545

Wesiderable local climatic variations at the sea level since the Pliocene age.

cannot, however, account in this way for the warmer climates of previous ages, but

must seek for their cause in the former constitution of the atmosphere.
      Touching the suggestion that former climatic changes were due to a displace-

ment of the earth's axis of rotation, the author expressed the opinion that it is
irreconcilable with the fact, long ago insisted upon by him, that " the direction
of the Arctic currents, which are guided by the earth's rotation, appears, from the
distribution of marine sediments, to have been the same since very early periods."
Dawson has reinforced this argument by recalling the fact that the southward mi-
gration of successive floras shows, in like manner, that from the Devonian age the
general courses of oceanic currents, and consequently the position of the earth's

axis, have not changed.

8. Notes on Eribollia Mackayi, a New Fossil from the Assynt Quartzite in
    the North-Western Highlands of Scotland. By James Nicol, F.R.S.E.,

     F.G.S., Professor of Natural History in the University of Aberdeen.

The remarkable fossils to which the above name has been given were found on

the western shore of Loch Eriboll by Mr. Donald Mackay, of Portnacow, in a por-

tion of the Assynt quartzite, or middle deposit of the west coast series of strata.

On a small block (of 9 inches by 7) more than a dozen peculiar bodies are seen
running down into the interior. They are mostly rounded and conical in form, and

show a central core, covering about half the width, and enclosed in an outer wall.

One of the most regular measures about 1£ inch above, and 3^- inches long to the

point below. Others are smaller, but similar in form and structure. Some of them

occur single, but others are joined in twos or threes, and arranged as if in

parallel rows. One of the largest, about 2 inches across, is more square in form,

and does not taper as it descends.

The single conical forms much resemble Orthoceratites, but show no trace of

septse or partitions ; whilst the internal appearance and mode of grouping rather

Ullapool, shows no structure when polished. As they differ very widely from any

known organism, he has named them Eribollia, from the locality, Maekayi, from

their discoverer. Some of the curious bodies, formerly described as casts of annelid

tubes may, he thinks, also prove similar corals. From the Ullapool quartzite he

has also a whorled shell (Macluria?).

The author in conclusion stated that he still adheres to his published views of

the structure of the North-Western Highlands.

9. On the Influence that Microscopic Vegetable Organisms have had on the
     Production of some Hydrated Iron Ores. By M. Alphonse Gages.

Geologists are aware of the influence some microscopic animal living organisms

have in the formation of bog ir^.n ore, resulting from the iron of surrounding decom-

posing rocks, and also of the properties that the skeletons of these organisms com-

municate to the iron.

     There are also other deposits of iron ores, far more important, and which cover
immense tracts of land, especially in the tertiary formations ; many of them are
remarkable for their purity, and are free from debris of former rocks.

     Under what influence were some of these so-called limonites, or brown hema-
tites, formed? This problem can, I believe, be more or less solved by the
observation of a phenomenon going on in some of the large iron tanks holding

Yartry water.

   We have in the College of Science, Dublin, a large iron tank on the roof of the

house, into which a constant supply of water flows freely. After a certain lapse of
time, the bottom of the tank and also the sides are covered with sponge-like concre-
tions, assuming the various shapes of the well-known concretions of lime or iron
ore found in various geological formations. The above sponge-like deposits are,

in our case, nothing else but vegetable microscopic organisms-- billions, I may say,

of thread moulds, Penicillia.

     These organisms accumulate after many months to such an extent as to form an
immense sponge intercepting the flow of water. Nevertheless, in the case of the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           _

iron tank, the water remains pure and pleasant to drink, and is without any taste

of iron.

     These organisms have, I may say, assimilated the iron (as hydrated sesqui-
oxide) and made of it a part of their constitution.

     During the process of life they have consumed the carbonic acid, and they
leave as a last result, when dried in a water-bath, a pure ore of iron, containing
a mere skeleton of carbon, and having a formula corresponding to that of brown

hematite.

2. On the Correlation of Lines of Direction on the Globe, and particularly
                  of Coast Lines. By Professor J. P. O'Reilly.

     The forces which have acted from the interior of the glohe have been the
most important of those which have produced the present distribution of land and
water at its surface.

     Those forces are more essentially, contraction due to secular cooling, and gravi-
tation. Furthermore, the mineral constitution of the earth's crust has necessarily-
influenced the mode of action of those forces, and assuming that constitution to

be homogenous, and to be represented by the lavas modern and ancient, we might
expect that the contraction forms presented by those lavas when in great mass

would represent the forms to which secular contraction gives rise at the surface of
the earth, and that these would be limited by lines of direction presenting poly-
gonal forms somewhat as the contraction forms of the older lavas (basalts and
trachytes). Those lines of direction would represent the joints or fissures along
which the interior forces have exercised their greatest action, that is, those lines

which are represented on the globe by mountain chains. Now these influence

notably the forms of the continents as represented by the present distribution of land

and water. On the other hand, the boundaries of seas past and present have been
and are simply coast lines determined by the intersection of the sea surface with
the upraised strata, whose direction is essentially represented by that of the adjacent
mountain chains, and of the system of fissures or joints forming their axes. Thus

mountain chains and coast lines can be correlated.
     Having measured a series of blocks of basalt at the Giant's Causeway, I have

found that the dominating polygonal angle, or that one which most frequently
occurs, is the angle 110°, and its supplement 70°; moreover, that the form presented
by an isosceles triangle having 70° and 70° at the base, and 40° at the summit, is
markedly present in the basalt columns of Fair Head. This form I had pre-
viously recognised as continually occurring on maps, especially geological, and
have thereon based a system of correlation of lines of direction.

      Adopting as line of departure, the direction of the East Coast of Madagascar,
and taking this from Imray's most recent chart, I have found that the greater
number of lines of direction of coasts and mountain chains on the earth's surface
can be derived therefrom solely by the intervention of the angle 40° and its mul-
tiples, and 70°, and as proof have transferred from the globe those lines to maps,

both geographical and geological, and found such lines to be related with many
others on the map through the intermediary of those angles, and that this law is
general. Amongst the many maps which might be exhibited in proof thereof, I
would mention Haidinger's Geological Map of Austria, whereon occur marked lines
of direction which can be most distinctly reduced to this law, as also the maps of

the Geological Survey of Great Britain and Ireland.

3. Concerning the Extent of Geological Time. By Rev. M. H. Close, F.G.S.

      This paper was only intended to afford desired opportunity for viva voce discus-
sion on the above subject. Since geology has her own strong and unrefuted
arguments for the great extent of geological time, it is not logically necessary for
her to do more than to show, if it can be shown, that the physical arguments for
the very inconvenient restriction thereof rest upon still unproved assumptions.
The argument from the rate of cooling of the earth seems to have been satis-
factorily shown by Mr. T. Mellard Reade to be quite inconclusive. The argument
from the probable duration of the sun's radiation of heat assumes, inter alia, that
the original nebula from which the solar system was formed was cold, and -also
that the unit of gravitation, relatively to the mass of that system, has been constant
from the time when that mass began to fall together, and throughout the enormous
interstellar distance which has doubtless been traversed by it since that time. Dr.
 Croll's suggestion in answer to the former of these assumptions is logically suffi-

cient as a reply to the whole of this argument. Nevertheless, it may be added, as
to the latter assumption, that those physicists who have entered upon certain

speculations as to the cause of gravitation cannot deny that it is perfectly credible,
and even probable, that gravitation is not an essential accompaniment of matter,

and that the unit of gravitation may not be constant throughout all time and
space. The argument from the earth's figure in connection with the retardation of

 her rotation by the ocean tides depends upon the doctrine of the steel-rigidity of
the earth taken as a whole, as do also the calculations of various writers on
subjects which bear, in different ways, on the present one. However, Sir "W.
Thomson himself has greatly weakened the support of this doctrine. But geology
 (as regards the matter in hand) is not concerned to question it ; although it is, at
first sight, a difficulty. The results obtained by the Tide Committee of the Asso-
ciation point to the conclusion that there is an 18'6 year-tide in the body of the
earth depending upon the revolution of the moon's nodes, and that the rigidity of
the earth, even if it be, in one sense, as high as that of steel, is yet a viscous

rigidity, by which she may yield almost indefinitely to sufficient long-continued

straining forces. Other considerations confirm this latter position. This 18 - G
year-tide, whether resulting from such viscosity proper, or from plasticity of a
different kind, must cause a variation in the earth's rate of rotation having the

same period. This variation would probably be sensible if looked for by the
astronomers, who would confer a boon on the geologists by endeavouring to detect

it. Dr. John Evans's suggestion of the possibly considerable mobility of the axis
of rotation relatively to the body of the earth bears in certain ways on the
present question ; the mechanical objection to it, already greatly weakened by
Rev. 0. Fisher, might be quite removed by the investigation suggested.*

                         THURSDAY, AUGUST 15, 1S78.

         Professor Flowkk gave the following Address, entitled :

          A --Century's Progress in Zoological Knoivledge :

On the 10th of January, 1778, died the great Swedish naturalist, Charles Linne,

more commonly known as Linnseus, a name which will ever be mentioned with

respect and regard in an assembly devoted to the cultivation of the sciences of

Zoology and Botany, as whatever may be the future progress of those sciences, the

numerous writings of Linnaeus, and especially the publication of the Syetema
Xaturce, can never cease to be looked upon as marking an era in their development.
That work contained a systematic exposition of all that was known on these
subjects expressed in language the most terse and precise. The accumulated
knowledge of all the workers at Zoology, Botany, and Mineralogy since the world
began, was here collected together by patient industry, and welded into a complete
and harmonious whole by penetrating genius.

    Exactly a century has passed since Linnaeus died. What of the progress of

the subjects to which he devoted his long and laborious life ? This one century is

a brief space compared with the ages which have passed since man began to dwell

upon the earth, surrounded by living objects, which have, more and more as
time rolled on, awakened his curiosity, stimulated his facidties to observe, and im-

Howpelled him to record the knowledge so gained for the benefit of those to come.

does it stand in comparison which those which preceded it, in the contributions it
has thus acquired and recorded ?

     It may be not without interest in commencing our work at this meeting to

cast our eyes back and take stock, as it were, of the knowledge of a hundred years
ago, and of that of the present time, and see what advances have been made ; to
look at the living world as it was known to Linnaeus and as it is known to our-
selves. The Systema Natwce, the last edition of which, revised by the author, was
published in 1766, will be a convenient basis for the comparison ; but as the subject
is one which, even in a most superficial outline, might reach such lengths as would
well tire out the most patient of audiences, and absorb time which will be more
profitably occupied by the valuable contributions which are forthcoming from other
members of the Association, I will merely take a small section of the work, about

100 pages out of the first of the four volumes, those devoted to the first class Mam-

maxia. The comparison of this part is perhaps the easiest, as the contrast is the
least striking, and the progress has been comparatively the slowest. The knowledge
of large, accessible, and attractive-looking animals had naturally preceded that of
minute and obscure organisms, and hence, while in many other departments the
advance has altogether revolutionized the knowledge of Linnseus, in the Verte-
550 REPORT-- 1878.

brated Classes, especially the one of which I shall now speak, it has only extended!

and reformed it.
      In taking the Systema Natures of Linnaeus, the comparison is certainly carried

hack somewhat beyond the hundred years which have elapsed since his death, and
the brilliant contributions to the knowledge of the Mammalia of Buffon and
Daubenton just then beginning1 to be known, and the systematic compilation of

Erxleben (published in 1777), are ignored; but for the present purpose, especially

considering the limited time at my disposal, it will be best not to go beyond the

actual text of the work in question.
      Before considering systematically the different groups into which Linnaeus

divides the class, I must remark in passing upon what is the greatest, and indeed
most marvellous difference between the knowledge of Zoology of our time and that

of Linnaeus. Now we know that the animals at present existing upon the earth

are merely the survivors of an immensity of others, different in form, characters,

and mode of life, which have peopled the earth through vast ages of time, and
to which numerically our existing forms are but infinitesimally small, and that the
knowledge we possess of an immense number of them, fully justifies the expecta-
tion of an enormous further advance in this direction. In the time of Linnaeus
 the existence in any past time of a species having no longer living representatives on
 the earth, though perhaps the speculation of a few philosophical minds, had not
 been received among the certainties of science, and at all events found no place in
 the great work we are now considering.

     In the twelfth edition of the Systema Naturce we find the class Mammalia

 divided into seven orders: I. Primates, II. Bruta, III. Ferce, IV. Glires, V. Pecorar
 VI. Belluce, VII. Cete. These orders contain forty genera without any intermediate

 subdivisions. The genera are again divided into species, of which the total num-

 ber is 220.

      The first order, Primates, contains four genera: Homo, Simla, Lemur, and

  Vespertilio.

      The vexed question of man's place in the zoological system was thus settled by

 Linnaeus. He belongs to the class Mammalia, and the order Primates, the same

 order which includes all known monkeys, lemurs, and bats : he differs only ge-
 nerically from these animals. But then we must remember that the Linnaean genera
 were not our genera, they correspond usually to what we call families, sometimes,
 to entire orders. So that practically man's position is much the same as that to
 which, after several vicissitudes, as his separation as an order by Blumenbach and
 Cuvier, or as a subclass by Owen, he has returned in the systems of nearly all
 the zoologists of the present day who treat of him as a subject for classifica-
 tion upon zoological and not metaphysical grounds.

       Yet since the time of Linnaeus the whole science of Anthropology has been

 created. There is certainly an attempt at the division of the species Homo sapiens

  into six varieties in the Systema Natural, but it has scarcely any scientific basis.

 Zoological Anthropology may be said to have commenced with Blumenbach, who,

 it is interesting to recall as an evidence of the rapid growth of the science, was a
  contemporary with most of us in this room, for he died as lately as 1840, although

 his first work on the subject, ' De generis humani varietate nativa,' was published

  three years before the death of Linnaeus, too late, however, to influence the work

 we are now speaking of. The scientific study of the natural history of man is
 therefore, we may say, but one century old. To what it has grown during that

  time you are probably aware. Scarcely an important centre of civilisation in
  the world but has a special Society devoted to its cultivation. It forms by itself a

 --special department of the Biological Section of our Association a department of

  such importance, that on this occasion no less distinguished a person than a former
  most eminent President of the whole Association was thought fit to take charge of

  it. From him you will doubtless hear what is its present scope, aim, and compass.

  I need only remind you that except the one cardinal point of the zoological relation

  of man to other forms of life, which Linnaeus appears to have appreciated with in-
  tuitive perception, all else that you will now hear in that department was not

   dreamt of in his philosophy.

     A3 might naturally be supposed, apes and monkeys have, for various reasons,

attracted the attention of observers of nature from very early times, and conse-
quently Linnaeus was able to give rather a goodly list of species of these animals,
amounting to thirty-three ; but of their mutual affinities, and of the important

structural differences which exist between many of them, he seems to have had no
idea, his three divisions being simply regulated by the condition of the tail, whether

absent, short, or long.

   We now know that the so-called Anthropoid or man-like apes, the gorilla,

chimpanzee, orang, and gibbons, form a group apart from all the others of such im-
portance, that everything related to their history, structure, and habits has been most

assiduously studied, and there is now an immense literature devoted to this group
alone. Nothing could better illustrate the advances we have made in a hundred

years, than the contrast of our present knowledge of these forms with that of
Linnaeus. It is true that, as shown in the most interesting story of the gradual de-
velopment of our knowledge relating to them in the first chapter of Huxley's ' Man's

Place in Nature,' the animal now called gorilla was, without doubt, the pongo, well
known to, and clearly described by our countryman, Andrew Battle, a contemporary

of Shakespeare ; and that a really accurate and scientific account of the anatomy of
the chimpanzee had been published as far back as 1699 by Dr. Edward Tyson, who,

as the first English comparative anatomist, I am proud to claim as in some sort a

predecessor in the chair I have the honour to hold in London, as he is described on

the title-page of his work as " Reader of Anatomy at Chirurgeons' Hall."

     Linnaeus was, however, not acquainted with these, and his second species of
the genus Homo, H. troglodytes, and his first of the genus Simia, S. satyrus, were

both made up of vague and semi-fabulous a-counts of the animals now known as
chimpanzees and orange, but hopelessly confounded together. Of the gorilla, and
what is stranger still, of any of the large genus of gibbons, or long-armed apes of
South-eastern Asia, he had at the time he revised the Systema no idea.

    The remaining monkeys, we now know, fall into three very distinct sections
the Cei-copithecidce of the Old World, and the Cebidce and Hapalidce of the New,
or by whatever other names we may like to designate them. Although members

of all three groups appear in the list in the Systema, they are all confusedly mixed

together. Even that the American monkeys belong to a totally different stock

from those of the Old World, does not seem to have been suspected.

     The genus Lemur of Linnaeus comprehends five species, of which the first four
wpre all the then known forms of a most interesting section of the Mammalia.
These animals, mostly inhabitants of the great island of Madagascar, though some
are found in the African continent, and others in some of the Southern and Eastern
parts of Asia, constitute a well-defined group, but one of which the relations are
very uncertain. At one time, as in the system of Linnaeus, they were closely asso-
ciated with the monkeys. As more complete knowledge of their organization has
been gradually attained, the interval which separates them structurally from those
animals has become continually more evident, and since they cannot be placed

within the limits of any of the previously constituted orders, ithasbeeu considered
advisable by some naturalists to increase the ordinal divisions in their behalf and to
allow them to take rank as a distinct group, related to the Primates on the one hand,
and to the Carnivora and Insectivora on the other. The knowledge of their rela-
tions, however, bids fair to be greatly increased by the discoveries of fossil forms

lately made both in France and America, some of which seem to carry their

affinities even to the Unyidata.

     Existing upon the earth at present, besides the more ordinary Lemurs to which

the species known to Linnaeus belong, there are two aberrant forms, each represented
by a single species. These are the little Tarsius of Borneo and Celebes, and the

singular CMromys, or Aye-aye, which, though an inhabitant of the head-quarters of
the group, Madagascar, and living in the same forests and under the same con-

ditions as the most typical Lemurs, exhibits a most remarkable degree of speciali-

zation in the structure both of limbs and teeth, the latter being modified so as to
resemble, at least superficially, those of the Rodents, a group with which in fact it
was once placed. It was discovered by Sonnerat in Madagascar iu 1780, two
--552 eepoet 1878,

years after the death of Linnseus. The specimen brought to Paris by this traveller
was the only one known until 1860. Since that date, however, its native land
has been more freely open than before to explorers, and many specimens have been

obtained, one having lived for several years in the Gardens of the London Zoo-

logical Society.

The history of a name is often not a little curious. Linnaeus applied the term

Lemures, i.e. the departed spirits of men, to these animals on account of their

nocturnal habits and ghost-like aspect. The hypothetical continent in the Indian

Ocean, supposed to have connected Madagascar with the Malayan Archipelago is
called by Mr. Sclater, Lemuria, as the presumed original home of the Lemur-like

animals. Although the steps are not numerous, it might puzzle a classical scholar,

ignorant of Zoology, to explain the connection between this continent and the

Roman festival of the same name.

The fifth animal which Linnaeus places in his genus Lemur, under the name of

L. volans, is the very singular creature to which the generic terra Galeopit.heeus has

since been applied. It is one of those completely aberrant forms, which having no
near existing relations, and none yet discovered among extinct forms, are perfect

?uzzles to systematic zoologists. It is certainly not a lemur, and not a bat, as has

Weeen supposed by some.  shrink from multiplying the orders for the sake of

single genera containing only two closely allied species ; so we have generally
allowed it to take refuge among the Insectivora, though without being able to show

to which of that .somewhat heterogeneous group it has any near affinities.

     The fourth genus of the Primates is VespertUio, comprising six species of bats.
This genus has now by universal consent expanded into an order, and one of the

best characterized and distinctly circumscribed of any in the class : indeed, those

who have worked most at the details of the structure of bats find so much diversity

in the characters of the skull, teeth, digestive organs, &c, associated with the modi-

fication of the forelimbs for flight common to all, as almost to entitle them to be

regarded rather as a sub-class. Anatomical, as well as palreontological evidence,

show that they must have diverged from the ordinary mammalian type at a very

far distant date, as the earliest known forms, from the Eocene strata, are quite

as specialized as any now existing, and no trace has hitherto been discovered of
forms linking them to any of the non-volant orders. By the publication withiu

the last few weeks of a valuable monograph on the existing species of the group,

Aentitled " Catalogue of the Chiroptera in the Collection of the British Museum,"

by G. E. Dobson, we are enabled to contrast our present knowledge with that of

the time of Linnreus. Although the author has suppressed a large number of

nominal species which formerly encumbered our catalogues, and wisely abstained

from the tendency of most monographists to multiply genera, he describes four

hundred species, arranged in eighty genera : nearly double the number of species,
and exactly double the number of genera, of the whole class Mammalia in the

Systemo Natures, and these Dr. Giinther remarks in his Preface are probably only

a portion of those existing. The small size, nocturnal habits, and difficulty of

capture of these animals, are sufficient reasons for the supposition that there are

still large numbers unknown to science. In the list of Linnaeus, the first primary

group of Dobson, the Megackiroptera, now containing seventy species, is represented

by a single one, V. Vampyrus, obviously a Iterojms, to which the blood-thirsty

habits of the fabulous Vainpyre are attributed, but which is not absolutely identi-

fied with any one of the known species. The other species described by Linnaeus

can almost all be identified with bats at present well known.

   A curious example of the results of basing classification upon a few, and those

somewhat artificial characters, is afforded by one of the true bats, now called

Noctilio Iepo)-inus, though admitted by Linnaeus to be ' simillimus vespertilionibvs,

similiter pedibus alatus, being separated from the others, not only generically, but

even placed in another order, that of the Glires or Rodents, because it did not, or

was supposed not, to fall under the definition of the order Primates, which begins

' Denies primores inciso?-es superiores IV. paralteli.' In reality this bat has four
upper incisors, but the outer ones are so small as to have been overlooked when

first examined. But even, if this were not so, no one would now dream of basing
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.-- DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANT. 553

.an animal's position upon such a trivial character when opposed to the totality of

its organization and habits.

     The characters of the incisor teeth are placed in the first rank in the definitions
of all the orders in the Systema Natures, and hence the next order called Bruta,
characterized by 'dentes primores nulli superius aut inferim,' contains a curious

mixture of heterogeneous animals, as the names of the genera Elephas, Trichechus,

Bradypus, Myrmecophaga, Manis, and Dasypus will indicate. It contains, in fact,

all the animals then known comprised in the modern orders of Proboscidea,
Sirenia, and Edentata, together with the walrus, one of the Camivora. The name
Bruta has been revived for one of these orders, that more generally called Edentata,
but I think very inappropriately, for it was certainly not equivalent, and if re-

tained at all, should rather belong to the Pi-oboscidea, as Elephas stands first in

the list of genera, and was probably in the mind of Linnaeus when he assigned

the name to the group.
     It is curious to find that the striking differences between the African and the

Indian elephants, now so well understood by every beginner in Zoology, and all

the facts which have already been accumulated relating to the numerous extinct
forms of Proboscideans, whether Mammoths, Mastodons, or Dinotheria, were quite

unknown to Linnaeus. .One species only, Elephas ma.vimus, represented in the
zoology of a hundred years ago, was all that was known of the elephants or

elephant-like animals.

     The genus Trichechus of this edition exhibits a very curious phase of zoological

knowledge : It contains two species. 1. T. rosmarus, the Walrus, now known to
be a modified seal, and therefore a member of the Linnaean order Fer^, and 2. T.
manatus, a name under which were included all the known forms of Manatees and
Dugongs, in fact the whole of the modern order Sirenia ; animals widely removed

in all essential points of their organization from the walrus, with which they are

here generically united. Their position, however, between the elephant on the one

hand and the sloths on the other, is far better than their association with the
Cetacea, as in Cuvier's system, an association from which it has been most difficult

to disengage them, notwithstanding their total dissimilarity, except in a few ex-

ternal characters. Although the discovery of many fossil forms has done much

to link together the few existing species and to show the essential unity of the
group, it has thrown no light upon their origin, or their affinities to other mam-

mals. They still stand, both by their structure and their habits, a strangely

isolated group, and it baffles conjecture to say whence they have been derived, or

how they have attained their present singular organization.

     The remaining genera of the Linnaean order Brtjta constitute the group out of
·which Ouvier, following Blumenbach, formed his order Edentata, a name certainly

not happily chosen for a division which includes species like the great Armadillo,
having a larger number of teeth than any other land mammal, but which, neverthe-

less, has been so generally adopted, and is so well understood, that to attempt to
change it would only introduce an element of confusion. Four out of five of the
principal modifications of form in the group at present known, are indicated by the
four Linnaean genera, Bradypus or Sloth, Myrmecophaga or Anteater, Manis or

Pangolin, and Dasypus or Armadillo. The advances during the century have con-

sisted in the accumulation of a great mass of details respecting these groups ; the
addition of a fifth and very distinct existing form, the Orycteropus or Cape Ant-

eater                            and  the  discovery of  numerous  and very remarkable extinct forms, such  as
                              ;

the Megatheriums and Glyptodons of South America, so fully known by their

well-preserved osseous remains. There is, however, still much to be done in work-

ing out the real relationship of the somewhat isolated members of the order, if it

be a natural order, both to each other, and to the rest of the Mammalia, from which

they stand widely removed in many points of organization.
     The third order of Linnaeus, Fer^:, contained all the then known animals,

which, with whatever diversities of general structure, agreed in their predatory

habits, and possessed certain general characters of teeth and claws to correspond,
though the terse definition of " Dentes jn-imores superiores sex, acutiusadi, canini
talitarii" is by no means universally applicable to them. This order was broken
--554
eeport 1878.

up by Cuvier into the orders Carnivora and Insectivora, and the genus Didelphys, in-
cluded in it by Linnaeus, has been since by universal assent removed to another group.

     The first six genera belong to the very well-defined and probably natural group
now called Carnivora. The one placed at the head of the list, Phoca, is equivalent
to the large and important modern sub-order Pinnipedia, the walrus, however,
though essentially a seal, having been, as before mentioned, relegated by Linnaeus
to another order, on account of its aberrant dentition. But three species are recorded
in the genus : P. ursina, the sea-bear of the North Pacific (now Otaria wsina) }
P. leonina, founded on Anson's sea-lion, now commonly called the elephant seal,
or sea-elephant (Macrorhimts proboscideus, or more properly leoninus) ; and
P. vitulina, the common seal of our coasts.

     The terrestrial sub-order of Carnivora is represented by five genera : 1. Canis,
including the dog, wolf, hyaena, fox, arctic fox, jackal, &c. 2. Felis, with only six
species, but still one of the few Linnaean genera, which covers exactly the same
ground as at present in the opinion of the majority of zoologists, although it may
be mentioned as an example of the tendency towards excessive and unnecessary
multiplication of generic names which exists in some quarters, that it has been
divided into as many as fourteen. 3. Viverra, a heterogeneous group, containing

ichneumons, coatis, and skunks, animals belonging to three very distinct families,

according to modern ideas. 4. Mustela, a far more natural group, being nearly
equivalent to the modern family Mustelidce ; and, lastly, a very comprehensive genus

 TJrsus, consisting of U. meles, the badger, U. lotor, the racoon, U. luscus,

the wolverene, and all the true bears known, comprised in the single species

 U. arctos. Many interesting forms of Carnivora, as Cryptoprocta, Proteles, JEuplexes,

Ailums, and Ailwropus-, have no place in the Linnaean system, being comparatively
modern discoveries. The very recent date (1869) at which the last-named remark-

able animal was made known to science by the enterprising researches of the Abbe
David into the Fauna of Eastern Thibet, gives hope that we may not yet be at the

end of the discovery of even large and hitherto unsuspected forms of existing
mammals.

     Next in the Linnaean system comes the genus Didelphys, constituted for the
reception of five species of American opossums. This is a very interesting landmark

in the history of the progress of the knowledge of the animal life of the world, as
these five opossums, forming a genus in the midst of the order Fek^:, were all that

was then known of the great sub-class Marsupialia, now constituting a group
entirely apart from the ordinary members of the class. It is difficult now to

imagine an animal world without kangaroos, without wombats, without phalangers,

without thylacines, without dasyures, and so many other familiar forms, and yet
such was the animal world known to Linnaeus. It is true that a species of
kangaroo from one of the islands of the Austro-Malayan Archipelago was described
as long ago as 1714 by De Bruyn, who saw it alive at the house of the Dutch
governor of Batavia, and that Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks saw and killed

 kangaroos on the east coast of Australia in 1770, and had published figures and
descriptions of them in 1773, or five years before the death of Linnaeus, but .the

work we are now considering contains no traces of knowledge of the existence of
such a remarkable and now so well-known animal.

      The three remaining genera of Ferj5, Talpa, Sorex, and Erinaceus, contained
 all the known species of the present order Insecttvora, which now embraces many
 and very varied forms, quite unsuspected a century ago, and to which it is probable
 that others will be added by the time the exploration of the animal products of the

 world is completed.
      The fourth order, Glikes, has remained practically unchanged to our day,

 although the name Rodentia has generally superseded that bestowed upon it by

 Mm,Linnaeus. The five genera of the Systema Natures, Hystrix, Lepus, Castor,

 and Sciurus, have been vastly increased, partly by subdivision and partly by the

 discovery of new forms. Noctilio is, as before mentioned, removed to the Chiroptera,
 but its loss is well compensated for by Hydrochcerus, the well-known Capybara,
 the largest existing member of the group, which in the Linnaean system is placed
 among the Belluae, in the same genus with the pigs.
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 555

The fifth Linnaean order, Pecora, is a fairly natural group, equivalent to

Cuvier's  Ruminantia                                                  but it is no longer considered of  the value of  an  order,  since
                                                                   ;

the animals composing it have now been shown to be as closely related to certain

of those belonging to the next order as they are to each other. The first genus,

Camelus, contains both the American Lamas and the Old World camels, the

demonstration of the common origin and close affinities of which has been one of

the important results of the recent discoveries in the palaeontology of the Western

continent. In the next genus, Moschus, were placed the well-known musk deer of

the highlands of Central Asia, and two small African antelopes, which have no

special affinity with it. The subsequent inclusion in the same genus of the small

chevrotains (Tragulhue), which was very natural at the time, as they agree per-

fectly with the musk in the absence of horns and the presence of large canine tusks,
by which artificial characters the genus was defined by Linnaeus, was one of those
unfortunate associations which has greatly retarded the progress of knowledge of

the true affinities of the group. Judging by the popular works on Zoology, it is
still as difficult to apprehend that a chevrotain is not a musk deer, as it is that a

manatee is not a cetacean ; both errors of the same kind, if not quite so gross, as
that of regarding a whale as a fish, or a bat as a bird. The genus Cervus contains
six species of true deer, including the moose, reindeer, red deer, fallow and roe,

associated with the giraffe.
     The twenty-one species at that time recognized of the great group of

hollow-horned" Ruminants are distributed quite artificially in three genera,

Capra, Ovis, and Bos. Though subsequent investigations have greatly increased
the number of species known, we are still in much uncertainty about their mutual
affinities and generic distinctions. Being a group of comparatively modern origin,

and only just attaining its complete development, variation has chiefly affected the

less essential and superficial organs, and the process of extinction of intermediate

forms has not operated sufficiently long to break it up into distinctly separated

natural minor groups, as is the case with many of the older families, which yield,

therefore, far more readily to the needs of systematic classification, especially as
long as the extinct forms are unknown or ignored.

     The sixth order of land mammals, Belltj^e, corresponding to the Pachydermata

of Ouvier, contains what is now known to be a heterogeneous collection, viz. the
horses, the hippopotamus, the pigs, rhinoceros, and tbe rodent capybara. The

abolition of these two last orders and the entire re-arrangement of the ungulate
mammals, into two different natural groups, now called Artiodactyla and Perisso-

dactyla, first indicated by Ouvier in the ' Ossemens fossiles,' from the structure of

the limbs alone, and afterwards confirmed by Owen from comparison of every part
of the organization, has been one of the most solid advances made in our knowledge

of the relations of the Mammalia during the present century.
    The past history of this, as of so many other groups of vertebrated animals,

has been brought to light in an unexpected manner by the wonderful discoveries of
fossil remains made during the last ten years in the Rocky Mountains of America
discoveries, the importance of which will only be fully appreciated when the
elaborate and beautifully illustrated work which Professor Marsh has now in

progress, is completed.

     The last Linnaean order, Oete, is exactly conterminous with the order so named,.
or rather more generally modified to Cetacea, in the best modern systems, for

Linnaeus did not commit the error of Ouvier and others, of including the Sirenia
among the whales. His knowledge of the animals composing the group was neces-

sarily very imperfect, indeed it is only within the last few years, especially since the

impulse given to their study by Eschricht of Copenhagen, that the great difficulties

which surround the investigation of the structure and habits of these denizens of

the open sea have been so far surmounted that we have begun to obtain clear views

of their organization, affinities, and geographical distribution.

    Two most remarkable fonns of mammals, so abnormal in their organization as

now to be generally considered deserving the rank of a distinct sub-class, the Echidna
and Ornithorhynchw, were first made known to science in 1792 and 1799 respectively,

and consequently have no place in the Systema Naturce. The very recent discovery
556 report-- 1878.

of a third form to this group, or at least a very striking modification of one of the

forms, the large New Guinea echidna (Acanthoglossus Bruyriii), is the last im-

portant acquisition to our knowledge of the class.
      In this brief review of the progress of one small section of one branch of

zoological knowledge it will be seen that it is chiefly of systems of arrangement,

of classification, and of names that I have been treating. By many biologists of

the present day these are looked upon as the least attractive and least profitable

branches of the subject. The interest of classification, though it has lost much in
some senses by the modern advances of scientific biology, has, however, gained
vastly in others. The idea that has now, chiefly in consequence of the writings of

--Darwin, taken such strong hold upon all working naturalists the idea of a gradual

growth and progressive evolution, and therefore genetic connection between all living

--things breaks down the artificial barriers which zoologists raise around their

groups, and shows that such names as species, genera, families, orders, &c, are
merely more or less clumsy attempts to express various shades of differences among
creatures connected by infinite gradations, and in this sense destroys the importance
attached to them by our predecessors. On the other hand, it immensely increases
the interest contained in the word " relationship," as it implies that the word is used
in a real and not, as formerly, in a metaphorical sense. There is a kind of classifi-
cation, such as we might apply to inanimate substances or manufactured articles.

We may say, for instance, that a tumbler, a wine-glass, and a tea-cup are more

closely related to each other than either one is to a chair or a table, and that they
might be formed into one group, and the last-named objects be placed in a second.
This kind of classification is certainly useful in its way, for methodical arrangement
and descriptive purposes. It is the kind of arrangement which Linnaeus and his

contemporaries applied to animals. It is, however, a very different classification

from that which supposes that the members of a group having common essential
characters are descended from a common ancestor, and have gradually, by whatever
cause or means, become differentiated from other groups. On this view a true

classification, if it could be obtained, would be a revelation of the whole secret of
the evolution of animal life, and it is no wonder that many are willing to devote

so large a share of their energies to endeavour to attain it.
     The right application of the principles of nomenclature, first clearly established

by Linnaeus, to the groups we form is, again, by no means to be despised, as laxity
and carelessness in this respect are becoming more and more the greatest hindrances
 to the study of Zoology. The introduction of any new term, especially a generic

 name, and indeed the use of an old one by any person whose authority carries
weight, has an appreciable effect upon the progress of science, and should never be
 done without a full sense of the responsibility incurred. All beginners are puzzled
 and often repelled by the confused state of zoological nomenclature to an extent to

which those who have advanced so far as only to care for the things, and to whom

 the actual names by which they are called are comparatively indifferent, have little
 idea. Those whose special gift or inclination leads them to the pursuit of other
~brancb.es of Biology, as Morphology, Physiology, Embryology, &c, must have
 definite names for the objects they observe, depict, or describe, and are de-
 pendent upon the researches of the systematic zoologist for supplying them, and
 should not neglect to take his counsel, otherwise much of their work will lose its

 value.

       Several times has the British Association thought this a worthy subject for the
 consideration of its members, and through the instrumentality of a committee of
 working naturalists drew up in 1842 an excellent code of regulations and sugges-
 tions on the subject of zoological nomenclature. These rules were revised and
 reprinted in 1865 : and in accordance with a resolution adopted at the last annual
 meeting at Plymouth they have been again republished at the cost of the Asso-
 ciation during the present year. The mere issue of such rules must have had a
 beneficial effect, as they have undoubtedly been a guide to many careful and
 conscientious workers. Unfortunately there are no means of enforcing them upon
  those of a different class, and there is still something wanting, short of enforcing

 them, which possibly may be within the power of the Association to effect. In
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 1). DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANT. 557

the administration of the judicial affairs of a nation, besides the makers of the laws,

we have an equally essential body to interpret or apply the law to particular cases
the judges. However carefully compiled or excellent a code of regulations may

be, dubious and difficult cases will arise, to which the application of the law is
not always clear, and about which individual opinions will differ. The necessary

permission given in the Association rules to change names which are either

' glaringly false,' or ' not clearly defined,' opens the door to considerable latitude of

private interpretation. As what we are aiming at is simply convenience and

general accord, and not absolute justice or truth, there are also cases in which the

rigid law of priority, even if it can be ascertained, requires qualification, and other

cases in which it may be advisable to put up with a small error or inconvenience to
avoid falling into a larger one. I may name such cases as the propriety of reviving
an obsolete or almost unknown name for one which, if not strictly legitimate, has
been universally accepted, or the retention of a name when already applied to a.

different genus, instead of the institution of another in its place. For instance,

should the name Echidna, by which the well-known Monotremous Mammal is
known in every text-book and catalogue in every language, be susperseded by

Tac.hyglossus, because the former name had previously been applied to a genus of

snakes? or should the chimpanzee be no longer called Troglodytes lest it should
be confounded with a wren? Should Chiromys be discarded for Dauhentonia,

Trichechus for Odobenus, and Tapirus for Hydroc/icerus? Should the Java slow

lemur be called Loris, Stenops, or Nycticebus ? Should Sowerby's whale be placed,

in the genus Physeter, Delphinus, Delphinorhynchus, Heterodon, Diodon, Aodon,

Nodus, Ziphius, Micropterus, Micropteron, Mesodiodon, Dioplodon, or Mesoplodon,

in all of which it may be found in various systematic lists ? Should one of the
largest and best known of the Cetaceans of our seas be called Bcdcenoptera mus-

culus, Physalus antiquorum, or Pt.erobalcena communis, all names used for it by

authors of high authority? Should the smallest British seal be called Phoca

hispnda, fwtida, or anellata ?

     I might go on indefinitely multiplying instances which will be answered
differently by different naturalists, the arguments for one or the other name being

often nicely balanced. What is wanted, therefore, is some kind of judicial authority

for deciding which should in future be used. If a committee of eminent naturalists,

selected from various nations, and divided into several sections, according to the

subjects with which each member is most familiar, could be prevailed upon to take

up the task of revising the whole of our existing nomenclature upon the basis of

the laws issued by the Association in 1842, occasionally tempering their strictly

legal decisions with a little discretion and common sense, and with a view, as
much as possible, of avoiding confusion, and promoting general convenience ; and

if the working zoologists of the world generally would agree to accept the decisions

of such a committee as final, we should dispose of many of the difficulties with
which we are now troubled. There seems to me no more reason why the nomen-
clature of such a committee, if it were composed of men in whose judgment their

fellow- workers would have confidence, should not be as universally accepted as is

We'the nomenclature of the last edition of the Systema Natures of Linnaeus.  have

agreed not to look beyond that work for evidence of priority, and why should we

not agree in the same way to accept decisions which would probably be arrived at

with even fuller knowledge and greater sense of responsibility ?

    Whether this suggestion will be received with favour or not, it appeared to me

that it was one not inappropriate for the consideration of this Section which has
already dealt with the question in a manner so advantageous to science, and also
for this year which has witnessed the hundredth anniversary of the death of the

great teacher of systematic zoology.

Our knowledge of the living inhabitants of the earth has indeed changed since

that time. Our views of their relations to the universe, to each other, and to our-

selves, have undergone great revolutions. The knowledge of Linnaeus far sur-
passed that of any of his contemporaries ; but yet of what we now know he knew
but an infinitesimal amount. Much that he thought he knew we now deem false.

Nevertheless, some of the oldest words to be found in all his writings contain,
558 eeport-- 1878.

sentiments which still claim a response in the hearts of many. Although we are

less accustomed to see such words in works of science, that is no proof that

their significance has heen impaired by the marvellous progress of knowledge.

With the words which Linnaeus selected to place at the head of his great work I

will conclude

               O' Jehova,
               Quam ampla sunt tua opera !

    Dr. Rae read a long paper on the above subject, chiefly with the object of supple-
menting the writings of Sir John Richardson, whose descriptions are in some

instances incomplete, in consequence of that admirable zoologist not having been

able to visit certain localities in the Hudson's Bay Company's territory, and having
had to depend upon the reports of others, who sometimes were not very conver-
sant with the subject.

                             By Sir Walter Elliot, F.R.S.

     The species above named, more commonly known as the short-tailed field-mouse,

has been observed of late to be annually increasing. In the early part of 1876, it
 appeared in such numbers in the hill pasture farms of the border districts between
England and Scotland, and in the western parts of Yorkshire, as to cause serious
damage to the grazing ground on which the sheep mainly depend for maintenance
in spring, thereby inflicting serious loss on farmers by the impoverishment and death
 of stock. Notwithstanding the efforts of the shepherds and their dogs, assisted by

--an unusual influx of birds and beasts of prey hawks, buzzards, owls, weasels, foxes,
--&c. their numbers were not sensibly diminished ; but on the approach of summer

 they began to perish with hunger after exhausting their own means of subsistence,

 and the few survivors were driven by starvation to their usual haunts. Their
 favourite abodes are low-lying humid meadows and damp plantations, in which they
 construct superficial burrows, breeding five or six times in the year, and producing
 six to eight young at a birth. Autumnal rains and severe winter frosts generally
 kill great numbers, and it is to an absence of these checks, during a series of mild
 seasons from 1872-76, that their late abnormal increase is attributed.

      It is remarkable that during the same period a kindred foreign species, the
 Arvicola arvalis, Pallas, was creating similar damage to the corn-fields of Austria
 and Hungary, and only the other day a paragraph in the Times stated that they are

 now destroying the wheat crop in Moldavia.
      Several instances are recorded of mischief done by the common vole to young

 plantations, notably those described by Jesse in the royal forests of Hampshire and
 Glouces tersh ire

      These facts show that although they have hitherto confined their attacks (as
 far as known) in our own country to woods and pastures, they may, under con-
 ditions favourable to their increase, attack our cereal produce. It would be well,
 therefore, for game preservers to consider whether they are not promoting such a
 contingency by the persistent destruction, under the name of vermin, of the natural

 enemies of the vole, and for farmers to reflect whether they may not carry too far

 the extirpation of the mole, of which voles are a favourite prey.

     One object in offering these observations to the section was to ascertain whether
anything similar had been observed in Ireland, where it is believed the vole is not
common, for it is observed that it, as well as its British congeners, A. amphibia
and A. glareolus, are omitted from Mr. Barrington's list of mammals given at page
91 of part ii., in the Guide to Dublin prepared for this meeting of the Associa-

tion.*

The following Papers were read :

2. On the "Willemoesia Group of Crustacea. By C. Spence Bate, F.B.S.

Among the many ohjects of interest taken from the depths of the ocean during the

cruise of the Challenger, there were few that attracted more attention than the so-

called blind Crustacea.

     These were described by Mr. Willemoes-Suhm rather fully both in ' Nature

--and in the 'Transactions of the Linnean Society,' in the pages of the former under

the name of  Deidamia                                         but  in  the                                                                                                                      latter  Mr. Grote,  having  discovered  that this

name had been in use for a genus of Sphingidse, changed it to Willemoesia, in com-

pliment to the unfortunate marine zoologist of the expedition.

Soon after it had been published it was recognized by those who had given at-

tention to the subject to resemble a small crustacean that Dr. Heller had described
among the " Crustaceen des siidlichen Europa," from a single male specimen in the

collection of the museum at Vienna, to which he gave the name of Polycheles
typhlops, belonging to the same group. I believe that I am correct in stating that
Mr. Wood-Mason was the first, in the ' Journal of the Asiatic Society ' for 1875, to

point out the resemblance between the Polycheles of Heller and Willemoesia of the

Challenger expedition.

Each of these zoologists has described the animal as being blind ; and it is sup-

posed that on this character Heller founded the specific name of his species, the eyes

of which, he says, are rudimentary                                                                                                                                                              and  Willemoes-Suhm  says   that  " the eyes are
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

entirely wanting, nor is there any place left open where you might expect to find

them."

     Both these observant naturalists have passed over the peculiar character of the
organ of vision that belongs to this group of animals. Heller has classified it with

the family Astacidae in a division by itself; and they have both asserted that it
closely corresponds with the fossil genus Eryon.

     Dr. Camil Heller, moreover, says that it bears a strong resemblance in the form
of the body to the ' Scyllaridae,' from which it differs essentially by the structure of

the antennae, the form of the chelae, and the narrow sternum. With the Astacidae
it has in common the possession of the leaf-like appendage at the base of the second

antennae and the chelate character of the pereiopoda ; in all other respects it differs
from Astacus.

    AVillemoes-Suhm says : " Among the living Decapoda Macrura there is hardly

a group with which Willemoesia could be said to be very closely allied. Nearest
to it are undoubtedly the " Scyllarinae ; "' but these, like all the genera of the 1'amily

Palinuridre, differ from it in the absence of the lamellar appendage of the second

antennae, and in the presence of palpi at the base of the gnathopoda, which, as we
have seen, are wanting in this new genus. Nor can it, for this latter reason, be re-
ferred to the Astacidae, with which it has in common the presence of the antennal

scale."

    "The genus," says Heller, corresponds greatly with the fossil crustacean de-

scribed by Deshayes from the slate-quarries of Solenhofen {Eryon Cuvieri), since

1878.                                                                                                                                                                                                o
662 report-- 1878.

also in this are found a flattened carapace and similarly formed antennae and
pereipoda. The hinder part of the body is much narrower than the anterior ; and

the leaf-like appendage of the second pair of antennas is much enlarged. It forms

a link between the Scyllaridae on the one hand, and the Astacidae on the other."

     " It is very astonishing, indeed," says Willemoes-Suhm, "that, among all the
crustaceans known to us, Willemoesia approaches most closely the fossil Eryontidae.
If we compare, for example, our figure of W. crucifera with the figure of Eryon
aretiformis, and the description of the ' Tribu des Eryons' given by Milne-Edwards

(and probably taken especially from Desmarest's ' Crustaces Fossiles') we find most
striking resemblances between the two forms. In W. crucifera as well as in Eryon

the carapace has nearly half the length of the whole body ; and in both forms its
lateral borders are wing-like expansions which are divided by two deep incisions
into three portions. The anterior border of the carapace is nearly straight in both

forms.

    " Eryon was probably not                               blind                     for  the eye-stalks have been  found  in  several

specimens. Its antennae seem to be somewhat more reduced then in Willemoesia
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

but the second pair of them has, according to Desmarest, ' une ecaille a3sez large,

ovoide et fortement echancree.' This is the chief difference between Eryon and the

Palinuridae, and the same in which Willemoesia also differs from that group."

    So much do the fossil and recent animals resemble each other that the dis-

coverer of the recent species says, ' If the last pair of pereiopoda and the pleon of

Eryon were presented to me I should undoubtedly declare them to be parts of the

genus Willemoesia. There are the same line of spines at the top of the rings, the
same wing-like expansions on both sides, and that characteristic ' caudal apparatus.'

Also the fine fringe of hairs which distinguishes the caudal fin of Willemoesia is to
be seen in the fossil crustacean "

    " Eryon," continues the same author, " differs from the living genus chiefly by

the presence of eye-stalks and of palpi at the base of the gnathopoda. According
to Quenstedt, the latter were observed only with difficulty ; and their presence

seems not to be beyond all doubt." And the lamented carciuologist of the expe-
dition looked forward to his return, when he would look over the original

specimens and satisfy himself, so as to enable him to give a more detailed account

of the relations of Willemoesia to Eryon. That they must be very close he had
no doubt, and considered that among the Eryontidae this new genus must take its
place, between the Astacidae and Palinuridse.

    It will be desirable that we should examine the animals and see how far the
conclusions arrived at by two independent observers can be supported by extended

inquiry.

     Heller describes Polyc/ieles as having a thin dermal structure, rudimentary eyes,
antennae like those of Willemoesia, and four pairs of pereiopoda chelate, and one

(the fifth pair) simple.

    Willemoes-Suhm describes Willemoesia as having the eyes and eye-stalks entirely

wanting ; four or five pairs of pereiopoda chelate in distinct species.

    In all other respects the descriptions of the two authors agree.

    The Challenger collection contains specimens of this group from thirteen

different  places                                and  in   every one I was                able, upon close examination, to find the

eyes very distinct, though singularly situated. Moreover, there is a variation in

form and position that gives them a value in classification, particularly when taken

into consideration with the relative forms of the several pairs of pereiopoda.

    The dorsal surface of the several species of this group is flattened and de-

pressed, and the anterior margin is tolerably straight ; the central tooth, which is

sometimes single and sometimes double, is never directed forwards in the form of

a_ rostrum, but upwards and obliquely forwards. In the anterior margin on each

side there is a deep cleft in the dorsal surface, in which the eye with its peduncle

is  lodged                                  the  anterior  extremity, being               directed  forwards,  outwards, and   down-

wards, is covered over by the lateral projecting wings of the carapace. It appears

to have two points of vision, the one upwards by the dorsal surface, the other

downwards and outwards by the lens at the extremity of the peduncle. But

thesg several points are liable to vary in degree. In some the dorsal notch is

almost non-existent, in others it is very deep ; and it is by this variation, taken in

connection with the power of change in the form of the pereiopoda, that I purpose

classifying the several species of this interesting group.

      In this genus I accept the author's definition, that it has the anterior four pairs

of pereiopoda chelate and the fifth simple. But instead of saying that the eyes
are rudimentary, I assert that they are immovably lodged in a notch in the dorsal
surface of the carapace, with the anterior extremity projecting heneath the antero-

lateral wings of the carapace.

     The eyes of the several genera, although they may differ from each other in
structural detail, yet correspond throughout the group in a common characteristic.
The peduncle is reduced to a minimum and fixed as a rigid part of the dermal

structure, over which a portion of the carapace is projected.

     If we turn to the animal while it is yet embryonic (and our only opportunity

is its observation before it has quitted the egg), although in an advanced condition,

we see that previously to the eruption from the ovum it attains at least the zoea

stage of development, and that the eyes are large and distinctly pedunculated, just

in the same way as the zoea of Alpheus in the embryonic condition ha eyes con-

siderably larger and more like the permanent organ in other genera than the adull
parent from which it springs.

     The alteration from the original type to a depauperised condition is therefore
due to causes acting through the habits of the animal after it has pas <>d through

its zoea stage. This is precisely the way that Alpheus has passed; and as the

                                                                                  2

result has been somewhat similar, it is highly probable that the conditions have
been parallel.

     Alpheus in the young stage is a free-swimming animal with powerful organs of

vision ; but in its adult condition it burrows in the mud of the sea-bottom, where

the eyes are of little use, except to see things in close proximity, and where they are
liable to injury from rough accidents, unless they be protected, as they are, by the

strength of the overlying carapace.

     The history of Willemoesia and its allies I believe to be very parallel with that
of Alpheus. In its young stage it has well-developed eyes, which it loses when it
has arrived at its adult condition. This I believe to be attributable to a similar

cause, viz. that it burrows iu the soft mud of the deep-sea bottom.

     This is borne out by an examination of the contents of the stomach, which I
found to be full of the remains of the structures found in the Globige?-ina-ooze.

      That the depauperised state of the organs of vision is not due to the loss of
light from the great depth at which Willemoesia is taken is evident from the fact
that Thalascaris, n.g. (Oranognidse) is taken at depths equally great, and is
remarkable for the large size of its eyes.

       Willemoesia, moreover, is not necessarily one of our deepest sea inhabitants.

 Willemoesia leptoclactyla was taken both in the Atlantic and Pacific at a depth
of 1900 and 1375, while Polycheles Hclleri and Pentacheles obscurus were taken

north of New Guinea at a depth of 1070 yet most of the other species, even in-
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

cluding Polycheles Heleri, were takeu at depths between 610 and 120 fathoms.

   --The bottom temperature has only been recorded iu seven of the stations at

which the species were taken that is, only from the deeper soundings ; these,

however, vary from G° to 1°"8 O. I am therefore inclined to think that temperature

can only be second to that of the character of the sea-bottom itself.
      Out of the thirteen stations from which specimens of this group have been

recorded, the bottom consists of what has been named Globigerina-ooze in eight,
one is recorded of mud, and two 'r.c' (which, I suppose means red clay), and one
only on hard ground; but as this occurs only once, and that with an animal
(Poh/cheles Ifelleri) that is also recorded from another station where Globigerina-
ooze' exists, I think that we may safely infer that the whole group are inhabitants
of a soft bottom, preferring that in which animal life suitable for their existence
abounds, and that their general structure and form are in accord with their habitat.

   4. On the Association of an Inconspicuous Corolla with Proterogynous
Dichogamy in Insect-fertilised Flowers. By Alex. S. Wilson, M.A., B.Sc.

      It is a well-ascertained fact that the great majority of conspicuously coloured
flowers are proterandrous, that is, the anthers are matured before the stigmas of the
same flower. Plants where this arrangement for the prevention of self-fertilisation
obtains have also for the most part their flowers growing close to each other,

forming a more or less compact inflorescence, as in Erica, Calluna, Vaccinium, Digi-
talis, Linaria, Gladiolus, &c. The flowers are also in many cases all turned to one

side of the floral axis, the inflorescence being termed secund. By these means the

plants as a whole are rendered more conspicuous. In the indefinite or basifugal
mode of flowering which is the commonest form, the flowers come out in succession
from below upwards ; hence on any given spike the older flowers will be lower
down than the younger ones, and it follows with proterandrous dichogamy the
lower flowers will at a given time be in the second or female stage, while those
towards the upper extremity of the stalk will have only attained to the first or
male condition. The lower flowers will in fact have shed all their pollen, and have
their stigmas ready to be fertilised by the time the anthers of the upper flowers are

beginning to shed pollen. On the other hand, in a plant with proterogynous

dichogamy, it is clear that, if we still keep to the indefinite mode of flowering, the

lower or older flowers on any given plant will he in the second or male stage hy

the time the younger upper ones have reached the first or female stage, seeing that

in this case the stigma is developed before the anthers of each flower. Scrophidaria

nodosa affords a good example of a plant having proterogynous dichogamy, and to

it the present paper chiefly refers. In this plant the stigma, after fertilisation, is

removed out of the pathway to the nectar by the bending back of the style on the

outside of the corolla ; thereafter the stamens straighten out to occupy the place

formerly held by the stigma, and begin to shed their pollen in this position. The

corolla of this flower, as usual in proterogynous plants, is small and obscurely coloured.

There is also a lax inflorescence, the flowers not being crowded together on one side

as in proterandrous and highly coloured flowers, but scattered all round, so that as

a whole the plant is not easily discerned from a distance, nor does it readily strike

the eye as a conspicuous object. That it is truly dependent on insects and not on

the wind for the transference of its pollen, is proved by the presence of a well-

developed nectariferous gland, and by its emitting odour. Its inflorescence so far

agrees with the indefinite form that as a whole the older flowers (in this case male)

occur lower down than the younger (female) ones. Among such inconspicuously

flowered plants proterogynous dichogamy seems to prevail, just as the proterandrous

is characteristic of highly coloured flowers. Hitherto it has not been shown in

what way an entomophilous or insect-fertilised plant could possibly profit by a

small uncoloured corolla, nor has any reason been given why this apparent dis-

advantage shoidd be generally associated with proterogynous dichogamy. The

procedure of a wasp visiting Scrophidaria nodosa afforded the solution of this pro-

blem. The manner in which it proceeded was quite exceptional. The first flower

on the stem which it visited was the top one ; from this it passed to the others in

a somewhat irregular manner going downwards, and finally left the plant from the

lowest flower. The same thing having been observed repeatedly, a key to the whole

question was furnished                                                                                          for any one who has watched bees collecting  honey from
                                                                                                             ;

flowers must have observed that the bee goes to the bottom flowers first, and then

visits those next above on the same stalk in regular succession from below upwards.

Now, that this order of visitation is of importance in reference to the cross-fertili-

sation of a plant, will be obvious if we bear in mind a fact which the experiments

of Mr. Darwin (' Cross and Self-fertilisation,' p. 299) have clearly demonstrated, viz.,
that " a cross between the flowers on the same plant does not at all increase the

number of seeds, or only occasionally, and to a slight degree." Now, were an insect

invariably to visit first those flowers on a plant which are shedding their pollen,
and then to pass to those with mature stigmas, clearly the usual result of this would

be that it simply removed pollen from the anthers of the flowers in the male stage,

and deposited it on the stigmas of those flowers on the same plant which happened

to be in the female stage. The effect of this would be little or no better than self-

fertilisation. This is well illustrated in the case of Gladiolus. In this strikingly

beautiful plant we have well-marked protandry in association with a highly con-

spicuous perianth, while the development of the flowers is from below up, so that

the older lower flowers have shed their pollen by the time that of the upper ones

are ready. The anthers are at first bent forwards and downwards, so that they rub

their polien on the back of a bee entering the flower ; meanwhile the immature

stigma is above and behind them, quite out of the way of an insect going into the
flower. When the pollen is shed, however, the stamens straighten up out of the

way, while the stigma lobes expand and bend downwards and forwards, so that they

stand in the fairway to the nectar ready to scrape off pollen from any insect as it

passes down the tube formed by the perianth. In this case a bee entering one of

the lower and older flowers has any pollen that it brings with it from another plant

removed from its back by the pendant stigmas of these flowers, and when it ascends

to the younger male flowers towards the top of the spike receives a plentiful supply

of pollen previous to leaving for another plant. This pollenit will not fail to deposit

on the stigmas of the female flowers which it first enters. From this it appears,

then, that the whole elaborate arrangements of Gladiolus to ensure cross-fertilisa-

tion would be frustrated, were the insects frequenting it to begin at the top flowers

and proceed downwards, instead of visiting them in the reverse order from below
--566

up as they habitually do, for pollen would then simply be taken from the younger

upper flowers, and deposited on the stigmas of those lower down the stalk. In

like manner, a similar effect woidd result in the case of proterogynous plants, were

these visited exclusively by bees or iusects adhering to the ascending habit of the

bee, for pollen would in that case be transferred from the lower older male flowers to

the upper female ones, the insect leaving with little or no pollen to carry to another

spike. Thus the chances of cross-fertilisation would be minimised, and the ends

served by the flower's dichogamy, nectar, and odour would be missed. For these

reasons it seems highly probable that proterogynous plants like Scrophularia nodosa

are adapted to the visits of insects which do not possess the ascending habit of the

bee, but visit flowers when in search of honey in an irregular manner, or in an

order exactly the opposite of that observed by the bee, as in the case of wasps

visiting Scrophularia before referred to. The lax inflorescence, too, favours an

irregular order of visitation, for as the flowers are placed at a distance apart, it is

Wealmost impossible for an insect to visit them in perfectly regular order.  see,

then, that in both cases things are so arranged that an insect on coming to a plant

shall tirst enter a female flower, and there deposit the pollen it brings from other

plants, and that before it leaves, whether a bee leaving from the top, or a wasp from

the lower flowers, it is well dusted with pollen from the male flowers it last enters.

According to H. Miiller, the flowers of Scrophularia are chiefly frequented by wasps

and S. aquatica Mr. Darwin states to be fertilised exclusively by wasps. It seems

only fair to infer that such flowers are in some way specialised to suit the nature

Weand habits of these insects.  have thus got so far with our explanation as to

see how plants having proterogynous dichogamy do not have their apparatus for

cross-fertilisation rendered ineffectual, as would undoubtedly be the case were the
ascending mode of visiting flowers rigidly followed and universal among all species

of insects. It still remains to trace the connection of this with obscurity in the
flowers, which appear to shun observation almost as distinctly as proterandrous

flowers court it. Within certain limits it is an advantage as regards cross-fertilisa-

tion that a plant's visitors shoidd be confined to a few or even to one species of
insect, for an insect visiting all flowers indiscriminately woidd be likely to have

deposited all the pollen taken from a particidar species of flower on the stigmas

of other and different species where it would be of no use, before comma- to

another plant of the same species as the first. This is probably the reason

why the great majority of flowers are visited only by a very limited number

of species of insects. Sir John Lubbock gives a list of plants with one species

opposite each as its sole visitant ; whether this be really so or not, unmistakablv

there is a tendency in this direction. If, then, we find a plant whose flowers secrete

nectar, and ascertain that it is visited almost exclusively by certain species of

iusects, and if the flowers do not possess a large coloured corolla, we are a,t libertv

to conclude that these insects are able to find such plants without its guidance, and
that the materials consumed in its production can be otherwise turned to better
account in the economy of the plant, just as in the case of self-fertile cleistogamic

flowers. Assuming, then, that inconspicuous flowers are adapted to the visits of
wasps, is there anything in the habits of these insects different from those of bees
that would afford an explanation of the remarkable fact that they appear to be
able to discover a small uncoloured flower as easily as a bee can a large and con-

spicuous one ? Wasps differ from bees in one important respect, that while the

latter are exclusively vegetable feeders, the former add to their vegetable diet by prey-
ing on insects smaller than themselves. All through the animal kingdom carnivorous
animals are endowed with keener powers of scent and vision than graminivorous

creatures. Indeed, it is a direct result of natural selection that a creature whose

food is perpetually eluding it should in time acquire acuter perceptive powers than
one whose food is more easily obtained. That keenness of vision, then, which
enables a wasp to descry its prey at a distance, aided by an acute sense of odour, in

all probability also enables it to discover these obscure flowers without the guidance

afforded by a large coloured corolla. This obscurity, therefore, specially adapts

these flowers for fertilisation by wasps to the exclusion of insects less highly en-
dowed in these respects ; while the wasp gains this advantage, that it has an
increased chance of finding honey in such flowers on account of the likelihood of
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY. 567

their being overlooked by other honey collecting insects. For this reason wasps,
as Mr. Darwin observes, do not frequent coloured flowers to the same extent that

bees do, as they probably meet so often with disappointments in the way of flowers
that have been emptied of their nectar previously. Hence it appears that the bee is

more highly specialised as a collector of honey than the wasp.

    5. On the Nectar of Flowers. By Alex. S. Wilson, M.A., B.Sc.

     Some observations on this subject made by the author during the past summer

revealed several highly interesting points connected with the labours of an insect
collecting honey. These are attended with more difficulties than mighty at first

--sight be supposed, for it appears that nectar is only produced during certain states

of the atmosphere dry warm weather being most favourable. The industry of the

bee is probably indispensable to its existence, as a small quantity of honey represents

a very large number of flowers visited. In the case of the common red clover, 125
heads were found by analysis to give one gramme of sugar. Now, as each head con-

tains about sixty florets, even in this plant, which is comparatively rich in nectar,
7,500,000 distinct flower-tubes must be sucked for each kilogram of sugar collected.
This corresponds to about two and a half millions of visits for a pound of honey.

In most of our common flowers the amount of nectar is much smaller, usually
dilute and iu many cases absent ; moreover, in some instances it appears to be formed
only when the essential organs are mature. If in addition the class of sham

nectar producers, which is perhaps larger than has been supposed, and previously
emptied flowers, as well as those whose nectaries are inaccessible, he taken into
account, it will be seen that a great number of fruitless visits must be made by
these insects. Bees, however, do not visit any flower at random, but appear to
know which flowers are secreting and which are not, on any particvdar day. Thus,
the flowers of Vacnnium Myrtillus were thronged with bees while those of Ule.v
Europceus were unvisited, on a day when the former were secreting copiously and the
latter were quite dry. The extreme solubility and diffusibility of sugar render it

--necessaiy that the nectar should be well protected from rain, and various arrange-

ments for this purpose are found in flowers such as the mouth of the flower hang-
ing downwards, cushions of hairs, papillse, spurs, &c. In the flower of the prim-
rose, if the limb of the corolla be covered with water, it will be found that none
can penetrate down the corolla-tube to the nectar, on account of the peculiar
character of the surface of the petals causing a capillary repulsion. Were there no
such means of protection the sugar would speedily be diffused to parts of the flower
where it would be accessible to insects without their being of any service in the
way of cross-fertilisation. In the fuchsia, which is rich in nectar, it is to be
observed that no nectar is formed before the flower opens, and the amount is
greatest at the time when the anthers are ready to dehisce. This in all likelihood
happens in other cases where it is more difficult, on account of the smallness of the
flowers, to ascertain the conditions. In this flower it is remarkable that three-

fourths of the saccharine matter is in the condition of cane or uninverted sugar.
Possibly this, taken in connection with the fact that nectaries are not un-

frequently aborted or degenerated organs, such as a petal or stamen, may throw
some lightjon the question in dispute among physiologists, as to whether nectar

should be regarded as a true secretion or simply as an excretion of effete matters
from the vegetable cells. It has further a physiological interest, as throwing light
on the share which the bee has in elaborating honey, since this substance contains
no cane sugar, although on account of the acid reaction of the nectar the process of
inversion possibly goes on spontaneously. The extensive character of the operations
that would appear, from the foregoing considerations, to be performed by insects
which collect honey, enables us to form some conception of the importance of this
factor, and will help us to judge of the adequacy or efficiency of this cause, which
biologists believe to have exercised in past time an important influence iu modify-
ing the size, form, and colour of flowers, as well as in determining the character. of

certain organs of the insects by which such flowers are frequented.

 6. Notes on some Dimorphic Plants. By Alex. S. Wilson, M.A., B.Sc.

     This paper had reference to Erythrma centaurium and Silene acaulis. The
author pointed out that the former plant was probably dimorphic, as it exhibited
heterostyly and had two kinds of pollen grains, in these respects closely resembling
the primrose and bog-bean, as well as several others belonging to the order Gen-
tianacece, of which it is a member. Silene acaulis was shown to have three kinds of
flowers, male, female, and hermaphrodite, thus resembling S. inflata, which Axel
has shown to be trioeciously polygamous.

7. Some Mechanical Arrangements subserving Cross-fertilisation of Plants
                  by Insects. By Alex. S. Wilson, M.A., B.Sc.

     The plants considered were Pinguicula vulgaris, Vinca minor, and the fox-glove.
In Vinca the curiously shaped stigma resembles the stopper of a glass bottle. The
circumference of its lower disc secretes a viscid substance which serves to smear the

pollen so as to cause it to adhere to insects, thus resembling physiologically the

sticky disc of the common orchid. The filaments of the stamens present a curious
geniculate bend close to their insertion on the corolla, which acts as a lever when

depressed, lowering the anther with its pollen into contact with the viscid matter
on the lower part of the stigma. Somewhat similarly a peculiar bend on the fila-
ments of the two stamens of Pinguicula, when pressed, causes the anthers to descend
so as to impinge on an insect entering the flower, this latch-like mechanism dislodging
the pollen from behind the under lip of the semi-petaloid stigma. The remarkable
twists and curvings of the filaments of the fox-glove appear to act in a manner
exactly analogous, for an insect pressing on their upturned edges as it passes over
the floor of the flower must cause a shower of pollen to fall on its back from the
overhanging anthers, on account of the disturbance produced by this lever-like
mechanism.

8. On the Stipules of Spergularia Marina. By Alexander Dickson, M.B.,

              Regius Professor of Botany in the University of Glasgow.

The stipules of this plant exhibit a peculiarity, which, if observed at all by de-

scriptive botanists, has not received the attention it deserves on account of its re-

markable character. The stipules are free from the petioles, and are wholly

cellular in structure. From connation of those of opposite leaves they form " in-

terpetiolar stipules," with more or less regularly, though slightly, bifid extremities.

Lastly (and this is the important point), these stipules are united to each other

round the backs of the petioles, so that a sheath is formed completely surrounding

the axis and the two leaf-bases. This connation of stipules round the backs of the

petioles is very interesting, as being a rare phenomenon. Cases are not uncommon

where the two stipules are connate on the inner side of the leaf-base, constituting

the so-called " axillary stipule," e.g., Potamogeton lucens, &c, or on the opposite

side of the axis from the leaf, e.g., Ficus elastica, Ricinus, Astragalus alpinus, &c,

constituting  the so-called " oppositifoliar  stipule  ;   but  the  only reference to conna-

                                                        "

tion of stipules behind or outside the leaf-base the author has been able to find, is to

the case of certain species of Astragalus by St. Hilaire in his ' Morphologic' In

those species of Astragalus examined by the author he did not meet with any

where the stipules are actually connate in this way ; but in some, e.g., A. alopecuroides,

--the bases of the stipules extend round the back of the leaf-stalk till they meet

condition just short of connation. In the stipules of S])ergularia, as we have seen,

there is the interesting combination of the interpetiolar connation, with connation

round the back of the leaf. In " English Botany " the condition is fairly enough

represented by the artist, but the morphological peculiarity does not hitherto seem

to have impressed itself upon the botanical mind.

 9. On the Inflorescence of Senebiera didyma. By Alexander Dickson, M.D.,

                Begins Professor of Botany in the University of Glasgow.

      The inflorescence here, like that of the mass of Cruciferous plants, is racemose.
 The racemes are " oppositifoliar," and at first sight the arrangement seems to he

 analogous to that of the oppositifoliar inflorescences of Vitis or of Alchemilla

 arvensis, where the inflorescence is really terminal, hut is thrown to the side hy a
 preponderant development of a " usurping shoot," the axillary hud of the last leaf
 produced hy the primary axis before ending in the inflorescence ; and it is to be
 noted that, of all the foliage leaves, that opposite the raceme is the only one ap-
 parently destitute of an axillary bud, which on the supposition would be represented
 by the " usurping shoot." If, however, the plant is more closely examined, a very

--remarkable condition is disclosed one, indeed, which offers a morphological pro-

 blem of considerable difficulty, and which probably can be effectually solved only by
 developmental study. The peculiarity consists in the constant occurrence of a
 solitary flower springing somewhere from the internode below the raceme, either
 about half-way down towards, or almost close to, the level of the leaf below. So
 far as observed, the solitary flower is never quite so low as the level of the lower
 leaf. Probably the first idea which would occur to one would be that this is a
 peculiar case of adhesion of parts ; it might be supposed that from almost imme-
 diately above the second last leaf of the main axis, the bases of the terminal raceme,
 of the " usurping shoot," and of the axillantleaf of that shoot, had all become fused
 together. Now, although cases are known, on the one hand, of adhesion between
 the base of a terminal flower and that of the " usurping shoot" {e.g., Helianthemum
 vulgare), and on the other hand between the base of auaxillant leaf and that of the
usurping shoot in its axil (e.g., Sedum sp.), we do not know of connation of all three
 together. It is possible, but not probable. The view which seems to the author

most fully to satisfy the conditions of this remarkable case may be stated briefly

 in categorical form as follows:--
      1st. The racemose inflorescence is terminal, and properly begins just above the

 level of the " second-last " leaf. It would thus include the aforesaid solitary flower.
      2nd. The raceme, after producing one ebracteate flower, produces at its second

node a foliage-leaf, from whose axil the "usurping shoot" springs.

     By such an explanation we can dispense with any cumbrous adhesion-hypothesis

such as that indicated above. The peculiarity is that the main axis does not per
solium pass from the condition of a leafy axis to that of an axis of inflorescence,
but begins by producing one flower and then developing a foliage-leaf, beyond which
the series of flowers is uninterrupted. The " usurping shoot," as above indicated,
represents the axillary bud of the foliage-leaf by which the raceme is interrupted.

10. On the Six-celled Glands of Oephalotus, and their similarity to the Glands
     of Sarracenia purpurea. By Alexander Dickson, M.D., Begins Pro.

     fessor of Botany in the University of Glasgow.

     The author pointed out that the peculiar six-celled glands found on the outer
surface of the pitcher, both surfaces of the pitcher-lid, and both surfaces of the
foliage-leaf of Cephalotus, are very nearly identical iu structure with the glands on
both inner and outer surfaces of the pitcher of Sarracenia purpurea, which were
originally described by August Vogl. The author suggested that the remarkable
resemblance in this respect, taken in connection with certain correspondences in the
details of the insect-trapping apparatus, might indicate an affinity not hitherto sus-

pected.

     Dr. Dickson exhibited specimens referable to this species -which he had lately

found growing on muddy bottom, among Potamogeton, in about two feet of water
in Loch Oalkter, Aberdeenshire. The plants were remarkable for the very slender
and tapering character of the leaves, which curve outwardly. The macrospores

are very markedly echinate, and in diameter about one-fourth smaller than those of

Isoetes lacustris.

    12. Some rare Scottish Alpine Plants. By Dr. J. Batlet Balfour.

     Specimens of some peculiar form of Scottish Alpine plants were exhibited
 chiefly willows, sedges, and hawkweeds.

     Of the willows, the most interesting was Sadler's willow (Sctli.v Sadleri, Syme).
This plant was discovered in 1874 by Mr. Sadler, on the rocks at the head of Loch
Kander, Aberdeenshire. Since that date it has never been collected. In August
of the present year Mr. Sadler, revisiting Loch Kander, found it in fair abundance,

the specimens exhibited being of his gathering.

   -- --Of the other plants that were worthy of notice was Carex frigida, All. This

sedge a novelty in the British flora was found by Mr. Sadler, in 1874, near the
spot where he discovered Salix Sadlerii, Syme. Since then it has not been gathered,
until this year Mr. Sadler again obtained some good specimens at the original
locality. The chief interest in this plant centres in its being a rare instance of a

non-Scandinavian plant inhabiting the Scottish Alps.

5. The Mammoth in Siberia. By Henry H. Howorth, F.S.A.

The existence of the carcases of mammoths and rhinoceroses in Siberia, with their

flesh and other soft parts intact, presents a problem which has not been hitherto

satisfactorily solved. There are two theories current as to the means by which

they came there.  One is that they were floated down the great Siberian rivers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           _

from more tropical countries, and the other that they lived where their remains are

now found. The former has now few adherents save perhaps Middendorf. The

nature of the rivers ; the fact that it would be impossible for such masses of flesh to

float down them for hundreds of miles without being broken to pieces ; the fact that

they are found standing upright, that we have specimens of the remains of their

food and the outward woolly covering of their bodies, are a few of the facts

which conclusively show that they were not floated clown the rivers. The remain-

ing alternative which is now almost universally held, that they lived where their

remains are found, necessitates another postulate, however. It is quite clear that

neither elephant nor rhinoceros could live under the conditions which now prevail

on the tundras bordering the Arctic Ocean ; the terrible climate, the absence of trees

and the universal covering of snow for a large part of the year makes it clear, d,

priori, that there must have been a change of climate in Siberia since they lived,

and this is largely supported by the existence of traces of woods, and remains of a

more southern vegetation, far to the north of the present limit of trees ; and it seems

clear that a temperate climate prevailed all over Siberia when the mammoths lived

there. But there is another difficulty, which, so far as the author knew, has not

hitherto been noticed. The fact of the flesh of these animals having been preserved

intact, proves that they must have been frozen immediately after death, and re-

Lmained frozen ever since. If the ground had thawed even during one summer,
      they would have decayed and been dissipated. Again, as they were buried iu earth
and mud, it is clear  that when  so  buried  the ground  must have been  soft.                     It is
                                                                                                _

impossible to conceive of large masses of flesh being pushed underground if the

earth was frozen fast, as it is over all Northern Siberia, from two feet below the

surface. It follows, therefore, that the change of climate was sudden, was in fact

in the nature of a catastrophe ; and this is supported by the fact of the mammoths

and their associated companions being found in such hecatombs, while, as is familiar
to travellers, the remains of modern elephants which have died in the forests are
seldom found. This accounts also largely for the flesh of the huge beasts not
having been torn and eaten by their carnivorous contemporaries. This conclusion

seems at issue with much modern geological speculation, which rather shrinks from

postulating catastrophes, but it nevertheless appears to be inevitable.

I would venture to say, to use a term of philosophy, that it looks very much better

from an objective than from a subjective point of view. But I found that my re-
solution, like a great many good resolutions that I have made in the course of my

life, came to very little, and that it was thought desirable that I should address you

in some way. But I must beg of you to understand that this is no formal address.

I have simply announced it as a few introductory remarks, and I must ask you to

forgive whatever of crudity and imperfection there may be in the mode of expres-

sion of what I have to say, although naturally I shall do my best to take care that

there is neither crudity nor inaccuracy in the substance of it. It has occurred to me

that I might address myself to a point in connection with the business of this de-

partment which forces itself more or less upon the attention of everybody, and

which, unless the bellicose instincts of human nature are less marked on this side of

St. George's Channel than on the other, may possibly have something to do with

the large audiences we are always accustomed to see in the Anthropological De-

partment. In the Geological Section I have no doubt it will be pointed out to you,

or, at any rate, such knowledge may crop up incidentally, that there are on the

earth's surface what are called loci of disturbance, where, for long ages, cataclysms

and outbursts of lava and the like take place. Then everything subsides into quie-

tude ; but a similar disturbance is set up elsewhere. In Antrim, at the middle of the

Wetertiary epoch, there was such a great centre of physical disturbance.  all know

that at the present time the earth's crust, at any rate, is quiet in Antrim, while the

great centres of local disturbance are in Sicily, in Southern Italy, in the Andes, and
Myelsewhere.
              experience of the British Association does not extend quite over a

geological epoch, but it does go back rather longer than I care to think about; and
when I first knew the British Association, the locus of disturbance in it was the

Geological Section. All sorts of terrible things about the antiquity of the earth,
·574  --report 1878.

and I know not what else, were being said there, which gave rise to terrible appre-
hensions. The whole world, it was thought, was coming to an end, just as I have
no doubt that, if there were any human inhabitants of Antrim in the middle of the
tertiary epoch, when those great lava streams burst out, they would not have had
the smallest question that the whole universe was going to pieces. Well, the
universe has not gone to pieces. Antrim is, geologically speaking, a very quiet
place now, as well cultivated a place as one need see, and yielding abundance of ex-
cellent produce ; and so, if we turn to the Geological Section, nothing can be milder

than the proceedings of that admirable body. All the difficulties that they seemed
to have encountered at first have died away, and statements that were the horrible

paradoxes of that generation are now the commonplaces of schoolboys. At present
the locus of disturbance is to be found in the Biological Section, and more par-

ticularly in the anthropological department of that Section. History repeats it-
self, and precisely the same apprehensions which were expressed by the aborigines

of the Geological Section, in long far back time, are at present expressed by those

who attend our deliberations. The world is coming to an end, the basis of morality
is being shaken, and I don't know what is not to happen if certain conclusions which

-- --appear probable are to be verified. Well, now, whoever may be here thirty years

hence I certainly shall not be but, depend upon it, whoever may be speaking at the

meeting of this department of the British Association thirty years hence will find,
exactly as the members of the Geological Section have found, on looking back thirty

years, that the very paradoxes and horrible conclusions, things that are now thought

to be going to shake the foundations of the world, will by that time have become
parts of every-day knowledge and will be taught in our schools as accepted truth,

and nobody will be one whit the worse.
     The considerations which I think it desirable to put before you, in order to show

the foundations of this conviction at which I have very confidently arrived, are i if
two kinds. The first is a reason based entirely upon philosophical considerations,

--namely, this that the region of pure physical science, and the region of those ques-

tions which specially interest ordinary humanity, are apart, and that the conclusions

reached in the one have no direct effect in the other. If you acquaint yourself with
the history of philosophy, and with the endless variations of human opinion therein
recorded, you will find that there is not a single one of those speculative difficulties
which at the present time torment many minds as being the direct product of
scientific thought, which is not as old as the times of Greek philosophy, and which
did not then exist as strongly and as clearly as such difficulties exist now, though
they arose out of arguments based upon merely philosophical ideas. Whoever ad-

-- --mits these two things as everybody who looks about him must do whoever takes
--into account the existence of evil in this world and the law of causation has before

him all the difficulties that can be raised by any form of scientific speculation. And
these two difficulties have been occupying the minds of men ever since man bewail
to think. The other consideration I have to put before you is that, whatever may
be the results at which physical science as applied to man shall arrive, those results

 are inevitable--I mean that they arise out of the necessary progress of scientific
thought as applied to man. You all, I hope, had the opportunity of hearing the
 excellent address which was given by our President yesterday, in which he traced

 out the marvellous progress of our knowledge of the higher animals which has been
 effected since the time of Linnseus. It is no exaggeration to say that at this

 present time the merest tyro knows a thousand times as much on the subject as is

contained in the work of Linnaeus, which was then the standard authority. Now

 how has that been brought about ? If you consider what zoology, or the study of

 animals, signifies, you will see that it means an endeavour to ascertain all that can
 be studied, all the answers that can be given respecting any animal under four
 possible points of view. The first of these embraces considerations of structure.

 An animal has a certain structure and a certain mode of development, which means

 that it passes through a series of stages to that structure. In the second place, every
 animal exhibits a great number of active powers, the knowledge of which constitutes

 its physiology ; and under those active powers we have, as physiologists, not only to

 include such matters as have been referred to by Dr. M'Donnell in his observations,*but

 to take into account other kinds of activity. I see it announced that the Zoological
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.  OYO

Section of to-day is to have a highly interesting paper hy Sir John Lubbock on the
habits of ants. Ants have a polity, and exhibit a certain amount of intelligence, and

all these matters are proper subjects for the study of the zoologist as far as he deals

with the ant. There is yet a third point of view in which you may regard every animal.

It has a distribution. Not only is it to be found somewhere on the earth's surface, but

--palaeontology tells us, if we go back in time, that the great majority of animals have

had a past history that they occurred in epochs of the world's history far removed

from the present. And when we have acquired all that knowledge which we may

enumerate under the heads of anatomy, physiology, and distribution, there remains

still the problem of problems to the zoologist, which is the study of the causes of

those phenomena, in order that we may know how they came about. All these

different forms of knowledge and inquiry are legitimate subjects for science, there

being no subject which is an illegitimate subject for scientific inquiry, except such
as involves a contradiction in terms, or is itself absurd. Indeed, I don't know that

I ought to go quite so far as this at present, for undoubtedly there are many be-
nighted persons who have been in the habit of calling by no less hard names con-
ceptions which the President of this Meeting tells us must be regarded with much re-
spect. If we have four dimensions of space we may have forty dimensions, and that
would be a long way beyond that which is conceivable by ordinary powers of imagina-
tion. I should, therefore, not like to draw too closely the limits as to what may be
contradiction to the best-established principles. Now, let us turn to a proposition

--which no one can possibly deny namely, that there is a distinct sense in which man is

an animal. There is not the smallest doubt of that proposition. If anybody entertains

a misgiving on that point he has simply to walk through the museum close by, in
order to see that man has a structure and a framework which may be compared,

point for point and bone for bone, with those of the lower animals. There is not the

smallest doubt moreover that, as to the manner of his becoming, man is developed,
step by step, in exactly the same way as they are. There is not the smallest doubt

-- --that his activities not only his mere bodily functions, but his other functions are

just as much the subjects of scientific study as are those of ants or bees. What we
call the phenomena of intelligence, for example (as to what else there may be in

--them, the anthropologist makes no assertion) are phenomena following a definite

casual order just as capable of scientific examination, and of being reduced to defi-

nite law, as are all those phenomena which we call physical. Just as ants form a

polity and a social state, and just as these are the proper and legitimate study of the

zoologist, so far as he deals with ants ; so do men organise themselves into a social
state. And though the province of politics is of course outside that of anthropology,
yet the consideration of man, so far as his instincts lead him to construct a social
economy, is a legitimate and proper part of anthropology, precisely in the same way

as the study of the social state of ants is a legitimate object of zoology. So with re-

gard to other and more subtle phenomena. It has often been disputed whether in

animals there is any trace of the religious sentiment. That is a legitimate subject

of dispute and of inquiry ; and if it were possible for my friend Sir John Lubbock to

point out to you that ants manifest such sentiments he would have made a very
great and interesting discovery, and no one could doubt that the ascertainment of

such a fact was completely within the province of zoology. Anthropology has

--nothing to do with the truth or falsehood of religion it holds itself absolutely and
--entirely aloof from such questions but the natural history of religion, and the origin

and the growth of the religions entertained by the different kinds of the human race,
are within its proper and legitimate province. I now go a step farther, and pass to

 the distribution of man. Here, of course, the anthropologist is in his special region.

He endeavours to ascertain how various modifications of the human stock are
arranged upon the earth's surface. He looks back to the past, and inquires how far
the remains of man can be traced. It is just as legitimate to ascertain how far the
human race goes back in time as it is to ascertain how far the horse goes back in

time ; the kind of evidence that is good in the one case is good in the other; and the

conclusions that are forced on us in the one case are forced on us in the other also.

Finally, we come to the question of the causes of all these phenomena, which, if

permissible in the case of other animals, is permissible in the animal man. What-

ever evidence, whatever chain of reasoning justifies us in concluding that the horse,
576 eeport-- 1878.

for example, has come into existence in a certain fashion in time, the same evidence

and the same canons of logic justify us to precisely the same extent in drawing the

same kind of conclusions with regard to man. And it is the business of the anthro-

pologist to be as severe in his criticism of those matters in respect to the origin of

man as it is the business of the palaeontologist to be strict in regard to the origin of

the horse ; but for the scientific man there is neither more nor less reason for dealing

critically with the one case than with the other. Whatever evidence is satisfactory

in one case is satisfactoiy in the other ; and if any one should travel outside the lines

of scientific evidence, and endeavour either to support or oppose conclusions which

are based upon distinctly scientific grounds, by considerations which are not in

--any way based upon scientific logic or scientific truth whether that mode of ad-

vocacy was in favour of a given position, or whether it was against it, I, occupying

the chair of the Section, should, most undoubtedly, feel myself called upon to call

him to order, and to tell him that he was introducing topics with which we had no

concern whatever.

I have occupied    your attention  for a  considerable  time yet there is            still one
                                                                                  ;

other point respecting which I should like to say a few words, because some very

striking reflections arise out of it. The British Association met in Dublin twenty-

one years ago, and I have taken the pains to look up what was done in regard to

oiu' subject at that period. At that time there was no Anthropological Department.

That study had not yet differentiated itself from zoology, or anatomy, or physiology,

so as to claim for itself a distinct place. Moreover, without reverting needlessly

to the remarks which I placed before you some time ago, it was a very volcanic

subject, and people rather liked to leave it alone. It was not imtil a long time

subsequently that the present organisation of this section of the Association was

brought about ; but it is a curious fact, that although truly anthropological subjects

--were at the time brought before the Geographical Section with the proper subject
--of -which they had nothiug whatever to do I find, that even then, more than half

of the papers that were brought before that section were, more or less distinctly, of

Wean anthropological cast. It is very curious to observe what that cast was.

-- --had systems of language we had descriptions of savage races we had the great

question, as it then was thought, of the unity or multiplicity of the human species.

These were just touched upon, but there was not an allusion in the whole of the
proceedings of the Association, at that time, to those questions which are now to be

regarded as the burning questions of anthropology. The whole tendency in the

present direction was given by the publication of a single book, and that not a very

--large one namely, ' The Origin of Species.' It was only subsequent to the pub-

lication of the ideas contained in that book that one of the most powerful instru-

--ments for the advance of anthropological knowledge namely, the Anthropological
--Society of Paris was founded. Afterwards the Anthropological Institute of this

country and the great Anthropological Society of Berlin came into existence, until

it may be said that, at the present time, there is not a branch of science which is

represented by a larger or more active body of workers than the science of anthro-

pology. But the whole of these workers are engaged, more or less intentionally,

in providing the data for attacking the ultimate great problem, whether the ideas

which Darwin has put forward in regard to the animal world are capable of being

applied in the same sense and to the same extent to man.

That question, I need not say, is not answered. It is a vast and difficult

question, and one for which a complete answer may possibly be looked for in the
next century ; but the method of inquiry is understood; and the mode in which
the materials bearing on that inquiry are now being accumulated, the processes by

which results are now obtained, and the observation of new phenomena lead to

the belief that the problem also, some day or other, will be solved. In what sense

I cannot tell you. 1 have my own notion about it, but the question for the future

is the attainment, by scientific processes and methods, of the solution of that

question. If you ask me what has been done within the last twenty-one years

 towards this object, or rather towards clearing the ground in the direction of

 obtaining a solution, I don't know that I could lay my hand upon much of a very

-- --· definite character except as to methods of investigation save in regard to one

 point. I have some reason to know that about the year 18G0, at any rate, there
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.-- DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.              577

was nothing more volcanic, more shocking, more subversive of everything right and

proper, than to put forward the proposition that as far as physical organisation is

concerned there is less difference between man and the highest apes than there

is between the highest apes and the lowest. My memory carries me back

sufficiently to remind me that, in 1860, that question was not a pleasant one

to handle. The other day I was reading a recently-published valuable and in-
teresting work, 'L'Espece Humaine,' by a very eminent man, M. de Quatre-

fages. He is a gentleman who has made these questions his special study, and
has written a great deal and very well about them. He has always maintained

a temperate and fair position, and has been the opponent of evolutionary ideas, so

that I turned with some interest to his work as giving me a record of what I

could look on as the progress of opinion during the last twenty years. If he has

myany bias at all, it is one in the opposite direction to that in which  own studies

would lead me. I cannot quote his words, for I have not the book with me, but

the substance of them is that the proposition which I have just put before you is

one the truth of which no rational person acqiiainted with the facts could dispute.

Such is the difference which twenty years has made in that respect, and speaking in
the presence of a great number of anatomists, who are quite able to decide a

question of this kind, I believe that the opinion of M. de Quatrefages on the sub-

ject is one they will all be prepared to endorse. Well, it is a comfort to have got

that much out of the way. The second direction in which I think great progress

has been made is with respect to the processes of anthropometry, in other words,

in the modes of obtaining those data which are necessary for anthropologists to

reason upon. Like all other persons who have to deal with physical science, we

confine ourselves to matters which can be ascertained with precision, and nothing

is more remarkable than the exactness which has been introduced into the mode of

ascertaining the physical qualities of man within the last twenty-five years. One
cannot mention the name of Broca without the greatest gratitude ; and I am quite
sure that, when Professor Flower brings forward his paper on cranial measurements

on Monday next, you will be surprised to see what precision of method and what

accuracy are now introduced, compared with what existed twenty-five years ago,

into these methods of determining the facts of man's structure. If, further, we

turn to those physiological matters bearing on anthropology which have been the

subject of inquiry within the last score of years, we find that there has been a vast

amount of progress. I would refer you to the very remarkable collection of the

data of sociology by Mr. Herbert Spencer, which contains a mass of information

useful on one side or the other, in getting towards the truth. Then I would refer

you to the highly interesting contributions which have been made by Professor

Max Miiller and by Mr. Tylor to the natural history of religions, which is one of

the most interesting chapters of anthropology. In regard to another very impor-

tant topic, the development of art and the use of tools and weapons, most remark-

able contributions have been made by General Lane Fox, whose museum at Bethnal

Green is one of the most extraordinary exemplifications that I know of the inge-

nuity, and, at the same time, of the stupidity of the human race. Their ingenuity

appears in their invention of a given pattern or form of weapon, and their profound

stupidity in this, that having done so, they kept in the old grooves, and were thus

prevented from getting beyond the primitive type of these objects and of their orna-

mentation. One of the most singular things in that museum is the exemplification

of the wonderful tendency of the human mind when once it has got into a groove

to stick there. The great object of scientific investigation is to run counter to that

tendency.

Great progress has been made in the last twenty years in the direction of the

Mydiscovery of the indications of man in a fossil state.  memory goes back to

the time when anybody who broached the notion of the existence of fossil man

would have been simply laughed at. It was held to be a canon of palaeontology

that man could not exist in a fossil state. I don't know why, but it was so ; and

that fixed idea acted so strongly on men's minds that they shut their eyes to the

plainest possible evidence. Within the last twenty years we have an astonishing

accumulation of evidence of the existence of man in ages antecedent to those of
which we have any historical record. What the actual date of those times was,

1878.      pP
--578 report 1878.

and what their relation is to our known historical epochs, I don't think anybody
is in a position to say. But it is beyond all question that man, and not only man,
but what is more to the purpose, intelligent man, existed at times when the whole
physical conformation of the country was totally different from that which
characterises it now. Whether the evidence we now possess justifies us in going
back further or not, that we can get back as far as the epoch of the drift is, I
think, beyond any rational doubt ; that may be regarded as something settled.
But when it comes to a question as to the evidence of tracing back man further

-- --than that and recollect the drift is only the scum of the earth's surface I must

confess that, to my mind, the evidence is of a very dubious character.

   --Finally, we come to the very interesting question as to whether, with such

evidence of the existence of man in those times as we have before us, it is possible

to trace in that brief history any evidence of the gradual modification from a

human type somewhat different from that which now exists to that which is met
with at present. I must confess that uiy opinion remains exactly what it was
some eighteen years ago, when I published a little book which I was very sorry to

hear my friend, Professor Flower, allude to yesterday, because I had hoped that it

would have been forgotten amongst the greater scandals of subsequent times. I
did there put forward the opinion that what is known as the Neanderthal skull

--is, of human remains, that which presents the most marked and definite charac-

teristics of a lower type using the language iD the same sense as we would use

it in other branches of zoology. I believe it to belong to the lowest form of

human being of which we have any knowledge, and we know from the remains
accompanying that human being, that as far as all fundamental points of structure

-- --were concerned, he was as much a man could wear boots just as easily as any

of us, so that I think the question remains pretty much where it was. I don't
know that there is any reason for doubting that the men who existed at that day
were in all essential respects similar to the men who exist now. But I must point

out to you that this conviction is by no means inconsistent with the doctrine of
evolution. The horse, which existed at that time, was in all essential respects

identical with the horse which exists now. But we happen to know that going

back further in time the horse presents us with a series of modifications by which
it can be traced back from an earlier type. Therefore it must be deemed possible

that man is in the same position, although the facts we have before us with respect
to him tell in neither one way nor the other. I have now nothing more to do than

to thank you for the great kindness and attention with which you have listened to

these informal remarks.

       The following Papers were read :

1. Notes on the Prehistoric Monuments of Cornwall as compared vrith those

                     in Ireland. By Miss A. W. Buckland.

     The prehistoric monuments of Cornwall, believed by archaeologists to be the
work of the same race as those of Ireland, present, in the midst of strong resemblance,
certain points of difference, which deserve the attention not only of archaeologists

--but of ethnologists. In both countries they consist of tumuli, including chambered

barrows and giants' graves monoliths or menhirs, circles, cromlechs or dolmens,
and holed-stones, all probably sepulchral j and hut-circles, cliff-castles, curious caves

and crosses, whilst in Ireland we find in addition earthworks called raths and
round towers. Long barrows, which are looked upon as the most ancient of burial
places, belonging to the stone age, are wanting in both countries, hence we may
infer that the people who erected them in England and Scotland never inhabited

 Cornwall and Ireland, where the earliest barrows seem to belong to the Bronze age,
the mode of interment in Cornwall being chiefly by cremation; but these tumuli may
not represent the earliest tombs in these countries. Sir William Wilde believes
that the earliest premetallic Irish were the erectors of gigantic cromlechs covered
with earth, whilst the menhirs in both countries are very ancient memorials of
the dead, although not always covering a grave, the " Pipers " in Cornwall being of
the latter class. Some of these menhirs were afterwards converted to Christian

uses, whilst some in Ireland bear Ogham inscriptions. The circles in Cornwall are
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANTHROPOLOGY.  579

·small as compared to those of Stonehenge and Avebury. Nine exist in the extreme

West of Cornwall, but no avenues are traceable in connection with them, the same

fact having been observed of some of the Irish examples ; the Cornish consist generally
of nineteen stones. The cromlechs of Cornwall are of the free-standing order, but
seem to follow no special rule as to the number of stones composing them. The
chambered tumuli and giants' graves do not equal in size the great pyramids of

Dowth and New Grange, although of the same general construction. The holed

 stones of Cornwall, which vary greatly in form and size, have their counterparts in

 Ireland, Scotland, and France, but the men-an-tol seems unique ; their use is unknown,
but in Cornwall and in Ireland they have a reputation as healing agents. From the
· difference in shape and size they could hardly have served as doors to dolmens, like

the Indian examples, but probably were associated with the God of Healing. Of
non-sepulchral monuments the beehive huts form an important part. Several groups

exist in Cornwall, apparently identical with the Irish cloughans in Kerry and Arran.
The Cornish cliff-castles and Irish raths are both ascribed to the -Danes, but they

 differ essentially in construction, the Irish rath consisting of earthwork only, whilst

 the Cornish cliff-castles are three or four circles of unceruented stones heaped

together to form walls. The crosses of Cornwall, with few exceptions, seem older and
 ruder than those of Ireland, and bear no inscriptions in Ogham, although there are
 on some hieroglyphic markings, but it is noteworthy that the Irish round towers do
 not appear in Cornwall, although traditions of Irish saints are numerous there. All
 these monuments are generally ascribed to the Celts, but this is probably an error,
 since maps showing the distribution of these remains prove that in most countries
 they follow certain lines, indicating the migrations of different tribes or races. The
 great cromlechs of Ireland are found chiefly on the coast, and similar groupings occur
 in almost every country, so that a map of the world wherein these are clearly marked

would be a great boon to ethnologists. Two distinct types of skull, the one do-

 licocephalic, the other brachycepkalic; are found associated with the Irish remains,
 and although both are assumed to be Celtic, the term seems inapplicable to both.
 The constructors of similar monuments in India belong to the dark-skinned pre-
 Aryan stock. Attention to the distribution, position with regard to the cardinal
 points, and the number of stones forming these monuments, is of considerable im-
 portance, and also their constant occurrence in bog or waste land. Their position

 appears to the author to have some connection with the point from which their

 builders first emigrated, and the rude hieroglyphs on some, to denote the tribal
 marks or totems of deceased chiefs.

 2. Flint Factories at Portstewart and elsewhere in the North of Ireland.

                                    By W. J. Knowles.

     Since this subject was brought forward at the Glasgow meeting there have been
found at Portstewart, besides additional flint implements and beads, some lumps of
porous lava, of the nature of pumice, and a few small flakes of obsidian. The lava
is rounded by waterwearing and floats on water, and the flakes or chips of obsidian
have bulbs of percussion. It is supposed that these substances are not native pro-
ductions, but that the lava, with obsidian attached, may have been carried by currents
from a distance, and cast ashore at Portstewart.

     Sandhills near Castlerock, County Londonderry, and at Wbitepark Bay, near
Ballintoy, were examined, and similar objects to those found at Portstewart were

obtained. At Whitepark Bay, which was the richer of the two, many hundreds of

flint implements were found, together with an oval toolstone, bone pins, bored and
cut bones, hammer-stones, cores, flakes, broken pottery, broken and split bones,
teeth, and shells. Blackish layers representing the ancient surface are to be seen
like those at Portstewart. The layers vary from about three to twelve inches in
thickness, and the objects are found imbedded in them, except where they are set
free by denudation. Twenty or thirty feet of sand protected by close vegetation
rests on the layers on some places, while in others the covering is removed, but the
layer which is pretty solid and coherent has resisted the action of the wind and still

remains.

                                                                pp2
--580 keport 1878.

     The animal remains as determined by Professor A. Leith Adams, F.R.S., were-
found to contain those of man, horse, ox, dog or wolf, fox, deer, and hog.

    Flint factories are also found at Lame and other places round the coast. Some-

are also found inland at a distance from the places where a supply of flint could he
obtained. In one of these inland places on the banks of the Bann, near Portglenone r
several flint implements were found approaching the form known as palaeolithic

--all having a thick base for holding in the hand and a cutting point and it was

thought strange that these, like the palseoiithic implements of large sizeas men-
tioned in Evan's " Stone Implements," should be found mainly in connection with

rivers.

     Our best authorities believe that all the stone implements found in Ireland

are of Neolithic age. It is not known that any extinct animal, such as the mam-

moth and Irish Elk, has been found asssociated with flint implements in Ireland,
but the implements from the Bann were found in the diatomaceous deposit below
the peat where remains of Irish Elk are usually found, and well-marked flakes have
been found at considerable depths from the surface in the raised beach at Larne, and
there is at present in possession of the Rev. Dr. Grainger, M.R.I. A., of Broughshane,
County Antrim, a mammoth's tooth found near Lame.* These facts, it was thought,
were sufficient at least to create a suspicion in our minds that some of the Irish stone
implements might be found to be older than the Neolithic age.

3. The Prehistoric Sculptures of Ilkley, Yorkshire. By J. Romilly Allen.

Ireland is a country rich in sculptures of the prehistoric period, and it is most

important to science that the comparative method should be applied to this branch

of research. The object in bringing the subject before the British Association at

Dublin is to enable the Yorkshire examples here described to be compared with

those found in Ireland. The particular type of .sculpture dealt with in the follow-

ing paper is known as " cup-ancWing marking." Sculptures of this description

were discovered in the North of England in 1825, and subsequently in Scotland,

Ireland, Brittany, and Wales. The most valuable addition to the information already
collected was made in 1877 by Mr. Rivett-Carnac, who found cup-and-ring marks,
identical with the ones of this country, amongst the Kamaon Hills in India. The

meanin"- of the symbols is fully understood by the natives, and is supposed to have
reference to " Ianaam" worship. Cup-and-ring marks in Great Britain are in-

timately connected with the burial rites, and therefore probably with the religious

ceremonies of the ancient inhabitants of this country, since the symbols are fre-

quently found carved on the stones of sepulchral circles and chambers, and on the
Acover stones of cinerary urns.
                                 full investigation of the subject may be the

means of throwing great light on the nature of the religion which preceded Chris-

tianity in this country. Examples of prehistoric sculpture from different localities

should be carefully compared. The remnants of Paganism incorporated in the

superstitions of remote districts and found mixed with the ceremonies of the

Christian church should be critically examined. The most successful method of

conducting such researches is to work steadily backward from the historic period

to the prehistoric, tracing the gradual course of development to its source.

The remainder of the paper is devoted to a description of the magnificent srroup

of cup-and-ring sculptures found on rocks in the neighbourhood of Ilkley, in York-

shire.

1. Methods and Results of Measurements of the Capacity of Simian Crania.

                           By William Henry Flower, F.E.S.

     The capacity of the cavity of the cranium is one of its most important
measurements, and at the same time one of the most difficult to ascertain. The

results of about three thousand experiments were given in this communication.

--Two methods had been chiefly employed 1. That of Broca, as described in his

memoir Sur la Mensuration de la Capacite du Crane, Mem. de la Soci^te d'An-

thropologic, T. l er (2e Sene), Paris 1873 ; the material used being leaden shot.
2. That of Busk, " Note on a ready method of measuring the capacity of skulls,"

"Journ. Anthrop. Inst.," vol. iii.'p. 200. In both the author has had the

advantage of the personal explanations and instructions of their respective in-

ventors. When these two methods were used to measure the same skulls, the

author found that the first invariably gave a larger capacity than the second,

amounting generally to as much as 3 or 4 cubic inches. To ascertain which, or

whether, either was absolutely correct, test skulls, prepared by stopping the larger

apertures with wax, and impregnating the bone tissue with melted paraffin to

make it impervious to fluids were employed. In these the capacity could be

ascertained with exactness by means either of inercury or water. In a skull so

prepared, Broca's method of mensuration gave 70 cubic centimetres above the real

Acapacity, Busk's 10 to 15.  slight modification of the last, using mustard seed,

and taking every care to fill both the cranium and the chorernometer to the utmost

by repeated shakings, gave very accurate results. The details of the method

(which cannot be described in an abstract) were demonstrated to the audience.

The results of the measurement of the collection of about a thousand crania

in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England were then described,

but their value as affording the data for comparing different races was not great,

owing to the insufficient numbers of each race available for comparison, as all

immature skulls, i.e. those in which the basal suture was not closed, were rejected

in the averages, and the sexes were carefully separated. To ascertain the influence

of sex, all the skulls of whatever race in the collection in which the sex is abso-

lutely known from other evidence than that presented by the skull itself, were

--measured with the following result : Sixt3'-three skulls of known males have an

average of 1433 cubic centimetres. Twenty-four skulls of known females have

an average of 1224 cubic centimetres, giving the proportion of 1000 to 854. The

largest normal skull in the collection is 2075 ; it is that of an Englishman of

unknown history ; the smallest, a female Vedda, measures 960 cubic centimetres.

The following are the averages of male skulls only, expressed in cubic centimetres,

the numbers of the skulls measured being placed in brackets. The insufficiency^?

many of these will be obvious, but they may serve as approximations. With

regard to the higher races, especially the English, it must be noted that the skulls
examined are those of the least intellectually developed portion of the community,
while with some of the lower races, it may he rather the reverse. The general
order in which the races are placed does not differ greatly from that of the tables
of Barnard Davis and Broca ; but the actual capacities are all smaller, especially
than those of the latter author,owing to the difference of the method of measure-
ment employed. West Coast of North America, mostly deformed (7), 1589

                  3. On a Colour Scale. By E. W. Brabkook.

     Having regard to Professor Broca's types of colour of eyes, hair, and skin adopted
by the Association in their 'Notes and Queries on Anthropology,' and to the selec-
tion made from those typesby the Anthropometric Committee, the writer drew attention
toa very comprehensive scale of colours lately published by the Socie'te' Stenochromiqua
of Paris, given to him by Dr. Paul Topinard, as affording a step towards universal
scientific language on the matter. The scale comprises forty-two colours and about
twenty shades of each, altogether more than 800 shades. The writer attempted to
 identify Broca's types of eye-colour with some of the shades of colours 4, 10, 12,

--13, 18, 19, 33 and 34 in the scale ; and his types of hair and skin colour with soma

 of those of 3, 4, 5,6, 32, 33, 34 and 35 showing that a comparatively limited range
 would suffice for all practical purposes in anthropology.

                 4. Left-handedwss. By Henry Muirhead, M.D.

      The writer directed attention chiefly to the seeming hereditariness of left-handed*
 ness in some families instancing his own as one in which he had been unable to trace
 a single instance of left-handedness. Contrasted with this he gave stalistics of tL
 family (named White) in Cambuslang for a period of 123 years. Of the individuals of
 this family so far as accurately known thirty-four used the right hand and nine the left;.
 nearly twenty-one per cent. Information as to the other members could not be relied
 on. Only one of the nine married and had children whose right and left-handednesa
 was known (she had five children two of them left-handed) so that in the majority of
 the instances given the parent was not left-handed. In all cases measured by the
 writer, left-handed individuals have the left foot from one-third to one-eighth of an
 inch longer than the right. The converse of this is usual in right-handed people.
 Right-handed people in looking with one eye (the other being shut) use the righti
 All left-handed females, so far as hitherto -scrutinized, use the left. Of left-handed
 males examined only two out of fourteen used the left eye.

     5. On the Evils arising from the use of Historical National Names as
                           Scientific Terms. By A. L. Lewis.

     The propositions endeavoured to be established by the author were: (1) That

there were at the first population of Europe certain primitive races, (of which three

were particularly  described)                                         (2) that these races are so mixed at the present day that
                                                                   ;

representatives of them appear not only in most European nations, but in the same

families, and among children                                          of the same parents                                                                                 (3)  that notwithstanding this
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

mixture, and the effects which it must permanently have, racial characters display

an astonishing permanence ; (4) that this mixture, being so slow in its effects, and yet
having become so general, has probably been at work for a very great length of

time, so great that the peoples to whom the earliest history of Europe introduces U3

were probably nearly as much mixed as those of                                         the present day                                                                              (5) that it is de-
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

sirable to discontinue the use of the political names of those peoples as ethnic names,

and  to  employ  others based                                         on the physical  characteristics of                                                                      the  individual                                                  (6)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

that while physical characteristics are the only basis for a true division into races,

yet in any practical application of this division the influence upon individuals of

different races of a community of language, custom, history, or tradition must not be

lost sight of, although these things do not prove community of race, but only the

contact at some time or other of the races to whom they are. now common.

         6. On some American Illustrations of new Varieties of Man.
                         By Professor Daniel Wilson, LL.D.

    7. On the Courses of Migration and Commerce, traced by Art Belies and
              Religious Emblems. By J. S. Phene, LL.D., F.8.A.

     In this paper references were first made to some remarkable sculptures of the

oldest historical notice, existing in the mountains of Asia Minor, particularly the

" Niobe " of Homer, on Mount Sipylus, and the Sesostris figure at Nymphio, and
subsequently, to the various colossal and other rock-hewn sculptures in the Sporades
and Oyclades, having affinity, by similarity of style, to those of Asia Minor. It was
then mentioned that according to Strabo, tradition showed that the religion of this
part of Asia Minor was transferred to the south of Gaul, in the ancient city of Mas-
silia, now Marseilles, and thence consequently it spread over the west of Europe.
That this religion brought with it the idea of the colossal in representation, which
probably accounts for the ancient colossal figures in Brittany and Britain, and the
love for the colossal still found over the. whole of that part of France lying between
Marseilles and Brittany, the old route of tin traffic between Britain and the Medi-
terranean. Still existing Phoenician customs were referred to on the same route,
and then references were made to some discoveries on this route, and in the south
of Britain and the south of Ireland, which tended to.tlie conclusion that the articles
discovered were introduced by Oriental, probably by Phoenician traders. One of
these was a sculptured human head in the exact style of Assyrian art, as found at
Nineveh, and which was discovered some slight distance under the surface on the
estate of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe, in Devonshire, who had drawn the attention
of the author of the paper to it, and furnished him with a photograph. Another
was a bronze mask or head found in a bog in the south of Ireland, near the Galtee

mountains ; it was the property of Lord James Butler, by whom the particulars and

a photograph were furnished to Dr. Phene with a request that he would give his
attention to the matter, and throw what light he was able on the subject ; and to
which, in response to such request, the author had devoted much time and research.
This bronze represented the head of a cow, and had a close resemblance to the head
found by Dr. Schliemann at Mycenae, which he identified as the head of Hera.
The latter relic was minutely examined by Dr. Phene at Athens, every facility
584 report-- 1878.

being afforded him by the Greek Government. The Mycenae head was silver, with
horns thickly plated with gold, and the head found in Ireland was a bronze one, with
the horns (missing) made to take on and off, thereby clearly indicating that they were
capable of being removed for security, and were therefore, no doubt, also golden.
Both the heads had the sun disc on the forehead, but the bronze one, which he con-
sidered was evidently of Phoenician workmanship, had also the emblem of Astarte
or Ashtoreth, the Sidonian deity, on the forehead. In the mask found in Ireland,
the tongue protruded, indicating sleep or rest, and this symbolism was further ex-
emplified by the crescent moon being placed beneath the sun disc, and so indicative
of her rest or sleep, a strong similitude when taken in connection with the well-
known appeal to the priests of Baal, who must have represented their deities in
action or occupation, " Cry aloud, for he is a god, either he is talking, or he is pur-
suing, or sleepeth, and must be awaked." Dr. Phene, who had gone carefully over
the whole districts referred to in Asia Minor, Greece, the Levant, and the complete
course in France, found a cow's head sculptured in the island of Paros, and another
on part of an ancient temple now forming the lintel of a Greek church near Ainycke,
not far from Sparta. Another object of great interest was represented, as were all
the others, by a fine photograph representing a bronze figure of a deity, shown to be
the Tyrian Hercules, found at Vienne, near Besancon, not far from the old route re-
ferred to, through Gaul. This deity bore on its head an enormous crown composed
of hammers, the number of which agrees with the united number of the Kabiri of
Samothrace and the Cyclopes of Sicily, their occupation being the same, viz. that
 of metallurgists. Dr. Phene considers they represented the same personifications,
but lost the attributes of divinity as their traditions were brought westward. The
 attitude of this deity and a vessel he holds in bis right band agree with the repre-
 sentation of one of the Kabiri on a coin of Perganms.

     les concement your Vethnograjphie de VEurope primitive. Par Henri

     Martin.

J'ai de'sire presenter a cette savante association quelques observations sur un

sujet qui rue semble digne d'interet et qui meriterait de plus amples developpe-

ments                         mais  j'aurai  atteint mon but  si  j'ai  pu  attirer l'attention  de  l'assistance  sur
                           ;

la question qui me prtioccupe : cette question, c'est la concordance que je crois

trouver entre les re"sultats qu'obtiennent actuellement les rechercbes des anthi-opo-

logistes et des ethnograpbes sur les vieilles populations du continent et les resultats

que donne 1 etude des traditions bistoriques et legendaires de l'Irlande.

Les antbropologistes signalent une race brune bracbycepbale qui existe le long

on retrouve cette ra"ce brune en France, dans la Celtique de Cesar (France centrale)

et plus ou moins dans le reste de^la France ; on la retrouve aussi a des proportions

diverses en Angleterre, Galles, Ecosse, Irlande. On la retrouve partout melee
aux Gaulois ou Celtes blonds ou cbatains et aux yeux bleus. Ges bommes bruns

^taient la race dominie : les grands Gaulois blonds de l'histoire grecque et romaine

e"taient la race dominante.

Examinons maintenant ce que nous donnent les traditions irlandaises.

L'Irlande semble d'abord occupee par des sauvages qui n'ont pas de nom dans

llristoire puis arrivent successivement plusieurs essaims, plusieurs colonies de
                                           ;

Celtes primitifs dont les 6tablissements ne subsistent pas, mais dont le souvenir

cependant persiste leurs conducteurs supposes sont evidemment des personnages
                                                                                          ;

mythologiques, de vieilles divinites qu'on a transformers beaucoup plus tard en

personnages humains. Un de ces noms importe a signaler : le nom de Nemedh, et

parce que Nemedh est l'ancetre suppose des colonies posterieures qui reussirent
enfin a s'etablir d'une maniere durable en Irlande, et parce que ce nom de Nemedh

se retrouve partout dans les traditions des peuples celtiques, depuis l'Irlande

jusque dans la Gaule d'Asie (Galatie) : il de"signe tout ce qui est ancien, vene-

rable, sacre" : c'est le nom meme des sanctuaires druidiques.

   A la race de Nemedh, suivant la tradition, appartient done le premier peuple

qui ait laisse des traces subsistantes en Irlande, le peuple des Fir-Bolgs. On avoulu

en faire des Beiges, mais ils n'ont pas le moindre rapport avec les Beiges de Ce"sar,

qui sont les plus recents, en Occident, des grands Gaulois blonds. Les Fir-Bolgs

sont au contraire tres anciens, et ils sont une petite race brune. Comment alors la

tradition en fait-elle une branche des descendants de Nemedh, e'est-a-dire des

Celtes ou Gaulois ? C'est que, s'ils n'etaient pas de meme sang, ils e"taient de
meme langue et de mceurs analogues plus ou moins ; ils etaient celtises quand ils

vinrent en Irlande ; les noms d'hommes et de lieux qui proviennent d'eux sont des
noms celtiques comme ceux des premieres colonies et comme ceux des autres

immigrations posterieures.

     Cette observation relative aux Fir-Bolgs dTrlande est egalement applicable
aux Ligures de Gaule et d'ltalie, ce peuple brun, mele aux Celtes, qui, dans les

temps bistoriques, ne parlait plus d'autre langue que la langue des Gaulois ou

Celtes.

Parmi les usages celtiques qu'avaient les Fir-Bolgs, la tradition leur attribue

celui d'elever des tumulus, des monuments megalithiques, quoique les plus con-
--586

siderables de ces monuments ne leur soient point attributes. En Angleterre, de>

meme, on signale les restes brachycephales trouves dans les round-barrotos qui

paraissent se rapporter aux freres des Fir-Bolgs d'Irlande.

    Au buitieme siecle avant l'ere cbr6tienne, peu de temps apres la venue des Fir-

Bolgs, la tradition, suivant les Annales des Quatre Maitres, fait arriver un peuple

nouveau : il s'appelait la race de la Deesse Dana on des Dieux de Dana : ce sont de
grands bommes blonds aux yeux bleus, des druides autrement organises que les

druides bretons, avec une niythologie differente et qui parait anterieure. Oe peuple

a organisation sacerdotale conquiert l'Irlande eur les Fir-Bolgs et les assujetit. Un

vieux poeme bardique sur la bataille de Moytura ou les Dananniens vainquirent les Fir-

Bolgs, contient une particularity bien remarquable, que Lady Ferguson a signalee dans

Ason excellent livre On the Ancient Irish before the Conquest.  l'6poque ou le poeme

fut ecrit, les Gaels d'Irlande ne portaient depuis bien des siecles que des glaives de

fer : cependant les bardes se souvenaient si bien de l'age du bronze, que l'auteur du

poeme explique la difference qui existait entre l'armement des Dananniens et celui

des Fir-Bolgs ; ces derniers n'avaient que de mauvaises epe"es triangulares, larges,

courtes, mal fabrique"es; les autres avaient des epees plus longues, mieux fabri-

quees, mieux affilees, de forme elegante Or, vous pouvez verifier au Museum de

l'lrisb Royal Academy l'exactitude du poete : ces deux sortes d'epees sont raugeea

dans les vitrines a cote les unes des autres. Vous avez la les armes dont se servaient

les deux peuples rivaux il y a 2,500 ans.

    J'ai fait remarquer l'accord qui me paraissait exister entre les observations

antbropologiques et la tradition. II y a aussi accord entre la tradition et lea

{ihilologues, les liiiguistes. La linguistique nous montre une grande famille da

angues, la famille aryenne, se formant dans l'Asie centrale, et en conclut que nos

aieux, ceux-la du moius qui nous ont donne" nos langues europeennes, sont venus de

cette region. La tradition irlandaise ne remonte pas jusqu'a l'Asie centrale, mais

elle est sur la route : elle fait venir les diverses colonies de la Tbrace, de la Grece,

c'est-a-dire du Pont-Euxin et de l'Asie-Mineure, en resume, de l'Orieut. Peu

importent les fables, et les infiltrations classiques, relativement modernes, qui

alterent ici les vieux souvenirs celtiques ; le foud, c'est la marcbe des immigrations

d'Orient en Occident. Je ferai observer que la tradition welcbe ou cymryque de

Galles est en accord avec la tradition irlandaise. Lhu Gadarn, ancienne divinite

que les Triades transforment en conducteur de peuple, amene les Oymrys du pays

de l'Ete (Bro haf), oil, dit la glose, est a present Constantinople.

Pour les Dananniens, les Tuatha-De-Danann, il y a quelque cbose de particulier,

et qui me'rite grande attention. lis ne viennent pas tout droit de l'Orieut ; ils

viennent de Locblin, c'est-a-dire de la Scandinavie.

   B y a des traditions qui les font venir 1,200, et jusqu'a 1,500 ans avant l'ere

cbretienne ; mais la plus accreditee, celle qu'ont cboisie les Quatre Maitres, dans
leurs grandes Annales d'Irlande, fixe leur avenement au buitieme siecle settlement.

Or, les etudes des savants du Nord nous fournissent ici un rapprocbemeut tres

frappant. Les savants Sue'dois et Danois font remonter approximativement a

huit siecles environ avant l'ere cbretienne l'arrivee en Scandinavie d'un peuple

qui succede a celui qui elevait des monuments megalithiques. Ce nouveau peuple

construit des tumulus ou il n'y a plus de grottes de grandes pierres, mais des

chambres funeraires en petits matoriaux, ou l'on trouve les guerriers non incini$r(Ss,

avec leurs grandes e"p£es de bronze, plus longues, plus larges, plus lourdes que les

6pt5es irlandaises, et parfois avec les restes de leurs vetements. Ces conquerants

sont, j'en suis convaincu, les Cimbres de l'histoire romaine, Celtes de race, et partis

du Pont-Euxin pour le Nord a, la meme epoque ou leurs freres les Bretons en

partaient pour l'Occident. L'arcbe"ologie ne signale dans la Scandinavie rien

d'intermediaire entre ces bommes aux grandes epees de bronze et aux ornements

--d'or, auxquels appartenaient aussi les grandes trompettes de bronze, rien d'inter-

mediaire, dis-je, entre les Cimbres et les Scandinaves, les guerriers aux e"pe"es de

fer et aux ornements d'argent, qui ne paraissent dans le Nord qu'au commencement

    Un passage du grand geograpbe Strabon me parait se rapporter a la migration

des Cimbres et des Bretons vers le Nord et l'Ouest. Strabon rappelle une tradition

suivant laquelle une double emigration de Cimmeriens et de Venetes ou Ilenetes-

serait partie du Pont-Euxin a une epoque post<5rieure a la redaction de l'Uiade,

mais anterieure a, cette autre Emigration citninerienne done parle Ilerodote et

que d^termina J'invasion des Scythes six siecles avant notre ere. Oela nous

donnerait encore a peu pres huit siecles avant notre ere, l'Uiade tStant consid^ree

comme datant d'enviroii neuf siecles avant Jt5sus-Christ. Les Venetes sont restes

celtises et ineles aux Celtes en Italie, en Armorique, en Gallea, en Ecosse.

    Voici comme ces migrations des CiunntSriens ou Cimbres me paraissent nous

ramener aux Tuatha-De-Danann. Les Cimbres remplacent dans le Nord le

peuple des monuments inegalithiques. Or, la tradition irlandaise fait venir les

Dananniens de Scandinavie a une epoque qui se rapproche de la venue des Oimbres

dans le Nord. N'est-il pas probable que la caste sacerdotale du Nord a emigre

devant les conque'rants, avec une partie de la population, et qu'elle est arrivee

en Irlande, ou la tradition lui attribue les plus imposants des monuments megali-

tbiques, Newgrange et autres ?

   A propos des Cimbres, Pline cite quelques mots de leur langue, qui ont une

pbysionomie tout-a-fait bretonne, et Tacite nous dit que les ^Estii (Estoniens ?)
parlent une langue tres voisine du breton.

Pour me resumer sur les Dananniens, ils sont, a mes yeux, une brancbe des

premieres migrations celtiques dont Nt5niedh est le prototype. Ils auraient ete les-

constructeurs des moniunents megalithiques en Scandinavie, pendant que d'autres

Celtes primitifs, leurs freres, construisaieut nos monuments de Gaule (Bretagne et

autres), dAlbion, etc. Newgrange et les autres grands monuments dananniens

d'Irlande seraient done posterieurs a Carnac, Locmariaker, etc., quoique appartenant

a la rneme tradition et a une brancbe analogue des Celtes. Les signes symboliques

des monuments de Bretagne et ceux des monuments irlandais, sans etre absolument

pareils, sont tres analogues ; il n'y a que ce qu'on pourrait nommer une difference

de dialectes.

. Les Tuatha-De-Danann, vainqueurs des Fir-Bolgs, furent, a leur tour, deux

siecles apres, suivant la tradition, vaincus par de nouveaux conquerants, les Scotts

ou Mildsiens, clans heroiques, qui subjuguerent les tribus sacerdotales. Les Mile"siens,

eux, seraient venus du Sud-Ouest, comme les Dananniens, du Nord-Est. Ils e"taient

partis de l'Espagne. Ils etaient moins blonds, chiitains ; ils semblent avoir ete de
race plus ou moins melangee : je les appellerais voloutiers des Celtiberes. Je

poserai settlement deux questions en ce qui les concerne : 1°. Avaient-ils deja les

armes de fer quand ils arriverent ? Les Gaulois du Danube, qui, apres avoir envahi

Test de la Gaule, envahirent l'ltalie, avaient deja les epees de fer lorsqu'ils prirent

Rome, pres de quatre siecles avant notre ere, et les Celtiberes, de leur cote, eurent

de bonne heure des glaives de fer, et de meilleure trempe que ceux des Gaulois.

2°. Ce qu'on dit de la religion des Milesiens est singulier. Tribus heroiques, ils

devaient avoir des dieux heroiques ; on leur attribue cependant des dieux cosmogo-

niques                             Crom, leur  grand dieu, est  un  Chronos, un    Saturne :   son  nom veut dire
                                ;

courbe, la courbe generatrice du cercle qui se referme sur lui-meme : il est entoure

de douze dieux inferieurs, comme une annee mystique avec ses douze mois. Cela

conviendrait bien mieux aux Dananniens qu'aux Milesiens. Serait-ce une partie

de la mythologie danannienne dont Cormac ne nous parle pas dans son Glossaire,

lorsqu'il cite la deesse Dana et la famille de dieux issue d'elle ? Les Scotts-

auraient-ils re^u ce mythe des Dananniens ?

Je terminerai, quant a ces vieux peuples, en emettant le vceu que Ton entie-

prenne de fouiller les tumulus irlandais qui passent pour les plus auciens, ceux qui

sont census etre les tombeaux de Beath, d'Eire ou Oeasair, et autres personnages

pretendus conducteurs des premieres colonies. On n'y trouvera pas les restes de

ces etres mythiques ; mais on pourra y trouver des objets archaiques tres
iht^ressants pour les etudes pre-bistoriques ou, pour mieux dire, pour les etudes

des origines de Thistoire.

Permettez-moi d'aj outer une observation personnelle : j'ai visits une partie des

comtes de Galway et de Mayo :                                   je  comptais    r  rencontrer  en   majority  les

                                                                              y

descendants des Fir-Bolgs : j'ai vu au contraire dominer dans cette contree la

race blonde aux yeux bleus, de beaucoup la plus nombreuse.

en Sussex. Les observations de son rapport peuvent s'appliquer a plusieurs des

anciennes fortifications appelees en France camps de Cesar, et qui sont d'anciens

oppida celtiques occupe"s bien apres Cesar par les Roniains ; mais un plus grand

nombre de ces oppida celtiques, en France, n'ont jamais ete occup£s par les

Romains : je citerai le pr<5tendu camp de C6sar pres Dieppe, auquel une tradition
sans doute mieux foudee donne le nom de cite de Lime et ou Ton trouve des

objets de provenance celtique tres ancienne.

J'tSmettais le voeu que Ton fouillat les tumulus irlaudais repute's les plus

anciens ; la fouille pratiquee dans un des tumulus de Moytura a deja donne un
resultat : ce tumulus passe pour le tombeau d'un des chefs des Fir-Bolgs. On

y"a trouv<5 une urne tres primitive, ou les ornements fort simples paraissent avoir

etc" creuses avec l'ongle dans la terre avant la cuisson. Ceci se rapporte tres bien

avec les traditions sur les Fir-Bolgs, qui passent pour beaucoup moins civilises que

Aleurs vainqueurs les Tuatha-De-Danann.                                                                ceux-ci appartiendraient les urnes

beaucoup plus finement orne"es et de forme assez elegante, trouv<5es dans d'autres

tumulus, et tres analogues par le style avec celles des monuments de France.

Je remercie la savante assembled d avoir bien voulu m'entendre et serai tres

satisfait si quelques-unes des personnes eclaire'es qui la composent prennent interet

aux questions que j'ai touchees et contribuent par leurs lumieres a les re"soudre.

    Une derniere observation me revient a propos de l'ecriture Ogharn. II ne

parait pas douteux qu'elle provienne des Tuatha-De-Danann. S'ils ont habite la

Scandinavie avant lTrlande, ils n'y einployaient pas encore l'Ogham, puisqu'on ne

le trouve pas sur les monuments mdgalithiques du Nord ; c'est done depuis leur

arrivee en Irlande qu'ils l'ont invents, et Ton peut le qualifier specialement de'

caractere druidique irlandais.

2. On some objects of Ethnological Interest collected in India and its Islands.
                               By V. Ball, M.A., F.O.S.

Mr. Ball exhibited and described a number of objects which he had collected in

some of the least-known and wildest parts of India, and in the Nicobar and Anda-
man Islands.

From the peninsular there were a series of stone implements, having a marked

resemblance to certain well-known forms of wide distribution. There were also

some peculiar adze-shaped implements, found in Western Bengal, which had served

to confirm a previously expressed supposition* as to a prehistoric connection having

Mumexisted between the Mundas of Bengal and the                                                        of Bumiah.

Other objects shown were battle-axes and musical instruments used by the

--Khonds of Orissafire-sticks                                                       from  Sambalpur ;  and boomerangs from Katiawar.
                                                                                 ;
Nicobar Islands. Photographs of the villages and people of these islands served

to illustrate the peculiarity of the structure of the houses and the costume of the

people, which latter was further exemplified by some wooden figures, which the

author considered were rather to be regarded as effigies of the departed than as

idols. The tail-like strips of cloth which hang from the waist and trail on the

ground were probably the cause of the ancient belief in the existence of tailed men

on some of the islands in the Bay of Bengal. In one of the editions of Ptolomy's

map, islands which were not improbably intended to represent the Nicobars are

labelled " Satyrorum inside tres quorum incole caudas ut sunt satyrorum habere

dicentur." Other objects from the same islands were a specimen of picture-writing

·ear-cylinders ; cocoa-nut-shell water-vessels ; a copper-headed hog-spear, and a large
sheet of cloth made of the beaten bark of a species of Celfis. The author gave

his reasons for believing in the existence of a Negrito race similar to the Andamanese

in the interior of the Nicobars.

  --Andaman Islands. The objects from these islands which were exhibited and

described were, human skulls adorned with shells, and which had been carried by

the relatives of the deceased slung on their shoulders; glass bottle flakes, used for

·shaving ; necklaces of turtle bones ; a cooking vessel of sun-dried clay in a bamboo
frame ; bows and arrows of peculiar shapes; bones of turtle and Dugong from a

                                                                                    * By General Sir Arthur Phayre.

trophy ; and oysters from a kitchen midden, the latter being remarkable from the
fact that the Andamaus of the present day do not, it is said, eat oysters, thou"h
they do eat other shell-fish. In conclusion the author remarked that ingenious in
construction as some of the objects were, their invention probably dated back to a
long distant time, since, in his experience, no savages of the present day ever invented

a new implement or changed the manner of performing any single custom of their

lives.

4. Notes on some Tribes of Tropical Aborigines. By T. J. Hutchinson,

                             late Her Majesty's Consul at Gallao.

The memoir commenced by the author's statement of the tribes he was about to

speak of being some of those in the tropical regions of West Africa and South

America, with whom he had become acquainted during his twenty-three years of

--going to and fro in climes beyond the seas. Its chief object was to tell peculiarities

of these tribes to show the analogies in superstitions and social barbarities, as

well as in a sort of indigenous civilization, amongst peoples of different races,

--dwelling on different sides of the globe. The Aborigines of Tropical Africa were

first introduced under the different heads of 1. Pagan Superstitions. 2. Domestic

ASlavery. 3. Polygamy. 4. Cannibalism. 5. Social Barbarities. 6. Idioms or
Languages.  description was given of the peculiar ideas in parts of Western Africa

--about the first Creation of Man. From this the author went on to the Tropical African

system of polytheism Serpent worship in Fernando Po was described as existing in

the fact of the skin of a large kind of boa constrictor, called the " Roukaronkon "

being annually suspended from a tree in the " Reossa " (or large forum space for

palavers), and all the children born within the previous year being carried out by

their mothers, and their little hands held up to touch the tail of the serpent. The

people of the Egbo or ' tiger ' tribe have an idea of an Almighty power, whom they

entitle " Abasi Ibuni." But as he is believed to be the Creator of all things incom-

prehensible, they worship a subordinate god-head whom they entitle Idem-Efik.

Their superstition of making what they entitle " devil houses " in obsequies for the

dead, wherein are put furniture, drink, eatables, and cloth, were shown to be pre-

cisely the same as exist amongst the Mongolian tribes in the Feejee Islands, as

described by Dr. Leeman. This people (the Efiks) at Old Calabar, likewise ad-

minister " Afias," or Ordeals, pretendedly to detect crime, but in reality to keep the

slave class in subjugation. They have also a biennial custom of purifyino- their

towns from evil spirits. Domestic slavery was described in Western Tropical

Africa, where all the women, from the wives of Kings and Chiefs downwards, were

described as slaves. There is a custom on the Gold Coast to buy or appropriate

out of the menage of domestic slavery a boy or girl, and bestow on him or her the title

of Crabbah or " Oerah." This signifies that thev are to be looked on as the soul or

spirit of master or mistress. They are treated well, never asked to work, wear chains

of gold round their necks, with a medallion of gold, and when their owners die they

are killed to accompany them into the next world. The two social institutions of

--Polygamy and Cannibalism were touched on briefly. An analogv was pointed out

between the practice which existed amongst the Moxos, a tribe of South Americans

now extinct, and the people of Old Calabar, when the author was out there twenty-

five years ago, of the barbarous practice of killing twins. The paper touched on the

--tribes of South American Indians--the Tobas, Guaicaruses, Abipons, and Mocovis
   seen by the author in the tropical parts of the Gran Chaco, which he traversed in
1863. The Chiuioo people of Peru were also spoken of. Differences of idioms be-

tween the tropical Africans living almost in contiguous districts were related, and
the same shown to exist in Bolivia (within the tropics also), where in one province

thirty-seven different tribes of Indians existed in former times, each tribe havino- a

different idiom, and many of them having such a limited knowledge of arithmetic

as to be able to count only to five, and some to three.

5. On the Prehistoric Relations of the Babylonian, Egyptian, and Chinese
     Characters and Culture. By Hyde Clarke, V.P.A.S., V.P.S.S.

Referring to the relationship of these three groups of characters, the writer

gave illustrations of a community of meaning and form, and of a diversity of

sound. This indicated that the original words attached to the characters belonged

to some earlier language different from these, and in which the sounds having

Kaidentical meanings corresponded. Taking the cuneiform characters for  and Ba

they were in opposition (equivalent to 2K). Together they formed the word

Kaba, a well-known recognisable prehistoric negative used for Not, Death,

&c. In Chinese the roots 7 and 75 for No and Not indicate a com-

bination of the same characters (2K). In the ancient Shwo wen there are

three arms on each side, so that the original form may be indicative of two hands
in opposition. Further, while in later times Kappa is X, in square Hebrew Caph

is nearer to C, and Caph means the Hollow of the Hand and is female, and in oppo-

sition to its neighbouring letter Yod, which signifies the Hand or emblem of the

man or male. On the other side Akkad 42 of Lenormant, sounding Ka and ga

is a square character (originally converted from round O), and signifying Mouth,

Speak. The square Chinese character 30 signifies Mouth, Speak, and sounds

K'eu and ga(p). No. 156 Akkad square signifies Presence ( = Face) and enclosure
( = Field). The Chinese character for Face 109, and for Garden 102, correspond to
Akkad. No. 204 Akkad signifies both House and Speak, conjunctions of meaning

for the same sound to be found in the African or prehistoric languages. No. 71
Akkad stands for Fish, Ship, equivalents for which are found in Africa. No.

459 Akkad (|| or =) stands for Son, Water, River, also combined as one word

in Africa. No. 354 Akkad signifies Tongue and Serpent, again combined in Africa.

In Chinese square characters, converted from round (D for O), are used for

equivalents prehistorically, and psychologically and philologically connected,

as Round, Circle, Eye, to See, Sun, Moon, Face, Head, Ear, Mouth, to Say,

Sound, Mother. The favourite sound in Chinese for this group is IMC, (as in

English Mouth, Moon, Mother). This series is continued in the alphabets, the

Phoenician, Sabean, Safa, and some of the features may be recognised in modern

Roman as 0. Indeed, in the alphabets many emblems of the ancient Nature-

worship, or emblems may be recognised as I, tf,C,U, O, V, e,S, T, A? M, *, K.
With regard to the comparative philology of Akkad, Mr. Clarke continued to

resist the Ugrian classification of M. Ujfalvy, and showed that the roots in Akkad

and in Ugrian can be identified with those of the languages of prehistoric character

of the Old and New World, but remarkably in Houssa, Mandingo, Pulo, Timbuktu,

Aku, of Africa. Thus they approach in their affinities the Kolarian group of

India as much as the Ugrian, and must precede the Dravidian or Tamil. This

afforded independent evidence, in contradiction of the Semitic theory of M. Halevy,

that the transliteration assigned to Akkad words by Lenormant is correct. At
the same time we must allow for an earlier epoch of culture in characters and in

mythology, antecedent to that of the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Chinese, and cor-

responding to that of the moundbuilders. With regard to the Egyptian mythology

Mr. Clarke gave illustrations of the prehistoric origin of Pasht (the moon) Seb

[Shepi], (Siva), and Kaba. He again maintained with regard to           and "/\

that  Uin cuneiform, the vowel A, is male, and /\, the vowel and O, is female.

        4. Inscribed Bone Implements. By J. Park Harrison, M.A.

     At the meeting of the British Association at Plymouth last year, I exhibited

 some marks upon chalk, from the entrances of subterraneous galleries, at Oissbury,
 near Worthing, made by neolithic flinl^workers for the purpose of obtaining
 materials for tools and weapons. They were of two kinds :

       1. Symbols, such as are often seen on ancient coins.

                  -ft.6.e:Kfi.A.L

      2, Simpler signs, and straight lines in different combinations.

              U.KH.h.lKX.,/.//.U.

      Both descriptions of marks have been pronounced by eminent palseographists
 to be Runes, or adaptations of early characters by a semi-barbarous people.

     No sufficient evidence, however, existed that the marks at Cissbury were con-
 temporaneous with the galleries until March last, when the discovery of a skeleton

 buried with British rites, and with flint implements only associated with it, some
 ten feet higher than the entrance of a gallery, over which there were signs of a
 similar description to some in the second category (believed to be the earliest),
 removed all doubt respecting their antiquity.

      Search has since been made for runes of early date in France, which has re-

 sulted in the acquisition of evidence of an inductive kind that brief inscriptions,
 possibly only charms, but perhaps names and dedications, were in use in very early

 times in Western Europe. Some twenty examples (all on implements of horn
 or bone) have been found in various museums, and the collections so opportunely
 brought together this summer at the Paris Exhibition.

      There are also rune-like incisions on a bone which bears the remarkable outline
 of a horse, from the upper strata of the Victoria cave at Settle,* which are very

 similar to marks in the second category at Cissbury.t And it should be mentioned,

       * ' Journ. Anthrop. Inst.' vol. viii. p. 182.
      t I have also very recently heard that Runes have been found on a bone needle
 co. Kilkenny.
--592 kepokt 1878.

that the marks on the butts of two lance-points, of which graphic representations
are given in the 'Reliquiae Aquitanicse,' are considered by the accomplished editor
(Professor Rupert Jones) to be inscriptive.

     It is not supposed that any of the early races, either in France or England,
invented written characters. All that it is necessary to assume is that a know-

ledge of letters may have been acquired by commerce or " contact " from a people
in a higher state of civilisation, just as bronze was introduced into neo-lithic
France from the East at what appears to have been a less remote period.

    In support of this I may mention that Professor Rhys, from a critical study of
the Ogham characters, arrived some time back at the conclusion that they must

have been founded on an earlier alphabet, which he considers woidd ultimately
have been derived from the East.* Owing, however, to the perishable nature of
the material (viz. wood) on which the earlier Runes are traditionally supposed to
have been inscribed, no remains were believed to be in existence.

     It is important, so far as the more distinctive forms at Cissbury are concerned,
that the significant fact shoidd be known that coins have been found on the coast
of Sussex, which Mr. Ernest Willett informs us are of the type of those of Sex, a
Carthaginian colony in the South of Spain : t and some of the Runes of that district
are like the symbols at Cissbury last alluded to.

5. The Primitive Human Family. By C. Staniland Wake, M.A.I.

After  an  examination  of  the  theories of  Mi-                MacLennan,  Sir  John  Lubbock,
                                                              .

Mr. Morgan, and Mr. Herbert Spencer, all of which assumed that, owing to the un-

certainty of paternity, the primitive human family was based on kinship through

the female only, it was shown that such an assumption is not consistent with the

social phenomena exhibited among uncultured peoples, which require the full recog-

nition of relationship through the male as well as through the female, and that,

while the clan or gentile organization is based on the latter, the primitive authority

of the father as the head of the family is perpetuated in the tribal organization.

  DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.

Chaikman of the Department-- E. McDonnell, Esq., M.D., F.B.S.

                    THURSDAY, AUGUST 15, 1878.

                            The Department did not meet,

       FRIDAY, AUGUST 16, 1878.

       Dr. McDonnell gave the following Address :

 Since this Association met twelve months ago, the science of physiology has suf-

 fered an irreparable loss. In February last, Claude Bernard died, in the sixty-fifth

 year of his age. He was interred with a degree of pomp never in this country,
 and rarely even in France, accorded to men of science. His country showed how

--highly and how justly they estimated the merit of a man who gentle, unobtrusive,
--modest by the greatness of his genius and the brilliancy of his many discoveries,

 shed a lustre on the land which gave him birth.

     It was my privilege to have been at one time a pupil of this illustrious physio-
 logist. It will be my pride if I can show to a thoughtful and cultivated audience,
 such as I have the honour to address, that the discoveries of my honoured master,

 although of necessity made by experiment on animals, have added much to that

 stock of knowledge which has conferred the greatest benefits upon mankind.
      In an address like this, limited to a short time, it would not be possible to give

 a detailed account of the work accomplished by Bernard. To do so would be to
 give a history of the progress of physiology for the last five-and-thirty years. His
 researches were so extensive and some of his discoveries so vast, that, by com-

 parison, they seemed to make others appear small, as the gigantic Oalifornian pine

--seems to dwarf a goodly-sized oak which grows alongside it. Hence we speak of

 Bernard's less important researches of his minor discoveries, although of sufficient

 magnitude to have seemed great if made by another. Of these I cannot speak at

 length. Yet some of my hearers well know that the services which Bernard has

 rendered to science by his researches on the pneumogastric nerves, the fifth pair, the

 chorda tympani, the facial, etc., are not small. Assuredly, the same may be said

 for his observations on " recurrent sensibility ; " on the blood pressure and the gases

 of the blood ; on the variations of colour in this fluid according to the active or

 passive condition of the functions of the organ traversed by it ; on the variations

  of temperature during these conditions of functional activity or inactivity ; on the
 elective elimination by the glands of substances introduced into the economy, or of

 those which, as morbid products, accumulate in the system as the result of certain

 morbid states ; on the special character of the action of the varieties of the salivary
 secretions ; upon the influence of the nervous centres on the secretion of saliva ; on

I

 the electric phenomena manifested in nerve and muscle ; on albuminuria connected
 with lesions of the nervous system ; and (notably in its important practical bear-
 ings on uraemia) on the modifications of the secretions of the stomach and intes-

 tines after arrest of the elimination of urea through the natural channels.

1878.  QQ
594 report-- 1878.

    Claude Bernard, in truth, left his mark deeply on every aspect of physiology on
which he touched. His discoveries, however, as regards the functions of the pan-
creas, of the liver, and concerning the vasomotor system of nerves, are those on

which his fame will ever chiefly rest.
    It is not too much to say, that, prior to the communications made by Bernard

to the Soci6te de Biologie, little or nothing definite was known of the normal
action of the pancreatic fluid. Even a popular audience can form a judgment as

to the practical value of Bernard's researches in this direction. Before the pub-

--lication of his memoir the fluid secreted by the pancreas was regarded as something

destined to dilute the bile and render it less acrid its true action as a liquid taking

a special and active part in. the digestion of particular kinds of food was, we may
say, unknown. Bernard was the first physiologist who obtained pure, healthy
pancreatic fluid from a living animal. It was he who showed its reaction. He

demonstrated its extraordinary digestive power, not only over fats, but over other

alimentary matters. He proved it to be the only one of the digestive liquids which

at once forms a complete and permanent emulsion with fats. It is true Dr. Richard

Bright had before (in 1832) observed fatty diarrhoea as existing in cases of organic
disease of the pancreas, but, in fact, his observations were barren, and did not

serve to direct attention to the action of the pancreatic fluid in digestion until
after Bernard's discoveries threw additional light on the question. Bernard's
researches on this subject have been so thorough and complete that he has left

little to be learned. Yet there are many excellent physicians, who in their daily
practice profit by his discoveries, who know little of the steps by which these dis-
coveries were made. They prescribe pepsine and pancreatine in one form or
another, but oftentimes they know as little of the discoverers of these agents as the

cheesemonger does about the secretion or coagulation of the milk from which the

cheese is made which he sells over his counter. It is hardly honest in such per-
sons to form and express a dogmatic opinion upon what experimental physiology
has done for practice without conscientiously endeavouring to inform themselves

on this subject.

    As regards the work accomplished by the liver in the animal economy, Bernard
did nearly as much as he did for the pancreas. As every one knows, the liver is a

large organ ; it performs duties the importance of which to the health and happi-

ness of mankind can hardly be overrated. Yet up to the year 1857 medical men
were in absolute ignorance of one half of what the liver does. They knew that it

secreted bile ; it was reserved for Bernard to discover another and no less impor-

tant function hitherto unknown. The majority of those engaged in practice even
still, I believe, look upon the liver as if the principal duty of this gland were

nothing else than the secretion of bile. It is certain, however, that it does other
work, little, if at all, inferior in importance to the formation of biliary matters, and
quite as necessary to the maintenance of health. Its power of making and storing

up for a time within its cells, a material resembling starch, constitutes, without
 doubt, one of its most important functions. This no person will for a moment
 doubt who takes the trouble of ascertaining by experiment the immense increase
 or diminution in bulk which the liver may be made to undergo in the space of a
 few days by such changes of diet as increase or diminish the amount of this starch-

like material in its tissue.

     It was in March 1857, that Bernard announced the important discovery of a

material formed by the liver closely resembling starch or rather dextrine of vege-

table origin, and, like it, readily changing into sugar in the presence of ferments.

Some of those present are aware that I have ventured to differ from my illustrious

teacher as to the ultimate destination of this substance in the animal economy. I

prefer, therefore, to designate it by another name than that which he gave to it.

He called it sugar-forming substance (glycogenic substance or glycogene). This

name involves the supposition that it is destined for the formation of sugar. It is
not quite fair in science to give names which point directly to one's own theory.'
As some of those who, like Dr. Pavy and myself, have investigated this subject

with a good deal of care, have still reason to doubt the sugar-forming theory as

regards this substance, we naturally prefer a name which does not involve this

Wesupposition.  wish it to be called animal starch or dextrine (amyloid substance
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 595

or zoo-ainyline). But, call it by what name we may, its discovery stands forth as
a great fundamental fact. It would be difficult to imagine a discovery more ex-

tended in its applications. In the course of his investigations on this subject,
Bernard showed the influence of diet, of digestion, of inanition upon this function

of the liver. He showed the influence of the nerves and nervous centres in rela-
tion to it. He made the important discovery of the production of diabetes artifi-
cially. He was led to discover a similar function as regards the formation of
amyloid substance on the placenta. He built up an entirely new theory of diabetes,

fundamentally changing the view hitherto held on this subject, and, in short, made
the whole held his own.

It is obvious to every one who allows himself calmly to reflect for a moment,

that no physician can be a good practitioner who does not know something of the

work done and the duties performed by the heart, or the stomach, or the lungs,

etc., in a healthy state.            Diseases  are  deviations                from  health                            to  understand  the
                                                                                                                   ;

one it is necessary to know something of the other. It must appear quite puerile,

therefore, to any thinking person, the assertion that the discovery of an important
new function in a great organ like the liver did not modify the practice of medicine
and throw new light on disease, not of the liver alone, but throughout the whole
myframe. You will pardon me, therefore, if I again express
                                                                                    doubts of the intelli-

gence or the honesty of those practitioners who treat contemptuously experimental

physiology and such work as has been achieved by men like Claude Bernard.

    Faust, in his great soliloquy, addressing the Sublime Spirit of good, says :--
« Thou didst not grant to me merely the cold gaze of open-mouthed astonishment.
Thou permittedst me to see into the depths of Nature as into the bosom of a

friend."

It has been the lot, no doubt, of a few among those whom I address, to have

exhibited to some of their friends the circulation of the blood, as seen through the

microscope, in the web of the frog's foot. They will have been struck, no doubt,

as I have been, by the effect which this spectacle, when witnessed for the first time,

has on different observers. Some look upon it much as they would upon a clever

conjuring trick. It is to them no more than a transformation scene on the stage
Howis to a child. "
                                     fast it goes," they say. They are astonished that anything

of the kind should go on in a frog. The cold unintelligent gaze of open-mouthed
wonderment is, perhaps, even too strong an expression for any emotion which stirs

them. Others there are who are struck dumb by the sight before them. One sees

at once that they have caught a glimpse of a boundless prospect--that they feel

it has been granted to them to see more deeply into the bosom of Nature than

they have ever done before. One perceives, to use again Goethe's words, that the

Sublime Spirit has not turned to them his countenance in vain.

There is an anecdote which I have dreamed of--as true, perhaps, as many such

anecdotes are, yet full of beauty--that when Malpighi first showed to the Pope,
whose friend and physician he was, this marvellous sight, his Holiness, having con-

templated it for some moments in silence, raised his hands and eyes to heaven,

repeating the " Te Deum," then, kneeling, thanked God for having permitted him

to live to see so impressive a sight. " Is it indeed true," he asked, " that this won-
drous movement goes on within me and you and all men ? " Being told that

doubtless it was so, " Mirantur aliqui," he "said, using the words of St. Augustin,
" altitudines montium, ingentes fluctus maris, altissimos lapsus fluminum et° gyros

siderum :--relinquunt seipsos nee mirantur ! " Apparently, Pope Innocent XI.
viewed with less jealousy and suspicion than many ecclesiastics are wont to do,

those divine writings traced on the face of Nature (too little studied by the theo-

logian), the interpretation and decipherment of which is the province and the plea-

sure of the man of science.

I have been led to this reflection, as it appears to me to explain the difference

between various individuals when contemplating some new disclosure in natural

science                              it illustrates the fashion in which the  discovery to which I next                   allude      is

Aviewed by different classes of minds.              small filament of nerve, no thicker than a

more blood. This same small filament of nerve is galvanized, and the reversal of
the above phenomena is found to take place. To some this observation is not only ·
a mere meaningless juggler's trick, but a cruel one. To others it is a key which

--opens a chamber full of treasures. It is like a newly-discovered isthmus or bridge

uniting two vast continents that of the circulatory system with that of the ner-

vous system. In this controlling power of the nerves over the calibre of the blood
vessels lies the explanation of many of the most interesting phenomena which go on

within us. The burning flush of shame, the cheek blanched with fear, the sudden
activity of glandular secretion, as when an emotion of the mind causes tears to

flow, or salt placed on the tongue causes the secretion of saliva. The activity of

the brain in our waking moments, its death-like inactivity during sleep, the regula-

tion of our temperature, etc., are, within the limits of health, phenomena connected

with this controlling power of the sympathetic nervous system. Within the

domain of disease, its applications are without end or number ; from the sympa-

thetic and often painful swelling of the milk glands (hardly to be regarded as a

morbid action) to the condition of the blood-vessels of the brain which causes the

dreaded convulsive seizure of epilepsy, this dominion of the sympathetic nervous

system over the blood-vessels has a meaning and a practical importance.

It would be unjust to others to say that Claude Bernard was the sole discoverer

of this vasomotor nervous system, as it is called. It would be equally unjust to

his memory not to admit that his researches had a large share in this discovery.
Pourfour du Petit and Dupuy had no doubt, long since divided the cord of the

Teat sympathetic nerve in .the neck, and noticed some of its consequences. But

the real discovery of the vasomotor nervous system was reserved for our time.

The illustrious physiologist (Dr. Brown-Sequard) who now fills the chair in the

College de France, rendered famous by such predecessors as Bernard, Magendie,

and Laennec, has no small share in this discovery, and, as regards its application

to the explanation of the phenomena of disease, and its treatment, has accom-
Weplished more than any of his predecessors.
                                              owe to Bernard the discovery of

the principal results due to division of the cervical portion of the sympathetic

nerve ; assuredly the discovery is one in which experimental physiology has reason
to triumph, for it must be regarded as one of the most valuable disclosures of

modern science. It cements together the vast number of isolated facts which,

since the days of Prochaska and Robert Whytt, have been accumulating upon the

hands of physiologists, but which, in the length and breadth of their importance,

even Marshall Hall himself did not appreciate. But let us turn to the other half
of this experiment ; let me remind you that Dr. Brown-Sequard in America, Pro-

fessor Claude Bernard in Paris, and Dr. Augustus Waller in England, almost

simultaneously observed that galvanization of the divided sympathetic is followed

--by a reversal of all the phenomena which have been already noticed to follow its

division the vessels contract, heat diminishes, secretion is checked. These experi-

ments are illustrative of the influence of the nervous system over the vascular.

They have formed the basis of physiological theories very widely differing from

each other, and perhaps less striking but not less valuable experiments bearing on

the same subject. The muscular tunic of the vessels which ramify through the

body places them under the control of the nervous system as completely as is
the heart itself. As the muscular structure of the heart, so the muscular structure

of the vessels is subject to emotional and reflex influences. It is not only the

blood-vessels of the cheeks which blush. The greater development of the muscular

tunic in the vessels of glands and of the brain, shows that in those situations the

arrangements for controlling the blood supply are even more complete than else-

where. It is true that it has long been known that intimate relations exist between

organs more or less remote from each other. The term sympathy has long been in

use, and equally applied to the healthy functional activity as to the pathological

disturbances of organs distinct from each other. In the eyes of the practitioner,

the morbid sympathies (or reflex disturbances), such as occur in teething children,

or, later in life, from irritation of the gastro-intestinal or genito-urinary systems,

etc., have naturally eclipsed in interest the normal physiological sympathies, such

as that between the uterus and mammary gland, the mucous membrane of the

tongue and the salivary glands, etc. But be it remembered that they are closely

Mildred phenomena, similar in mechanism, and, in fact, often passing into each
other so gradually that it is impossible to say where the normal terminates and the
morbid begins. It is hardly possible to conceive any kind of research which bears

more closely than these upon the various maladies that flesh is heir to.
     Some hard-hearted individuals, however, in these countries, confounding their

own selfish feelings with true humanity, who, I would venture to say, have rarely

spent days or nights of their lives watching at the bedside of real suffering,

                                                         " Who live

                         In mere mock knowledge of their fellow's woe,
                        Thinking their smiles may heal it,"

who fancy themselves too humane to seek a remedy for human agony in an experi-

ment which it would be painful to themselves to conduct-- such persons have

heaped much obloquy on the name of Bernard. Let me pass by these in sileuce.

There are others who, admitting the greatness of his achievements and his power
of kindling an enthusiasm for research among his pupils, think that these same

results might have been attained by a less amount of repetition of experiment.

Them I would truly respect. Most earnestly would I urge those physiologists who,

either as original inqmrers or as teachers, may follow in the footsteps of Claude

Bernard, while they admire him as a sincere, zealous, patient searcher after truth,

to imitate him in that, and avoid what they believe to have been his errors.

Bernard's discoveries, in truth, tell but a small part of the tale of all that he

accomplished during his lifetime. He was one of those truly great teachers who

exercise a great and expanding influence over the miuds of their pupils. He pos-

Asessed a gentle, mild, and thoroughly infectious enthusiasm.  conscientious worker,

a sincere lover of truth, a marvellously dexterous experimenter, he possessed the

power of expressing himself with great precision and great simplicity. His pupils

in every part of the civilized world will indeed account him as one

" Of those immortal dead who live again
 In minds made better by their presence : live

  In pulses stirred to generosity,
  In deeds of daring rectitude, in scorn
  For miserable aims that end with self,
  In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars,
  And, with their mild persistence, urge man's search
  To vaster issues."

     1. Observations on some Points in the Osteology of an Infantile Gorilla

              Skeleton. By Allen Thomson, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S.

     Dr. Allen Thomson exhibited the skeleton of an infantile female Gorilla, which
be had prepared from a specimen sent him some time ago, and which is now placed
in the Hunterian Museum of Glasgow University.

     The first dentition had been recently completed, and the age of the animal was
estimated to be from eighteen months to two years. It had been shot through the
head and had sustained a fracture of the thigh, but had lived long enough after the
injuries to allow a healing process to be set up round the two apertures by which
the lead pellet had passed through the opposite parietal bones of the cranium, and

the fractured femur to be reunited by bone.
      The author reserved for another opportunity the fuller account of the state of

 ossification of the bones of the skeleton, and limited his remarks for the present to
 several points in the osteology of the skull, vertebral column, ribs, and sternum.

      In instituting a comparison between the skull of the infantile gorilla and that of
 the adult or of other animals, the author pointed out the importance of adopting a
 reliable standard position in which the skulls submitted to observation should be
 placed so as to secure uniform results; and, following Professor Flower, gave
 the preference to that recommended by Broca, in which the horizontal plane of
 the skull is made to coincide with that of the visual or orbital axes ; and he showed,
,598                           --eeport 1878.

by reference to drawings of the young and adult gorilla skulls, and those of other

animals and of man, the necessity and advantages of such a standard in enabling the
observer to make accurate corresponding representations and measurements of di-

mensions and directions. The resemblance of the view taken in the norma facialis
of the infantile gorilla to the human skull was very striking.

In its general form this skull, as belonging to the infantile age, like that of its

congeners and of man, differs remarkably from that of the adult ; and in the case of
the gorilla and orang, more particularly of the male, in the proportionally large size

of the cranial part, the smaller size of the face, jaws and teeth, and in the entire

absence of the crests of bone which attain such an enormous size in the adult male

gorilla. In the infantile condition there is probably little or no difference in the

form  of  the  skull  in  the  two sexes                                        but  as  age  advances,  and  more  especially  as  the
                                                                             ;

second dentition appears, the distinctions arise by the greater development of the

jaws and by the gradual approach and elevation of the temporal ridges, which remain

distinct in the female, but rise into the sagittal and occipital crests of the male. In
the skull shown there was as yet no appearance of the temporal lines, except in the
commencement at the zygomatic process of the frontal bone. The double ridges on

each side described by recent authors come to be obvious only at the change of the

dentition.

      For comparison with the human form the skull of a child of about two and a

half years of age with the first dentition recently completed was employed, and

many points of [interest were brought out. Among these the capacity of the cra-
nium may be mentioned. 'That of the child's skull now referred to was 64 cubic

inches, that of the infantile gorilla 28|, while the average adult human skull may be

stated at 85 cubic inches, and that of the adult male gorilla at 33, and of the female

at 28 cubic inches.

      The author then referred more particularly to a point in the osteology of the

skull which had excited considerable interest since the researches of Virchow and

Gruber had thrown some light upon it, viz. the mode of union of the several bones

which meet at the antero-lateral fontanelle of the foetal skull, or the ptereon of Broca.

It is now known that considerable differences in this respect occur in the human

skulls of the same and different races of men, and it has long been known (Owen)
that among the anthropoid apes there are differences of a similar kind, and that

these differences are in some instances at least connected with the existence of a

separate bone in the seat of the place of meeting at the ptereon, of the frontal,

parietal, squamous, and alisphenoid bones, to which the name of epipteric has been

given by Professor Flower.

      In the great majority of human skulls, as well known to anatomists, the anterior

inferior angle of the parietal bone joins here the alisphenoid in a greater or less ex-

tent,* and thus excludes the frontal and squamous bones from mutual union ; while
in a smaller number of instances the alisphenoid and parietal are separated by the

junction of the squamous and frontal bones.

      Now, in the gorilla, as shown in the skull exhibited, and in nine other skulls of

the same animal examined by the author, the mode of union at the ptereon is in-

variably squamo-frontal. In the chimpanzee he found the same land of union to

prevail as in the gorilla in 23 out of 27 skulls examined ; but in two examples the
union was spheno-parietal on both sides, and in two others it was squamo-frontal on

one side and spheno-parietal on the other.

      In the orang, again, a greater difference was observed, for out of 30 skulls

observed, the spheno-parietal union was present on both sides in 16, and the squamo-
frontal in 7, while in 4 the mode of union was different on the two sides, and in 3

there existed the intervening epipteric bones, occupying as it were the common

territory.

      In 9 skulls of the Gibbon examined, 8 presented the spheno-parietal mode of

union, and in the other case there was unilateral squamo-frontal union with an

epipteric bone on the opposite side.

    * The author referred here to the differences observed in tlte human skull, but
as he is engaged in unfinished observations on this subject, he reserves their de-

scription for another opportunity
--TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND THYSIOLOGY. 599

The author had made a considerable number of observations in different genera

of Simiae and Prosimiae, from which it appeared that in the whole of the American

monkeys examined without exception, amounting to 40 specimens from the genera

Mycetes, Ateles, Oebus, Pithecia, Nyctipithecus, Callithrix, and Hapale, the union

at the ptereon was spheno-parietal ; and the same was found to be the case in the

18 skulls observed of Lemur, Galago, Loris, and Oheiromys.

In 96 skulls observed belonging to monkeys of the Old World, considerable variety

was found. In 23 of Macacus, 1 Colobus, and 8 Cercocebus, all had squamo-frontal

union                               of 33 baboons, the same                                            kind  of  union      existed in 29, in  1 double and in 1
                                 ;

xmilateral spheno-parietal union was observed, and in 3 cases epipteric bones were

present. In 10 skulls of Semnopithecus observed, 9 had spheno-parietal and one

squamo-frontal union                                                                                   and in 20 skulls of  Cercopithecus  there was spheno-parietal
                                                                                                    ;

union in 10 and squaino-frontal in 7 on both sides, and unilateral union of the two

different kinds in 3.

The author left for future consideration the causes determining these varieties,

more especially as connected with the origin and mode of ossification of the

epipteric bone                                                                    but he showed        the  probability     of  a  number  of  the varieties being
                                                                               ;

attributable to the existence of such an intermediate bone at an early period, and to

its union with one or other of the bones surrounding the ptereon. This union

might be with alisphenoid, parietal, or squamous, but very rarely with the frontal

bone. The author considers it doubtful that the epipteric is homologous with the

posterior frontal, first described by Serres, afterwards by Rambaut and Renault,

and more recently by Von Ihering (1872), but believed that the further explanation
of the differences shown to exist in the mode of union of the bones at the ptereon

is to be sought for with success in the histoiy of their development, upon which he

expected some light to be thrown by observations in which he was engaged.

Dr. Thomson also directed the attention of the section to some peculiarities in

the mode of ossification of the bones of the trunk in the young gorilla, which he

connected with the very frequent varieties observed in the adult condition of these

--and other anthropoid apes.
     These observations referred 1st, to the condition of the sternum as regards the

relative size of the presternum and mesosternum, and the number and place of im-

plantation of the costal cartilages into the sternum; 2nd, to the number of vertebral

ribs, and the occasional development of additional ribs upon the lumbar vertebrae
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and 3rd, to the variations in the relative number and state of development of the

lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal vertebras in the four genera of anthropoid apes.

The author reserved to another occasion the fuller description of these observa-

tions, which were still incomplete.

2. The Intrinsic Muscles of the Mammalian Foot. By D. J. Cunningham,

     M.D., F.E.8.E., Ser.ior Demonstrator of Anatomy, University of Edin-

      burgh.

     The typical arrangement of the intrinsic muscles of the pes is the same as in the
manus, and this arrangement is seen to best advantage in the feet of certain of the
marsupialia. In these animals the muscles are laid down in three layers, viz. :

   A(1) plantar layer of adductors.
   A(2) dorsal layer of abductors.

    An(3) intermediate layer of flexores breves.

   --According to this disposition each digit is furnished with three muscles one

from each layer.

    Deviations from the typical arrangement may take place by suppression or

fusion of certain of the elements of the different layers. Fusion of the constituents

of the intermediate and dorsal layers is extremely common, whilst fusion of the
intermediate and plantar muscles is a very rare occurrence.

     But this disposition of the intrinsic foot muscles does not account for the pre-
sence of an opponens muscle. This muscle may proceed from one of two sources.
Most commonly it is a development from the flexor brevis, and is thus associated
--600 report 1878.

with the intermediate layer of muscles (e.g. man, lemurs, phalanging marsupials).

It may be derived, however, from the plantar layer, and thus be associated with the

adductors (e.g. lion, dog, leopard, puma, otter, and other digitigrade carnivora).

    Lastly, in many adult animals, the relation of the intrinsic muscles to the

metatarsus, both as regards their origin and position, corresponds with transitory

conditions in the foot of the human embryo.*

  3. On the Gill Skeleton of Selache Maxima. By A. Macalistek. M.J).

     The author directed the attention of the section to a fine specimen of the gill
skeleton of this shark in the Museum of the University. The remarkable dentinal
gill-rakers are preserved in situ, and the different portions of the cartilages of the
palato-pterygoid, hyoid, and branchial arches are shown united. These are from a
large shark cast ashore last year at Kinsale, but, unfortunately, much mutilated
before it came into the hands of Mr. Cullen, the museum assistant of the Uni-

versity.

                           1. Phenomena of Binaural Audition.*
                 By Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, D.Sc, B.A.

      This paper resumed an investigation on which the author had read a paper in Sec-
 tion A, the preceding year. The following points summarize the communication

      (a) There is an interference of the perception of sound : for the tones of two
 tuning-forks or other simple tones, differing slightly in pitch, and capable of inter-
 fering, are still heard to .interfere when conducted separately to the two ears.

     (b) When two simple tones in unison reach the ears in opposite phases, the

 sensation of sound is localised at the hack of the head instead of in the ears. This

 and the preceding phenomenon are easily experimented upon with Graham Bell's

 telephones, or with indiarubber tubes to bring the sounds to the ears.
      (c) This localisation of an objective acoustic " image " is independent of the

pitch of the sounds.

     When(d) the difference of phase is partial, the sensation is localised partly in

the ears, partly at the back of the head.
      (e) If the difference of phase be complete, and the intensities unequal, the

acoustic " image," instead of being at the middle of the back of the head, is nearer
to that ear in which the sound is louder.

      (f) It is possible to discern the difference between two compound tones which
differ only in phase but not in pitch, or in intensity of their component partial tones
for when two such compound tones are brought to the ears so that the vibrations of
any partial tone present reach the ear in opposite phases, that particular partial tone
is singled out and localised at the back of the head.

    (g) When two simple tones are led singly to the two ears no differential tone is

heard. There is some evidence that summational tones are heard.
     (h) To binaural audition dissonances are excessively disagreeable, and ordinary

consonances harsh.
      (i) Vibrations mechanically conveyed to a point of the parietal or occipital

regions of the skull at one side of the median line are apparently heard in the ear

of the other side of the head.

 2. On the Theory -of Muscular Contraction. By G. F. Fitzgerald, M.A.

     Assuming a muscle to consist of fibriles averaging g^th of a centimetre in dia-

meter, and that they may be treated as a system of elongated cylinders of fluid

with a superficial tension capable of variation by the action of nervous stimuli in
accordance with M. Lippmann's experiments on the relations of electrical difference

of potential to the superficial tension of fluids, it may be shown that a force of

4 kilogrammes per square centimetre might be produced, which approximates to the

observed maximum contractile force. The striations in striated fibre are accounted

for by the instability of uniform fluid cylinders, the necessity for a continual
stimulus to keep up a given contraction by the constant repair going on in living
muscle, and the heating of a muscle when it contracts, is completely explained by
the fact that all fluid surfaces heat when they are allowed to contract under the

action of their superficial tension.

       1. On the Excretion of Nitrogen. Part II. By the Skin.
                               By J. Byrne Power.

I have already published a paper upon the renal excretion of nitrogen. Since

then I have made some experiments on the cutaneous excretion of nitrogen, the

results of which, and the modus operandi, I beg to lay before this Association for

the first time. I may mention that I was induced to undertake these as well as

my former researches with a view to the study of the physiological action of the

hot-air bath, which I have found personally beneficial, in the hopes of establishing

its utility on a scientific basis. In considering the action of prolonged sweating

the question most practically important is, can the skin be made to act vicariously

of the other organs of excretion, and, if so, to what extent ? I believe that the

generally received opinion is that the skin can be made so to act ; and how far such

opinion is warranted by experiment I hope in this paper to show more clearly than

has hitherto been done. At present I confine myself to the cutaneous excretion of

nitrogen, an element the excretion or retention of which in the system is a ques-

tion of supreme importance, physiologically and pathologically. Without here

attempting to quote the numerous authorities, I may shortly state what I consider

to be the present position of this important question. Funke, by the results of his

experiments upon himself and his two pupils published in 1853, not only verified

those of Anselmino, Berzelius, Favre, and others as to the existence of nitrogen in

the sweat, but proved its existence as urea, and was the only person, as I believe,
who ever succeeded in making an estimation of the total quantity of nitrogen ex-

creted by the skin in a given time until I attempted it myself. On the other hand,

-- --many experimenters Voit, Ranke, Parkes, and others have denied the existence

of nitrogen in the sweat. They arrive at this conclusion inferentially, finding that

the amount of nitrogen excreted by the kidneys and bowels was equal, and in some

cases even exceeded, the quantity ingested, therefore leaving no room for any

--excretion by the skin. The most recent English authority on the point the late

eminent Professor Parkes, in the Croonian Lectures delivered by him before the

--College of Physicians in London, in 1871 after reviewing most of the authorities,
--thus concludes : " Ou the whole, there appears to be little doubt that, apart from

detached skin structures, the balance of evidence is against the passage of nitro-

genous substances by the human skin." I do not think that the form of negative

proof advanced by these authorities can stand before the positive results of those

who obtain nitrogen in some form or other as a constituent of the fluid portion of

the sweat. With regard to Funke, I consider that his estimation of the excretion

--of nitrogen per diem amoimting to as much as from 4- 76 to 7 -045 grammes

is excessive. He arrives at these results by multiplying the quantity obtained in an

hour by 24, necessarily assuming the constancy of the sweat secretion, which

assumption is contradictory to the statement made in another part of his paper, to
the effect that " in one or two hours the quantity of the supply begins to diminish,

even though the temperature and movements remain unaltered, and falls to such a

minimum that one can scarcely perceive the increase even during greater intervals

of time." Funke obtained the sweat from the arm only, and, having ascertained

by measurement a ratio between its superficies and that of the whole body, he thus

estimated the entire cutaneous excretion. His experiments were made under con-

ditions of more or less violent exercise. I made mine on the body in a state of

rest in the hot-air bath, considering results thus obtained more referable to con-

myditions of disease. I shall now, without dwelling on  many failures, briefly

state the mode of collecting the excretion which I finally adopted as being the
--TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DEPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 60S

best. Having first tested the atmosphere of the ward in which I was about to

operate to ascertain that it did not contain free ammonia in any quantity, I placed

upon one of my hospital beds an indiarubber sheet, and over it another sheet of

pure linen, upon which the person to be experimented upon lay. Over his body

was placed a wooden cradle or canopy, covered outside with a thick felt, and lined

inside with linen, which coverings were to be carefully adjusted round his neck. To

raise the temperature with the canopy I used the lamp-furnace invented by the

late Surgeon-Major Wyatt, the flame from which fitted accurately through a hole

in the coverings guarded by a wooden ring. Considering the spirit-lamp of

Wyatt's furnace objectionable for many reasons, I substituted a Bunsen gas-burner.

To insure the regular renewal of the air within the canopy, and to prevent its

saturation, as well as to collect any free ammonia which might be evolved, I intro-

duced a tube leading from a Bunsen air-pump, which tube was connected with two

glass towers filled with large beads and charged with half an ounce of dilute

hydrochloric acid of known strength. Through another hole in the canopy I

introduced a Daniel's hygrometer, by which I was enabled to observe the tempera-

ture and calculate the degree of saturation of the atmosphere within. As the gas,

water, and re-agents employed  contained  some  small  portion of  mynitrogen,  first

task was to ascertain the constant error arising from this source. To effect this I

performed three blank experiments, omitting only the introduction of the person

to be experimented upon. The result was that I obtained a small quantity of

nitrogen nearly equal in each case and having a mean value of '063 grammes,

that being the total amount collected in one hour under the experimental con-

ditions. The water I used was Vartry water, and when I used it unfiltered

I employed the above number as a constant. As it would be necessary to

use filtered water in order to eliminate epithelium, I made three similar blank

experiments, using filtered Vartry water, and obtained another constant amount-

ing to -0408 grarnme of nitrogen, which I used in all experiments on filtered

water. The method employed for estimating the nitrogen was that to be described

hereafter. I commenced a series of experiments upon myself, with the assistance of

my clinical clerk, Mr. Clune. One of these I shall now describe. I first took a

sponge bath for the purpose of removing loose epithelial scab s, as well as minute

fibres from the under-clothing, which I always found adhering to the skin, and

having noted my pulse, respiration, bodily weight, and temperature, I entered under
the canopy. The coverings being carefully adjusted round my neck, the gas-furnace

was lighted, the air-pump and hygrometer adjusted, and the experiment continued

for an hour or an hour and a half, the time being carefully noted. Before leaving

the canopy the pulse, respiration, and bodily temperature were again noted, also the

mean temperature and. point of saturation of the atmosphere within the canopy.
On leaving the canopy I got into a bath containing 20 litres of Vartry water acidu-

lated with an ounce of the dilute hydrochloric acid of known strength. I took with
me into this bath the linen sheet upon which I had lain whilst under the canopy,

and with it I gently rubbed myself so as to remove any loose epithelial scales. On

leaving the bath I again weighed myself, and in twenty minutes after I again noted

my pulse, respiration, and bodily temperature. I caused the linen and india-rubber

sheets, as well as the towels containing the dilute hydrochloric acid, to be washed in

the water of the bath, and then brought a specimen of it to my laboratory for analysis.

--The process of analysis of this water which I employed was briefly as follows :

carefully measured 100 c.c, and poured it into a partial-distillation flask, which

I altered to suit my purposes by shortening and bending the side tube upwards

towards the mouth. I now took a porcelain dish, in which I placed a small quantity

of pure sand carefully cleansed with hydrochloric acid, and subsequent washing

with distilled water, and moistened it with a drop of strong sulphuric acid. Hav-

ing placed the dish upon a water-bath, I inverted the flask into it, and, properly

suspending it, carefully evaporated the water as it gradually flowed into the dish
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

1 then removed the sand from the dish, and, mixing it with soda-lime, placed it in

a small combustion tube, and proceeded to estimate the quantity of nitrogen con-

tained in the 100 c.c. in the manner referred to in my former paper. Hence I

calculated the quantity contained in the 20 litres, and from this quantity I deducted

my constant, thus ascertaining the total quantity of nitrogen excreted by the skin

during the experiment. I have described an experiment in detail, as all the others
604 REPORT 1878.

were conducted in a similar manner, except when I filtered in order to get rid of

epithelium, a circumstance noted in my tabular statement of results, in which case,
of course I employed the constant for filtered water. I may here note that I ex-

amined the deposit from the water of the bath under the microscope, and found it

myto contain scarcely a trace of anything but epithelial scales. On comparing

experiments with those of Funke, we find that the quantities of nitrogen obtained
by Funke are much greater than mine. This difference may arise from the circum-

stance noted already, that Funke's experiments were conducted under the con-
ditions of more or less violent exercise, which I, accepting the views of Liebig, so
strongly supported by the recent experiments of Professor Flint on the pedestrian
Mr. Weston, believe to be always accompanied by waste of muscular tissue, and

consequent increased execretion of nitrogen. I am aware that this view has been

controverted by the experiments of several eminent physiologists, but I believe that

my work tends somewhat to confirm it, though indirectly. I believe that the cutaneous
excretion of nitrogen in normal healthy conditions is but small. But in my table

will be found the results obtained from a patient suffering from Bright's disease
(marked [c]), showing an excretion of nitrogen more than double the average

amount in my own case (marked [«]). I note that in case [6] the renal excretion

of nitrogen was considerable, increased by the use of the hot-air bath, a result I
conceive of great importance, due, I believe, to the temporary febrile condition
induced by the bath, evidenced by the increased rate of pulse and bodily tempera-
ture. I have since found this view confirmed by the experiments of G. Von Schleich,
of Tiibingen, showing an increased excretion of urea caused by the use of the
ordinary hot-water bath. But I have not as yet had an opportunity of making

further researches, on this point. I have again to thank my friend Professor J.
Emerson Reynolds, under whose guidance my experiments were conducted, for his

valuable and kind assistance.

               Substances. By J. A. Wankltn and W. J. Cooper.

3. On the Aberrant Form of the Sacrum connected with Naegele's Obliquely
        Contracted Pelvis. By Allen Thomson, M.D., LL.D., F.B.S.

Dr. Allen Thomson exhibited a well-marked specimen of Naegele's obliquely-

contracted pelvis in a male adult, together with a series of eight sacrums present-

ing different forms and degrees of the abnormal development which is the most

frequent primary cause of the pelvic deformity first described by Naegele.

Naegele's first description of this deformity was published in 1834 (' Heidel-

berg. Klinisch. Annalen,' vol. x. No. 4, translated in the ' London Medical and

Surgical Journal/ vol. vii. No. 168), but he had already observed a case of it as

early as 1803, and others in 1813 and 1825. In 1850 Naegele published at
Maintz a separate and more extended memoir on the obliquely contracted

pelvis, and some other pelvic deformities, illustrated with full-sized representa-

tions, in which he showed that the oblique deformity in question is not confined

to one  sex, but occurs  iu the  male as well as in the female                                                                                                                                       though, of  course, its
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

presence in the female is more liable to arrest attention from its relation to diffi-

culties in parturition.

Although Naegele had not fully described the nature of the abnormal condition

of the sacrum which accompanies the pelvic deformity, yet he had figured that

condition clearly as it occurred in different instances on the right and on the left

side, and it may be inferred from his description and drawings that in the majority

of the cases the deformity was of the nature of a congenital malformation. Dr.

Edmund B. Sinclair, of Dublin, had the merit of detecting the existence of a

similar deformity during life in a case which he has described in the 'Dublin
Journal of Medical Science.' In this case Dr. Sinclair was inclined to attribute

' the origin of the obliquity to morbid degeneration in the vicinity of the sacro-

 iliac articulation, and he may have had sufficient reasons for doing so. But the
 specimens exhibited to the section by Dr. Thomson fully bear out the view recog-

nised by Rokitansky, that the deformity of oblique pelvis is very frequently if not

always of the nature of an aberrant kind or defect of development occurring in
the first sacral vertebra ; and Dr. Thomson's object was to show more clearly than

had previously been done the nature of this aberration.

    The most common form of the malformation may be described as one in which

the first sacral vertebra presents on one side all the usual characters which belong

--to it as a constituent part of the sacrum possessing, therefore, the large lateral

mass which enters into the formation of the upper pelvis, and articulates with the

ilium iu the auricular surface ; while upon the opposite side there is no sacro-iliac

junction, an entire absence of the lateral mass, and the first sacral vertebra pre-

sents in its transverse and articular processes, its intervertebral foramen, the

form of its body and arch, and in all other respects, the characters of a lower

lumbar vertebra. There is, therefore, half a sacral vertebra on one side and half

a lumbar vertebra on the other ; the detachment of the vertebral arch (laniinas and

processes), however, generally extending over to the sacral side.

The obliquity of form in the pelvis, and its consequences in other parts of

the vertebral column, are most directly the result of the unequal support given by
the sacro-iliac articulations of opposite sides. The author regards the liga-

mentous synostosis frequently found in these cases at the sacro-iliac articulation

on the abnormal side, not, as has been supposed by some, as a cause of the deformity,

but rather as a consequence of the greater strain thrown upon this joint by the

curvature following upon the shrunken condition of the first sacral vertebra, and

the absence of its connection with the ilium in the nonsymmetrical pelvis.

Of the eight specimens of sacrums exhibited, three presented the lumbar form

in the upper piece on the right side, and four on the left side, while one was nearly

symmetrical in form, but presented a partial retrogression, as it were, from the sacral

to the lumbar form on both sides very nearly in an equal degree.
606 report--1878.

    The specimens illustrated in an interesting way the different degrees in which

the transition between the sacral and lumbar vertebral form might occur ; and, in
connection with the examples of symmetrical form, led the author to remark upon
the vai'iations in the number of sacral and lumbar vertebrae which occur not un-

frequently both in man and animals, and, according to some observations which he
has made, very commonly among the anthropoid apes.

    With reference to this subject, the author held that the most common cause of
the occurrence of six component pieces in the human sacrum (more frequent in the

male than in the female) is the increased development and union of the first piece
of the coccyx with the fifth sacral vertebra, without there being any actual
increase in the whole number of vertebrae in these two portions of the verte-
bral] column. But he further held it to be pi'obable that in some instances,

though very rare, an addition may take place to the number of sacral vertebrae

by the conversion of the lowest lumbar vertebra into the sacral form ; thus
giving rise, in an instance in which there is the usual number of ribs and dorsal
vertebrae, to the existence of only four lumbar vertebrae.

     It is more certain that in instances of six lumbar vertebrae (with twelve

developed ribs and dorsal vertebrae), the sixth lumbar vertebra may be regarded

as a transformed sacral vertebra ; as in an example of this kind observed by the
author, the sixth lumbar vertebra showed a slight approach to the sacral characters,
while the normal number of five sacral and four coccygeal vertebral pieces was
still present, thus indicating distinctly the interpellation of an additional vertebra,
and the transference, as it were, of one from the coccygeal to the sacral series,
and of one from the sacral to the lumbar series.

     Dr. Thomson showed also an example of a sacrum of four pieces, and pointed
out that this might arise either from the conversion of the upper piece into the
lumbar form or from the detachment and retrogression of the lower vertebra into

the coccygeal form.

     At the suggestion of Professor Macalister, Dr. Thomson exhibited from the
Museum of Trinity College a skeleton of the wombat {Phascolomys) presenting

the same unilateral retrogression of the upper sacral vertebra into the lumbar
form which is the cause of the oblique pelvis in man, thus showing that the
abnormal form of development which had been described is not confined to the

human species.

4. Note on the Occurrence of a Sacral Dimple and its possible Significance.

                                By Lawson Tait, F.B.C.S.

The author had noticed casually amongst his hospital patients a curious pit-like

depression or dimple in the skin over the lowest bone of the sacrum, and his atten-

tion had been drawn to a case in which it was present in a marked degree in all

the children of a woman who had it. In one of these the pit was a centimetre in

depth, its apex adherent to the aponeurotic structures, and it expanded outwards

so that its mouth had a diameter of about 13 millimetres. Of the patients sub-

jected to examination (for other and special reasons) he found no trace of it in 55

per cent.                                            in 22 per  cent, it was  faintly marked ;  and  in  23  per  cent, it was  well
                                                  ;

Amarked.                                             double pit was noticed in about 6 per cent, of the cases. The average

age of its occurrence was slightly over thirty-two years, and the average age of

those in whom it was entirely absent was nearly forty-five years. In children aver-

aging about five years it was found entirely absent in only 26 per cent., and it was

well marked in 40-7 per cent, of the cases ; so that there is a manifest tendency for

it to disappear with age.

The author further described the appearances of a kitten which he had dissected,

and in which there had been a spina bifida in the lower sacral vertebrae ; all, the

vertebral elements below the seat of the malformation had been arrested in deve-

--lopment exactly as is found in the coccyges of those animals in which a tail has

been lost man, the Manx cat, the guinea-pig, &c. The nervous nutrition of the

posterior limbs had not been interfered with in any way.
 --TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D. DBPT. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. 607

    The author suggested that the origin of such a curious variety as the Manx cat
might have occurred in a sport of this kind, as such cases of spina bifida are known

to live to maturity ; and if it occurred in a male cat in a limited area like the Isle
of Man, the perpetuation of the alteration of structures would be favoured.

    He also suggested as a possibility that the pitting over the human sacrum, to

which he had drawn attention, might represent some such process by which the
tail which man undoubtedly had lost at some time or other in the history of his
development, had been suppressed.

       The following Tapers were read :

1. The Bate of Cardiac Hijp extrophy. By William H. Stone, M.A., F.B.C.P.

     It may be accepted as an axiom that every reduction of physiological or patho-
logical processes to known physical laws, even if only partially and approxi-

mately successful, is a step forward in science, and that if the whole disturbance of
Nature's equilibrium, from the excessive complexity of the functions involved, be
beyond our power of analysis, there is still some advantage and a gain to precise
observation in cutting off and putting on one side such portions as are susceptible
of accurate treatment. The predominance of vague, though necessary generaliza-
tions, such as that of vital action, is thereby materially diminished, and the direction

is more closely indicated in which future efforts at advance may most judiciously

be directed.

     Of all parts of the human organism, there is none, after the simple muscular and
bony framework, which belongs more distinctly to Physics than the apparatus of
circulation, and its central motor, the heart. This organ is obviously nothing more
than a double force-pump, furnished with two reservoirs and two pipes of outflow.
It is true that the valvular apparatus, which is also duplicated, is furnished with

complex muscular and tendinous appendages to regulate the tension and secure the
apposition of the occluding surfaces. But in the main the problem of its action is

hydrodynamical, and many valuable facts may be obtained by regarding it in a
mechanical point of view. The height to which this force-pump is called upon to

raise a o-iven volume of fluid is obviously measured by the height of the animal to
which it belongs, and even as early as 1769 Dr. Hales made experiments on horses,
which showed the height of the column of fluid sustained by the hearfs contraction,
as transmitted through the large arteries, to be in horses about 9-14- feet.

     Dr. Haughton, in his excellent and suggestive work on 'The Principles of
Animal Mechanics,' has most ingeniously utilized an accidental opportunity afforded
by an operation for computing the force when a large artery is divided in the
human subject, at a vertical column of 2-58 feet; that ascertained to exist in the

horse being 2-53 feet. It would, indeed, seem that the maximum hydrostatical force

is about the same in the two animals, and probably not far different in the sheep
and dog.

     Besides (1) the statical pressure of the column equal to the animal's height,
which has to be sustained, and (2) the force consumed in overcoming the inertia of
the blood-mass, an important element in the work to be done is (3) the resistance
offered by the capillary vessels to the flow of blood. There is reason to believe,
says Dr. Haughton, that in animals similar in bulk the arrangement and 'structure
of the capillaries are such that the ratio of the squares of their cross-sections to
their total length is practically constant. Supposing the co-efficient of capillary

resistance to be the same in the man as in the horse, we can calculate, on Dr.
Haughton's method, the hsemastatical pressure of blood in the human arteries.
The left ventricle has a capacity of about 3 ozs., or 5-2 cubic inches, and beats about

75 times per minute.

     There is a fourth element to be considered in estimating the heart's work, namely,

the friction of the machine itself. This, in a state of health, is kept at its minimum

by the beautiful contrivance of the smooth lubricated serous membrane of the
pericardium. It will be seen that in disease this condition may be completely

altered.

     It appears from Dr. Haughton's calculations, resulting from comparison of

several observations, that the average weight of the heart may be taken as
= 9-39 ozs.

     Dr. Peacock's laborious collection of weights, both in health and disease,* gives

a value not far distant from this : namely, " in persons from twenty to fifty-five years
of age it is, in males, 9 ozs. 8 drachins, and in females 8 ozs. 13 drachms." But in
disease this is entirely changed. The heart possesses a power of increasing its

muscidar force in proportion to any extra work that may be thrown upon it. In
extreme cases the hypertrophy thus caused may be very considerable. Even without
valvular disease of the organ a remarkable increase may occur, especially in persons

whose occupation subjects them to sudden muscular strain, accompanied by forcible
holding of the breath, as in the case of paviours working with their rammers. Dr.

Peacock records a case in which the heart weighed 40 ozs. 12 drachms, though

nothing, except some atheromatous change, was detected sufficient to explain the

hypertrophy. In this instance, however, no note was apparently obtained by which
the time during which the compensatory process had been going on coidd be

ascertained.

     The object of the present paper is to record briefly some cases in which one only
of the above-named causes of increased strain was at work ; and thus, by coupling
together increase of weight with a fairly accurate statement of the time which
had been occupied, to obtain an estimate of the rate at which the hypertrophic pro-

cess proceeds in each instance.

    These cases are four in number--
    1. Two of valvular disease of the aortic valve, arising from injury, without any

concomitant blood-disease (No. 2).

    2. One of adherent pericardium, dating from a known commencement, unac-

companied by valvular or blood-disease, and showing the hypertrophy due to simple

increase of friction in the propelling machine (No. 4).

3. One of congenital or very old atrophy of one kidney, increasing (3) the resist-

--Aance offered by the capillary circulation, without valvular or pericardial disorder.
Case 1.       robust man, aged 30, was kicked by a horse on the front of the

chest. The animal lashed out with both hind legs at once, and landed a hoof fairly

on either side of the sternum. This occurred on October 2nd, 1875. The man im-

mediately began to suffer from short breath and other signs of valvular disease of the
heart. In spite of this he managed to keep at his occupation of groom until February

2nd, 1876. On the 27th of the same month he died. On the following day the heart

was found to measure transversely 8^ inches, and in circumference 14 inches while
in situ. It weighed-29 ounces. The aorta was laid open in front and the condition
of its valves examined. On allowing a stream of water to run into the vessel, there
was free flow into the ventricle. On looking into the valves from above, a tri-
angular aperture was seen between the flaps, which appeared to be formed in the

following manner. The posterior and the right anterior segment acted well, and
were in contact along a great part of their adjacent borders. The left anterior seg-

ment, however, scarcely acted at all, its free border being widely separated from the

edges of the other segments, and · turning downwards towards the cavity of the
ventricle. Its edge was puckered and folded, as if an effort had been made to fold
it downwards. The whole of the segments were somewhat rigid and thickened,
free, however, from atheroma and vegetations.

     The mitral valve was healthy, and acted well.
     The aorta was not materially diseased.

All the other organs were healthy.

From the injury to the day of death, 147 days, or exactly 21 weeks, had

elapsed.
--ACase 2.
            dock-labourer, set. 36, also in St. Thomas's Hospital, had been sud-

denly attacked when pulling at a sugar hogshead. His hands slipped, struck him a

severe blow on the left side of the chest, and he fell backwards. He immediately

felt severe pain in the region of the heart, and in the evening his breathing became

difficult. He died 3£ months from the injury.

     The heart was found to be greatly enlarged, weighing 23 ounces. The left

angle of the posterior semilunar segment at the aortic orifice was found to be torn
from its attachment, so that it was quite loose, and readily admitted of retroversion,

allowing free regurgitation from the artery into the ventricle.
--ACase 3.
            French waiter, set. 20, came into St. Thomas's for acute rheumatism.

On January 12, 1878, he had a sudden attack of pericarditis, from which he had

been perfectly free before. This proceeded to total adhesion, and after leaving the

hospital for a time he returned and died on July 7, exactly 176 days, or twenty-
weeks and a day, from the commencement of the disease.

     All the valves of the heart and all other organs in the body were substantially
healthy. The pericardium was, however, firmly and universally adherent. The heart

--Aitself weighed 1$H ounces.
Case 4.     boy, 14 years of age, was admitted into St. Thomas's on August 22,

1876, suffering from obvious hypertrophy of the heart, but without evidence of val-

vular disease. I considered the case to be, like the last, one of adherent pericardium.

It was difficult to obtain any distinct history from so young a person but, from

information tendered by his relations, the following facts were established :

    He had been quite well until three months before admission. He then " caught

a severe cold," accompanied by cough, pain in the chest, short breath, and prostration.

When first seen he was pale, oedematous in the face, suffering much from spasmodic

cough. The heart was obviously enlarged, as was also the liver. The temperature
was 98° - 4. The urine of sp. gr. 1016, containing much albumen. This, however,

disappeared after a fortnight's rest, and never returned to any appreciable extent.

   A sphygmographic tracing of the pidse at the wrist, taken two months after his

admission, showed the remarkable fact that the heart's pulsation was entirely under
the command of respiration, so that when he held his breath, the tracing was

reduced to a faintly undulated line. On the other hand, when he coughed, a wave
of great force and extent was sent through the artery, somewhat resembling the
healthy pulse tracing. He had occasional slight haemoptysis and increased dyspnoea,
under which symptoms he sank on November 20, 1876. The pericardium was found

entirely free from adhesions, the heart weighing 19£ ounces, greatly hypertrophied,
but without any valvular lesion.

    The aorta and great vessels of the neck were extremely atheromatous, much

thickened in places, but quite pervious.
     The left kidney was atrophied, flattened, and of triangular shape, somewhat re-

sembling the suprarenal capsule. Its vessels and the ureter were normal and per-

vious, but the vessels were only about half the size of those on the right side.
     The arteries at the base of the brain were extremely atheromatous ; the atheroma

extending throughout their branches as far as the small vessels spreading over the

convexity of the hemispheres.

    On comparing the above cases, we obviously have three different causes, all of a

--physical character, but producing one and the same result namely, hypertrophy.

In the first two the permanent obstacle between the heart and the arterial system

was broken down, and the momentum of the blood column was thus permitted to

fall back upon the muscular structure itself, instead of being warded off by the re-

tentive tissue of the aortic valves.* The quantity propelled at each stroke can only
have been the difference between what was admitted through the mitral orifice and
what regurgitated through the partially patent aortic orifice. Besides this, there
must have been the constant backward pressure of arterial elasticity bearino- on the
cardiac walls, even during the period of rest in the circulatory cycle. In the third
case an impediment was caused to the action of the heart itself by additional friction

due to the destruction of its serous covering, and the additional mass of false mem-
brane as well as adjacent tissues, which it was thus compelled to keep in movement

at every contraction. In the fourth and last case, the only assignable cause for the
great enlargement must be the increase of what Dr. Haughton has named the

capillary coefficient. It here stands for the resistance, not of the capillary system
alone, but of the whole arterial network, from the aorta onwards, which is described
as highly rough and atheromatous. In the transparent structures on the surface of
the brain this condition could be seen to penetrate even into the smallest vessels,

and it may, therefore, be fairly assumed to have been universal. It has been shown
by Dr. Bright that disease of the kidneys, unconnected with valvular disease or

disease of the aorta, has a tendency to produce enlargement of the heart.. Dr.
Peacock proves this statistically by giving the proportion of enlarged hearts as

eleven out of eighteen cases examined. The smaller arterioles in cases of renal dis-
ease have also been demonstrated by Dr. Johnson to possess a largely increased
amount of muscular fibre. Whether the hypertrophy in this ca9e was originally
due to this cause, or went backwards to the insufficient renal excretory surface sup-
plied by the single healthy kidney, it is difficult to say. Placing the cases in a
tabular form :

                        THURSDAY, AUG VST 15, 1878.

     Professor Sir C. Wyville Thomson gave the following Address :

In doing me the honour to select rne to preside over this Section on the present

occasion, the Council of the British Association have doubtless had in view the part

which it has been my privilege to take in contributing to the physical description

of the earth, as director of the civilian scientific staff on board Pier Majesty's ship
Challenger. I will not, therefore, apologise for following the example of several of

my more immediate predecessors in leaving to others the subject of topographical

geography, of which I have never made a special study, and directing your atten-

tion for the short time at my disposal to advances which have been made of late

years in certain directions in the application of the physical and natural sciences
to the illustration of the general condition of the earth.

     Before doing so, however, I must refer to the great geographical event of the

--year which has passed since the geographical section of the British Association last

met the return of the African explorer, Henry Moreland Stanley. As the graphic
account which Mr. Stanley has given of his journey " through the dark continent
is in all our hands, and as we may hope to have an opportunity during this meeting

of hearing something further of his adventures from the great traveller himself, it

will not be necessary for me at present to enter into any details either with regard

to the course taken by his expedition or to the brilliant results which it has
achieved. It is, however, incumbent upon us in this place to acknowledge once
more the flood of light which Stanley has thrown upon the geography of Central
Africa, and to express our wondering admiration of the iron will and the daring
intrepidity which carried him through these long years of labour and difficulty and

danger. Although, in reading Stanley's narrative, we may be forced to regret some
of the dark scenes by which his terrible march was chequered, still no one who has
not himself had some dealings with savages can fully understand how entirely the

action of a leader, solely responsible for the lives of his party, must be guided in
every emergency by considerations which he alone is in a position to weigh.

      During the last few years, a factor, so altered in its proportions that it has
appeared almost new, has entered into the calculations of the naval executive
departments of all the maritime powers ; and in harmony with the rapid advance

of natural knowledge and the widening recognition of its practical value, many

opportunities, hitherto too often lost, have been taken advantage of. Latterly
almost all special expeditions, whether despatched avowedly with the object of
extending the boundaries of science, or for hydrographic purposes, or for training
naval cadets, or for drilling the inmates of a penitentiary, or pioneering commercial
enterprise, as in the case of Captain Wiggins's late excursions to the mouth of the
Yenisei, have been supplied more or less fully with the means of scientific obser-

vation, and have been in many cases accompanied by observers trained in one

department or another of physical research.

I will simply name among many such equipped and instructed expeditions of

these later days, the splendid circumnavigating voyage of the Austrian frigate

Novara, under the command of Admiral von Wiillerstorf-Urbair (the report of

the scientific results of this expedition has been published by the Austrian Govern-

ment in eighteen beautifully illustrated volumes, and the completion of this work,

after seventeen years of heavy labour, was one of the scientific events of the year

1877) ; the voyage of the Italian corvette Magenta round the world, so well

chronicled by Professor Enrico Hillyer Giglioli; the very important sounding

voyages of Captain Belknap, in the American surveying ship Titscarora ; the Sassier

expedition, the last crowning effort with which the elder Agassiz closed a long and

brilliant career devoted to the study and illustration of nature, and the many

scientific explorations undertaken from year to year by the officers of the American

Coast Survey, with the co-operation of the younger Agassiz and Count Pourtales

the tentative cruises of the Britishgunboats Lightning and Porevjrine, culminating

in the Challenge!- expedition ; the scientific voyage round the world of the German

transit of Venus ; the German Arctic expedition, under Captain Koldewey ; the

several Swedish expeditions, so rich in zoological results, to the Spitzbergen Sea,

under the guidance of Otto Torell, Nordenskjbld, and others; the exhaustive

researches into the conditions, physical and biological, of the North Sea by the North

Sea Commission, under the direction of Dr. H. A. Meyer ; the voyage of the

Tegethoff, which Lieutenant Payer has rendered ever memorable by his thrilling

story of disaster, success, and heroism ; the Arctic voyage of the Alert and the

Discovery, of which Sir George Nares has just published the semi-official narrative,

a simple and charming account of almost superhuman effort and insuperable ob-

struction, which it is impossible to read without a feeling of regret that the devoted

little band had attempted what was so hopeless, and at the same time a conviction

that if their task had been practicable by human skill and bravery, it must certainly

have been accomplished. But although this expedition of necessity failed in its

main object, that of reaching the Pole, the additional information which we gain

from Captain Nares's volume and from the more popular sketch of the voyage by
Captain Markham on the physical condition of the Arctic Sea, is in the highest

degree valuable. I must also mention the very important cruises in connection

with the Norwegian Department of Fisheries, which, through the skilled labours

of Professor Mohn and Professor G. 0. Sars, annually contribute largely to our

knowledge of the distribution of temperature, of the course of the ocean currents,

and of the range of animal life in the North Atlantic. I observe in a letter from

Professor Mohn, dated from Hammerfest on the 10th of last month, that the

expedition of the past year has had a successful cruise to Bear Island, where it

has left letters for the Dutch Arctic schooner, the Willem Barentz, and has made
many important temperature observations. Professor Mohn speaks highly of the

service rendered by Negretti and Zambra's new reversing thermometer. This is a

most ingenious instrument, so constructed that by a simple mechanical arrangement

the temperature may be registered at any given depth, irrespective of any number

of zones of temperature, higher or lower, through which the instrument may have

passed in descending. In the Challenger we felt greatly the want of such a ther-

mometer, for although generally throughout the ocean the temperature of the water

--falls steadily from a surface maximum to a minimum at the bottom, in the Arctic

and Antartic seas where a special interest attaches to the vertical distribution

of temperatures--the coldest layer is frequently, as in Professor Mohu's observa-

tions, on the surface ; and a warmer belt intervenes between it and a bottom-
stratum, probably, in many cases, of intermediate temperature. With the ordinary

deep-sea registering thermometer, the temperature of the lowest layer cannot be

Weascertained with certainty.                                    had Negretti and Zambra's earlier instrument on

the reversing principle on board during the latter part of our cruise, but through

some defect in construction we did not find its indications trustworthy for great

depths. I always believed the plan of construction of this instrument to be good,.

and I am very glad to find from Professor Mohn's report that this defect has now

been entirely overcome.

It follows from the nature of these many and varied enterprises that the

department of geographical science to whose progress they have most specially

contributed, is the physical geography of the sea ; and the special appliances with

which they have been provided have been principally instruments for determining

the temperature of the water at different depths, the depth of the sea and tbe

nature of the sea-bottom, and, in some few cases, the distribution of the deep-sea

fauna. It is of course impossible for me in so short a time even to sketch their

several lines of investigation, or to attempt to assign to each its share in the general

advance of  knowledge                                                                                      I think it  may be  better that I should  give an  outline  of

some of the conditions of tbe regions to which they refer by the light of their

combined results. I am aware that in taking this course I shall be forced to face

questions ou which there has been some controversy ; and I can only say that I

will avoid the controversial aspects of such questions as far as possible, and merely

--describe as shortly as I can the condition of things as they appear to me.
     The General Ocean Circulation. It was pointed out long ago by Sir Charles
Lyell that many of the most marked phenomena of the present physical condition

of the globe depend upon the fact that the surface of the world is divided into two

hemispheres, one of which contains nearly the whole of the dry land of this world,

while the other is almost entirely covered by water. The centre of the land-

hemisphere is somewhere in Great Britain, and the centre of the water-hemisphere,

which includes the southern sea, the South Pacific, whatever antarctic land there

may be, Australia, and the southern point of South America, is in the neighbour-
hood of New Zealand. With a full knowledge of the absolute continuity of the

ocean, we have hitherto been too much in the habit of regarding it as composed of

several oceans, each possibly under special physical conditions. All recent obser-

vations have, however, shown us that the vast expanse of water which has its

centre in the southern hemisphere, is the one great ocean of the world, of which

the Atlantic, with the Arctic Sea and the North Pacific, are merely northward

extending gidfs                                                                         and that any physical          phenomena affecting obviously one portion
                                                                                     ;

of its area must be regarded as one of an interdependent system of phenomena

affecting the ocean as a whole.

  --Shallow as the stratum of water forming the ocean is--a mere film in propor-

tion to the radius of the earth it is very definitely split up into two layers, which,

so far as all questions concerning ocean movements and the distribution of tem-

perature is concerned, are under very different conditions. At a depth varying

in different parts of the world, but averaging perhaps 500 fathoms, we arrive at a

layer of water at a temperature of 40° F., and this may be regarded as a kind of

neutral band separating the two layers. Above this band, the temperature varies

greatly oyer different areas, the isothermobathic lines being sometimes tolerably

equally distributed, and at other times crowding together towards the surface;
while beneath it, the temperature almost universally sinks very slowly and with in-

creasing slowness to a minimum at the bottom.
     The causes of natural phenomena, such as the movements of great masses of

water, or the existence over large areas of abnormal temperature conditions, are

always more or less complex, but in almost all cases one cause appears to be so

yery much the most efficient that in taking a general view all others may be prac-

tically disregarded                                                                                        and speaking in this sense it may be said that the trade-winds
                                                                                                        ;

and their modifications and counter-currents are the "cause of all movements in the

stratum of the ocean above the neutral layer. This system of horizontal circula-

tion, although so enormously important in its influences upon the distribution of

climate, is sufficiently simple. Disregarding minor details, tbe great equatorial

current driven from east to west across the northerly extensions of the ocean by

Athe trade-winds, impinges upon the eastern coasts of the continents.                                                                                         branch

turns northwards and circles round the closed end of tbe Pacific, tending to curl

back to the North American coast from its excess of initial velocity ; and in the

Atlantic, following a corresponding course, the Gulf Stream bathes the shores of

northern Europe, and a branch of it forces its way into the Arctic basin, and bat-

tling against the palseocrystic ice, keeps imperfectly open the water-way by which
Nordenskjold hopes to work his course to Behring's Strait. The southern de-
flections are practically lost, being to a great extent, though not entirely, dissipated

in the great westerly current of the southern anti-trades.

     One of the most singular results of these later investigations is the establish-
ment of the fact that all the vast mass of water, often upwards of 2000 fathoms in
thickness, below the neutral band, is moving slowly to the northward ; that in fact
the depths of the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian Oceans are occupied by
tongues of the Antartic Sea, preserving in the main its characteristic temperatures.
The maintenance of a low temperature while the temperature of the floor of the ocean
must be higher, and that of the upper layers of the sea greatly higher, is in itself a
conclusive proof of steady movement of the water from a cold source ; and the
fact that the temperature of the lower layers of water, both in the Atlantic and
the Pacific, is slightly but perceptibly raised to the northward, while the continuity

of every layer with a corresponding layer in the southern sea can be clearly traced,
indicates the southern position of that source.

     The immediate explanation of this very unexpected phenomenon seems simple.
From some cause or other, as yet not fully understood, evaporation is greatly in

excess of precipitation over the northern portion of the land-hemisphere, while
over the water-hemisphere, and particularly over its southern portion, the reverse
is the case ; thus one part of the general circulation of the ocean is carried on
through the atmosphere, the water being raised in vapour in the northern hemi-

sphere, hurried by upper wind currents to the zone of low barometric pressure in
the south, where it is precipitated in the form of snow or rain, and, welling thence
northwards in the deepest channels on account of the high specific gravity depen-
dent on its low temperature, supplies the place of the water which has been re-
moved.

     The cold water wells northwards, but it meets with some obstructions on its
way, and these obstructions, while they prove the northward movement, if further
proof were needed, bring out another law by which the distribution of ocean tempe-
rature is regulated. The deeper water sinks slowly to a minimum at the bottom,
so that if we suppose the temperature at a depth of 2000 fathoms to be 36° F.,
the temperature at a depth of 3000 may be, say, 32°. Now, if in this case the
 slow current meet on its northward path a continuous barrier in the form of a sub-
 marine mountain ridge rising to within 2000 fathoms of the sea-surface, it is clear
 that all the water below a temperature of 36° will be arrested, and, however deep
the basin beyond the ridge may be, the water will maintain a minimum of 30° from
a depth of 2000 fathoms to the bottom. In many parts of the ocean we have most
 remarkable examples of the effect upon deep-sea temperature of such barriers inter-
 secting cold in-drauglits, the most marked instance, perhaps, a singular chain of
 closed seas at different temperatures among the islands of the Malay Archipelago
 but we have also a striking instance nearer home. Evaporation is greatly in excess
 of precipitation over the area of the Mediterranean, and consequently, in order to
 keep up the supply of water to the Mediterranean, tbere is a constant inward cur-

 rent through the Straits of Gibraltar from the Atlantic ; I need not at present refer

 to an occasional tidal counter-current. The minimum temperature of the Mediter-
 ranean is about 54° F. from a depth of 100 fathoms to the bottom. The tempe-
 rature of 54° is reached in the Atlantic at the mouth of the Straits of Gibraltar at
 a depth of about 100 fathoms, so that in all probability future soundiu>rs will show

 that the free water-way through the Straits does not greatly exceed 100 fathoms

 in depth.

   --The Depth of the Sea, and the Nature of Modern Deposits. It seems now to be

 thoroughly established by lines of trustworthy soundings which have been run
 in all directions, that the average depth of the ocean is a little over 2000 fathoms,
 and that in all probability it nowhere exceeds 5000 fathoms. Depths beyond 4000
 fathoms are rare and very local, and seem to be usually pits in the neighbourhood
  of volcanic islands. In all the ocean basins there are depressions extending over
 considerable areas where the -depth reaches 3000 fathoms or a little more, and
 these depressions maintain a certain parallelism with the axes of the neighbouring

  continents.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  617

     Within 300 or 400 miles of the shore, whether in deep or in shallow water,
formations are being laid down, whose materials are derived mainly from the disin-
tegration of shore rocks, and which consequently depend for their structure and
composition upon the nature and composition of the rocks which supply their
materials. These deposits imbed the hard parts of the animals living ou their area

of deposition, and they correspond in every way with sedimentary formations with
which we are familiar, of every age. In water of medium depths down to about
2000 fathoms, we have in most seas a deposit of the now well-known globigerina-

ooze, formed almost entirely of the shells of Foramiuifera living on the sea sur-
face, and which after death have sunk to the bottom. This formation, which
occupies a large- part of the bed of the Atlantic and a considerable part of that of

the Pacific and Southern Seas, is very like chalk in most respects, although we are
now satisfied that it is being laid down as a rule in deeper water than the chalk of

the Cretaceous period.

     In depths beyond 2500 or 3000 fathoms no such accumulations are taking place.
The shores of continents are usually too distant to supply land detritus, and although
the chalk-building Foraminifera are as abundant on the surface as they are else-

where, not a shell reaches the bottom ; the carbonate of lime is entirely dissolved
by the carbonic acid contained in the water during the long descent of the shells
from the surface. It therefore becomes a matter of very great interest to determine

what processes are going on, and what kind of formations are being laid down in
these abyssal regions, which must at present occupy an area of not less than ten

millions of square miles.

     The tube of the sounding instrument comes up from such abysses filled with an
extremely fine reddish clay, in great part amorphous, but containing, when exa-

mined under the microscope, a quantity of distinctly recognisable particles, organic
and inorganic. The organic particles are chiefly siliceous, and for the most part the
shells or spines of Radiolarians which are liviDg abundantly on the surface of the
sea, and apparently in more or less abundance at all depths. The inorganic par-
ticles are minute flakes oi* disintegrated pumice, and small crystalline fragments of
volcanic minerals ; the amorphous residue is probably principally due to the de-
composition of volcanic products, and partly to the ultimate inorganic residue of
decomposed organisms. There is ample evidence that this abyssal deposit is taking
place with extreme slowness. Over its whole area, and more particularly in the
 deep water of the Pacific, the dredge or trawl brings up in large numbers nodules
very irregular in shape, consisting chiefly of peroxide of iron aud peroxide of man-
ganese, deposited in concentric layers in a. matrix of clay, round a nucleus formed

 of a shark's tooth, or a piece of bone, or an otolith, or a piece of siliceous sponge, or

more frequently a fragment of pumice. These nodules are evidently formed in the
clay, and the formation of the larger ones and the segregation of their material

must have taken a very long time. Many of the sharks' teeth to which I have
alluded as forming the nuclei of the nodules, aud which are frequently brought up
uucoated with foreign matter, belong to species which we have every reason to
 believe to be extinct. Some teeth of a species of Carcharodon are of enormous

 si/e, four inches across the base, and are scarcely distinguishable from the huge
 teeth from the tertiary beds of Malta. It is evident that these semi-fossil teeth,
 from their being caught up in numbers by the loaded line of the trawl, are covered
 by only a very thin layer of clay.

      Another element in the red clay has caused great speculation and interest. If

& magnet be drawn through a quantity of the fine clay well diffused in water, it
 will be found to have caught on its surface some very minute magnetic spherules,
 some apparently of metallic iron in a passive state, and some of metallic nickel.
 From the appearance of these particles, and from the circumstance that such

magnetic dust has been already detected in the sediment of snow-water, my col-

 league, Mr. Murray, has a very strong opinion that they are of cosmic origin
·excessively minute meteorites. They certainly resemble very closely the fine gra-
 nules which frequently roughen the surface of the characteristic skin of metorites,
 and from their composition and the circumstances under which they are found,

 there is much to be said in favour of this view. I cannot, however, hold it entirely

proved ; there can be little doubt, from the universal presence of water-logged and
partially decomposed pumice on the bottom, and from the constant occurrence of

particles of volcanic minerals in the clay, that the red clay is formed in a great
measure by the decomposition of the lighter products of submarine volcanoes drifted
about by currents, and finally becoming saturated with water and sinking ; and it

is well known that both iron and nickel in a metallic state are frequently present in

minute quantities in igneous rocks. I think it is conceivable that the metallic

spherules may be derived from this source.
    So far as we can judge, after a most careful comparative examination, the

deposit which is at present being formed at extreme depths in the ocean, does not
correspond either in structure or in chemical composition with any known geolo-

gical formation ; and, moreover, we are inclined to believe, from a consideration of

their structure and of their imbedded organic remains, that none of the older forma-

--tions were laid down at nearly so great depths that, in fact, none of these have

anything of an abyssal character. These late researches tend to show that during
past geological changes abyssal beds have never been exposed, and it seems highly

probable that until comparatively recent geological periods such beds have not been

formed.

  --It appears now to be a very generally received opinion among geologists an
--opinion which was first brought into prominence by Professor Dana that the

" massive " eruptions which originated the mountain chains which form the

skeleton of our present continents, and the depressions occupied by our present
seas, date from the secular cooling and contraction of the crust of the earth, from
a period much more remote than the deposition of the earliest of the fossiliferous
rocks ; and that during the period chronicled by the successive sedimentary
systems, with many minor oscillations by which limited areas have been alternately
elevated and depressed, the broad result has been the growth by successive step3
of the original mountain chains and the extension of the continents by their
denudation, and the corresponding deepening of the original grooves. If this view

--be correct and it certainly appears to me that the reasoning in its favour is very

--cogent it is quite possible that until comparatively recent times no part of the

ocean was sufficiently deep for the formation of a characteristic abyssal deposit.

     Time will not allow me even to allude to the interesting results which have

been obtained from the determination of the density of sea water from different
localities and different depths, and from the analysis of sea water, and its contained
gases, and perhaps these results have been scarcely sufficiently worked out as yet

to afford safe bases for generalization.. I must, however, say a few words as to
certain additions which have been made to our knowledge of the two hitherto
impregnable strongholds of the frost, the regions round the North and South

Poles.

   --The Arctic Regions. The question which has of late held the most prominent

place in all discussions about the conditions of the Arctic Regions, particularly
since the voyage of Dr. Hayes, is whether it is possible that there can be at all
times or at any time anything in the form of an open Polar sea. This question

seems now to be virtually settled, and in the most unsatisfactory manner imagin-

able. There can be no doubt that in the year 1871, Count Wilczek in the
schooner Isbjorn found the sea between Novaya Zemlya and Spitzbergen nearly
free from ice, and that the same sea presented to Weyprecht and Payer in the
following year a dangerous stretch of moving and impenetrable pack. There can
be no doubt that in the year 1861 Dr. Hayes gazed over an expanse of open water
where in 1875-6 Captain Nares studied the conditions of palreocrystic ice. It is

evident therefore that the Polar basin, or at all events such portions of it as have
been hitherto reached, is neither open sea nor continuous ice, but a fatal compro-
mise between the two, an enormously heavy pack formed by the piling up and
crushing together of the floe of successive years, in frequent movement, breaking
up and shifting according to the prevailing direction of the wind, and leaving open,

now here and now there, lanes and vistas of deceptive open water, which may be
at any moment closed and converted into a chaotic mass of hurtling floe-bergs by

 a hurricane from another direction. It seems, however, that in certain seasons
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  619

  there is more open water in the direction of Grinnell's Land and Smith's Sound
  than in others, and that there are also years comparatively favourable for the
 northward route following the lead of Franz-Josef Land ; and there seem now to

 --be only two plans, one nearly as hopeless as the other, to chose between in any

  future attempt either to establish several permanent Polar stations, as proposed
 by Lieut. Weyprecht, and already initiated at one point, so far as preliminaries are
  concerned, by Captain Tyson and Captain Howgate, and to seize the opportunity
  of running north in early autumn from the station where the sea appears most
  open ; or to run as far north as possible at enormous expense, with a great force of

 men and abundance of provisions and paraffin oil, and push northwards during the

 arctic winter by a chain of communicating stations with ice-built refuge huts. It
 seems possible' that in a cold season, with the pack in the condition in which

 Markham found it in 1876, some progress might be made in this way, if it were
 conceivable that the end to be gained was worth the expenditure of so much

 labour and treasure.

    --The. Antarctic Regions. But little progress has been made during the last

 quarter of a century in the actual investigation of the conditions of that vast

 region which lies within the parallel of 70° S. Some additional knowledge has
 been acquired, and the light which recent inquiries have thrown upon the general
 plan of ocean circulation and the physical properties of ice, have given a new
 direction to what must partake for some time to come of the nature of

 speculation.

     From information derived from all sources up to the present time, it may be

 gathered that the impenetrated area of about 4,700,000 square miles surrounding
 the South Pole is by no means certainly a continuous " Antarctic continent," but

 that it-consists much more probably partly of comparatively low continental land,

 and partly of a congeries of continental (not oceanic) islands, bridged between and
 combined, and covered to the-depth of about 1400 feet, by a continuous ice-cap ; with
 here and there somewhat elevated continental chains, such as the groups of land
 between 55° and 95° ~W\, including Peter the Great Island and Alexander Land,

discovered by Billingshausen in 1821, Graham Land and Adelaide Island,
 discovered by Biscol in 1832, and Louis Philippe Land by D'Urville in 1838, and
at least one majestic modern volcanie range discovered by Ross in 1841 and 1842,

stretching from Balleny Island to a latitude of 78° S., and rising to a height of
 15,000 feet. It seems, so far as is at present known, that the whole of the
antarctic land, low and high, as well as the ice-cap of which a portion of the

continuous continent may consist, is bordered to some distance by a fringe of ice,

which is bounded to seaward by a perpendicular ice-cliff, averaging 230 feet in
height above the sea-level. Outside the cliff njloe, which attains near the barrier
a thickness of about 20 feet and in some places, by piling a considerably greater
thickness, extends northwards in winter to a distance varying according to its

position with reference to the southward-trending branches of the equatorial

current ; and this floe is replaced in summer by a heavy drifting pack with
scattered ice-bergs. Navigating the Antarctic Sea in the southern summer, the
onlv season when such navigation is possible, it has been the opinion of almost all
explorers, that after forcing a passage through an outer belt of a heavy pack and
ice-bergs, moving as a rule to the north-westward, and thus fanning out from the
ice-cliff in obedience to the prevailing south-easterly winds, a band of compara-

tively clear water is to be found within.

     Several considerations appear to me to be in favour of the view that the area
round the South Pole is broken up and not continuous land. For example, if we
look at a general ice-chart we find that the sea is comparatively free from ice-

bergs, and that the deepest notches occur in the " Antarctic Continent " at three
points, each a little to the eastward of south of one of the great land masses.

Opposite each of these notches a branch of the equatorial current is deflected south-
wards by the land, and is almost merged in the great drift-current which sweeps

round the world in the Southern Sea before the westerly anti-trades. But while the
greater portion of the Brazilian current, the East Australian current, and the
southern part of the Agulhas current, are thus merged, they are not entirely lost ;.
620 report--1878.

for at these points of junction with the drift-current of the westerlies, the

isobathy therms are slightly deflected, to the southwards, and it is opposite these

points of junction that we have comparatively open sea and penetrable notches in

the southern pack. But we have not only the presumed effect of this transfer of
warmer water to the southwards, we were able to detect its presence in the

Challenger by the thermometer. Referring to the result of a serial temperature

sounding on the 14th of February 1874, with a surface temperature 6f 29° F. at

a depth of from 300 to 400 fathoms, there is a band of water at a temperature

more than half a degree above the freezing-point, That this comparatively warm

Wewater is coming from the north there is ample proof.          traced its continuity

with a band at the same depth gradually increasing in warmth to the northward,

and it is evident that its heat can be derived from no other source, and that it must

be continually receiving new supplies, for it is overlaid by a band of colder water,

tending to mix with it by convection.

It is, of course, possible that these warm currents may by coincidence be

directed towards those notches already existing in a continental mass of land ; but

such a coincidence would be remarkable, and there is certainly a suggestion of the

alternative that the " continent " may consist to so great an extent of ice as to be

liable to have its outline affected by warm currents.

In high southern latitudes it seems that all the icebergs are originally tabular,

the surface perfectly level and parallel with the surface of the sea, a cliff about 230

feet high bounding the berg. The top is covered with a layer of the whitest

snow ; now and then a small flock of petrels take up their quarters upon it, and

trample the soil some few square yards, but after their departure one of the frequent

snow showers restores it in a few minutes to its virgin whiteness. The upper part

of the cliff is pale blue, which gradually deepens towards the base. When looked

at closely, the face of the cliff is seen to be traversed by a delicate ruling o'f faint

blue lines, the lines being more distant from one another above and becoming

gradually closer. The distance between the well-marked lines near the top of a

berg may be of a foot or even more, while near the surface of the water it is not

more than two or three inches, and the space between the blue lines have lost their

dead whiteness and have become hyaline or bluish. The blue lines are very

unequal in their strength and in their depth. of colouring; sometimes a group of

very dark lines gives a marked character to a part of a berg. Between the

stronger blue lines near the top of the cliff a system of closer lines may be

observed, marking the  division  of  the  ice  by still  finer  planes  of  lamination                                                     but
                                                                                                                                        ;

in the narrower spaces near the water-line they are blended and lost. The blue

lines are the sections of sheets of clear ice ; the white intervening bands are the

--sections of layers of ice where the particles are not in such close contact ice

probably containing some air.

The stratification in all these icebergs is, I believe, originally horizontal and

conformable, or very nearly so. In many, while melting and beating about in the

sea, the strata become inclined at various angles, or vertical or even reversed ; in

many they are traversed by faults, or twisted, or contorted, or displaced ; but I

believe that all deviations from a horizontal arrangement are due to changes

taking place in the icebergs themselves.

I think there can be no doubt, from their shape and form, and their remarkable

uniformity of character, that these great table-topped icebergs are prismatic blocks

riven from the edge of the great antarctic ice-sheet. I conclude, therefore, that

the upper part of the iceberg, including by far the greater part of its bulk, and

culminating in the portion exposed above the surface of the sea, was formed by

the piling up of successive layers of snow during the period, amounting perhaps to

centuries, during which the ice-cap was slowly forcing its way over the low-land,

and out to sea over a long extent of gentle slope, until it reached a depth con-

siderably beyond 200 fathoms, when the lower specific weight of the ice caused an

upward strain which at length overcame the cohesion of the mass, and portions

were rent off and floated away. The icebergs when they are first dispersed float

in from 200 to 250 fathoms ; when, therefore, they have been drifted to latitudes
of 65° or 04° south, the bottom of the berg, the surface which forced itself glacier-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  621

like over the land, just reaches the layer at which the temperature of the water
distinctly rises ; and is rapidly melted, and the pehhles and land debris with which
it is more or less charged are precipitated. That this precipitation takes place all
over the area where the icebergs are breaking up, constantly and to a considerable
extent, is evident from the fact that the matter brought up by the sounding instru-
ment and the dredge is almost entirely composed of such deposits from ice; for

Diatoms, Foraminifera, and Radiolarians are present on the surface in large num-

bers, and unless the deposit from the ice were abundant it would soon be covered

and masked by the skeletons of surface organisms.
     The curious question now arises, what is the cause of the uniform height of the

--southern icebergs, that is to say, what is the cause of the restriction of the

thickness of the free edge of the ice-cap to 1400 feet? I have mentioned the
gradual diminution in thickness of the strata of ice in a berg from above down-
wards. The regularity of this diminution leaves it almost without a doubt that
the layers observed are in the same category, and that therefore the diminution is
due to subsequent pressure or other action upon a series of beds, which were at the
time of their deposition nearly equally thick. About sixty or eighty feet from the
top of an iceberg, the strata of ice a foot or so in thickness, although of a white
colour, and thus indicating that they contain a considerable quantity of air, are

very hard, and the specific weight of the ice is not much lower than that of layers
three inches thick nearer the water-line of the berg. The upper layers have been

manifestly produced by falls of snow after the berg has been detached.

     Now, "it seems to me that the reduction in thickness cannot be due to com-

pression alone, but that a portion of the substance of the lower layers must have

been removed. It is not easy to see why the temperature of the earth's crust,

under a widely extended and practically permanent ice-sheet of great thickness,
should ever fall below the freezing-point ; and it is a matter of observation that at

all seasons of the year vast rivers of muddy water flow into the frozen sea from

beneath the great glaciers which are the issues of the ice-sheet of Greenland. Ice
is a very bad conductor, so that the cold of winter cannot penetrate to any great

depth into the mass. The normal temperature of the surface of the earth's crust, at
any point where it is uninfluenced by cyclical changes, is at all events above the
freezing-point, so that the temperature of the floor of the ice-sheet would certainly
have no tendency to fall below that of the stream passing over it. The pressure
upon the deeper beds of the ice must be enormous at the bottom of an ice-sheet

--1400 feet in thickness not much less than a quarter of a ton on the square inch.

It seems, therefore, probable that under the pressure to which the body of ice is
subjected, a constant system of melting and regelation is taking place, the water

passing down by gravitation from layer to layer until it reaches the floor of the ice-
sheet, and finally working out channels for itself between the ice and the land,

whether the latter be subaerial or submerged.

     I should think it probable that this process, or some modification of it, may be

 the provision by which the indefinite accumulation of ice over the antarctic con-

 tinent is prevented, and a certain uniformity in the thickness of the ice-sheet

--maintained that in fact ice at the temperature at which it is in contact with the

 surface of the earth's crust within the antarctic regions cannot support a column of

itself more than 1400 feet high without melting. It is suggested to me by Pro-

 fessor Tait that the thickness of the ice-sheet very probably depends upon its area,

 as the amount of melting through squeezing and the earth's internal heat will
depend upon the facility of the escape of the water. The problem is, however, an
exceedingly complex one, and we have perhaps scarcely sufficient data for working

 it out.

   --The Fauna of the Deep Sea. I can scarcely regret that it is utterly impossible

for me on this occasion to enter into any details with regard to the relations of the
abyssal fauna, the department of the subject which has naturally had for me the

greatest interest. Recent investigations have shown that there is no depth limit to
 the distribution of any group of gill-bearing marine animals. Fishes, which from
their structure and from what we know of the habits of their congeners must
 certainly live on the bottom, have come up from all depths, and at all depths the
·622  --report 1878.

whole of the marine invertebrate classes are more or less fully represented. The
abyssal fauna is of a somewhat special character, differing from the fauna of shallower
water in the relative proportions in which the different invertebrate types are
represented. It is very uniform over an enormously extended area, and in this

respect it fully confirms the anticipations of the great Scandinavian naturalist

Loven, communicated to this Association in the year 1844. It is a rich fauna, in-

cluding many special genera, and an enormous number of special species, of which
we, of course, know as yet only a fraction ; but I do not think I am going too far
iu saying that from the results of the Challenger expedition alone the number of
known species in certain classes will be doubled. The relations of the abyssal fauna
to the faunse of the older Tertiary and the newer Mesozoic periods are much closer
than are those of the faunas of shallow water ; I must admit, however, that these

--relations are not so close as I expected them to be, that hitherto we have found

 living only a very few representatives of groups which had been supposed to be

 extinct. I feel, however, that until the zoological results of several of these later
 voyages, and especially those of the Challenger, shall have been fully worked out, it

would be premature to commit myself to any generalisations.
      I have thus attempted to give a brief outline of certain defensible general con-

 clusions, based upon the results of recent research. Some years ago, certain

 commercial enterprises, involving the laying of telegraph cables over the bed of the
 sea, proved that the extreme depths of the ocean were not inaccessible. This some-

what unexpected experience soon resulted in many attempts, on the part of those
 interested in the extension of the boundaries of knowledge, to use what machinery
 they then possessed to determine the condition of the hitherto unknown region.
 This first step was naturally followed by a development of all appliances and

 methods bearing upon the special line of research ; and within the last decade the
 advance of knowledge on all matters bearing upon the physical geography of the

 sea has been confusingly rapid--so much so, that at this moment the accumulation
 of new material has far outstripped the power of combining and digesting and
 methodising it. This difficulty is greatly increased by the extreme complexity of
 the questions, both physical and biological, which have arisen. Steady progress is,
' however, being made in both directions, and I trust that in a few years our ideas
 as to the condition of the depth of the sea may be as definite as they are with
 regard to regions to which we have long had ready access.

     The following Papers were read :

A1. Journey on Foot through Arabia Petraa. By the Rev. F. W. Holland,

                                                  M.A., F.B.O.S.

     The objects of this expedition were
     1. To examine the sandstone district in the Peninsula of Sinai lying between

the ancient Egyptian mining stations of Wady Mugharah and Serabit el Kadim,

with the view of the possible discovery of further Egyptian ruins or in-

scriptions.

     2. To trace out the various routes that the children of Israel might have taken
on their journey northwards- from Mount Sinai (Jebel Musa) to Kadesh Barnea, so
as to institute a just comparison between the facilities or difficulties which at-

tended them.

     3. To explore Jebel Mugrah and Ain Kadeis, in the hopes of throwing some
additional light upon the disputed questions of the site of Kadesh Barnea and the
boundary of the ancient kingdom of Edom.

    4. To follow the road from Wady el Arish by the ancient Lake Serbonis to

Kantara, this having been suggested by Brugsch Bey as the route taken by the
children of Israel when they left Egypt.

     Starting from Suez on March 31st, attended only by three Arabs of the Jowarah
tribe, Mr. Holland made a walking tour to Jebel Musa, which he believed to be
                            TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.       623

the true Mount Sinai ; thence northwards hy Wadies Telleger and El Atujeh, by

the route followed hy Baron Koller in 1840 (< R. G. S. Journal,' 1842) to Wady el
Hessi ; thence N.W. to Nakhl, and so on hy Wady Muweilah to Wady el Ain.
Leaving his Jowarah Arabs at Wady el Ain, he took an escort of the Haiwat tribe
and made an expedition up Wady Kadeis, and eastwards across Jebel Mugrah, re-
turning by Wady Lussan. On leaving Wady el Ain, he followed down Wady
Muweilah to Wady el Arith, and passing south of Jebel Helal, and north of Jebel

Yelek, he crossed Jebel Mugharah, and, striking due west, arrived at Isniailia on

May 23rd.

The results of the journey were as follows :

     1. Mr. Holland found extensive turquoise mines worked by the Arabs between

Wady Mugharah and Wady Nusb, but no further Egyptian ruins or inscriptions.
He traced out and mapped the course of Wady Sahone,an important valley, which had
previously been unexplored, and found that it forms the upper portion of Wady

Shellah, which takes its name, ' the valley of cataracts,' from the water, which

Heflows down it after rain, falling over a cliff.  also explored the ancient turquoise

mines of Serabit el Kadim, and ascended Jehel Umen Riglain.

2. On leaving Jehel Musa he journeyed north-east to the neighbourhood of Ain

el Huthera, which has been identified with Hazeroth. Mr. Holland cannot agree

with this identification, nor does he believe it possible for the large host of the

Israelites to have travelled this way. Following up the course of Wady Marah,

he reached Ain el Akhdar. Thence he explored the passes of Jebel Thellah and

the plateau of Zeranik, and afterwards descended Wady Zelleger, Wadies Edeid and

Biyar, and the pass of El Mirad. He finally came to the conclusion that the only

available route for the children of Israel to have taken was that by Wadies

Zelleger and El Atiyeh. These valleys afford the most direct, the best watered,

and by far the most easy course from Jebel Musa northwards, and by them one

ascends to the plateau of the desert of Et Tih without any difficult pass. The

want of water and Arab raids compelled him to give up his plan of travelling north-

wards direct to Jebel Mugrah ; but he passed over the water-shed of Jebel et Tih,

into the open plateau on the north, and made a route survey of that portion of the

country which would present the greatest difficulties to the passage of a large host.

In his journey to Nakhl from the head of Wady Atiyeh, he also passed across a

district that had been previously unexplored.

3. Jehel Mugrah had in the author's belief never before been penetrated by

travellers, and he found that its position on the maps was far from correct. He
carefully explored Wady Kadies, and came to the conclusion that its position

militates strongly against its identification with Kadesh Barnea. Jebel Mugrah

belongs to the territory of the Haiwat Arabs, and not to that of the Azazimeh as

has generally been stated. It shows traces of ancient habitation and cultivation,

and extends eastwards only about as far as lat. 35° : here it ends abruptly in a

steep cliff, and is separated from Jebel Jerafeh by the head of Wady Garaiyeh and
Wady Jerafeh. These valleys he believed to afford the road which was known

as " the way of the spies," and formed the western boundary of Edoru. Kadesh

Barnea he would place at the south-east point of Jebel Mugrah, but he was unable

to descend into the plain.

    4. Mr. Holland gave up his intention of following down Wady el Arish to the
coast from Wady Muweilah, both because the bed of the Wady proved a very bad

road for travelling, and also because he heard from the Arabs of a direct road west-

wards to Ismailia, which appeared a very important one to explore. It was not
marked on any map seen, but was described by the Arabs as an easy, direct, and

well-watered route to Egypt, a description found to be perfectly correct. The

course of Wady el Arish has been very inaccurately laid down. It runs to the

«ast of Jebel Helal, and passes through that mountain by a narrow gorge. Jebel

Yelek has been placed too far to the north. Wady Hasanah, which contains three

wells, and is a very important watering-place, runs to the west of Jebel Helah.

After crossing Wady Hasanah and passing to the north of Jebel Yelek, the road

crosses Jebel Mugharah, an important range, where there are wells and ancient

juins, and then, turning due west, runs over a rolling plateau, in places much covered
--624 report 1878.

with sand-drifts, to Isinailia. Large numbers of flint flakes and arrow-heads prove

that this road was much used in ancient times, and there can be little doubt that
it was the road followed by Abraham from the Negeb, or south country, to Egypt.
Larce tracts of land on the west of Jebel Mugharah are cultivated by the Arabs.
The discovery of this road is regarded as one of great importance, and, as far as the

author can learn, it has been previously unknown.

     2. Survey of Galilee. Hij Lieut. H. H. Kitchener, RE., F.B.O.S.

      This paper contained an account of the operations subsequent to those described
by Major Wilson at the last meeting of the Association.

     On the renewal of the survey, Lieut. Kitchener found that the cairns built at

Hattin in 1875 were all destroyed ; but after a careful search he found the broad
arrows cut on the rock under where the cairns had been, and was thus able to
carry on the triangulation from a base of 25 miles, and other calculated lines from
8 to 12 miles long ; subsequently, after carrying the triangulation round the country,
the calculated length of this base was only 60 feet different from the measurement

started with, or a little more than 2 feet of possible error in the mile. On the

scale employed, this error in 25 miles is only the thickness of a pencil line.
      The triangulation took eight days from this camp, as the old cairns had to be

rebuilt, and new ones erected in the northern country. By thus doing the trian-

gulation and survey of the ground from each camp were both kept going together,
and the strength of the party was not sufficient to adopt any other method. While
 observing from the top of Mount Tabor, Lieut. Kitchener examined three chapels
recently unearthed by the Roman Catholic monks ; they date from crusading
 times, when this was supposed to be the Mount of the Transfiguration, and the

 three chapels are mentioned in old chronicles of that time.

      Immediately above the camp was an extinct volcano, called the Kurn Hattin,
 or Horns of Hattin, being two peaks on the top of a steep mountain, having be-
 tween them the crater of an extinct volcano, memorable as the scene of the final

 struggle of the Crusaders after the fatal battle on the plain below.

      On the completion, of the triangulation, the levelling had to be taken up from
 the last point on the line. In seven days' work 16| miles were accomplished, and
 the seashore was reached, giving a depression of 682 feet 6 inches below the Medi-

 terranean.

      The survey of the detail had then to be done. From the fixed triangulation-
 points a number of supplementary angles were taken to every village, hill-top,
 prominent tree, or important object in view ; and, as this was done from every
 point, when these Hnes were plotted, intersections fixing these objects were obtained.
 Practically almost every place of importance was fixed in this way. The surveyor

 then started with this diagram of fixed points, and by the interpolation of the

 angles taken with his prismatic compass was able to fix his own position at any
 point on paper ; he then sketched in by eye the detail that was in his close vici-
 nity, and by going through the same process all over his work, the detail was
 obtained with considerable accuracy. The heights of all places of importance were

 taken by aneroids, besides the calculated heights of all the triangulation-points.
  These aneroids were checked morning and evening with a standard barometer kept
 in camp. The slopes of the hills were taken by Abney's level, and on returning
 to camp in the evening a report was made of all ruins, villages, and water-supply

 in the work of the day. The nomenclature was written down in Arabic by a well-
 educated scribe kept for that purpose. Each surveyor had a guide with him, who
  gave the names of the different places. The surveyor wrote them down as near as
  he could to the sound, and on returning to camp he repeated them in front of the
  guide and the scribe. The guide then pronounced the names correctly, and the
  scribe wrote it down from him. Lieut. Kitchener afterwards transliterated the
  Arabic in accordance with Robinson's method, and the proper spelling was thus

obtained, and written on the map. Every possible check on the veracity of the

natives was employed by asking the names of numbers of people independently.
    One of the great values of the resulting- map is the number of unknown names it

has made public ; thus, on this survey, 2770 names were collected, only about 450
of which were to be found on the best formerly existing map of the country,
Another is the accuracy of these names, taken down from the natives in a man-

ner never attempted before ; and the result has been to throw a vast light on the

ancient nomenclature of the country, and the origin of the races that inhabit it.
     The survey of the detail took live more days, and on the 27th March the camp

was moved to Tiberias, with the assurance of having no obstacle of a technical

nature to hinder work.

    The scenery of the lake is decidedly monotonous, but there is a great charm in

that dry and thirsty land in having a vast expanse of fresh water spread out before
the eyes. During the survey of the shores, a considerable discovery was made,
viz., the site of Sennabris, mentioned by Josephus as the place where Vespasian

pitched his camp when marching on the insurgents of Tiberias. The name Sinn en

Nabra still exists, and is well known to the natives ; it applies to a ruin situated on

a spur from the hills that close the southern end of the Sea of Galilee ; it formed,
therefore, the defence against an invader from the Jordan plain, and blocked the

great main road in the valley.

Close beside it, there is a large artificially-formed plateau, defended by a water-

ditch on the south, communicating with Jordan, and by the Sea of Galilee on the

north. This is called Kh. el Kerak, and is doubtless the remains of Vespasian's

camp described by Josephus. It is just like another Roman camp found near

Jenin, where an army was camped. This Kh. el Kerak has been identified with

Tarichaea, but, as Major Wilson has pointed out, that site must be sought to the

north of Tiberias. The finding of Sennabris, the place where the Roman host

encamped before marching on Tiberias and Tarichrea, clearly proves that the latter

place could not have been anywhere near the southern end of the lake.

The ruins of ancient Tiberias, with its sea-walls and scattered columns, extend

nearly as far south as these springs, and it may be fairly supposed that the modern

site of the town is situated to the north of the ancient place.

Passing the ruin of Kuneitriah, where, Lieut. Kitchener believes, the ancient

Tarichaea was situated, and the plain beyond, the path leads along the side of the

steep slope of the hills, with rocky cliffs towering above, and the sea almost directly

below ; turning a corner, the Plain of Gennesareth lies spread out, with the cluster
Aof ruined hovels of the village of Mejdel in the foreground.
                                                                 fine stream of

water irrigates this portion of the plain from Wady Hamam, the narrow gorge

through which the levelling had been brought down, with cliffs 1000 feet high

on either side. In those on the south, are the caves of the robbers who were sub-

dued by Herod the Great by letting down soldiers on platforms from above on the

defenders, who slew one another sooner than be taken captive. Lieut. Kitchener

explored the caves, which consist of galleries at different heights conducted along

the face of the precipice leading to different-sized chambers ; some appeared natural,

while others were artificial ; there were spacious halls, small sleeping-places, and
some enormous stables, all cut out of the solid rock. Water was brought by a

long aqueduct, cut in the face of the precipice, and poured down into cisterns in-
side the fortress. The place has been since occupied by Arab marauders, who have

built walls to defend the outside of the galleries and round towers at different

elevations on the face of the rock, to bring a flanking fire on the entrance, which

was reached by a long flight of basalt steps.

     Beyond Mejdel on the Plain of Gennesareth, and round the northern shores of

--the lake, are the most interesting sites of all Capernaum, Chorazin, and Bethsaida.

Lieut. Kitchener does not agree with Major Wilson in the position of Capernaum

at Tell Hum, but would rather place it at Kh. Minia on the plain, believing the

Humfine remains. of Tell  to be the relics of the known grandeur of the ancient

Bethsaida.

On the 4th April the camp was moved to Khan Jubb Yusef, situated on the

great Damascus road, and some distance from any inhabited village. The country

round  is occupied  by wandering  tribes of  Bedouin Arabs with  their  goat flocks
                                                                                                                           ;

to the east it is a mass of basalt which has flowed over the country, and down to

the shores of the lake ; to the west are the limestone hills of Safed.

    From the subsequent camp at Meiron, the triangulation required a considerable

arnoimt of attention. The Jebel Jerniuk, the highest peak in Galilee, reaching an

altitude of 3930 feet, had been observed from the south, but now it was necessary

to ascend and observe from it ; this was accomplished, and the triangulatiou thrown

well forward to the north, but the triangulation would not allow of a descent to

the low unhealthy Huleh marshes as early as had been hoped. The village of

Meiron is a famous Jewish place of pilgrimage, for there Rabbi Shamai and Hillel

and the Great Simeon Ben Jochai lie buried. The rocks around are honeycombed

with ancient tombs, and there still remains an almost perfect facade of au

ancient synagogue, dating probably from the second century after Christ. The

principal results of the survey of this district were the discovery of three dolmens.

During the course of the survey, eight dolmens were discovered, and as these are

the first that have been noted in Palestine, it adds a new district to those already

known to possess these rude stone monuments, and may be a connecting link be-

tween the ancient inhabitants of Europe and India.

The remains of two synagogues, unobserved hitherto, were discovered, one at

Sufsaf and the other at El Jish. These add considerably to our knowledge of these

interesting buildings, and the discovery of the Roman eagle engraved in relief in
the synagogue of El Jish adds new proof that these buildings are due to Roman

influence over a subjugated people. The eleven specimens that remain of these

buildings were carefully examined and planned during the course of the survey

where it was possible to trace the original work.
     The triangulation and survey of the country round Dibl, to which the camp

moved on May 3rd, took twelve days ; a number of curious ruins were visited, and

special plans and photographs were made. The country to the west was rugged

and rocky, covered with brush-wood, and occupied by Arab tribes. Deep ravines
and gorges carried the winter rains down to the sea, and in many parts of this wild
country a European had never before been seen. To the east, the country was
more open and cultivated ; there are not many springs, but numbers of rock-cut

cisterns and large pools for collecting the winter rains at almost every village.

    On the 16th, camp was moved east to Kades, and from the camp much of the

plain of the Huleh and the low country was surveyed. The ruins of the Temple of

the Sun were planned and photographed.
    On the 24th, the party again marched northwards, and, having pitched camp at

Taiyebeh, the triangulation was carried to its most northern point, the great

Crusading castle of Beaufort. From a study of the masonry of the four Crusading

castles that defended the northern frontier of the kingdom, Beaufort, Toron, Hunin,

and Banias, and after comparison with others in different parts of the country,

Lieut. Kitchener is led to suppose that they are none of them older than Crusading
times, except a portion of Banias, which appears to be slightly older work ; and,

therefore, that none of them date, as most travellers assert, from Phoenician or even

Roman times.

On the 2nd of June, camp was moved to Banias, the Oaesarea Philippi of the

New Testament, and the Panium of Josephus. The triangulation was here suc-

cessfully closed on this side by observing from the Castle. This was the ancient

acknowledged source of the Jordan springing out of the cave of Pan in the face of

a precipitous rock, and rushing at once in a strong stream through the tangled

groves of luxuriant vegetation to the plain below, there to be joined by its rivals in

modern writings, the Leddan and the Hasbany. The Hasbany, with less flow of

water than either of the other two streams, and joining them after their junction,

when they form a mighty stream, cannot be followed as a source of the Jordan.

When the other two divide into almost equal streams, the longest course leads to

this fountain of Banias, the true source of the Jordan;

     In discussing the great depression of the Jordan valley, which is merely a con-
tinuation of the great valley extending through Syria, dividing the Lebanon from

the Anti-Lebanon, and down which the Leontes and Jordan rivers flow, Lieut.
                                                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                           627

Kitchener advanced a new theory. There is little doubt that the depression was

caused by a fault, and the sliding down of the strata, and that it was once an

immense lake                                               this is proved by the ancient shore lines found at different elevations
                                                        ;

along its course. The general supposition is, that it has been a continuation of the

Gulf of Akaba, and that the gentle rising of 130 miles has cut oft* the Dead Sea

from' the ocean. It is curious that on this raised land there is still a well-defined

valley, having a fall, and showing the channel of a water-course, as far as known,

the whole way. In the north, there is considerable evidence of volcanic action, and

a volcano found was exactly in the bed of the valley of the Leontes, at the bend

of  the river                                    it has been mentioned previously by Canon Tristram, who    noted the
                                              ;

way the basalt had flowed down the western side of the Hasbany. These volcanic

outbreaks are known to belong to a late period of geological time. Before then,

the Leontes, instead of being forcibly turned off at right angles to its course in the

most extraordinary bend which makes it cleave through the rocks to the sea,

would have flowed into the mighty lake which then covered the plain, and over the

southern boundary along the Arraba, which still shows signs of its presence, to the

Gulf of Akaba. The only supposition required in this theory is a more abundant

supply of water, and of that the country gives striking proof. The extraordinary

evidences of the action of glaciers on the rocks, the deep water-courses cut through

hundreds of feet of solid limestone, now dry, speak of a former age of rushing tor-

rents.   Thus this volcanic outbreak in                                 the  Merj  Ayun  is  the  key  to  the  present

        _

formation of the valley ; a very slight cutting through it would again turn the

Leontes into its former course down the Jordan valley and into the Dead Sea.
The saltness of the Dead Sea may be accounted for by the great natural cliffs

of rock-salt found at its southern extremity, and by the many salt springs that

are found in that region continually pouring brine into its waters. These cliffs of

rock-salt at the Khashm Usdun are a natural crystalline formation, and cannot,

therefore, have been deposited by an evaporating sea.

    On the 22nd, camp was moved to Nakurah ; and from the Eiis en Nakurah,

the last round of observation, angles were taken, closing the triangulation of the

whole of Palestine, and joining very well on the base ; the check calculations have

proved its accuracy.

    On the 11th July, all arrived at Haiffa, after completing the survey of 1000

square miles of country.                                    The  whole  expenditure was  £900, and  taking  £100  as

the cost of the fair drawing, the party may claim to have produced a 1-inch survey

at the cost of £1 a square mile.

    After four weeks' rest in the Lebanon, the field was taken again on the 23rd
AAugust witha reduced party.
                                                                 long march led to the south country, and 340

square miles in the desert round Beersheba were surveyed. This completed the

survey of Palestine; but the early portion required revision, and from 10th October

to 22nd November 1700 square miles were revised. The party, having completed

all it was sent to perform, then returned to England.

                                                                        ss2

FRIDAY, AUGUST 16, 1878.

The following Papers were read :

1. Notes on some Geographical Variations on the Coast of France.

By  J.  S.  Phene                                LL.D.,  F.8.A.
                                              ,

     Dr. Phene, having for years past taken careful observations and soundings in

the Morbihan sea, was of opinion that a very large portion of what was now that

inland sea did not exist, in fact nothing that could be so called had existed, in the

time of Cffisar. The lie de Batz, an island near the mouth of the Loire, cele-
brated for strange and ancient rites, mentioned by classical writers, was now a

promontory, and the former littoral line only to be traced with difficulty. Dr.

Phen<5 believed that he had discovered the island of Avalon, the reputed place of
King Arthur's burial, though from the island having been severed into two by the

sea, and the name retained only by the smaller portion, it had been overlooked,
Aand even in the neighbourhood no one knew of it but local fishermen.
                                                                       dolmen

unlike any other in France or Britain on the larger portion, and the traditions of

the locality, seemed to put the matter out of doubt.

2. On Processes of Map-producing. By Captain J. Wateehouse, B.S.C.,

                                 Assistant Surveyor-General of India.

     Before the introduction of lithography, about the beginning of the present

century, the only means by which maps could be reproduced was by engraving on
metal plates or on wood, both tedious and expensive methods. With the invention
of lithography, a new impetus was given to cartography. The new art was, how-
ever, scarcely out of its cradle when Joseph Nicephore Niepce, of Chalons-sur-Saone,

experimenting unsuccessfully in endeavouring to find a substitute for lithographic
stone,, conceived the happy idea of obtaining images on metal plates by the sole

agency of light upon thin films of asphaltum or bitumen of Judsea.
      Since these first essays of Niepce, the idea of superseding the slow and laborious

hand-work of the lithographic draughtsman and engraver by the quicker, cheaper,

and more accurate processes of photography has been steadily kept in view.
     The first serious attempt to carry out the method practically appears to have

been made by Sir Henry James, RE., in 1855. The result proved the great value
of photography for the reproduction of maps, and the enormous saving in time and
money that could be effected by its use. In 1860, Captain A. de Courcy Scott, R.E.,
perfected the process of photozincography, which has since been employed with so
much success and advantage at the Ordnance Survey Office, Southampton, and the
 India Survey Offices in Calcutta, Dehra Diin, Piina, and Madras.

     By a curious coincidence, at the very time when this process was being worked
out in England, Mr. W. Osborne, of Melbourne, Australia, independently perfected

 an almost identically similar process of photolithography, which has been exten-
 sively used for reproducing the maps of the Australian Colonies.

      Little progress was made in the practical working of photolithography or
 photozincography in India till 1865, when Mr. J. B. N. Hennessey, of the Great
 Trigonometrical Survey, fairly established the process at Dehra Diin.

      The specific advantages to be gained by the use of photography for the repro-

 duction of maps are

(1.) Rapidity of production and multiplication.
(2.) The perfect fidelity with which the most delicately minute and intricate

details are copied.

     (3.) The facility with which copies may be obtained on scales larger or smaller

than the original.

(4.) The comparative cheapness of the photographic methods.
Notwithstanding these advantages, the use of photography as a means of repro-

ducing maps for publication has not extended so much as might have been ex-

pected, in great part owing to the difficulty of making draughtsmen fully under-

stand the requirements to be fulfilled when preparing maps for reproduction, in

order to produce satisfactory results, and that they must strictly refrain from

using colour, and draw the map neatly in black and white, so that every line may

be reproduced of its proper strength, according as the map is to be copied on the

same scale as the original, or to be reduced.

                                                       MONDAY, AUGUST 19, 1878.

      The following Papers were read :

1. The Land of Midian. By Captain R. F. Burton, R.B.M. Consul, Trieste.

      The kingdoms of Zibah and Zalrnunna have hitherto been vaguely and

erroneously laid down. The wandering tribes still apply the term Arz Madyan

(land of Midian) to the maritime strip, 108 miles long, bounded north by the head of

the Akabah Gulf, and south by the Wady Suit, the great waterless river-bed upon

which the fort El-Muwaylah is built. But Captain Burton also proposes a South

Midian beginning at the latter point, extending 105 miles, and ending at the Wady
Hamz (N. lat. 25° 55'), where the Egyptian and Ottoman possessions meet.

Thus the latitudinal length of the Midianite seaboard is 21.3 miles, which the

windings of the coast prolong to 300. The inner depth is determined by the Shafah

line of sub-maritime mountains defining the eastern frontier. Politically spealdng,

the country all belongs to the Khediv of Egypt, whose predecessors have gar-

risoned the two forts El-'Akabah and El-Muwaylah since the days of Sultan Selim

the Conqueror, in a.d. 1517. Captain Burton assigned to the Jebel El-Tihaniah

(mountains of the Lowlands), the ghats or fringing ranges of the Arabian Peninsula,

an altitude of 6000 to 6500 feet, a figure which the hydrographic chart has ex-

aggerated to 9000.

      Captain Burton proceeded to outline the movements of the two expeditions

which he commanded in 1877 and 1878, both due to the liberality of the Khediv

of Egypt, Ismail I. The four months of travel which ended 1877 and began 1878

were distributed into three excursions :

      1. The northern march, which visited the copper works established by the

ancient Egyptians ; the ruined capital, " Madiama," which Ptolemy places in N.

lat.  28° 15'                               the  Fort  El-'Akabah, where,  also,  traces of  smelting  metal were
                                         ;

found                           the sulphur-hill, northernmost of the three discovered,      and the great gypsum
                             ;

formations of Midian and Sinai. This section concluded with a peripi-m of the

perilous Akabah Gulf and a narrow escape from shipwreck and the sharks.

      2. The central or eastern march to Middle Midian, the course of which was

arrested by the villanous Ma'azeh tribe, then tinned southwards, and explored the

ruins of Shuwak, the Soaka of Ptolemy (N. lat. 27° 15'). This section concluded

with a visit to the turquoise diggings of Ziba; an inspection of the central

sulphur-hill, and the ascent of the mighty Sharr mountain which lies behind El-

Muwaylah. Geographically speaking, it was the most important, as it brought
back details of the Hisma or sandstone plateau bounding the ghats on the East

and of a huge volcanic tract called El-Harrah.

      3. The southern march, which began and ended at El-Wijh, covered the region

worked for gold by the ancients, and collected details, sketches, and plans of the

Amines open and closed.                                third sulphur-hill was explored ; the gold mine El-

Marwah of the mediaeval Arab geographers was satisfactorily identified, and a

classical shrine or temple was found upon the southern bank of the great Wady

Hamz.

    The expedition, which landed in Arabia on December 19th, 1877, left it on

April 18th, 1878. By sea and land, it had covered nearly 2500 miles ; of these

some 600 were mapped, the crucial stations being determined astronomically. It

had measured and planned fourteen settlements, some large enough to be called

cities, besides nearly thrice that number of ateliers. At least 200 sketches, oil-
                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  631

colours, water-colours, pencil drawings, and photographs were taken, besides twenty-
five tons of rock-specimens. The explorers brought back to Cairo a small ethno-
logical collection of stoue implements, rude and worked ; coins of ancient

Midian, mixed with Roman and Kufic ; fragments of copper and bronze, glass and
pottery; Nabathsean inscriptions and Arab tribe marks; skulls, spirit specimens
of zoology, shells from the shores of the Red Sea, and a /tortus siccus.

     Captain Burton ended his paper by noticing that the terms of the Anglo-Turkish
Convention have placed Great Britain, with reference to Arabia, nearly in the

same position as that occupied by Rome after the days of Augustus. He found the

land wasted and spoiled, far less civilised than it was in the nineteenth century
B.C. But he cherishes the conviction that Midian is fated to see better days, and
that by the development of her mineral wealth, under the fostering care of" Euro-

pean, and especially English companies, this forgotten California, now like Algeria

before 1830, will presently rival the rich and fruitful province of Algiers in 1878.

2. On a Journey to Fez and Mequinez. By A. Leared, M.D., F.B.G.S.,

                                                   M.B.I.A.

Dr. Leared, who, in May, 1877, accompanied the Portuguese Embassy to the

Sultan of Morocco, in addition to many interesting personal and historical details,

gives the following particulars of the country on the route followed from Tangier.

For some three and a half hours' ride, the land near the city is well cultivated, the

first halt being under a range of hills named Kaa-el-Urmil, near the river M'har.

After advancing close to the sea and crossing a plain, a river fifty yards wide was

forded, and the douar of Garbia reached, two hours from which is a thick grove of
Awild olive-trees, abounding in nightingales.
                                               succession of hill and plain, but

little cultivated, then followed, and Klatta de Raissana was reached, after fording

another considerable river. Next day, a great alluvial plain was traversed, through

which runs the small river M'Hassen, the distance from which to Alcassar-el-

Kebir (historically associated with the destruction of Don Sebastian and his army

by the Moors in 1578) is some ten miles of level, little cultivated land, becoming

an arid plain at two miles from the town. Dr. Leared estimates the inhabitants as

between 5000 and 6000, considering Rohlfs's number of 30,000 as much exa»ce-

rated. Beyond Alcassar, two miles of wide and paved footpath were followed,

ending at a ford across the Lucos, here about eighty yards broad. Still further on

the land was better cultivated, and wheat was being cut (May 25th). The encamp-

ment was in the midst of an immense tract, covered with hay going to waste. After

passing the bounds of the province of Larache, the river Guarot was crossed by a

ford about 50 yards wide, and a rolling prairie traversed, grass and flower-covered,

but with no tree or shrub. Ten miles further on, the douar or village of the go-
vernor of the Habassie tribe was reached; the next journey being throuo-han

immense level tract, with a sea-like horizon to the west. Much of this was culti-

vated with wheat and barley, with scattered douars and cattle ; but the greater
part was a fertile waste.- The Sebou, one of the chief rivers of Morocco, here

120 yards wide and of considerable depth, was then passed in flat-bottomed boats
Aand by swimming.
                   flat fertile country followed, with splendid wheat-crops

great tracts of a tall white-flowering wild umbelliferous plant were observed and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

a camp was made, close to the village of Bokhara, on the bank of the river Irrdrum,

a tributary of the Sebou, on a dead level plain, having to the south a fine aniphi-

theatre-like range of distant hills. Pour miles from this, after cresting the com-
mencement of a hilly country, and making a short descent, a halt was made at

Zacouta, on flat parched soil, deeply fissured by the summer heat, and abounding

with the lesser bustard, a bird not known near the coast. Leaving Zacouta, the

road lay through a succession of hills, on the slopes of which was much standing

corn ; and after a short journey, the party encamped under the mountain of Zar°

houn, on the south side of which, less than a mile distant, is the town and sanc-
tuary of Muley Edris-el-Keber. To the right, across a stream with deep banks,

and on higher ground, stand the ruins called Cassar Pharaon (Pharaoh's Castle),
632 BEPORT 1878.

12 miles N.E. of Mequinez, and 28 N.W. of Fez, identified by Dr. Leared as the

ancient city of Volubilis. After crossing some hills and a large plain, and camp-
               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                633

Wading by the  Cazar (river of trees), Mequinez itself was entered. This city-

is computed to be 157 miles from Tangier, and is more modern-looking than Fez,

with wider streets. It is surrounded with high walls, with towers and huge

gates, which swarm with hawks, jays, and pigeons, and having an outer circuit of

about five miles. The inhabitants are estimated at 25,000, including many Jews,

who, though, as usual, insulted and badly treated, contrive to prosper.

After sixteen days' residence in Mequinez and various state ceremonials, the

party started for Fez by the northern gate, near which are fine perennial springs.

WadOlive plantations of great extent, and an encampment near a small river, the

Jedida, 12 miles from the city, conspicuous for the plenty and beauty of its vegeta-

tion, were the only points noticed on the thirty-four miles' ride to Fez, which city

seemed to be about two and a half miles long, but narrow. It is surrounded by hills,

those on the south side being so close as to overlook the place, and is divided by the

river into Old and New Fez, a long street, only seven feet wide, running east and

west through the whole of the former division. Its population is estimated at

50,000. There is an extensive palace, Lallah Amina, at two miles' distance, in

the midst of a large garden. After a short stay of three days, the party left by a

route to the east of that usually followed, commencing with a broad aloe avenue,

Aand passing a small lake, white with salt after evaporation.  succession of hills

extended to Woled Jemah, the soil in the latter part being very thin and chalky,
but bearing a profusion of flowering caper bushes. Two hours from Woled Jemah

is a ford of the Sebou, 150 yards wide ; and after fording the wide river Wurga,
Hadcour was reached, and afterwards Alcassar. Leaving Alcassar, and crossing

the Lucos (a corruption of El Kus), the course lay westward through a country

studded with cork oak-trees until arriving at El Araish or Larache, picturesquely

situated at the mouth of the Lucos, with its treacherous sand-bar. Larache has a

population of about 4000, including one Englishman. After crossing the river in

a fourteen-oared galley, the route lay over sand-hills and elevations covered with

myrtles and other blooming shrubs, until at length the original road was struck at

Resana, and finally Tangier was reached.

in this comparatively unknown country.

4. On the Characteristic Features of Alaska, as developed by the JJ. S. Survey.

                             By W. H. Dall, U.S.C.S.

     The territory is divided, topographically, botanically, ethnologically, and in a
meteorological sense, into three regions. These regions are not, however, abso-
lutely coincident under the respective heads. The topographical regions are the
south-eastern or Sitkan region, remarkable for its rugged and elevated mountains
and numerous islands with bold shores ; the Aleutian, comprising the Aleutian
Islands and the peninsula of Aliaska, also partly mountainous, but of a different
character ; and lastly, the Yukon region, including the greater part of the area of
the territory and composed of the lowlands north of the Alaskan mountains and
the Arctic tundri, with, for the most part, shallow water along then* coasts. The
botanical <ind meteorological regions are mainly identical with the preceding, but
not absolutely so. The Sitkan region is characterised by dense forests of conifers
and many plants peculiar to the western slope of the continent; the Aleutian
region by an absence of trees, the great development of grasses and herbage,
numerous Ericace<r, and a more Arctic physiognomy. The Yukon region is marked
by the presence of birch, spruce, willow, and poplar, often forming large forests, of
a different character from those of Sitka, and, for the rest, by a chiefly Arctic flora.
Meteorologically, the Sitkan (as well as the British Columbian coast) is marked
634 report-- 1878.

by great precipitation and mild and equable temperature ; the Aleutian region, by
the prevalence of fog, a somewhat colder climate and a diminished rainfall and
the Yukon region by a truly Arctic climate with a small precipitation.

     The ethnological divisions comprise those areas inhabited by tribes of Innuit
stock, by the Tinneh or Athabascan tribes, and by the T'linkits or Kaloshians.
The latter inhabit the Sitkan region ; the Eskimo or Innuit the shores of the
Yukon and Aleutian regions eastward to Mount St. Elias ; and the Tinneh tribes
the interior, reaching the sea coast only at Cook's Inlet. The native population is
believed to number between 20,000 and 25,000, and the present white population

is very small.

     The commercial products of the different regions are also characteristic. The

Sitkan region, beside a small trade in continental furs, offers salmon, timber,

and minerals, the value of which has not yet been fully tested. The Aleutian
region is at present of most commercial importance, affording the sea-otter, fur-
seal, and cod-fish. From the Yukon region, come the ordinary continental furs,
while the adjacent seas support the whale and walrus fisheries.

     The Sitkan and Aleutian regions reproduce very nearly the conditions of the

coast of Norway, while the Yukon region may be compared to the Archangel

district of Russia.

     The tribes of Innuit stock (including the Aleuts) are generally of a peaceable
and tractable nature: those of Tinneh stock more independent, but still easily con-
trolled ; while the T'linkits are, of all American natives, the most intractable and

difficult to deal with.

    The T'linkits, while rejecting all attempts to subdue or improve them, have a well-
advanced semi-civilisation of their own, particularly shown in then- carvings,
advanced totemic system, mythology, and permanent dwellings. The Innuit,
though of shorter average stature than the whites, are a very different race physically
from their stunted cousins of Greenland, and are intelligent, athletic, and ingenious.
The Aleuts have already adopted many features of civilisation from the Russians.

     The Tinneh are nearly all in a condition similar to those of the Hudson Bay
Territory, but are much more amenable to improvement than the T'linkits. Al-

ready several missions have been established, with a tolerable prospect of success.
     The results obtained by the explorations of the Coast Survey are in process of

preparation for publication in detail, and will eventually be printed and issued
under the direction of the Superintendent of the Survey by the United States
Government.

5. On the Acquisition by England of Cyprus, and some Observations on the
            Islands in the Levant. By J. S. Phen)5, LL.D., F.S.A.

Dr. Phene described the physical features of the islands of Chios, Mytilene,

Lemnos, Imbros, Thasos, and Samothrace ; the relation of the Cyclades to the great
range of Pindus in lateral offsets, of which the Cyclades appeared to be the sum-

mits of former ranges, now (except as to these summits) submerged. Reference

was made to the great aqueous stratification in Asia Minor and Southern Thrace,

which, being undisturbed, could  not  (geologically speaking)  be  remote                                and  to  a
                                                                                                      ;

remarkable tradition given by Diodorus Siculus, that the Euxine had at a far

distant period burst its bounds, and rushed westward to the Mediterranean Sea,

that in this convulsion some of the islands had become submerged, and that the

champaign country of the island of Samothrace was permanently so, and that even

indications of cities by the recovery of parts of buildings from the sea were some-

times found. It was possible that this convulsion represented the sinking down of

the mountain ridges, of which the summits were now represented by the various

islands stretching south from the several headlands of the Peloponnesus. Dr. Phene

ascended Samothrace, and was, so far as he could learn on the island, the only per-

son not being a native who had made the ascent, which was very difficult. The

height was slightly over 5200 feet, but it was the whole climb of this from the sea

level. The climates, culture, and salubrity of the different islands were dwelt on;
Mytilene, from its rich gardens, good roads, and delightful air, being, with its

--splendid and secluded harbours the entrance to the larger one only requiring a little
--blasting to make it easy of ingress considered more adapted for British occupation

than Cyprus. Chios had also its advantages. Cyprus had a variety of climate, so
that the debility produced by the heats in the south could be relieved by a retreat
to the northern coast, which is cooled by the breezes coming from the Karamauian
mountains. It was our first acquisition towards the tactics of the ancient commer-
cial nations, both the Phoenicians and the Venetians having occupied Cyprus and
other Levantine islands.

 --3. Livingstonia. The Opening up of the East African Lake District.

                            By James Stevenson, F.R.G.S.
    FThis paper is in continuation of that read in Section at the Glasgow Meet-

ing of the British Association.

     The intention in founding settlements in South-Eastern Africa was the promo-
tion of the Christian civilization of the natives, especially by the system of
Industrial Missions, tried with success in Southern Africa.

     The new mission settlement was placed in the Nyassa region, which is accessible
by the only considerable rivers of Eastern Africa. The immediate results of its
establishment were eminently discouraging, for a hostile tariff was issued, and the
exclusive right of steam navigation on the rivers Zambesi and Shire was offered to

a Portuguese subject, the concession being for thirty years.

     This exclusiveness has gradually passed away. The slave-trade terminated by
treaty in 1877, and the Portuguese Legislature passed a tariff by which they limited
themselves to transit duties of 3 per cent, to countries situated beyond the conflu-
ence of the rivers Zambesi and Shire, and to other countries outside their provinces.

   A steam launch was got ready, and application made to use her for the purposes

of the settlement, which has resulted in the opening of the navigation of both

rivers. The launch, which will carry from 10 to 20 tons, is now on her way

to Quillimane.

     The Shire Junction road past the cataracts of the Shire is also under construc-
tion by Mr. Stewart, O.E., of which a section exhibited showed no gradients
exceeding 1 in 20. The steamer Ilala takes the traffic on to Livingstonia and the
north end of Lake Nyassa.

     To work this trade, the " Livingstonia Central Africa Company, Limited,"
has recently been formed in Glasgow.

     The tribes of Nyassa are of the Kaffir family of races, their languages being of
similar construction, although the tribes vary considerably from each other.

     In the Lower Shire, an industrious but unwarlike people, the Manganja, have as
their chiefs some of Livingstone's Makololo followers, who are opposed to slavery.

     The Upper Shire" and the southern part of Lake Nyassa are surrounded by chiefs

of the Ajawa race, who are still under Arab influence, but the slave trade is

gradually dying out since its prohibition on the coast.
      Towards the middle and north end of the lake, on the west side, the pressure

of a race called the Maviti or Mazitu is greatly felt by the inhabitants, who are
being gradually absorbed. These Maviti are Zulus who crossed the Zambesi forty
years ago. They retain the bull-hide shield and spear, and dress their hair in the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                 637

Kaffir ring, but are much mixed, and though retaining the tactics, have hardly the
courage of the Zulu race. Towards the north end, they have met with more war-
like races and have more of the characteristics of the Zulu. Their great chief or

Chipatula resides on the highest lands west of Nyassa, about the 11th degree of

latitude.

     The dominant power north of the lake is the kingdom of Usanga or Urori, of
which the chiefs are said to have come from Madagascar. The present chief is
MerertS, whose town is on the slope northwards of the Kondi mountains. Between
them and the lake are the Wachunga, belonging to Merere, without clothing,
but with some aptitude for industry.

     East of the lake, behind the Livingstone mountains, are said to be the Gwan-
gwaras, a very warlike people who work in iron.

     The people of the neighbourhood have latety grown provisions, sugar-cane, &c,
much more largely, finding a market at the settlement, and this if extended to
various articles by the action of the new Company will probably cause the

chiefs no longer to sell their people.
     The Livingstonia staif have also assisted in forming a settlement on the Shire

junction road, which will be of use to the people imder the Makololo Chief.
There is here a mission station with a school. The rearing of cattle has been
successful here, and also of European grain and vegetables, the site being 3500 feet

above the level of the sea.
     The next station is proposed to be near the centre of the west side of the lake,

with the hope of influencing the Maviti, of whom the older persons still speak Zulu.

While retaining Livingstonia as an important station, with a good harbour suitable
for commerce, experience shows that a higher portion should be sought. So far,
relations with the Maviti have been opened very favourably.

     Last year, a second circumnavigation of the lake was made by Dr. Stewart, of
Lovedale, and Dr. Laws, of Livingstonia. At the north end they commenced
intercourse with the natives at the Kambwe, about fifty miles, and at the
Rombashi, about fifteeen miles from the north-east termination of the lake.

     From the first they foimd that there was a rather mountainous approach to

Lake Tanganyika, and from the second one more level, but, finding the natives

excited by their sudden appearance, they only paved the way for future exploration.

Near the upper end of the Livingstone Mountains they saw what appeared to be a
gorge, extending towards S.E. by E. true, which they were informed was the pass
used in visiting the Gwangwaras. They intended to have visited Merere, whose
capital lies five days to the north of the Rombashi, but were prevented by the
attitude of the Wachungu, who, though cordial at first, threatened a coalition of
the neighbouring chiefs against them, the steamer eventually sailing to the

Kambwe to avoid a collision.

     The maps prepared in anticipation of exploration by the Mission parties were
found useful, the position of the mountain ranges, rivers, towns, and highways
having been estimated with sufficient accuracy to be a substantial guide. Native
information indicates that the distance between Lakes Tanganyika and Nyassa,
 which was a disputed point, is about 200 miles, which would require the accep-
 tance of Mr. Stanley's position of the south end of Tanganyika, which differs from
Livingstone's, or of a more easterly position of the north end of Lake Nyassa,
according to an observation taken on the Kondi Mountains, by the late Captain

 Elton's party.

      The Eucalyptus has been introduced with success on the low ground at
Livingstonia, and by the kindness of the Governor-General in Council at Madras,
Wardian cases, containing cinchona, tea, and coffee plants, have been sent there
and to Blantyxe.

5. On the Geographical Distribution of the Tea Plant.
                    By A. Bureell, F.8.S.

Tea, as a beverage, was known in Europe in the beginning of the sixteenth

century, became a regular article of consumption in the seventeenth, formed one of

the largest imports from China in the eighteenth, and is now the special beverage
of all English-speaking peoples, both in the New World and the Old. The botany,

method of culture, and modes of manipulation were, however, little known here

till about forty years ago. The Jesuit missionaries in China and Japan were our

first informants of the virtues of tea. The Portuguese and the Dutch, who, long

before our East India Company was established, traded with these countries,

introduced it commercially to Europe, and there is evidence of its use in Eng-

land in 1610, during the reign of James I. It was in common use during the

Commonwealth, and the first Act of Parliament after the Restoration was passed

to levy a heavy duty on it.

The tea plant first reached Europe in 1763, when Linnseus received a seedling.

The earliest plant that flowered and produced seed was at Zion House, near

London, in 1768. In China, the plant was in common use from the seventh cen-

tury ; in Japan, from the eighth. It grows in these countries up to 42° north
latitude, and is capable of being grown as far of south latidude, though the best tea

is produced in China between 27° and 30° north latitude. Up to the first quarter

of the present century, all the tea-consumption of the world was supplied from

China, with a very little from Japan. In 1827, the culture was introduced by the

Dutch in Java, and has ever since proved a successful undertaking. In 1834,

immediately after the abolition of the East India Company's monopoly of trade to

the East, tea was introduced from China into India, then first becoming a profitable

business. Next year, the plant was discovered growing wild in Assam. Tea, both

from the China plant and from this Assam kind, is now grown throughout all

India, and with the result that our great dependency is producing tea which

China, in her more palmy days, and less so than ever now, coidd not rival. India,

--beginning with a production of only four pounds in 1840, now sends into this country

forty millions of pounds as great a quantity as was consumed in the whole of the

·United Kingdom in 1837. In Asia, the tea plant is distributed in the Corea,

Tonquin, Cochin China, Annam, Ava, and Burma, where it is cultivated to some

extent, but only for native consumption. It was introduced to Brazil in 1827.

The French attempted its cultivation in 1841. It is now growing in Mauri-

tius, the Isle of France, St. Helena, at Singapore, in Ceylon, and our Australian

Colonies. In the West India Islands it has also been recently introduced, and a

good account of its condition in Jamaica has been given. Nor have our American

cousins neglected it. They sent to China in 1857 for plants, and tried the

culture near Washington, in Virginia, and Carolina ; quite recently they have tried

it in California, and near Baltimore. As to the original home of the tea plant, in

Japan it was admitted on all hands not to be indigenous. In China, it was long

held to be native to the soil, but more recent researches have thrown doubt on this

point, and the balance of evidence seems to point to the Assam Valley of India,

along the course of the Brahmapootra, as its original seat. This is supported by

the fact that, while in China the tea plant is never found thoroughly wild away

from man's habitation, and is more of a bush than a tree, in Assam, on the other

hand, and in the hill ranges surrounding that valley, it is found everywhere grow-

ing wild, and attaining great height, usually fifteen to twenty feet (and even by a

report just received from India, sixty to eighty feet), and of the girth of three to four

Afeet, among the secluded Naga hills.  long list of authorities, from Marco Polo

and his learned editor, Colonel Yule, the Jesuit Missionaries, and more recent tra-

vellers, down to the recent works of Richthofen, Margary, Baber, and Gill, all

afford evidence of the tea growing wild throughout the vast stretch of country

intervening between the frontiers of India and China, and on either side, and
                     TBANS ACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                                639

constantly of smaller dimensions as it approached China, thus supplying ground
for the contention, which is further supported by the legends of China and
Japan, that the tea plant was introduced there by a Buddhist missionary from

India.

6. Influence of the Straits of Dover on the Tides of the British Channel and

                  North Sea. By Sir William Thomson, F.B.S.

The conclusions are

     1. The rise and fall of the water surface, and the tidal streams throughout the
North Sea, north of the parallel of 53° (through Cromer in Norfolk and the North
Coast of Holland and Hanover) are not sensibly different from what they would

be if the passage through the Straits of Dover were stopped by a barrier.

     2. The main features of the tides (rise and fall and tidal streams) throughout
the British Channel, west of Beachy Head and St. Valery-en-Caux, do not differ
much from what they would be if the passage through the Straits were stopped

by a barrier between Dover and Cape Grisnez (Calais).

   A3. partial effect of the actual current through the Straits is to make the tides

throughout the Channel, west of a line from Hastings to the mouth of the

Somme, more nearly agree with what tbey would be were there a barrier along

this line, than what they would be if there were a barrier between Dover and Cape

Grisnez.

     4. The chief obviously noticeable effect of the openness of the Straits of Dover
on tides west of Beachy Head is that the rise and fall on the coast between
Christchurch and Portland is not much smaller than it is.

     5. The fact that the tidal currents to the westward commence generally an
hour or two before Dover high water, and to the eastward an hour or two before

Dover low water, instead of exactly at the times of Dover high and low water, is

also partially due to the openness of the Straits of Dover.

--6. The facts referred to in Nos. 4 and 5 are wholly due to two causes (1)
The
     openness  of the Straits  of Dover                                (2)  fluid  friction  (in eddies  along  the bottom
                                                                    ;

and in tide races). It is certain that (1) and it is probable that (2) is very

sensibly influential. Without farther investigation it would be vain to attempt

to estimate the proportionate contributions of the two causes to the whole effect.

7. It is certain that were the Straits of Dover barred, and were the water

frictionless, there would be a nodal line (or line of no rise and fall) across the
Channel from somewhere near St. Alban's Head on the English coast to somewhere

near Cape La Hogue'or Cherbourg or Cape Barfleur on the French coast ; that

west of this line the time of low water, and east of this line the time of high water,

would be exactly the same as the time of high water at Dover ; and that through-
out the Channel the water would be flowing eastwards while the tide is rising at

Dover, and westwards while the tide is falling at Dover.

8. Understanding from Fourier's 'Elementary Principles of Harmonic Analysis'

that all deviations from regular simple harmonic rise and fall of the tide within

twelve hours are to be represented by the superposition of simple harmonic oscil-

lations in six-hour period, four-hour period, three-hour period, and so on, like

the "overtones" which give the peculiar characters to different musical sounds of

the same pitch, the six-hourly oscillation which gives the double low water at Port-

land and the protracted duration of the high water at Havre,* is probably due to

French coast, the high water remains stationary for one hour, with a rise and fall of

quantity of water passing through the Straits per unit of time at any instant of the
twelve hours. The double high-water experienced at Southampton and in the
Solent and at Christchurch and Poole, and still further west, which is generally
attributed to the doubleness of the influence experienced from the tidal streams on
the two sides of the Isle of Wight, seems to have a continuity of cause with the
double low water at Portland, which is certainly allied to the protracted high water
of Havre, a phenomenon quite beyond reach of the Solent's influence. It is pro-
bable, therefore, that the double high water in the Solent and at Christchurch and
Poole is influenced sensibly by the current through the Straits of Dover ; even

though the common explanation, attributing them to the Isle of Wight, be in the
main correct.
     Section F.--ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

--President of the Section Professor J. K. Ingram, LL.D., F.T.C.D., M.E.I.A

                                                           THURSDAY, AUGUST 15, 1878.

          Professor Ingram gave the following Address :

Had I been called upon at any other time to preside over this Section, I should

have followed the example of most of my predecessors, in selecting as the subject

of the discourse which it is usual to deliver from this chair, some one of the

special economic questions of the day, which my knowledge might have enabled
me most adequately, or, let me rather say, least inadequately to treat. But I have

felt that the matter with which I should deal has been practically determined for

me beforehand. An important crisis in the history of our Section has taken place.

Its claim to form a part of the British Association has been disputed. Some of

the cultivators of the older branches of research but half recognize the right of

Political Economy and Statistics to citizenship in the commonwealth of science

and it is not obscurely intimated on their part that these studies would do well to

relinquish pretensions which cannot be sustained, and proceed, with or without

shame, to take the lower room to which alone they are entitled.

    How far this sentiment is entertained by those who would be recognized as

the best representatives of the mathematical, physico-chemical and biological

sciences, I am unable to say. But it is natural to suppose that no one clothed

with an official character in the Association could have assumed towards us such

an attitude as I have described, unless supported by a considerable weight of

opinion amongst those within the body who are regarded as competent judges.

-- --Still more and this is what lends a peculiar gravity to the incident such a step

could scarcely have been taken if the general mass of the intelligent public enter-

tained strong convictions as to the genuinely scientific character of political

economy, as it is usually professed and understood amongst us. It is, in fact, well

known that there is a good deal of scepticism current on this question. There
may be seen in various quarters evidences sometimes of contemptuous rejection of

its claims, sometimes of uneasy distrust as to their validity. And even amongst
those who admit its services in the past, there is a disposition to regard it as

essentially effete, and as having no scientific or practical future before it.

    When some of our leading economists met not long ago to celebrate the cen-

tenary of the publication of the ' Wealth of Nations,' it was plain from the tone
of most of the speakers that the present position of their studies, as regards their

general acceptation and public influence, was considered to be far from satis-

factory.

    " To those who are interested in economic science," says a recent writer in

' Mind,' " few things are more noticeable than the small hold which it has upon

the thoughts of our generation. Legislation has been directly influenced by it in
the past, and the results of the application of its doctrines are manifest in every

department of  our laws                                    yet in spite of  its triumph in this  region, we find  a wide-

spread tendency to look on its teaching with suspicion."

" I seem to observe," said Professor Cairnes in 1870, " in the literature and

1878.                                                                       TT

social discussions of the day, signs of belief that political economy has ceased to

he a fruitful speculation ; nay, I fear I must go further and admit that it is regarded

--by some energetic minds in this country as even worse than unfruitful as obstruc-

--tive a positive hindrance in the path of useful reform. ... It is not denied that

the science has done some good ; only it is thought that its task is pretty well

fulfilled."

     The attitude which the working classes generally take up with respect to
political economy, may be seen from Mr. Howell's candid and instructive book on
the Conflicts of Capital and Laboiu\

     Professor Jevons has recognized quite recently the state of facts indicated by

these testimonies, though he has no misgiving as to any grounds for it in the

--current methods or doctrines of political economy ; if the public do not like the

science, so much the worse, he thinks, for the public " the fact is," he says, "that
just as physical science was formerly hated, so now there is a kind of ignorant dislike
And impatience of political economy."

     It is plain, therefore, that the low estimate of the studies of our Section which
is entertained by some members of the Association, is no isolated phenomenon, but

--is related to a mass of opinion outside the body that, in fact, the crisis which, as I

have said, has shown itself in the Association with respect to our Section, is only

the counterpart, -in a more limited sphere, of a crisis in the history of economic

--science, which is apparent on the face of English and, as I shall point out by and
--by, not of English only, but of European thought. It is important to understand

the origin and significance of this state of things ; and to that subject, accordingly,

I purpose to direct your attention.

   We must take care to distinguish, at the outset, between two views which are

--sometimes confounded namely, between the opinion that economic facts do not

admit of scientific investigation, and the quite different opinion that the hitherto

prevailing mode of studying those facts is unsatisfactory, and many of the current
generalizations respecting them unsound. That economic phenomena are capable

of scientific treatment is a proposition which I do not intend to spend time in

demonstrating. It is comprehended in the more general question of the possibility

of a scientific Sociology ; and any one who disputes it will have enough to do in

combating the arguments by which Comte, and Mill, and Herbert Spencer have

established that possibility. Nor do I intend to waste words in showing that, if
there be a science of society, no other branch of investigation can compete with it
in importance or in dignity. It has the most momentous influence of all on human

welfare. It receives contributions from all other departments of research

whether in the ascertainment of results to be used for its purposes, or in the

elaboration of methods to be applied in its inquiries. It presides, in fact, over the

--whole intellectual system an office which some, mistaking the foundation for the

crown of the edifice, have claimed for Mathematics. It is the most difficult of all

the sciences, because it is that in which the phenomena dealt with are most com-

plex and dependent on the greatest variety of conditions, and in which, accordingly,

appearances are most deceitful, and error takes the most plausible forms. That the

-- --professors of the more stably because earlier constituted branches of knowledge

should ignore the claims of this great department of inquiry would be doubly

--disastrous first, by leaving the scientific system without its necessary com-

pletion in a true theory of the highest and most important class of phenomena

accessible to our researches                                                                                                    and secondly, by tending, so far as prejudice and mis-
                                                                                                                             ;

conception can temporarily produce such an effect, to hand over to minds of insuffi-

cient power, and destitute of the necessary preparation, studies which, more than

any others, require a strong intelligence, disciplined in the methods and furnished

mywith the results of the sciences of inorganic and organic nature. There is, in

judgment, no duty more incumbent in our day on the professors of these last, than

that of recognizing the claims of Sociology, whilst at the some time enforcing^ on

its cultivators the necessity of conforming to the genuine scientific type. Yet it is
now sought to expel from this Association, which ought to represent the har-

monious union of all positive research, the very limited and inadequate portion of

the science of society which has ever found recognition in its scheme.

I assume, then, that economic phenomena are proper subjects for scientific
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  643

 treatment. This I imagine the public at large are not disposed to doubt,

 though they may not repose much confidence in the methods actually followed.

 But, strangely enough, a professor of political economy has recently disputed the

 possibility, or at least the utility, of a scientific handling of economic questions.

 Professor Bonamy Price, of the University of Oxford, who has published a volume
 in which several of those questions are handled with much ability and freshness of
 treatment, not only repudiates a scientific character for his own inquiries, hut

 alleges the scientific method to be a mistake. According to him, ordinary people
 are right in believing that they can arrive at truth on these questions by the aid of

--their natural lights, by their untrained sagacity, that they can take a shorter

 and far clearer path through their own observations, than through what he calls

 " the tangled jungle of scientific refinements." In plain terms, he is in favour

--of relegating the study of economic phenomena to the domain of empiricism to

 what is called the common sense of practical men.

    A more fatal suggestion coidd not, in my judgment, be made. I shall have to

 express the opinion, that the prevalent methods of economic research and exposition

 are open to grave criticism ; but how can this be remedied by throwing ourselves on
 the undisciplined and random inspirations of so-called common sense ? It was " com-
 mon sense " that long upheld the mercantile system ; and indeed there is scarcely
any error that it lias not, at different times, accepted and propagated. What

 security can there be in this as in other branches of inquiry against endless aberra-

tions and confusions, but systematic observation and analysis of the phenomena,
 resulting in a body of ascertained and reasoned truth ; and what is this but science ?

I am forced to say that Professor Price seems to me to labour under radical mis-

 conception as to the nature and conditions of science. Because the facts of the
 production and distribution of wealth have always gone on spontaneously amongst
 mankind, and definite modes of social action with respect to them have progres-

 sively established themselves, economic investigation, he argues, adding nothing to

what men have with more or less sagacity and intelligence always practised, can-
 not be regarded as having the nature of a science. But it might be similarly shown
that there is no science of human nature, for the intellectual processes, the feelings,
and the practical tendencies of man have always been similar; they have not

 waited for science to develop themselves and pass into action; rather their long
continued spontaneous action was the necessary condition of the science that studies

--them. So, too, with respect to all human action on external nature practice

always must precede theory ; art, more or less intelligent, must precede science.

 Science is simply the ascertainment and co-ordination of laws ; a law is the state-

 ment of a general fact ; we explain a particular fact by showing that it is a case of
 a more general fact. Now, from the beginning to the end of his own book, Pro-

--fessor Price is endeavouring to ascertain such general facts, and to explain particular

 facts by means of them in other words, he is busied upon science without knowing

it. He rests much of the importance of economic studies, which he regards as

 essentially practical, on their efficacy for uprooting the evil weed of false theory
but theory of some sort will always be necessary. On ne detruit que ce qiCon rem-
 place ; and the only way of extinguishing false theory is to establish the true.

      I therefore repudiate the doctrine of Professor Price, and I hold by the truth,

 which has indeed now become a philosophic commonplace, that social phenomena

 generally, and amongst them the economic phenomena of society, do admit of
 scientific treatment. But I believe, though on different grounds from his, that the
 mode in which the study of these phenomena has been conceived and prosecuted in

 the hitherto reigning school, is open to serious objections ; and the decline in the

 credit and influence of political economy, of which I have spoken, appears to me

 to be in a large measure due to the vicious methods followed by its teachers. The

 distrust of its doctrines manifested by the working classes is no doubt in a great
 degree owing to the not altogether imfounded belief, that it has tended to justify too

 absolutely existing social arrangements, and that its study is often recommended with
 the real, though disguised, object of repressing popular aspirations after a better

order of things. And it is doubtless true that some of the opposition which political

·economy encounters, is founded on the hostility of selfish interests, marshalled

                                                                          tt2

against the principles of free-trade, of which it is regarded as the representative.
But it is not with manifestations of this kind, which belong to politics rather

than philosophy, that I am now chiefly concerned. It is more appropriate to this

--place to point to the growing coldness or distrust exhibited by the higher intellects

towards political economy a fact which lies on the surface of things, and shows
itself everywhere in contemporary literature. The egoistic spirit in which it is

steeped may explain the continued protest which Oarlyle and Ruskin have, mainly

--as moral preachers, maintained against it though that very spirit is, as I shall

show, closely connected with vicious method. But what are we to say of Miss

Martineau's final judgment? Speaking in her 'Autobiography' of that part of
her career in which, as Professor Jevons says, " she successfully popularized the
truths of political economy in her admirable tales," she tells us that what she then
took to be the science of political economy as elaborated by the economists of our

--time, she had come to regard as being no science at all, strictly speaking. " So

many of its parts," she adds, " must undergo essential change, that it may be a
question whether future generations will owe much more to it than the benefit

 (incalculable to be sure) of establishing the grand truth, that social affairs proceed
according to great general laws, no less than natural phenomena of every kind."
Here is a conclusion resting essentially on intellectual, not moral, grounds ; and 1
presume Professor Jevons will not explain it as a result of ignorant impatience.

     But it is no longer necessary to consider scattered indications of the feeling of
eminent individualities on this matter, for of late years the growing dissatisfaction
has risen to the dimensions of a European revolt, whose organs have appeared not
in the ranks of general literature, but within the sphere of economic investigation
itself. It is a characteristic result of the narrowness and spirit of routine which
have too much prevailed in the dominant English school of economists, that they
are either unacquainted with, or have chosen to ignore, this remarkable movement.

     The largest and most combined manifestation of the revolt has been in Germany,
all whose ablest economic writers are in opposition to the methods and doctrines of
the school of Ricardo. Roscher, Knies, Hildebrand, Nasse, Brentano, Held,
Schmoller, Schaffle, Schbnberg, Samter, and others, have taken up this attitude.

In Italy a group of distinguished writers, amongst whom are named Luzzatti,

Forti, and Lampertico, follow the same direction, and have a special organ in
which they advocate then- views. In Denmark a similar scientific evolution is in
Srogress, chiefly under the leading of Frederiksen. The eminent Belgian publicist,

  [. de Laveleye, has done much to call attention to these new tendencies of

economic doctrine, in which he himself participates. In England a corresponding
movement, by no means imitative, but on the contrary, highly original in character,

is represented by Mr. Gliffe Leslie, whom I mention with pride as an alumnus of

this University. In France, the new direction is not so marked in the economic
world, strictly so called, though in that country it really first appeared. For the
vices of the old school, which have led to the development of the new, were power-
fully stated more than forty years ago by a French thinker, who is too little studied
by the mass of his countrymen, Auguste Oomte, the greatest master who has ever

treated of sociological method. How far the Germans may have been led by

national prejudice to ignore his influence in the formation of their views, I will not
undertake to say ; but there is no doubt of the fact that the tendencies they have
sought to impress on economic studies are largely in accordance with the teaching
on that subject contained in his ' Philosophie Positive.'

     In the admirable chapters of that work, in which he described the normal con-

ditions and method of social science, whilst paying a warm tribute to the merits of
Adam Smith, he criticized what he considered the aberrations of later political
economists. The late Professor Cairnes, of whom, as a member of this University,
we are justly proud, and whom, even when I differ from him, I name 'with all the

respect due to an able and earnest searcher after truth, attempted an answer to
some of these strictures of Comte, which again elicited a reply from Mr. Frederic
Harrison. Considering the criticisms of the great Frenchman to have been per-

fectly just when he wrote them, and only requiring a certain correction now in
view of the healthier tendencies apparent in several quarters since his work was
                                                                                            TMANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                     645

published, I shall dwell at some length on the several grounds of his censures,

stating and illustrating them in my own way, which will differ considerably from

the mode of treatment which they received in the controversy to which I have

--referred. Those grounds, though nowhere by him formally enumerated, are essen-

tially reducible to four, having relation first, to the attempt to isolate the study

of the facts of wealth from that of the other social phenomena ; secondly, to the

metaphysical or viciously abstract character of many of the conceptions of the

economists                                              thirdly, to                         the abusive  preponderance of         deduction in  their  processes

of research                                             and        fourthly, to the         too          absolute way in which         their conclusions   are
                                                    ;

conceived and enunciated. It will be found that these heads cannot be kept strictly

apart, but run into each other at several points. The separation of them will,
however, serve to give distinctness and order to the discussion.

     I. The first objection is, as I have stated, to the pretension of the economists to

isolate the special phenomena they study, the economic phenomena of society, from
all the rest--its material aspect from its intellectual, moral, and political aspects,
and to constitute an independent science, dealing with the former alone, to the

exclusion of the latter. This question as to the relation of economic studies to the

general body of human knowledge, is really the most radical and vital that can be

raised respecting them, and on it more than on any other depends, in my opinion,

the future of these studies.

     It is sometimes sought to get rid of this question in a very summary manner,
and to represent those who raise it either as weakly sentimental persons, who shrink
from studying the conditions of wealth apart, because there are better and higher

things than wealth                                                                          or as persons of confused intellect,  who  wish to  mix together
                                                                                         ;

things which are essentially different in their nature. On the former of these im-

putations it is unnecessary to dwell. I am far from undervaluing sentiment in its

proper sphere                                                      but I take up no         sentimental  ground on                the present   question.  In
                                                                ;

denying the propriety of isolating economic investigation, I appeal to considerations

derived from the philosophy of science. The second allegation is, therefore, the only

one with which I am now concerned.

--"WeIn a recent elementary treatise                                                        on political  economy, by                  a well-known    writer,

_
it is argued:                                                                               must do one thing at a time; we cannot learn the social

sciences all at the same time. No one objects to astronomy that it treats only of

the stars, or to mathematics that it treats only of numbers and quantities. . . There

must be many physical sciences, and there must be also many social sciences, and

each of these sciences must treat of its own proper subject, and not of things in

general."

     But a little consideration will show that these remarks touch only the outside

of the question. Of course we must do only one thing at a time. Only one out of

several branches of a subject can be considered at a time ; but they are yet branches

of a single subject, and the relations of the branches may be precisely the most

important thing to be kept in view respecting them. It might be said : " It is

important, no doubt, that plant life and animal life should both be understood

but zoology and botany are different sciences ; let them be studied apart ; let a

separate class of savants be appropriated to each, and every essential end is secured."

--But what says Professor Huxley, in unison with all the most competent opinion on

the subject ? " The study of living bodies is really one discipline, which is divided

into zoology and botany simply as a matter of convenience." They are, in fact,

branches from the common stem of Biology, and neither can be rightly conceived

Nowwithout bearing this in mind.                                                                         I maintain that for still stronger reasons the

several branches of social science must be kept in the closest relation.

    Another biological analogy will place these reasons in the clearest light. When
we pass from the study of the inorganic world to that of the organic, which pre-

supposes and succeeds to the former, we come upon the new idea of a living whole,

with definite structures appropriated to special actions, but all influencing one

another, and co-operating to one result--the healthy life of the organism. Here,

then, it is plain that we cannot isolate the study of one organ from that of the rest,
Weor of the whole.
                                                                                            cannot break up the study of the human body into a number

of different sciences, dealing respectively with the different organs and functions,
646 eepoet-- 1878.

and, instead of a human anatomy and physiology, construct a cardiology, a hepat-

--ology, an enterology. It is not of course meant that special studies of particular

organs and functions may not he undertaken that they may not he temporarily

and provisionally separated from each other in our researches ; hut the fact insisted
on is, that it is essential to keep in view their relations and interactions, and that

therefore they must be treated as ·forming part of the subject-matter of one and

--the same science. And what is thus true of theory is also true of practice the

physician who had studied only one organ and its function would be very untrust-

worthy even in the therapeutics of that organ. lie who treats every disease as

purely local, without regard to the general constitution, is a quack ; and he who

ignores the mutual action of the physique and the moral in disease, is not properly

a physician, but a veterinary.

These considerations are just as applicable, mutatis mutandis, to the study of

society, which is in so many respects kindred to biology. The most characteristic
fact about what is well called the social system, is the consensus of its different

functions                                              and the  treatment of these  functions as  independent is sure  to land us
                                                    ;

in theoretic and practical error. ' There is one great science of Sociology; its

several chapters study the several faces of social existence. One of these faces is

that of the material well-being of society, its industrial constitution and develop-

ment. The study of these phenomena is one chapter of Sociology, a chapter which

must be kept in close relation with the rest.

    The justice of this view is clearly seen when we consider the two-fold aspect of

--Sociology as statical and dynamical that is, as dealing on the one hand with

laws of coexistence, and on the other with laws of succession. As in biology we

have, alongside of the theory of the constitution and actions of an organism, the-

further theory of its development in time ; so in Sociology we have, beside the doc-

trine of the constitution and actions of society, the doctrine of its evolution from a

Nowprimitive to a higher condition.                                                 nothing is plainer than that in the course of

the human evolution the several social elements did not follow separate and in-

dependent processes of growth. The present economic state, for example, of the

nations of western Europe, as a group, or of any individual one amongst them,,

is the result of a great variety of conditions, many of them not in their own nature

economical at all. Scientific, moral, religious, political ideas and institutions have

all concurred in determining it. But if they worked in this manner in the past, it

follows that they are working so in the present. It is therefore impossible ration-

ally to conceive or explain the industrial economy of society without taking into,

account the other coexisting social factors.

In nothing is the eminent superiority of Adam Smith more clearly seen than in

his tendency to comprehend and combine in his investigations all the different

aspects of social phenomena. Before the term " social science " had been spoken

or written, it could not be expected that he should have conceived adequately the

--nature and conditions of that branch of inqvu'ry, much less founded it on definitive

bases a task which was to be achieved more than fifty years later by the genius

of Conite. But he proceeded as far in this direction as it was possible to do under

the intellectual conditions of his time. In his ' Theory of Moral Sentiments ' he

promises to give in another discourse " an account of the general principles of law

and government, and of the different revolutions they have undergone in the dif-

ferent ages and periods of society, not only in what concerns justice, but in what

concerns police, revenue, and arrns, and whatever else is the subject of law.""
Here is no separation of politics, jurisprudence, and political economy, but rather

--an anticipation, wonderful for his period, of general sociology, both ' statical and

dynamical an anticipation which becomes more extraordinary still, when we

learn from his literary executors that he had formed the plan of a connected his-

tory of the liberal sciences and elegant arts, which would have supplied, in addition

to the social aspects already mentioned, a view of the intellectual progress of

society. Of this last undertaking there remains to us only the remarkable essay
                                     _

on the history of astronomy, which is evidence at once of his thorough acquaint-

ance with that branch of science, and of his profound philosophical conceptions on

the nature of scientific inquiry in general. The other project too was never fully
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  647

carried out ; it may well be thought because it was essentially premature. The
' Wealth of Nations ' is in fact a part of that larger design ; and though in this

work he has for his main subject the economic phenomena of society, he has in-
corporated into it so much that relates to the other social aspects that he has on
this very ground been censured by some of the later economists. Mill, however,

who of all his English successors was the most large-minded and the best equipped

in respect of general culture, has recognised it as the great characteristic excel-
lence of Smith that " in his applications of political economy, he perpetually

appeals to other and often far larger considerations than pure political economy
aftords." In consequence of this admirable breadth of view, the study of the work

of Adam Smith is, I believe, more fitted than that of the writings of any other
economist, to cultivate in theorists a philosophic, and in practical men a statesman-

like, habit of mind.

     In striking contrast with this spirit of the master is the affectation, habitual in
his followers, of ignoring all considerations except the strictly economic, though
in doing so they often pass over agencies which have important effects on material

well-being. Thus, when Senior is led to make some observations of the utmost

importance and interest, on the very doubtful advantage to a labouring family of
the employment of the mother and the children in non-domestic work, he thinks
it necessary to apologise for having introduced such remarks, as not, perhaps,

strictly within the province of political economy. And when he finds himself

similarly induced to observe on the evils of severe and incessant labour, and the

--benefits of a certain degree of leisure subjects so momentous to working men,
--and closely connected with their material as well as moral condition he pauses

and corrects himself, admitting that he should not only be justified in omitting,
but perhaps was bound to omit, all considerations which have no influence on
wealth. This is the very pedantry of purism ; and the purism is not merely ex-
aggerated, it is really altogether out of place. Mill, though, as I believe, he did

--not occupy firm ground in relation to the constitution of social science, is free from

any such narrowness as this : " For practical purposes," he says, " political
ecunomy is inseparably intertwined with many other branches of social philosophy.
Except on matters of mere detail, there are perhaps no practical questions, even
among those which approach nearest to the character of purely economical ques-
tions, which admit of being decided on economical premises alone." This is true
but it is only part of the truth. For purposes of theory as well as of practice, the
several branches of social inquiry are inseparably intertwined ; and this larger
proposition Mill in another place has stated with all the desirable fulness of enun-
ciation, declaring that" we can never understand in theory or command in practice
the condition of a society in any one respect, without taking into consideration its

condition in all other respects."

     Yet, notwithstanding this ample admission, he appears to exhibit some uncer-

tainty of view with respect to the relation of economic studies to general sociology;
at least after repeated careful examination of all that he has written on the subject,
I confess myself unable to understand exactly the position he occupies. Sometimes

he speaks of political economy as being a department "carved" (to use his own

expression) "out of the general body of the science of society;" and again he
speaks of it as belonging to a subordinate order of specidation to that with which

--the science of society is conversant proposing to itself a quite different sort of

question, and supplying only a sort of knowledge sufficient for the more common
exigencies of daily political practice. The latter view is apparently reflected in
the title of his economical treatise, which is called ' Principles of Political Economy,

with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy,' a phrase which seems to
imply that political economy is not a part of social philosophy at all, but is pre-

paratory and ancillary to it. And it is interesting to observe that it was from this
point of view of the study, as preliminary only and intended to prepare the way

 and provide materials for a true science of society, that Comte, in his correspond-
 ence with Mill, encouraged the latter in his project of a special treatise on political

economy.

      The ground which the economists commonly take up in justifying their one-
648 report-- 1878.

sided attitude, is this : they announce that their treatment of every question is
partial and incomplete, and that for a real solution all the other elements involved

must be taken into account. Political economy, Professor Oairnes tells us, is ab-

solutely neutral as between all particular schemes and systems of social or indus-

trial life. It furnishes, he tells us, certain data that go towards the formation of a

sound opinion, but can never determine our final judgment on anv social question.

Now this systematic indifferentism amounts to an entire paralysis of political

economy as a social power capable of producing or confirming in the mass of the

community just convictions on the most important of all subjects. How, it may

well be asked, are sufficiently fixed and convergent opinions on such matters to be

Howgenerated in the public mind ?  are the scattered lights, supplied by the

several partial and one-sided studies of human affairs, to be combined, so as to

convey social truth to the understanding, and impress its practical consequences on

--men's consciences ? These queries bring into the clearest light the doctrine I wish

to commend to your attention namely, that what is wanted for this purpose is &

study of social questions from all the points of view that really belong to them, so

--as to attain definite and matured conclusions respecting them in other words, a

scientific sociology, comprehending true economic doctrine, but comprehending also

a great deal more.

Even on the special subjects in which purely economic considerations go for

most, it will not do to take into account those considerations only. Professor

Fawcett, in his recent timely and useful treatise on Free-trade and Protection, finds

that he cannot restrict himself, in the treatment of that question, to the economic

point of view. " As complaints," he says, " are constantly made by protectionists

that their opponents persistently ignore all the results of protection which are

not economic, I will be careful to consider those results." And he goes on to

maintain the proposition, in which I entirely concur, that protection may produce

social and political consequences even far more mischievous than the economic

loss it causes to a country. I believe that the most effective weapons against

this and other economic errors will often be found in reasons not based on

material interests, but derived from a consideration of the higher ends of society,

and the ideal of the collective fife of the race. And, a fortiori, when we have to

deal with the larger economic subjects, now rapidly increasing in urgency, which

are more immediately in contact with moral conceptions, these questions of the

ultimate ends of the social union cannot be left out of sight. This was recognised

by Mill, who was open to all noble ideas, and saw that the practical life of man-

--kind cannot be governed by material egoism. In discussing the claims of Com-

munism, he says: "Assuming all the success which is claimed for this state of

society by its partisans, it remains to be considered how much would be really

gained for mankind, and whether the form that would be given to life, and the

character which would be impressed on human nature, can satisfy any but a very

low estimate of the capabilities of the species." Here, you observe, is raised the

entire question of the ends of social life ; and economic progress is subordinated,

as it ought to be, to the intellectual and moral development of humanity.

    Mr. Lowe, at the Adam Smith celebration, declared himself not to be sanguine

as to the future of political economy ; he believes that its great work, which he

justly remarks has been rather a negative than a constructive one, has been already

accomplished, and that not much more remains to be achieved. Such, indeed, as
we have seen, Professor Oairnes declared to be the prevalent idea of the great

  --_

majority of educated people that political economy has fulfilled its task by

--removing impediments to industry ; and that it cannot help us is rather likely to
--be an obstruction in the social work which now lies before us. I will not use

language so strong ; but it does appear to me that either as a fruitful branch of

speculation, or as an important source of practical guidance, it will cease to command,

or rather will fail to regain attention, unless it be linked in close connection with

--the general science of society unless it be, in fact, subsumed under and absorbed

into Sociology.

II. The second common error of the political economists since the time of Adam

Smith, consists in this, that, mainly by the influence of Eicardo, they have been led to
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                                                                                                                                              649

conceive and present, in a viciously abstract way, the conceptions with which they

deal.

      Abstraction is, indeed, necessary to all science, being implied in the search after

unity amidst variety. The criterion of true or false science lies precisely in the
right or wrong institution of the relation between the abstract and the concrete.
Now, in matters of human life especially, we have only to carry abstraction far
enough in order to lose all hold on realities, and present things quite other than they

in fact are ; and, if we use these abstractions in the premises of our reasonings, we

shall arrive at conclusions, either positively false, or useless for any practical purpose.

As Comte remarked, the most fundamental economic notions have been subtilized in

the ordinary treatises, till the discussions about them often wander away from any

relation to fact, and lose themselves in a region of nebulous metaphysics so that
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

exact thinkers have felt themselves obliged to abandon the use of some of the most

necessary terms, such as value, utility, production, and to express the ideas they

attach to them by circuitous phrases. I am far from condemning the effort after

accuracy of language and well-defined terms                                                                                                                                                                                    but the endless fluctuations of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

economists in the use of words (of which numerous examples are given in Senior's

Appendix to Whately's ' Logic,' and in Professor Price's recent work) certainly indi-

cate a very general failure to apprehend and keep steadily in view the corresponding

realities.

    A vicious abstraction meets us on the very threshold of political economy. The

entire body of its doctrines, as usually taught, rests on the hypothesis that the sole

human passion or motive which has economic effects, is the desire of wealth. " It
aims," says Mill, " at showing what is the course of action into which mankind

--living in a state of society would be impelled if that motive" except so far as it is
--checked by aversion to labour, and desire of present indulgence "were absolute

master of all their actions." " So strictly is this its object/' he adds, " that even

the introduction of the principle of population interferes with the strictness of
scientific arrangement." But what is the desire of wealth ? It is, as Mr. Leslie

--says in an article in ' Hermathena,' in which he urges the necessity for a new

method in political economy it is a general name for a great variety of wants,
desires, and sentiments, widely differing in their economic character and effect, and
undergoing fundamental changes in some respects in the successive periods of
society. As moralists, viewing the same abstraction, not as a condition of well-
being, but as the root of all evd, "have denounced under the common name of love

of wealth, not only sensuality, avarice, and vanity, but the love of life, health,

cleanliness, decency, and art, so all the needs, appetites, tastes, aims and ideas
which the various things comprehended in the word ' wealth ' satisfy, are lumped

together in political economy as a principle of human nature, which is the source
of industry and the moving principle of the economic world." The motives
summed up in the phrase vary in different individuals, different classes, different

nations, different sexes, and especially in different states of society ; in these last,

indeed, the several desires comprehended under the general name follow definite

-- --laws of succession. The point Mr. Leslie here insists on is, be it observed, not

merely though that is also true that the phrase desire of wealth represents a coarse

and crude generalization in the natural history of man ; but that the several im-
pulses comprised under the name assume altered forms and vary in their relative

strength, and so produce different economic consequences, in different states of
society ; and therefore that the abstraction embodied in the phrase is too vague and
unreal for use in economic investigations of a really scientific character. The special
desire for accumulation, apart from the immediate or particular uses of wealth, is
no doubt a principle of social growth which must not be overlooked ; but this, too,
takes different directions and works to different ends in different stages of social
development. All these economic motors require to be made the subjects of careful
and extensive observation ; and their several forms, instead of being rudely massed

together under a common name, should be discriminated as they in fact exist. The
consumption, or more correctly the use, of wealth, until lately neglected by econo-
mists, and declared by Mill to have no place in their science, must, as Professor
Jevons and others now see, be systematically studied in its relations to production
650 beport-- 1878.

and to the general material well-being of communities. And none of these things-

can he really understood without correct views of the structure and evolution of

society in all its aspects ; in other words, we are led back to the conclusion, that

they cannot he fruitfully treated apart from general sociology. I have not been
ahle to do more than indicate the leading features of a criticism which I recommend

all who are interested in the subject to pursue in its full development in Mr. Leslie's

admirable essay.

    There is a common economic abstraction, which, by the unsympathetic colour it

has given to political economy, has tended, perhaps more than anything else, to

repel the working classes from its study. By habitually regarding labour "from the

abstract point of view, and overlooking the personality of the labourer, economists
are led to leave out of account some of the considerations which most seriously

affect the condition of the working man. He comes to be regarded exclusively as

--an agent I might almost say, an instrument of production. It is too often for-
--gotten that he is before all things a man and a member of society that he is

usually the head of a household, and that the conditions of his life should be such

--as to admit of his maintaining the due relations with his family that he is also a

citizen, and requires for the intelligent appreciation of the social and political
system to which he belongs a certain amount of leisure and opportunity for mental

culture. Even when a higher education is now sought for him, it is often con-
ceived as exclusively designed to adapt him for the effective exercise of his functions

as a producer, and so is reduced to technical instruction ; whereas moral and social
ideas are for him, as for all of us, by far the most important, because most directly
related to conduct. Labour, again, is viewed as a commodity for sale, like any
other commodity ; though it is plain that, even if it could be properly so called at
all, yet in some particulars, as in the difficulty of local transfer (a family having to
be considered), and in the frequent impossibility of waiting for a market, it is quite

exceptional amongst commodities. By a further abstraction, the difference of the
social vocations of the sexes is made to disappear, in economic as in political rea-
soning, by means of the simple expedient of substituting for man in every proposi-
tion^e/-sow or human being; and so, by little else than a trick of phraseology, self-sup-
port is made as much an obligation of the woman as of the man. It is true that un-
generous sentiment has much to do with the prevalence of these modes of thought

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \

but what it is most suitable to insist on here, is that the science on which they
rest, or in which they find justification, is false science. By merely keeping close
to facts and not hiding realities under lax generalizations, we shall be led to more
humane, as well as truer, conceptions of the proper conditions of industrial life.

     It is a characteristic feature of the metaphysical habit of mind (using that
phrase in the sense with which Comte has familiarized us) to mistake creations of

the speculative imagination for objective realities. Examples of this tendency
have not been wanting in the dominant system of political economy. The most
remarkable is perhaps furnished by the ' Theory of the Wages Fund.' The history
of that doctrine is instructive, but I cannot here enlarge upon it ; it may suffice to
say that though the so-called wages fund is simply a scientific figment, the only
legitimate use of which would be to facilitate the expression of certain relations, it

has been habitually regarded as an actual entity, possessing a determinate magni-

tude at any assigned instant. It is true that Mill gave up this theory, when Mr.
Thornton had convinced him of its unsubstantial nature ; but, strange to say,
even when relinquished by the master, some of the disciples continued to cling
to it. Professor Caimes in his latest work insisted that Mill was mistaken in

--abandoning it, and it is still taught in some of the elementary manuals not, I am

glad to observe, in that of Professor Jevons, who indeed never adopted it. There
are, in my opinion, other quite as illusory economic conceptions which have met

with & good deal of acceptance, and have even obtained the sanction of dis-

tinguished names. If I do not now enter on an examination of them, it is
because I am unwilling that the general views I am desirous of presenting should

be lost in a series of special discussions, for which a more suitable opportunity can
 easily be found.

   --III. The third prevailing error of the economists and, with the exception of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  651

--the isolation of their study, this is the most serious of all is that of exag-

gerating immensely the office of deduction in their investigations.

     Deduction has indisputably a real and not inconsiderable place in Sociology.

We can sometimes follow the method which Mill calls the direct deductive, that

is, we can, from what we know of the nature of man and the laws of the external
world, see beforehand what social phenomena will result from their joint action.

But, though the economists of the so-called orthodox school recognize no other

method, we cannot really proceed far in this way, which is available only in simple

cases. Social phenomena are in general too complex, and depend on too manifold
conditions, to be capable of such a priori determination. In so far as the method can
be used, the vital condition of its legitimate employment is the ascertainment of
the consilience of the results of deduction with those of observation ; and yet such

verification from fact of the conclusions of theory, though essential to the admissi-

bility of this process of inquiry, is too often entirely overlooked.

    Much more commonly the function of deduction is different from what has just
been described, and its relation to observation is inverted. The laws of the
economic constitution and movement of society are first obtained by observation,

whether directed to contemporary life or to the history of the past. The office of
deduction is then to verify and control the inductions which have been arrived
at, using for this purpose considerations founded on the qualities of human nature
and the external conditions to which society is subjected. Results which could
not have been elicited by a priori reasoning from the latter data, may, when in-
ductively obtained, be in this way checked and rationalized. The pretension of
the economists, formally set forth in Senior's treatise, to deduce all the phenomena

of the industrial life of communities from four propositions, is one that cannot be

sustained. But conclusions derived from observation may be placed in relation
with the laws of the world and of human nature, so far at least as to show that
they contradict nothing we know respecting those laws. This method, in which
inductive research preponderates, and deduction takes a secondary place as means

of verification, is the really normal and fruitful method of sociological inquiry.
     But the method of Sociology must be not only inductive, but historical ; and by

the latter name it may best be characterised. By this is meant, not merely that it
finds the materials for its studies in the general field of human history : . we mean

--further that it institutes a comparison of the successive states of society in order

to discover the laws of social filiation a process similar in principle to the biological

comparison of organisms of different degrees of development. If we followed exclu-

sively the a priori method, in (for example) economic research, and sought to infer

the economic facts of life from the nature of the world and man, we could arrive
only at one determinate order of things, whilst we know that in reality the economic

organization and functions of society vary in time according to definite laws of suc-
cession. Mr. Lowe, indeed, will have it that " political economy is founded, on the

attributes of the human mind, and nothing can change it ;" which means, I suppose,,
that its formulas must always correspond with the phenomena. But how can this
view be reconciled with the now ascertained fact, that society has passed through
states in which the modern economic constitution was so far from existing, that
property did not belong to the individual, but to the community ? The a priori

--method, in fact, overlooks what is the main agency in the social movement namely,

the accumulated influence of anterior on subsequent generations of mankind ; an

influence too complex to be estimated deductively. Every department of social life,

--and amongst the rest the industrial system, undergoes transformation not arbi-

trarily indeed, but in accordance with law ; and if we wish to understand any of
those departments, we must study its transformations, considering each successive

form in relation to all the preceding and contemporary conditions.

     There is, indeed, no more important philosophical theorem than this : that the
nature, of a social fact of any degree of complexity cannot be understood apart from
its history. " Only when its genesis has been traced," says Mr. Herbert Spencer,
" only when its antecedents of all orders have been observed in their co-operation,

--generation after generation, through past social states is there reached that inter-

pretation of a fact which makes it a part of sociological science." To understand,
52 beport-- 1878.

for example, the true meaning of the trade societies of modern times, so important an

object of economic study, " we must," he says, " go back to the older periods when

analogous causes produced analogous results." And facts of this order, he adds,

--" must be studied not merely in their own successive forms, but in relation to the

other phenomena of their time the political institutions, the class distinctions, the

family arrangements, the modes of distribution and degree of intercourse between

localities, the amounts of knowledge, the religious beliefs, the morals, the senti-

ments, the customs." These considerations all point to the historical method, and,

I may add, they all confirm what I have already urged, that the economic pheno-

mena of society cannot be isolated from its other aspects. "When our object is not

the explanation of any past or present fact, but the prevision (within possible limits)

of the future, and the adoption of a policy in relation to that future, our guide mu9t

still be the historic method, conceived as indicating, from the comparison of succes-

sive states, the general tendency of society with respect to the phenomenon consi-

dered, and the agencies which are in course of modifying existing systems.

" Legislative action of no kind," again says Mr. Spencer, " can be taken that is

not either in agreement with or at variance with the processes of national growth

Weand development as naturally going on."  can by judicious action modify in their

special mode of accomplishment or in the rate of their development, but cannot alter

in their fundamental nature, the changes which result from the spontaneous tenden-

cies of humanity. An attempt to introduce any social factor which is not essen-

tially conformable to the contemporary civilization, will result, if not in serious

disturbance, at least in a mere waste of effort. Any proposal of social action, there-

fore, should repose on a previous analysis of those spontaneous tendencies, and this

is possible only by the historic method. Let me give an example from an economic

subject which happens just at present to offer a special interest. Attention has

been called by Sir Henry Maine to the general law that property in land originally

belongs, not to individuals, nor even to families in the modern sense, but to larger

societies, and that in the progress of mankind there is a natural movement from

common to separate ownership. This historical result has been elaborated by a

number of independent inquirers ; and M. de Laveleye in a work of great research

has brought together a vast mass of evidence, both establishing the main fact, and

exhibiting the varied features which the common evolution has assumed in different

countries. There is much that is attractive in particular sides of this early organi-

zation of territorial property, and M. de Laveleye has yielded to the charm, so far

as to regret its disappearance in the developed communities of the West, though he

--stops short of recommending what others have suggested namely, a return to

the primitive constitution, by replacing the commune in the possession of the soil.

Indeed, he himself, by establishing the progressive spontaneous tendency of society

towards individual property, shows such a project to be a dream, and banishes it

from the field of practical economic policy. From the general appearance of this

collective ownership in an early stage of society, it is sometimes argued that it is

a natural system ; but the historic method shows that it is just as natural that it

should disappear at a more advanced stage. Serving useful ends in the former

period, it becomes in the latter an obstruction to progress by stereotyping agricul-

tural art, and impeding that individual initiative which is an indispensable condition

of social improvement. The safe prediction is that the Swiss Allmend, the Russian

Mir, and other forms of collective ownership will disappear, and that personal ap-

propriation will become the universal rule. The social destination of property in

land, as of every species of wealth, will be increasingly acknowledged and realized

in the future ; but that residt will be brought about,, not through legal institutions,

but by the establishment and diffusion of moral convictions.

     There have been great differences of opinion as to the method of economic in-

quiry pursued by Adam Smith. Mr. Lowe insists that his method was de-

--ductive that he had the unique merit of baring raised the study of a branch of

human transactions to the dignity of a deductive science. At the same celebration

at which this opinion was put forward, Professor Thorold Rogers expressed his

surprise that anyone should entertain such a view. It seemed to him clear that

Adam Smith was pre-eminently an inductive philosopher. Mr. Rogers has edited
                                                                                                      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                                                             653

the ' Wealth of Nations,' and in doing so has verified all the references ; and what
strikes him is the extraordinary wideness of the reading from which Smith drew
his inferences. The work, he says, is full of facts. It is interesting to observe

that David Hume made just the same remark on the book at the time of its

publication :--" It has depth," he said, "and solidity, and acuteness, and is so
much illustrated with curious facts, that it must take the public attention."

    Of the two views thus advanced by Mr. Lowe and Mr. Rogers the latter
seems to me much the more correct. That the master tendency of Smith's
intellect was the deductive, or that it is at the deductive point of view that he
habitually places himself, seems to me plainly at variance with fact. Open his

book anywhere, and read a few pages ; then do the same with Ricardo's principal

work, and observe the difference of the impression produced. Under the Guidance

of Ricardo you are constantly, not without misgivings, following certainabstract

assumptions to their logical residts. In Smith you feel yourself in contact with
real life, observing human acts and their consequences by the light of experience.

Of course deduction is not wanting                                                                                                                                                                   but it is in the way of  explanation ;  the facts'

Adam Smith, besides giving generally a large place to induction, opened

several lines of interesting historical investigation, as notably in his Third Book

which contains a view of the economic progress of modern Europe as shaped by

political causes.                                                                            But  historic                     inquiry                                                                     was  neglected by his successors, with

dominant chiefly by the influence of Ricardo. Professor Price objects to
this method as too_ scientific ; but, as Mr . Leslie has said, what ou°-kt to be

alleged respecting it is that it is unscientific, because ill adapted for the Successful

investigation of the class of phenomena with which it deals. Settino- out from

propositions involving the loose abstractions of which I have spoken, it arrives at

conclusions which are seldom corrected by the consideration of conditions which

were at first, for simplicity, omitted in the premises. And these conclusions can in

general not be directly confronted with experience for the purpose of verification,

for they are hypothetical                                                                             only                     they                                                                  give  us,  not  the  resultant phenomenon, but

resultant.

I am not concerned nor disposed to deny that useful general indications have

been gathered by inference of this kind. But it is evidently a very unsafe process

even in purely economic matters, especially when consequences are pushed into'

any degree of detail. Careful thinkers have a profound distrust of lengthened
A Bdeductions in economic inquiries. When it is argued that must lead to and

B again to C, and so on through a long chain of results, they assume in 'self-

defence a sceptical attitude of mind, and often feel more than half convinced that
what is going on is a feat of logical sleight of hand. And this suspiciousness is, I

where protracted deductions are always safe, because we can be sure that we have'

before us at every step all the determining data, and each proposition successively
used is universally true. But as the most that the economist can affirm is a set

of tendencies, the certainty of his conclusions is plainly weakened in a rapidly

increasing ratio by the multiplication of links, there being always a possibility that

the theorems applied in the course of the demonstration may be subject to special
counteractions or limitations in the case we are considering.

     I observed before that Mill betrayed some uncertainty of view as to the precise

relation of economic inquiries to general sociology. As to the proper method
of the social science also, he appears to me not strictly consistent with him-
self. That method he declares, in so many words, to be the direct deductive
Yet elsewhere he as plainly agrees with Oomte, that in the general science of

society, as distinguished from its separate departments, nothing of a scientific
character is possible except by the inverse deductive--as he chooses to call the his-
torical--method. In one place he seems to assert that the general course of
economic evolution could be predicted from the single consideration of the desire

of wealth. Yet again he admits that no one could determine a priori from the
principles of human nature and the general circumstances of the race the order in

-which human development takes place. Now this involves the conclusion, that the

-- --laws of economic progress like all dynamic laws of Sociology must be ascertained

by observation on the large scale, and only verified by appeal to the laws of the
external world and human nature ; in other words, that the right method for their

study is the historical.

     I hope it is not inconsistent with a profound respect for the eminent powers and

high aims of Mill, to say that he appears to me never to have extricated himself

completely from the vicious habits in regard to sociological method impressed on

him by his education. His father had the principal part in the formation of his

mind in his early years. Now whatever were the intellectual merits of James

Mill, his mode of thinking on social subjects was essentially metaphysical, as
opposed to positive. Through him, as well as directly, John Mill came under the
influence of Bentham, of whom, whilst fully recognizing his services, we may truly

say that he was one of the most unhistorical of writers, building most, I mean, on

assumed a priori principles, and sympathizing least with the social past, in which

he saw little except errors and abuses. It is strong evidence of the natural force

of Mill's intellect that he more and more, as he advanced towards maturity, shook

himself loose of the prejudices of his early entourage. On every side, not even

excluding the aesthetic, he grew in comprehensiveness, and his Social and historic

ideas in particular become -wider and more sympathetic. The publication of the

letters addressed to him by Auguste Comte has revealed more fully, what could

already be gathered from his writings, that the study of that eminent thinker's first

oreat work happily concurred with and aided his spontaneous tendencies. Hence

in his economic studies he broke away in many respects from the narrow traditions

of the reigning English school, and by opening larger horizons and discrediting

ri"id formulas, did much to prepare the public mind for a more complete as well as

truly scientific handling of these subjects. But though the interval between his

father and himself represents an immense advance, yet never in regard to method

mydid he, in  opinion, attain a perfectly normal attitude. Whilst in his ' Logic ' he

criticized with just severity what he, not very happily, calls the geometrical mode

of philosophizing practised by the Benthamites in political research, he approves

what is essentially the same course of proceeding in economic inquiry ; and, whilst

protesting against the attempt to construct a special science of the political pheno-

mena of society apart from general sociology, he yet, with whatever restrictions

and qualifications, accepts the separate construction of a science of its industrial

phenomena. His ambition in his work on political economy was, as may be seen

from the preface, to replace the ' Wealth of Nations ' by a treatise which, whilst

more uniformly correct on points of detail, should be in harmony with contemporary

social speculation in the widest sense. Admitting fully the great merits of the book,

I yet must hold that, chiefly from the absence of any systematic application of the

historic method, he has not succeeded in attaining this end. The presentation of

what is solid and permanent in the work of the economists, in relation with the
mylargest and truest views of general sociology, is, in
                                                         judgment, a task which still

remains to be accomplished.

    The tendencies of the new school with respect to method are sufficiently indi-
cated by the names of the Realistic and the Historical by which it designates
itself. It declares, in the words of Brentano, the description of political economy

by the so-called orthodox writers as a hypothetic science, to be only a device to
cloak its dissonance with reality ; and affirms that much of the current doctrine
is made up of hasty generalizations from insufficient and arbitrary premises. It
sets out, says Held, from observed facts, and not from definitions, which often

serve only to mask foregone conclusions. It aims at describing objectively existing
economic relations, not as immutable necessities, but as products of a gradual
historical development in the past, and susceptible of gradual modification in
the future. " Its philosophical method," says Mr. Leslie, " must be historical,
and must trace the connection between the economical and the other phases of
national history." In these tendencies the rising school seems to me to be in har-

mony with all that is hest in the spirit of the most advanced contemporary

thought.

      IV. Lastly has to he noticed the too absolute character of the theoretic and practi-

 cal conclusions of the political economists. It follows (as I have already indicated)

from their a priori and unhistoric method that they arrive at results which purport

 to apply equally to all states of society. Neglecting the study of the social develop-

ment, they tend too much to conceive the economic structure of society as fixed

 in type, instead of as undergoing a regular modification in process of time, in rela-

tion to the other changing elements of human condition. Similar consequences

arose in other branches of sociological inquiry from the prevalence of unhistoric
methods. But reforms have been largely carried into effect from the increasin"-

recognition of the principle, that the treatment of any particular aspect of society

must be dominated by the consideration of the general contemporary state of

civilization. Thus, in jurisprudence there is a marked tendency to substitute for
the a priori method of the Benthamites a historical method, the leading idea of

which is to connect the whole juristic system of any epoch with the corresponding

state of society ; and this new method has already borne admirable fruits, especially
in the hands of Sir Henry Maine. Again, the old search after the best government,
which used to be the main element of political inquiry, is now seen to have been

radically irrational, because the form of government must be essentially related to
the stage of social development and to historic antecedents, and the question, what
is the best ? admits of no absolute answer.

      Mill admits that there can be no separate science of government ; in other
words, that the study of the political phenomena of society cannot be conducted

apart, but must, in his own words, stand part of the general science of society, not
01 any separate branch of it. And why ? Because those phenomena are so closely

mixed up, both as cause and effect, with the qualities of the particular people, or
of the particular age. Particular age must here mean the state of general social
development. But are not economic phenomena very closely bound up with the
particular state of development of the society which is under consideration ? Mr.
Bagehot, indeed, took up the ground that political economy is " restricted to a

single kind of society, a society of competitive commerce, such as we have in
England." And Mill himself, whilst stating that only through the principle of

competition, as the exclusive regulator of economic phenomena, has political
economy any claim to the character of a science, admits that competition has, only
at a comparatively modern period, become in any considerable degree the governing

principle of contracts ; that in early periods transactions and engagements were
regulated by custom, and that to this day in several countries of Europe, in large
departments of human transactions, custom, not competition, is the arbiter.

     The truth is, that in most enunciations of economic theorems by the English

school, the practice is tacitly to presuppose the state of social developmentfand

the general history of social conditions, to be similar to that of modern England ·
and when this supposition is not realised, those theorems will often be found to fail!

     The absolute character of the current political economy is shown, not only by
this neglect of the influence of the general social state, but in the much too
unlimited and unconditional form which is given to most of its conclusions. Mr.
Fawcett has, in his latest publication, animadverted on this practice ; thus he
points to the allegation often met with, that the introduction of machines must im-
prove the position of the workman, the element of time being left out of account
and the assertion that the abolition of protection in the United States could not
injure the American manufacturer. But this lax habit cannot, I believe, be really
corrected apart from a thorough change of economic method. As lono- as conclu-
sions are deduced from abstract assumptions, such as the perfectly free flow of
labour and capital from one employment to another, propositions which only affirm
tendencies will be taken to represent facts, and theorems which would hold under
certain conditions will be annoimced as universally true.

     The most marked example, the economists have afforded of a too absolute con-
ception and presentation of principle, both theoretical and practical, is found in
the doctrine of laissez /aire. It might be interesting, if time permitted, to follow

its history in detail. First inspired by a priori optimistic prepossessions, it long-

served a useful purpose as an instrument of combat against the systematic restric-

tions with which a mistaken policy had everywhere fettered European industry.

But, from the absolute manner in which it was understood and expressed, it tended

more and more to annul all governmental intervention in the industrial world, even

when intended not to alter the spontaneous course of industry, but only to prevent

or remedy the social injustices and other mischiefs arising from the uncontrolled

play of private interests. Experience and reflection, however, gradually surmounted

the exaggerations of theory. The community at large became impatient of laissez

faire as an impediment and a nuisance ; statesmen pushed it aside, and the econo-

mists, after long repeating it as a sacred formula, themselves at last revolted against

it. So far has the reaction proceeded, that Professor Oairnes has declared the

--doctrine implied in the phrase namely, that the economic phenomena of society

will always spontaneously arrange themselves in the way which is most for the

--common good to be a pretentious sophism, destitute of scientific authority, and

having no foundation jn nature or fact.

    Let me now recapitulate the philosophical conclusions which I have been en-

deavouring to enforce. They are the following :

(1) That the study of the economic phenomena of society ought to be syste-

matically                                combined with  that of the  other  aspects of  social  existence                                (2)  That
                                                                                                                                      ;

the excessive tendency to abstraction and to unreal simplifications should be

checked                                  (3) That the a priori deductive method         should be changed for the
                                      ;

historical ; and (4) That economic laws and the practical prescriptions founded on

those laws should be conceived and expressed in a less absolute form. These are,

in my opinion, the great reforms which are required both in the conduct of econo-

mic research, and in the exposition of its conclusions.

    I am far from thinking that the results arrived at by the hitherto dominant

economic school ought to be thrown away as valueless. They have shed important

partial lights on hiunan affairs, and afforded salutary partial guidance in public

action. The task incumbent on sociologists in general, or such of them as specially

devote themselves to economic inquiries, is to incorporate the truths already elicited

into a more satisfactory body of doctrine, in which they will be brought into

--relation with the general theory of social existence to recast the first draughts of

theory, which, however incomplete, in most cases indicate real elements of the

--question considered and to utilize the valuable materials of all kinds which their

predecessors have accumulated. Viewed as provisional and preparatory, the cur-

rent political economy deserves an approbation and an acceptance to which I

think it is not entitled, if regarded as a final systematization of the industrial laws-

of society.

Returning now from our examination of the condition and prospects of eco-

nomic study in the general field of human knowledge to the consideration of its

Position in this Association, what seems to follow from all I have been saying ?

do not take into account at all the suggestion that that study should be removed

from what professes to be a confederation of the sciences. As has been well said,

the omission from the objects of this body of the whole subject of the life of man

in communities, although there is a scientific order traceable in that life, would be

a degradation of the Association. If the proper study of mankind is man, the

work of the Association, after the extrusion of our Section, would be like the play

with the part of the protagonist left out. What appears to be the reasonable

suggestion, is that the field of the Section should be enlarged, so as to comprehend

the whole of Sociology. The economic facts of society, as I have endeavoured to

show, cannot be scientifically considered apart ; and there is no reason why the
researches of Sir Henry Maine, or those of Mr. Spencer, should not be as much at

home here as those of Mr. Fawcett or Professor Price. Many of the subjects, too,

at present included in the artificial assemblage of heterogeneous inquiries known

by the name of Anthropology, really connect themselves with the laws of social

development ; and if our Section bore the title of the Sociological, studies like those

of Mr. Tylor and Sir John Lubbock concerning the early history of civilization

would find in it their most appropriate place. I prefer the name Sociology to that

of Social Science, which has been at once rendered indefinite and vulgarized in

common use, and has come to be regarded as denoting a congeries of incoherent

details respecting every practical matter bearing directly or remotely on public

interests, which happens for the moment to engage attention. There are other

Societies in which an opportunity is afforded for discussing such current questions

in a comparatively popular arena. But if we are to be associated here with the

students of the other sciences, it is our duty, as well as our interest, to aim at a

genuinely scientific character in our work. Our main object should be to assist in

fixing theoretic ideas on the structure, functions, and development of society-

Some may regard this view of the subject with impatience, as proposing to us

investigations not bearing on the great and real needs of contemporary social life.
But that would be a very mistaken notion. Liiciferous research, in the words

of Bacon, must come before fructiferous. " Effectual practice," says Mr.
Spencer, " depends on superiority of ideas ; methods that answer are preceded by

thoughts that are true." And in human affairs, it is in general impossible to solve

--special questions correctly without just conceptions of ensemble all particular

problems of government, of education, of social action of whatever kind, connect

themselves with the largest ideas concerning the fundamental constitution of

society, its spontaneous tendencies, and its moral ideal.

I have as yet said nothing of Statistics, with which the name of this Section at

first exclusively connected it, and which are still recognized as forming one of its

objects. But it is plain that though Statistics may be combined with Sociology

in the title of the Section, the two cannot occupy a co-ordinate position. For it is

impossible to vindicate for Statistics the character of a science                                                                                                                                                                                                                                they constitute only
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

one of the aids or adminicula of science. The ascertainment and systematic

arrangement of numerical facts is useful in many branches of research, but, till law

emerges, there is no science; and the law, when it does emerge, takes its place

in the science whose function it is to deal with the particular class of phenomena
Weto which the facts belong.
                              may arrange meteorological facts in this way as

well as sociological ; and, if doing so helps us to the discovery of a law, the law

belongs to meteorology : and, in the same manner, a law discovered by the aid of
statistics would belong to sociology.

But though the character of a science cannot be claimed for Statistics, it is

obvious that if the views I have advocated as to the true nature and conditions of

economic study should prevail, the importance of statistical inquiries will rise, as
the abstract and deductive method declines in estimation. Senior objected to the
saying that political economy is avide de faits, because, according to him and the
school of Ricardo in general, its work was mainly one of inference from a few
primary assumptions. But if the latter notion is given up, every form of careful
and conscientious search after the realities of the material life of societv, in the

present as in the past, will regain its normal importance. This search must, of

course, be regulated by definite principles, and must not degenerate into a purpose-
less and fortuitous accumulation of facts ; for here, as in every branch of inquiry,
it is true that " Prudens interrogatio est dimidium soientiee."

     I do not expect that the news I have put forward as to the necessity of a

reform of economic studies will be immediately adopted either in this Section or

elsewhere. They may, I am aware, whilst probably in some quarters meeting

with at least partial sympathy, in others encounter determined hostility. And it
is possible that I may be accused of presumption in venturing to criticize methods
used in practice, and justified in principle, by many distinguished men. I should

scarcely have undertaken such an office, however profoundly convinced of the

urgency of a reform, had I not been supported by what seemed to me the

unanswered arguments of an illustrious thinker, and "by the knowledge that the
growing movement of philosophic Europe is in the direction he recommended as

the right one. No one can feel more strongly than myself the inadequacy of my
treatment of the subject. But my object has not been so much to produce

conviction as to awaken attention. Our economists have undeniably been slow

in observing the currents of European thought. Whilst such foreign writers as
echo the doctrines of the so-called orthodox school are read and quoted in

But the fence of self-satisfied routine within which in these countries we formerly

and its relations to Sociology as a whole, cannot long be postponed amongst us.
It has, in fact, been already opened from different sides by Mr. Leslie and
Mr. Harrison, and it is desirable that it should arrive as promptly as possible
at a definitive issue. If I have done anything to-day to assist in launching this
great question on the field of general English discussion, the purpose I have set

            2. On Canadian Statistics* By A. E. Bateman, F.8.S.

    The author said that these were very much less widely known than those of our
Australian colonies. In the province of Quebec, or as it was called New France,
the population in 1665 was 3,215; in 1695, 13,695; in 1726, 29,396; in 1736,
39,000. The census of Ontario and Quebec, taken in 1861, was very much in

excess of the real numbers, chiefly on account of the double entry of persons not
sleeping at home on the night of the census. One result was that the census of
1871 failed to show the increase that had been expected. The rate of mortality was

said to be 14 per 1,000, considered to be much below the truth; but, taking the

death rate at 21 and the birth rate at 35 per 1 ,000, and allowing for the increase
by recorded immigration, the estimated population of the Dominion of Canada was

now something over four millions and a quarter. In the ten years since the
Dominion was formed, the imports had increased from fifteen millions to more than

twenty millions sterling ; the exports from twelve to sixteen millions sterling. In

the last two or three years there had been a falling off, but when the present com-

mercial depression had passed away, he believed there would be a large develop-
ment of the meat trade to this country. The total tonnage of seagoing vessels was
six millions. This did not include the coasting traffic between the several provinces.
There were, in 1871, 180,000 persons employed in manufacturing industries, in
receipt of wages to the amount of eight millions sterling. The capital invested

was 16 millions, and the value of last year's produce was 46 millions. As to the
deposits in Government Savings Banks, these, which ten years ago were little over
a quarter of a million, were now a million and a half. The railways were not
prosperous, owing to the great competition between railways and canals. They had
cost 68 millions. Their income was four millions, and their expenditure about

--three and a quarter millions, leaving three-quarters of a million sufficient to pay

 four or five per cent, on the bonded debt, but leaving little for the ordinary or
 preference shareholder, or the Government or municipal advances.

--houses ' the author thought that a sufficient answer had heen given to this question

by the proceedings which took place at Glasgow, where the Corporation obtained an

Act in 1866 for the same purposes as that for which the Artizans Dwelling Act

was many years afterwards procured. This Act led to large purchases of property

by the Corporation, under the name of City Improvement Trustees. As soon as it
became known that these large purchases of blocks of houses had been made for

the purpose of clearing them away, and that there would consequently be a great

demand for house accommodation, builders immediately commenced the erection of

workmen's houses, and to such an extent has this been carried, that at December

last, while no less than 31,057 persons have been displaced by the removal of old

buildings during the ten years the improvement trust had been in operation, houses

have been erected, not only sufficient to accommodate those displaced, but greatly

beyond it. These trustees were in no hurry in pulling down the houses they had

purchased, and did not begin such operations for about two and a half or three

years from the commencement of their proceedings, so that sufficient time was

given for the erection of new buildings. It may, therefore, be reasonably

assumed that a like result will follow to all local authorities in similar

circumstances. Altogether, however, these operations have been effected with

great benefit to the public, and to all who could afford to pay a small increase of

rent for a better house yet it is not to be concealed that it has been attended with
                                                                                                          ;

considerable hardship to such as are too poor to pay an increased rent in an im-

proved locality. In Glasgow a considerable amount of accommodation has been

procured for this class in consequence of a number of tradesmen, with their

families, removing from houses in localities not of the poorest kind to those

newly erected and better situated, and thus leaving those from which they have

removed to this poorer class. These two outlets, though important, have not

in Glasgow been foimd sufficient to meet all the requirements, and accordingly re-

course has been had by the Corporation to the erection of model lodging-houses.

The peculiar construction of these is worthy of attention. The accommodation

given to each lodger is a comfortable bed, separate from others. There is apparatus

necessary for washing, &c, a bath-room, a comfortable large sitting-room, to which

all the lodgers are admitted, cooking apparatus, and fire and gas. The charge is
3id. and 4^d. per night, or Is, 9d. or 2s. 3d. per week. Games of various kinds are

allowed in the evening, and there are newspapers and a library for the use of the

inmates                                 a chaplain is attached  to  each house,  and  Divine worship is performed
                                     ;

every Sabbath. The success which has attended the houses already opened is verv

gratifying; for although they have been erected at a time when ground and
building was at an inflated price, and when time was required to make them

known, so as to procure adequate numbers, they have yielded a fair return on the
money spent upon them, viz., 5} per cent, per annum.

4. On the Boarding. out of Pauper Children. By Miss Isabella M. Tod.

     The most conspicuous opponent of the boarding-out system repeatedly and
earnestly deplores the mischiefs of all kinds to which children are exposed in work-
houses. The discontent and even alarm which such a conviction created led to the
establishment of the English District Schools. Undeniably the scheme had certain
advantages. But after many years' experience, the opinion of most of those who
have watched it minutely is that this plan also has failed, and has failed precisely
because, with all possible external advantages, it has inherited the wholesale work-
house mode of treatment, and, therefore, has reproduced its effects upon the children.
Various charitable associations in England had always been in the habit of finding
rural homes for some of their children, but the existence of the district schools

(although even they are only available for a minority of the pauper children),
probably prevented philanthropists from quickly perceiving their need of similar

care. The present movement in that direction may be said to have begun with the

exertions of Mrs. Archer, Miss Boucherett, the Misses Hill, and other ladies, about

                                                    uu2

fifteen years ago. In Scotland boarding out has, in one form or another, been
practised for a century or more as a mode of relief. In Ireland, as the Poor-law
itself is a very modern affair, it is not, in the early stages, to anything done by the

authorities, but to the action of voluntary charities, that we have to look for ex-
perience. Warned by the errors of the old Charter Schools, which had just been

closed, the Protestant Orphan Society from the first eschewed large buildings and
mechanical arrangements, and placed the children in families in the country. The
success of this institution is beyond dispute, and as it deals with hundreds at a
time, the scale is sufficiently large to be an excellent test of efficiency. In a similar

--manner many Roman Catholic orphanages and institutes such as those of St.
--Joseph and St. Bridget have constantly boarded out the children in their care

among farmers and others in the country with the best results. The Presbyterian

Orphan Society, with the working of which I am best acquainted, has been about ten

years in operation, and it, also, makes the placing of the children in suitable fami-
lies its central object. Not till 1862 were Irish guardians empowered to board
young children out, and that only up to the age of five years, except in special
cases. Power was afterwards obtained to board out the children until ten years of
age. At this point it remained until 1876, when a bill was introduced and carried
by Mi". O'Shaughnessy, M.P. for Limerick, to extend the age to thirteen; and those

-- --unions decidedly the majority, and also the most important which had already

adopted the system, gladly availed themselves of the permission. It was evident,
however, that if boarding out was to be substituted on a large scale for the false
system which had grown up care would have to be taken that the supervision by
educated people, which was connected with it when set in operation by charitable
associations, should be continued in a satisfactory and permanent manner when set
in operation by the guardians. It needs sound good sense and experience, as well
as good will, to select the right foster-parents in each case and to meet with advice,
encouragement, or warning the emergencies which arise from time to time. This

is the proper work of the ladies who undertake to assist in boarding out. The
State is composed of men and women, and has both masculine and feminine duties.
The forgetting of this truth led to hideous results for thousands of unhappy
children ; and now that attention is directed to it, it is not a matter of choice

whether ladies will offer to help, or guardians accept their offer, but a matter of
plain duty. It is a cause of congratulation that such a committee has just been
formed in Dublin to look after children boarded out from the metropolitan unions.
The boarding-out system rescues children from artificial conditions under which

--nothing living could thrive, and secures for its clients a home friends, parents,
--brothers, and sisters ; school teaching which becomes a pride and a pleasure, in-
--stead of a meaningless drudgery and religious instruction which is blended with

tenderness, instead of a dry form which might inspire awe, but could not inspire

love. This surely is work in which the place of women is evident and essential.

     The following Papers were read :

1. On the Condition of Small Farmers, and their Position with reference to
                   the Land Question* By Mdkrough O'Brien.

     Ireland is a country of large estates and small farms. There are 300,000 farms
the annual value of which is less than 10/. each ; and the average size of farms of
all kinds is under thirty acres.

     Thirty-three per cent, of the population are engaged in agriculture, while in
England the percentage of agriculturists is thirteen.

     Peasant farming in Ireland differs from peasant farming in other parts of
Europe, in that the occupiers hold almost universally as tenants from year to year.
They are thus subjected to continually increasing rents, the demand for which
causes discontent and bad farming, and discourages improvement.

     Tenants in Ireland usually supply all buildings, and make whatever improve-

ments are necessary yet they frequently have to pay increased rent on account of
                                                                                  ;

the additional value they have given to their farms. This system tends to make
the interests of landlord and tenant more antagonistic than in England.

     Eents have always been high in Ireland, and the tendency in settling them is

steadily against the tenant ; although the increase in the value of land is seldom
due to any expenditure of capital by the landlord.

    As a consequence, largely affecting for evil the whole nation, the house accom-

modation of the labouring classes is exceedingly bad. In rural districts there are

148,200 cabins with only one room each. On small farms it does not pay the

landlord to build, and yearly tenants can scarcely be expected to build and improve
as they would if they were owners.

    On small plots purchased under the Bright clauses of the Church and Land

Acts remarkable improvements have been noticed. Farmers have built or perma-
nently improved their homesteads ; labourers have built themselves substantial
cottages ; industry has been increased. This points to the settlement of the land
question that has universally been recommended by economists, viz., free trade in
land, and facilitating occupiers in becoming owners, but " not by means coercive or
unjust." Every other solution has involved litigation between landlord and tenant,
and has failed to give protection for improvements. It is impossible to reconcile
the interests of landlords and tenants ; and as long as ownership and occupation
are dissevered it is impossible that the land can be cultivated as it should be and
the condition of the people be really improved.

     There are millions of acres to be reclaimed in Ireland, and a want of, and a
desire for, better houses throughout the whole country, yet there is a general com-
plaint that there is no employment. The wages of ordinary labourers are very low,
and insufficiently supply the necessaries of life. The want of employment still exist-
ing is largely due to the tenure of land, which is such that the landowner cannot
make the necessary improvements, and the tenant, if he makes them, is liable at any
time to have the fruit of his expenditure wholly or in part appropriated by an
increase of his rent. The position with regard to the land question is this : It

is the general custom that small farmers should build and maintain their own
houses, make and preserve all improvements. Practically the landlord cannot enter

Inquiry Society of Ireland.'

on the land to do it even if lie wished. If the landlord were to provide the

buildings which are needed on the small farms, the general value of his estate

would not be increased ; for the land would not be rendered more directly produc-
tive, and he would obtain no return for his outlay. The tenant builds because a

house is as necessary to him as clothes or food ; it adds to his health and comfort,

and in proportion to his comfort and ease is the strength and wealth of the nation

increased. The expenditure by tenants on small farms often exceeds the value of

the fee-simple. Improvements and reclamation on small farms is necessarily done

Alittle by little.  record of such improvements cannot be kept by farmers, and to

file them under the sixth section of the Land Act is impracticable. The Land Act

(section 4) implies that after the lapse of an uncertain time the improvements

made by the tenant sboidd become landlord's property. This is contrary to the

natural dictates of justice. The Land Act places no limit to the rent that may

be demanded of a tenant. In revaluation of estates the value of the tenant's im-

provements cannot be satisfactorily eliminated, and the occupier is always liable to

a rent placed on his own improvements. Great complaints and discontent exist on

--this ground not without reason, as appears from the evidence of the senior judge

of the Landed Estates Court. This liability to continually increasing rents checks

improvements, and operates as an uncertain and capricious tax on the tenants'

capital. No law can fix or limit rents without committing an injustice, and if

such a law were passed it might be evaded. The scheme recommended in 1866

by Mr. Bright is the only economical solution of the land question. The partial

trial it has had has been most satisfactory ; its extension has been recommended by
a Select Committee of the House of Commons ; and accompanied by a simple system
of land transfer, the best results may be expected from a scheme such as this.

2. The Creation of a Public Commission to purchase Land for Resale to
                  Occupiers in Ireland. By Francis Nolan.

3. Suggestions for a Bill to regulate Sales of Property.

                By James H. Monahan, Q.C.

There is no legal topic more closely connected with economic science than sales

of property. Certainly, there is no other single legal subject where the materials

for rational legislation are more rich and abundant, nor where a systematic arrange-

ment of these materials is more urgently needed ; for the great work of reducing
our chaotic co?-pusjuris to order. The Judicature Acts constitute a stride in advance

towards this desirable achievement. The introduction and reception of Sir J. F.

Stephens' Criminal Code is also a most important step gained. And the debate

and the division on Mr. Potter's Real Estate and Intestacy Bill is also encouraging

to those who desire the substitution of rational and intelligible rules for the sur-

vival of feudalism, still permitted to continue to exist in our law. The introduc-

tion of Sir J. F. Stephens' Bill has naturally evoked the usual objections from those

who do not believe in codification                                                                                                                                                          but I  should  think  that  most honest litigants
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

--who have had practical experience of protracted litigation will be inclined to

believe Mr. Carlyle when he says " Unfortunate mortals do want to have their

bits of lawsuits settled and have on trial found even the ignorant Code Napoleon a

mighty benefit in comparison with none." And we have again heard recently, as
we have often heard before, that " you can codify rules, but it is impossible to

codify principles." One asks, naturally, what then is meant by " a principle,"
when it is said that " you cannot codify principles ? " If the expression " a legal

principle " means anything intelligible, surely a legal principle can be stated in

plain English, and nothing more is wanted to fit a legal principle for its proper-

place in a code. In truth, the statement of a legal principle is no more than a

compendious description of a general characteristic of the conduct of persons who
act in conformity with legal rules. And there is certainly no insuperable difficulty
in the way of shaping such descriptions, once legal rules are known.
                                                                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.               663

     Sales of property depend upon the branch of the general principle of ownership

conversant with powers of disposing of property, and the branch of the general

principle of veracity dealing with contracts. I have elsewhere described these

general principles fully,* and there is do difficulty in the way of stating in a mode-

rate compass the applications of these principles to sales. This has been already

partly accomplished by the Indian Contract Act of 1872 ; but it is to be wished
that the framers of that Act had confined the meaning of the term " property "
to " the thing owned," and not also, as in sec. 78, employed " property " to
signify " ownership."

4. On the Application of Copyhold Enfranchisement to long Leases in

     Ireland, the assimilation of Chattel and Freehold Succession, and the

    simplification of Transfer of Land. By J. H. Edge.

The report of the Committee of the House of Commons on the working of

the Bright clauses of the Irish Land Act of 1870, has brought out in a glaring

manner some anomalies and defects in the tenure of land in Ireland. The com-

mittee, in fact, attribute the break down in the working of these clauses in a great

measure to the expense and delay attending the transfer of land from one individual

to another, or from the State to a private purchaser ; and the report evidently

shows forebodings of difficulties to arise hereafter from the same source. What-

ever diversity of opinion may exist on such questions as the expediency of creating

a peasant proprietary, or the necessity of giving fixity of tenure to the farming class,

I think all people will agree with me that if one individual chooses to contract with

another to sell him an estate, the costs of transfer ought to be reduced to a

minimum. How to do so, and to what extent it can be done, are the problems to

solve. The great end to which the public would strive, if they only knew how,

would be to make the transfer of land as cheap and speedy as that of ordinary

personal property, and it has been powerfully urged that this can be done. It has

been asserted that if you can establish a complete registry for shares of ships, you can

do the same for shares in land, and that by an easy method transfers in a registry office

can be accomplished. I do not think that the question can be pushed to this limit.

I think there are essential differences between land and every other marketable

commodity, which would prevent its accomplishment, as in every settled country

the very nature of land necessitates a division of interests which does not exist in

other property. In addition to what I may call the inevitable complication

attached to the title of land, family pride and sentimental feelings have in all old

countries, and in Ireland more than any other I am aware of, added complications

to its title, by imposing what may be called fanciful conditions on its tenure. I

scarcely think it would be right to attempt to interfere with the owners in these

matters. Even if it was otherwise inexpedient to extend to this country Lord

Caims's Act for the Sale and Transfer of Land, so much of its provisions might be

adopted as would necessitate the registration in one office of all claims of land in

Ireland of every description, and whether by the Crown or subject. The present

state of things might be learned from a paper by Dr. Neilson Hancock, read before

the Dublin Statistical Society. Another reform I would suggest would be a sup-

plement to Lord St. Leonards' and Lord Cranworth's Acts for shortening deeds.

Lord St. Leonards found in every well-drawn will and settlement common form

clauses, for the protection of trustees, known to lawyers as the indemnity and re-

imbursement clauses                                                                                                  and he introduced  and  carried  an Act  through Parliament,
                                                                                                                  ;

to the effect that all deeds and wills should be construed as if they contained these

clauses, unless their application was expressly negatived by the instrument. Lord

Cranworth afterwards 'carried a similar Act ; by which various powers are em-

ployed in mortgages, settlements, and wills, thereby greatly shortening their length.

I then would suggest further legislation in this practical direction. At present, in
an ordinary conveyance or assignment of land by way of sale or mortgage, there are

inserted certain stereotyped covenants for title, which the purchaser or mortgagee

* 'The Method of Law,' chapters vi. and vii.
664 report-- 1878.

has a right to insist on without any express agreement on the subject. There is no

reason, then, why their existence should not he implied in every such deed, leaving

it open to the parties to make any agreement they please with respect to qualifying

or extending their effect, or negativing their application altogether. This would

shorten many deeds by at least one-third their length. And similar covenants

against incumbrances by trustees might be implied, and, where only part of an

estate is sold, covenants for the production of title deeds by the vendor. I shall

now strive to go a little deeper to the root of the evil, by trying to show how the

mytitle to the land itself might, in  judgment, be simplified more than it is, with-

out interfering unjustly with existing rights "or restricting freedom of contract.

The remedies I suggest are the abolition of the middleman tenure, and the assimi-

lation of the law of succession in the different varieties of tenure. I propose that

the middleman should be enabled to purchase, by compulsory sale, his landlord's

rights, in analogy to the English Acts enabling copyholders to compel their lords
of the manor to enfranchise their holdings. I do not think it would be any more

violent interference with the landlord's rights to force him to sell them to the
middleman, than it was to force a lord of the manor in England to enfranchise a

copyhold.

     It is scarcely possible that anyone will dispute the question that the assimila-
tion of the law of succession, in freehold and chattel real property, would simplify
titles, and therefore facilitate the transfer of land, as there are numerous instances
in which the one farm, or even a portion of the same house, is held under both

tenures, and even the one lease through one portion of its duration is freehold and

another chattel. I cannot discover any valid reason why there should be the two

kinds of tenure ; nor were the two even deliberately or purposely created, but
merely are remnants of the old feudal period, when leaseholds for years were not

regarded as constituting any estate in land, and were allowed to go like cattle to
the executor. The popular view is to assimilate the succession of freeholds to

leaseholds. It would appear to me that a fair settlement of the question would be

to recognise the eldest son's right to inheritance, to restrict the widow's right to

dower, or one-third of the annual profits for her widowhood only, as exists in lands

--held in gavelkind, and to allot a third portion to the younger children during

their minorities leaving the remaining third to the heir, who would get the whole
on his mother's death or second marriage, and on his brothers and sisters attaining
full age. This, which would remedy the great hardship of the present law as regards

freeholds, would, I think, make a useful alteration in the law of chattels real.

5. On Impediments to the prompt carrying out of the principles conceded by
      Parliament on the Irish Land Question. By W. Neilson Hancock,
      LL.D*

   'In this paper I do not propose to deal with any principles as applied to the
Irish Land Question, except those which have already been conceded by Parliament.

--With respect to one branch of the land question the encouragement and facilities

--for the creation of peasant proprietors a very elaborate inquiry has been made by

Mr. Shaw Lefevre's committee, to ascertain the impediments to the successful working
of what are called the Bright clauses. I propose to state the results of a scientific in-

vestigation on principles of economic science and jurisprudence of the impediments to
the working of some of the other clauses of the Land Act. The British Govern-
ment has to deal in India with the most eastern branch of the Aryan races, and in
Ireland with the descendants of what was, before the discovery of America, the
most western branch of the race. The reform of 1860, substituting contract for
tenure in the relation of landlord and tenant, and the Act of 1870 recognising
tenant right, reversing the presumption as to improvements and favouring small

TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.         665

--ownerships the legislation of 1877, giving a preference to equitable over legal

rules, and favouring compensation and restraint in lieu of forfeiture, have effected
such large changes, that the whole law as to land requires to be reviewed with a
view to its simplification. The effect of the Land Act of 1870, in recognising
tenant right, and the property of agricultural tenants in their improvements, has
been to bring within the domain of law property worth some millions of money
belonging to several hundreds of thousands of people, that before, owing to its
want of recognition, required no legal machinery for its management and disposal.
If this, as in every other case of concessions made by Parliament are to produce
contentment, and lead to good government, they should be promptly and cordially

accepted in all their consequences, and, above all, the legal and official arrange-

ments should be as completely and as effectually as possible organised, so that the

parties intended to be benefited may really get the benefit conferred on them by
Parliament. Again, when English or Scotch institutions are extended to Ireland,

the latest and most improved form which is adopted in either of the sister countries
is the one that should be extended. The suggestions I have ventured to make all

--fall within these principles: (1) That the eleven district registrars of the Court

of Probate should be consolidated with the county officers, as under a recent

reform the commissaries have been consolidated with sheriff's officers in Scotland.

(2) That the office of sub-sheriff should, on the Scotch model, be made permanent,
and consolidated with the county officers. (3) That the entire jurisdiction in
bankruptcy should be entrusted either directly or by remission to the local courts as
in Scotland. (4) That to enable poor people to prove their wills, and take out
administration as cheaply and as locally as possible, the recent Scotch Acts for this
purpose should be followed. (5) That taking the 150 towns in which County Court

Judges sit, as the established convenient limit for exercise of local administrative
jurisdiction, the petty sessions clerks of these towns should be the officers to cany
out the cheap local proof of wills. (6) That to make the petty sessions clerks in
these towns suitable for this and other duties that would devolve on them as sub-

ordinate officers of justice, the principle of the English Justices' Clerk's Act, 1877,
should be extended to Ireland. (7) That the great principle of union rating

carried for England in 1856, and extended in principle to the whole of London in
1867 and 1870, should be followed in Ireland: the commencement made in 1876
being completed by the full adoption of the English system. (8) That this reform
would diminish the stimulus to interfere with the distribution of population pro-
duced by the 3,438 electoral divisions in Ireland, with an average population of
1,600, as compared with the 35,000 average population of the English area of
charge. (9) That the English principle of valuation for taxation according to

letting value should be substituted for the old Irish principle, still retained, of

valuing according to scales of prices of agricultural produce. That the Irish
principle conflicts with live and let live tenant-right. (10) That the adoption of a
uniform basis of valuation for the purposes of taxation through the United King-
dom, besides its natural justice and equity, is of importance as a recognition as far

as possible of the principle of maximum identical legislation. (11) That the

principle of simplifying and codifying the law which in recent years has been so
successfully carried out in India, should be applied to Irish law, and especially to
the whole of the laws relating to land in Ireland.

2. The Periodicity of Commercial Crises, and its Physical Explanation.

                     By Professor W. Stanley Jevons, F.B.S.

     In this paper the author took up again the inquiry into the relation between
the solar spot period and commercial phenomena, which he had previously treated,

but, as he now believes, unsuccessfully, at the Bristol Meeting of the British Asso-

ciation (see Report for 1875, Transactions of Sections, p. 217). Observing that
commercial collapses have occurred in 1866, 1857, 1847, 1837 (in United States),

1825, and 1815, the author adopts the opinion of Dr. Hyde Clarke and others,
that such phenomena tend to recur in a, period of about ten years.

    He then points out that the series, although apparently broken (a crisis occur-

ring in 1809-10, rather than in 1805, when there was no great increase of bank-
ruptcy), may probably be traced back through the 18th century. There were

great crises in the years 1793 and 1763, and very distinct ones also in 1772-3 and
1783. The principal part of the paper was occupied with an attempt to show that
the great crisis of 1721, which followed the South Sea Bubble, falls into the series,

as it was preceded by " stock jobbing " manias about the years 1701 & 1711, and was

followed by one in 1732-33. There remains, in order to complete the whole series,
two periods, 1742 and 1752, when there were certainly no great manias, or crises.
But the author adduces evidence of a certain weight to show that in those years
there were remarkable rises in the price of wool, and about 1752-53, there was a
marked rise in the price of tin, which forms one of the best indications of commercial

activity and good credit. He believes, then, that trade reached maxima of activity

in or about the years 1701, 1711, 1721, 1732, 1742, 1753, 1763, 1772, 1783, 1793
(1805 ?), 1815, 1825, 1837, 1847, 1857, 1866. The intervals vary from 9 to
12 years ; the average interval is 10'3 years. But, as the earlier dates, 1701 and
1711, are not well established, and the panic of 1866 was probably premature, as
shown by comparison with the three preceding panics, the author prefers to com-
pare the undoubted collapse of 1721 with that of 1857, giving a mean interval of

10 - 46 years. If we take the year 1763, which was also a year of well marked
crisis, and compare it with 1857, we obtain 10'444. The mean length of the com-

mercial period is thus almost identical with Mr. J. A. Broun's estimate of the
sunspot period, namely, 1045 years, which again is almost exactly the same as
Lamont's earlier estimate.

     The author infers that the phenomena are probably connected ; but, as he and
other inquirers have failed in discovering a like cycle in the price of corn, he
believes that the connection must be sought rather in the varying produce of the
crops in the tropical or other countries, where the meteorological influence of the
solar period has already been detected. In corroboration of this opinion he points
out that the exports of goods from England to India, when graphically represented,

display a certain appearance of decennial variation, especially in the earlier part
of the 18th century.

     In conclusion he alludes to the contemporary state of trade, quoting a statement
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                 667

of the numbers of bankruptcies in England and the United States, to show that
the latest crisis must be assigned either to 1877, or, it may be, to 1878. In

either case the theory of decennial variation will be verified as closely as can be
expected.

4. Some Statistical Researches into the Poor Removal Question, with special

      reference to the Removal of Persons of Irish Birth from Scotland. By
     W. Neilson Hancock, LL.D*

There were 774,310 persons of Irish birth in Great Britain in 1871, of whom

no less than 082,000 were of twenty years of age and upwards. As there were

only 2,900,000 persons of Irish birth of twenty years of age and upwards in

Ireland, those in Great Britain are about one-fifth of the whole--without counting

migratory labourers. The number in Scotland of this age, 184,000, is one-tenth of

the whole population of that age in Sc< >tland, 1 ,788,000 ; while the number in London,

82,900, is only a twentieth of the corresponding figure, 1,789,000. Dr. Alison, in

a paper read at the British Association in Belfast in 1852, ascribed mortality of

persons of Irish birth in Scotland in part to operation of Scotch poor-law. Dr.

Lyon Playfair noticed unhealthiness of persons of Irish birth in Scotland. Amongst

the defects in Scotch poor-law noticed by Dr. Alison were the period of residence

to protect against removal, still five years, though 'reduced to one year in England

in 1865. The defects in the law as to acquiring and losing a settlement, noticed

by Dr. Alison, were remedied in England in 1876, but not yet in Scotland. Scotch

poor law is in advance of English in allowing questions of chargeability to be

adjusted between different localities in Scotland, without a removal, and so con-

tains germs of total abolition of removal. In conclusion, I would repeat what I

--said on this question some seven years ago, in a paper before the Statistical Society

of Ireland, The prestige of our legislation would be strengthened, if we were able

to have laws, like those relating to poor removals that affect the labouring classes

in the whole three kingdoms, assimilated and reduced to an enlightened and bene-

ficent code, by collecting what is best out of each of our laws in England, Scot-
Aland, and Ireland.
                     large cause of discontent would be removed if we were able
--to say to the migratory labourers of these kingdoms "No matter what is your
-- --race or place of birth no matter where you labour your relations to the State
--in any calamity that overtakes you will be the same at Belfast, at Glasgow, and at

Liverpool in Dublin, in Edinburgh, and in London."

5. On the Education and Training of the Insane. By Joseph Lalor, M.D.,

       Resident Medical Superintendent, Richmond District Lunatic Asylum,

        Dublin.

     I propose to consider 'in this paper some of the general principles on which the
education and training of the insane can be dealt with most advantageously;
starting with the proposition that education and training form the basis of the
moral treatment of all classes of the insane. Commencing with criminal lunatics,
I adopt the division of criminal lunatics into two classes proposed by Dr. Orange,

of the Broadmoor Asylum :-- (1) Those whose offences have been the direct result
of their insane state, and who up to the time of the outbreak of insanity have in
many cases led honest and industrious lives ; and (2) those who have been certified
to be insane whilst undergoing penal servitude in convict prisons, and who consist

chiefly of habitual criminals whose ofl'ences against law and order are part of their
every-day life, their habitual actions being anti-social. The first class may, I think,

     * Published in 'Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland,'

pt. liv. vol. vii. p. 356.
668 eepobt-- 1878.

be very properly treated in district lunatic asylums, and not dealt with as a distinct

class. As regards the second class, there are unquestionably great disadvantages
in mixing them with the general inmates of a lunatic asylum. But systematic and

skilled education and training are obviously called for in the case of all the patients

in lunatic asylums, all of whom are prone to breaches of the moral laws. In the

district lunatic asylums of Ireland the great insufficiency of the means of educating
and training are obvious.

     The Charity Organisation Society of London, after very prolonged inquiry,
conducted with peculiar advantages for obtaining information, have come to the

conclusion that voluntary charity has not proved equal to providing a remedial
machinery for the training of imbeciles and idiots coextensive with the evil, and

that such provision cannot be made without the intervention of the State. The
society recommends that the administration of such provision should be conducted
by governing bodies composed of representatives of the local magistrates, repre-

sentatives of the guardians, and persons appointed by the Crown, and that its cost
should be met partly out of local rates and partly out of the public revenue. I
think municipal bodies should be represented on the governing boards ; and whilst
I concur in the other views above set forth by the Charity Organisation Society, I
dissent entirely from an opinion which they have expressed, that idiots and imbeciles
should be treated distinctively from other classes, and that they ought not to be
associated with lunatics in asylums. Indeed, I would disapprove of the introduc-
tion of any system that would make provision for the care and training of idiots
and imbeciles of the poorer classes distinct in the organisation of its administra-
tion and mode of support from that for the insane afflicted with other forms of

insanity.

    It is much to be wished that some system may be devised by which the due

care and treatment of the insane poor, labouring under the different forms of

insanity, may be dealt with so that they should be recognised in law as belonging

to one abnormal family or group ; and that their interests, as well as those of the
public at large, should obtain that increased and much-needed advancement which
might be expected from the combination of existing diverse systems into one con-
sistent and homogeneous whole, working with the full power which such union
woidd confer.

     Assuming that educational training is a powerful, improving, and ameliorating
agent with all classes of the insane, it is important to bear in mind that it does not
produce its full results, in many cases, until after the lapse of a very long period

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and it has led, in the Richmond Asylum, in my experience, to most unexpected

improvement, and even cure, only after its continuance for years. Hence I venture
most earnestly to deprecate any such interference, by legislative enactment or other-
wise, as would make its trial short and insufficient.

    In the year 1857, on my appointment to the Richmond Asylum, I found with

much pleasure that a schoolmistress was a member of the staff, having been
appointed in 1854. At the time of my appointment she had a class of about twelve

patients, and also gave elementary instruction to such of the nurses as required and
wished for it. I have endeavoured to develop, extend, and strengthen systematic
education and training as part of the moral treatment of all forms of insanity in

this asylum, and I trust my efforts have been attended with some success.

     In reference to the education or training of the insane, no matter of what class
or age, I wish to state that I try to have the patients engaged in the same pursuit
for not more than from one to one hour and a half consecutively. Monotony,

whether of work, education, or recreation, appears to me to be injurious to the

insane of all classes and ages. I consider the alternation of literary, sesthetical,
moral, and physical education, with industrial employment and recreation (so as to
produce variety of occupation), to be of great advantage in the treatment of the
insane, whether the particular form of the insanity be mania, melancholia, mono-
mania, dementia, idiocy, or imbecility.

     The great want of further and better provision for the cure of recent and
curable cases, and for the training of idiots and imbeciles in Ireland, has, for
several years, received some attention, and the latter subject has been brought into
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                 669

still more prominent notice by the investigations and reports of the Charity Organi-
sation Society of London. The most approved system of training juvenile idiots
and imbeciles is founded, as appears to me, on the same general principles, and
includes nearly the same details, as those on which the educational system in the
Richmond has been founded and carried out, until it has reached its present

development.

    By comparatively cheap structural changes, and the removal of a large number
of quiet and incurable cases at present in district asylums in Ireland, who might be

cared for sufficiently well in one or more workhouses selected and appropriated to

such a purpose, and at less cost than in the present district asylums, I believe that

accommodation might be made for some hundreds of juvenile idiots and imbeciles,
and means presented for their receiving that education and training of which they

are admittedly in urgent want.

In the district lunatic asylums of Ireland the number of single rooms is, I

believe, much larger than is called for by what I consider to be the most advanced

opinions on the use of seclusion. In some of the best managed asylums of England

seclusion is very rare, and my own experience leads me to use it very sparingly.

In fact, a very large proportion of the single rooms in the Richmond Asylum are

occupied by the quietest patients in the house, with the view of putting into asso-
whomciated dormitories the class of patients often called refractory, for
                                                                           single

rooms were formerly considered necessary. In my opinion, single rooms would not

be wanted in a larger proportion than one for every twenty patients. From the

thirty-fourth table of the Inspector's Report for 1872, which is the last return

o-iving the number of associated and single rooms in the district lunatic asylums of

Ireland, there appears to have been at that time about one single room on the

average for every four patients, making about 2000 single rooms in institutions with

a total number of patients amounting to 8000. The space occupied by single

rooms and the connecting corridor, if converted into large rooms, would accommo-

date two for every one accommodated according to present construction, and a gain

of 1600 beds would thus be available for the accommodation of large classes of the

insane at present in much need of suitable provision for their proper care and treat-
ment. I am confident that the means of treating the patients in a way more

conducive to their comfort and improvement would thus be obtained at a cost

which I would estimate not to exceed 201. per head, or about one-fourth of what it

would cost to build new asylums. The removal of quiet and incurable cases, and

the conversion of single rooms and corridors into large rooms, would in this asylum

alone give means for the education and training of several hundreds of the insane

who at present are deprived of such an opportunity. The present staff would,

without increase of numbers or of expense, be sufficient, and the advantages thus

offered on the score of experience and economy of time and money are obvious.

Preconceptions founded on insufficient data would, I think, be removed by an

impartial examination of the system carried out in the Richmond Asylum, and it

will always give me great pleasure to afford persons anxious to judge it by personal

--observation the opportunity of doing so ; but I would suggest that such persons

should visit during our school hours, viz. : From nine to one o'clock, from April 1

to October 1, and ten to two o'clock from October 1 to April 1 (vacations at

Christmas, Easter, and Midsummer excepted).

Summarising what I consider some very important items of our system here, I

note that out of 479 male patients in the house on May 17, 400 were employed

either at school or industrially, or both combined, and only 79 were wholly unem-

ployed ; 45 of the unemployed were so in consequence of being under medical

treatment, leaving only 34 men unemployed purely owing to their state of mind.

Of 553 female patients in the house on the same day, 448 were employed either at

school or industrially, or both combined, and 105 were wholly unemployed ; 89 of

the unemployed were so in consequence of being under medical treatment, leaving

only 50 unemployed purely from the state of their mind. In the management of

the* insane, it is of the first importance to keep them from mischief and harm

and with them, as with the sane, there is no means of doing this so reliable or so

good as healthful employment of mind and body. Morning and evening prayers
--670
                                      beport 1878.

are said in all the divisions of the Richmond Asylum, the Protestants and Roman
Catholics being in separate rooms, and in care of an attendant of their own reli-
gious belief (being a school attendant, when possible). The average number

attending morning and evening prayers is 322 males and 486 females, making 808

of both sexes.
     In reference to the employment or occupation of the insane in this asylum, I

consider that one of the advantages of the school system is, that it provides an

occupation for some, and leads to the occupation of others who would otherwise be

wholly imoccupied. In reference to industrial employment, I wish to observe that
I try to provide such as is most suited to the tastes or antecedents of the patients,
and at the same time such as, with certain limitations, is most useful to the insti-

tution.

  --The total disuse of restraint, and the very infrequent use of seclusion the

freedom allowed to all our patients to exercise and have various sorts of games on

--the open grounds, in place of enclosed yards are very gratifying features. The

number and cost of our staff, estimated per head on the daily average number of

patients, is less in this than in the other district lunatic asylums of Ireland ; and

this fact, taken in connection with our large teaching and training power, shows

that education and industrial employment carried out, as they are here, systema-

tically, by skilled  hands,  do  not  necessarily increase                                                                        expense.  The cost per head
                                                                                                                               '

for salaries and wages here, estimated on the average number in the house, was for

1876 41. 0s. 5d., compared with 41. 19s. Gd., the average cost per head of the staff in

all the other district lunatic asylums in Ireland in the same year. Our staff of

--officers and servants was at the rate of one for every 8-8 patients the staff of all

other district asylums in Ireland was one to every 66 patients.

In the number of the Journal of Mental Science for October 1860 I published a

paper in which I advocated large in preference to small asylums, and any person

desirous of doing so can there see the reasons on which I grounded my preference.

The experience which I have since had in the education and training of lunatics

makes me still more in favour of large asylums than I was in 1860, particularly in

view of this question of education ; and as the same general principles and

machinery are applicable in their case, so far as training is concerned, as in that of

idiots and imbeciles, it may be presumed that if the result of experience and

reasoning has led to a decided preference for large over small training institutions,

in the case of the latter, it should favoar a similar preference in the case of the

former. The Earlswood Asylum, which had 184 idiots and imbeciles in training in
1857, and 509 in 1877, appears to have advanced in efficiency and public estimation
as it has enlarged in size. The Charity Organisation Society and the Metro-
politan Asylum Board appear to think 500 a favourable size for a training
school for imbecile children. The Charity Organisation Society also states that :
" Training schools and adult asylums, however they may differ in their internal
arrangements, have mutual relations which often make it desirable that they should
be in each other's neighbourhood, and under the same general superintendence."
I coincide in this opinion, and I think it is from a wise forethought that a site has
been selected at Darenth, sufficiently large for an asylum for adults, in addition to
the training school for 500 children now near completion. It is probable that such
an asylum, with accommodation for 2000 adults, will be built at Darenth, and
ample evidence is thus afforded that extended experience and consideration is found
to favour large and combined in preference to small and distinct asylums.

     Ever since physical repression and fear have ceased to be the principles relied
on for maintaining even tolerable security, order, and quiet, and promoting recovery
or improvement amongst the insane in confinement, medical and moral treatment
have been brought more and more into requisition. Moral treatment is only
another name for education and training. But the great defect in carrying out the
recognised principles of moral treatment has been that the agents employed have

not been sufficiently adapted to the object in view. It is absurd to expect that
moral treatment can be efficiently carried out by a few resident medical and other
officers, however intelligent and well-intentioned, through their direct and personal
exertions, which are necessarily desultory. There must be an organisation in con-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  671

 nection with the ohject, analogous to that which is found essential for the educa-

 tion and training of the sane. In the case of the insane, it is further obviously
 desirable that the educational agency, which has been found so efficacious in school

 hours, should not wholly cease after school hours are over. It would be contrary

 to sound principles to remit the moral treatment of the insane after school hours to
 the sole charge of attendants not prepared by their antecedents for the discharge of
 such a duty. Everyone with extended practical experience of the subject knows

 that a very large proportion of the attendants in lunatic asylums have not received

that instruction calculated to make them skilled agents in fulfilling the requirements

 called for in the moral treatment of the insane.

      In each division there should be at least one such attendant, whilst at present I

fear that there are many asylums without even one such attendant in the whole
asylum. To carry out individual moral training in asylums, even of small size,

appears impossible, even if it were desirable. Direct individual training is too

likely to degenerate into argumentation, not calculated to influence an insane person
beneficially. The problem to be solved is to break the habit of abnormal feeling

and acting as much as possible, and this can be better done by indirect and class

training than by direct individual training. In classes, the influence of the example
of the large mass of the quiet and orderly on their more disorderly inmates multiplies

the good result.

      In instructing sane adidt classes, whether in morality, in science, or in literature,

the advantage of teaching in class becomes every day more fully appreciated and
established. Singing, music, and amusements for the million are every day more
called for by the public voice, and the opinion is, I believe, gaining ground that
religious instruction carries more influence when addressed to large than to small

congregations. What reason is there for supposing that the powerful mental and

moral lever of example should not be applied on the same principles to the insane
as to the sane mind ? Be this as it may, I think it will be admitted that any
influence which is good should be as continuous as possible. To keep the mind
free from insane or immoral impressions is an obvious desideratum. This result is
to be sedulously sought for ; and even in a negative form it opens the door for the
introduction of normal thought. Normal action follows normal thought. To keep
the insane from mischief, to themselves or others, is a chief reason for placing them

in asylums, and I know of nothing more conducive to this end than healthful
occupation of mind and body ; and such occupation can only be efficiently conducted
by trained and skilled hands.

     It is generally admitted at the present day that, to be qualified to teach, literary
knowledge alone is not sufficient, but that the teacher should also be trained to teach

and I believe that the same principle should be kept in view in selecting those who
are to educate and train the insane, whether in or out of school. Those who have

been trained as monitors and monitresses in normal schools and public establish-

ments are a class from whom persons well fitted to act as attendants may be

obtained, who, with a little additional special instruction, would become admirably

suited to carry out the moral training of the insane in asylums, whether in school-
classes or otherwise. In Ireland there are a number of such persons suited and
willing to take the situation of attendants on the insane in asylums, moderate as is

--the remuneration attached thereto. Their education the habits and skill in

teaching and influencing to good ends which they have acquired, the knowledge of
singing and music and of directing industrial occupations, whether for males or

females, which they often possess, present obvious advantages ; and it is much to be
regretted that many of this class (if I am rightly informed) take situations in their
own country lower in value and position than that of an asylum attendant, or emi-

grate to our colonies or other countries. It is from this class that I have selected

what are called school attendants in the Richmond Asylum ; and my experience of
them gives me no room for hesitation or doubt in recommending the example of

this asylum in this respect for general imitation. The want of school-rooms is a
difficulty sometimes alleged as standing in the way of establishing schools in
asylums. But school-rooms are not necessary, and we have none here. Schools
are alleged by some, who admit their practicability and value in the Richmond
--672 report 1878.

Asylum, to be impracticable in most other asylums, particularly where the patients
are of a rude, illiterate, and agricultural class. But it is to be borne in mind that
the education and training of the insane is chiefly of use, not for the literary and
industrial knowledge imparted, but as supplying the best means of restoring the
mind to a healthy state, of teaching habits of good order and self-control, and of
relieving the tedium of idleness, and so promoting contentment and even happiness.
The ignorant, as well as the educated, present subjects capable of deriving benefit
from that moral treatment which skilled education and training alone can adequately
supply. Amongst the causes which lead to insanity as well as to crime, I believe
ignorance to be one ; and it should be noted that out of 8183 patients in the
district lunatic asylums of Ireland, only 1899 are set down as well educated and

capable of reading and writing well, whilst there are 5516 who can only read and

write indifferently, read only, or neither read nor write. Whilst the insane in
lunatic asylums are in general so deficient in education, it is noteworthy that 125
were students or teachers before they became insane. Here is a body amongst

whom several are by no means incapacitated from teaching by their mental con-

dition. In this asylum, out of fifteen of this class, several give valuable aid in

carrying out our school system. Twelve patients who were learning to read and
write in this asylum in 1837 were taught, I should suppose, by a fellow-patient, as
there was then no paid teacher in the asylum ; and in 1852 a few of the female

patients in this asylum received school instruction for some time under the direction

of one of the patients, who had been a schoolmistress, and the result was satis-
factory. The circumstances in the public asylums in England and Scotland are, I

believe, at least equally favourable to the introduction of education and training of
the insane of all classes as they .are in Ireland ; and the advantages vvould, I feel
confident, be equally great.

       TUESDAY, AUGUST 20, 1878.

The following Papers were read :

1. Some Remarks on the Desirability of Simultaneous and Identical Legisla-
               tion/or England and Ireland.'11' By H. L. Jephson.

      The Act of Union is very far from being complete. First of all, though it
 'declared Her Majesty's subjects of Great Britain aud Ireland to be on the same
 footing generally in respect of trade and navigation, it left both countries with
 separate customs department and tariffs, and thus left them in this matter

 virtually separate countries. Next, it left each country with its separate exchequer,

 its different coinage. Next, it directed that all laws then in force, and all the
 courts of civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the respective kingdoms, should
 remain as then by law established within the same, subject, however, to " such
 alterations and regulations from time to time as circumstances might appear to the
 Parliament of the United Kingdom to require." It left Ireland also with a sepa-
 rate peerage, a separate Privy Council, and finally, and perhaps the most important

--of all, as being the ever fruitful cause of separate legislation it left Ireland with a

 separate Executive. Seventeen years elapsed before any material progress was
 made, the union of the exchequers then had taken place. The next step of im-
 portance was not taken until 1825, when the two countries were commerciallv
 united, and in the following year the currencies were assimilated; but it was not
 until so very recently as 1858 (just twenty years ago) that the fiscal systems of the
 two countries were finally assimilated. The very striking fact, however, remains

that after a lapse of now very close on 80 years, many of the defects of the Act of
 Union exist in full vigour. About the close of the first quarter of the centurv a

system of legislation crept in, and gradually gained ground, which resulted in the
creation of a vast number of differences. Reforms in the administration of justice
naturally became necessary, but instead of their being carried simultaneously for
both countries, as ought to have been done, each country was dealt with separately.
It might reasonably be expected that in the matter of sanitary legislation the two
countries shoidd be treated as one. Such an opinion, however, if it prevailed, was
not acted on. In 1855 a Sanitary Act was passed for England only. In 1866
when an invasion of cholera was anticipated in Ireland, the only precautions which
the Irish Privy Council could take against the introduction of that disease into
Ireland were under the condemned Acts of 1848 and 1849 which were still in force
there. The emergency, however, became so great that the Sanitary Act had to be
passed for Ireland, and the law was then assimilated to the English law. Another
difference created since the Union, and one which entailed a number of others, was
as regards the valuation of property. In England and Scotland the valuation of
property was based upon rent; in Ireland it was based on the prices of agricultural

produce. Furthermore, in Great Britain the valuation is annually revised, whereas
in Ireland no revision as to the value of land as distinct from buildings had taken
place during the last 25 years. The result was that the valuation of property in
Great Britain and Ireland was far from being approximate. Besides those which the
author had alluded to, there were differences in the laws relating to the representation
of minorities, relating to the legal status of women, in the pawnbroking laws, in the

licensing laws, in the poor laws, and in a host of other minor subjects. The prin-

--ciple which should regulate all legislation for Ireland might be thus stated:

Firstly, In all legislation regarding matters which affect equally the people of
both countries no differences whatever should be permitted. In the next place
where similar results could not be obtained by identical means, the difference of
means should be as far as possible minimised ; and the absolute condition should be

insisted on that legislation should be simultaneous. And lastly, where special

legislation was a necessity, it should aim at bringing the matters that formed the
subject of such legislation as far as possible into harmony in the two countries.
The rules which should be followed to give effect to these principles might be thus

--stated : No measure that came under the first of these principles should be intro-

duced into either House of Parliament for England only, but should be made to

extend to both countries. When special clauses were required to adapt a measure

to the institutions of Ireland, the necessary clauses, instead of being postponed to a

future period, and then made a separate Act, as now so often happens, should be

tacked on to the principal Act. The Ballot Act showed how, even in a large and
very complicated subject, simultaneous legislation was possible. Certain cases re-
mained where the subject would be of such a nature or extent that a separate Act
for Ireland would be required. Under this class would come all the legislation
which would have to be effected to assimilate Irish to English institutions,
and to bring Irish laws into harmony with English laws. In these cases the
English precedent should be followed as closely as possible, and every unnecessary
difference avoided. If the principles here stated were kept steadily in view and

systematically acted on, a considerably increased degree of legislative uniformity

would soon be attained ; and what was also very important, a guarantee would be
afforded that such uniformity would be lasting.

2. On the Importance of raising Ireland to the Level of England and Scot-

       land in the matter of Industrial Schools and Compulsory Education.

      By W. Neilson Hancock., LL.D*

     The official statistics of children committed to reformatories in Ireland show
that only 10 per cent, of the boys and none of the girls were properly educated.
More than half the girls and three-fifths of the boys were totally ignorant. To

--remedy the state of ignorance disclosed, the following suggestions as to industrial

schools were recommended for adoption: The suggestions of the Recorder of
Dublin (Mr. Falkiner) that Lord Sandon's clause in the Act of 1876, for establish-
ing day industrial schools, should be extended to Ireland. The suggestion of Mr.
Lentaigne, Inspector of Reformatory Schools, that the full benefit of English law
as to industrial boarding schools should be extended to Ireland. As to compulsory
 education, it is proposed to follow the Scotch Act of 1872, only substituting in the
 details Irish existing centralized official machinery for the Scotch local machinery.
 Elementary education of children between five and thirteen to be obligatory on
 parents. Guardians to be enabled, in case of poverty, to pay school fees. Irish

--police to collect information as to neglect of parents, as officers of local boards do

in Scotland, and to prosecute unless medical officer, as to health, clergyman, as to
 family reasons, or inspector of National schools, as to want of school accommoda-

 tion, certified that parent might be excused. Where National School inspector

 reported school accommodation deficient, or justices refused to convict for that
 reason, reports to be referred to Commissioners of Donations and Bequests, to see
 if any unused endowments were applicable, and the inspector of industrial schools
 to see if want could be met by industrial day schools and other voluntary effort.

 From such reports could be collected, as to whether assistance for industrial and

 primary education would be necessary, like that afforded to intermediate education
 by the Irish Intermediate Education Act of 1878.

3. On some Economic Fallacies of Trades Unionists.
                 By Professor J. J. Shaw.

The theory of the Unions on the subject of wages was that they might be

raised without either increasing capital or diminishing the supply of labour by
lowering the rate of profits, and, on the other hand, they might be lowered

without either diminishing capital or increasing the supply of labour by raising

the rate of profits                                                                        that the most obvious way to increase the  reward  of  the
                                                                                        ;

labourer was to diminish that of the capitalist, and the direct way to diminish

the labourer's reward was to increase the share that fell to the capitalist. This

reasoning overlooked the fact that there was in every community a certain rate of
profit which was the minimum that any capitalist would be content to accept

that if his profits were permanently forced below that minimum he would with-
draw his capital, and in the end there would result a fall of wages even below the

point at which they stood when the artificial rise commenced. The idea enter-

tained by the organisers of trades unions of effecting by their action a permanent

rise in the average rate of wages, independently of any change in the general pro-

ductiveness of industry, was one that could never be realised. This could be done
only by lowering the rate of profit, and in these countries the rate of profit was
always on the verge of the minimum. To lower the rate of profit, therefore, was
to check accumulation, and thereby to diminish the fund out of which labour was

paid. Labourers, by combination, could do much to alter the rate of wao-es tem-
porarily, and in particular trades. But it was evident that the high wages were
obtained at the expense of the consumers, and if the commodities they produced

was one consumed by their own class they reduced the wages of their fellow-
workmen as much as they raised their own. To the important economic question
whether the wage-earning classes could by combination permanently raise the
average rate of wages, he was obliged to answer " No." What the working classes

most of all needed to be taught was that their destiny was in their own hands,
that their happiness was not made or marred by the by-laws of their unions or the
tyranny of their masters, but depended wholly and solely on their own prudence
                                                                                                                                                  '

     The following Papers were read :

  1. On the Social Aspects of Trades Unionism. By J. H. M. Campbell.

     The Trades Unions are advantageous to the working classes, as benefit and
insurance societies, and centres of combined legitimate action. It is, moreover, to
the persistent agitation of these unions, aided by the efforts of philanthropists,
that are to be ascribed the many legislative enactments of modern times against

the employment of women or children in unhealthy or too-protracted labour,

against the use of defective and dangerous machinery, and affording facilities for
the erection of comfortable and well-aired dwellings. But Trades' Unions assumed

a verv different aspect when examined with regard to that which is avowed to be
theirprimary object, and to which all others are ancillary and subservient, that of
controlling the labour market, and regulating the amount of their wages. The

author then reviewed the economic conditions regulating the rise and fall of wages,
with which he contended Trades Unions could not attempt to interfere without
injury to their members and the country. Respecting strikes, nothing could be
more suicidal than the policy sometimes pursued of going out on strike to avoid a
reduction of wages in times of depressed trade. The year 1877 affords a striking
illustration of the truth of this statement, for, while the country was suffering
from acute commercial depression, I find that in that year no less than 191 strikes
occurred, the majority of which were intended, not to secure a rise of wages, but
to prevent the reduction rendered inevitable by the state of trade, and were conse-
quently disastrous failures. Little less injurious was the consequence of a strike,
nor the plan at present in favour with the working classes for retrieving their
position under the prevalent depression by shortened hours of labour. Every
 reduction in the hours of labour, unless compensated for by superior efficiency, is
 equivalent in its effect to a rise of wages, and, consequently must either raise prices

 or lower profits. The effect of the latter result we have already seen, while
 increased prices arising from such a cause would drive out the English manufac-
 turer, and enable foreign competitors to undersell him in all those industries in
 which the advantage possessed by England is trifling in extent. The most disas-

 trous and fallacious form which this claim for shortened hours of labour assumes is

 when it is urged as a means of bringing in unemployed workmen. Why, it is
 asked, should not the workmen limit the supply of their labour by working less

 hours, and thereby give others a chance of sharing in the amount of work, and
 consequently in the wages offered by employers ? To this, as to all those regula-
 tions of trades unions which, like their restrictions on apprenticeship, are for the
 avowed object of making work, the simple answer is, that it is never work that is
 deficient, but capital to give employment, and that the greater the total produce is
 the greater will be the amount saved and devoted to the subsequent employment of
 labour ; so that it would seem to be a self-evident proposition that if workmen
 combine to do only half the amount of work they are capable of performing, there
 will be only half the amount of wealth in the country that it is possible there
 should be, and, consequently, only half the amount to devote to the purchase of

 fresh labour.

        2. On Adam Smith's Theory of Bent. By W. D. Henderson.

     I purpose confining my paper to one aspect of the subject, viz., the effect of the

 payment of rent upon the productiveness of the ground, and this, it will be seen,

--includes at least one aspect of the great question is it for the benefit of the com-

munity that land should be owned by persons who let it out for cultivation
rather than by the cultivators themselves ? Again, my investigation will not

--answer the question- would it be worth while to destroy the present system upon

which land is owned, and substitute for it some form of ownership by peasant
proprietors ? It was the well-known opinion of Smith that land which would
grow almost anything would afford a rent. His reason for this opinion was, that
agriculture was more profitable than any other mode of employing capital. The

question may fairly be asked, why should not the same rule be applied to agricul-
tural rents as Smith applies to rents of mines, and why should not the landlords

refuse to let lands which would yield them no rent, either on account of the natural
barrenness of soil or the expense of working it ? Now, the reply given by modern
political economists is this. They admit that in fact there are large tracts of land
which would be cultivated by peasant proprietors, but which will not be cultivated

by mere tenants. So far we are all agreed, and this admission furnishes a per-
fectly solid economic basis for the demand of which we often hear in Ireland, that

the waste lands should be dealt with by the State. I shall endeavour to point out
what are the landlords' motives to prevent the increased cultivation of the soil, and
what are the means taken to attain his end, it being assumed that his only motive

is to obtain the largest possible rent for himself. His first motive will be to keep

down the poor rates. He has constantly before his eyes the risk of the labourers

and their families coming on the poor rates in bad seasons, or through sickness or
ill health. The burden of supporting them properly falls on the land ; and it is a

source of incessant watchfulness on the part of the landlord that it should not be

in any way excessive. So strong has this motive been found in practice that it has

been necessary in England to extend the area of rating for the poor rates. His

second motive is his desire to have a steady and certain income. He is, in fact,
like other men in his position, disposed to take the world very easily indeed ; he
prefers large farms to small. Pie would rather deal with one man of capital than
with a dozen men who might, and probably would at times give him trouble.
From this, again, arises another important result. The landlord is most anxious

that he should be absolute. owner of his land, and this for various reasons, political,

social, and economic. And all these motives combine to dictate his conduct as to
having large farms. Now, a system of small farms, such as we have in Ulster,
almost necessitates that the tenants shall make the improvements, both permanent

and otherwise. The desire also of the landlord to get an addition to his income in

the shape of an increased rent will tend in the same direction. He does not

care to be met with the argument that so many labourers have been employed.
Such seem to be the chief determining motives of the landlords. The mode in which

they attain their ends are very simple. In the first place the landlords absolutely

refuse to allow of the sub-division of farms. No matter how large may have been

the farmer's holding, or what his tenure, the landlord reserves the power, and ex-

ercises it, of compelling the farmers to cultivate it themselves, and he forbids after
their death any sub-division of their interest. The peasant proprietor, or the semi-

peasant proprietor, who would sub-divide within reasonable limits, and cultivate

carefully, has no chance on the estate. Not merely does he prevent sub-division,
but he is disposed to pursue a system of consolidation of farms.
   Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

Peesident of the Section-- Edward Easton, Esq., C.E.

                          THURSDAY, AUGUST 15, 1878.

Mr, Easton gave the following Address :

At the commencement of each Annual Report it is stated that one of the objects of

the British Association is " to give a stronger impulse and a more systematic

direction to scientific inquiry," and its division into Sections was made with the

view of concentrating such inquiry upon the several departments of Science.

I propose to endeavour to further that object by making the Address, which I

have the honour to deliver as President of Section G, a preface as it were to the

fuller consideration of a subject of the highest interest to all the inhabitants of the

United Kingdom, and not least to those who have so freely extended their hospitality

to us on this occasion. That subject is the Conservancy of Rivers and Streams in

the widest sense of the term.

It is worthy of remark that it was on the occasion of the first visit of the

British Association to this city in the year 1835, that the Mechanical Section was

virtually instituted. Previous to that meeting the Section of Mathematics and

Physics had undertaken the discussion of questions having reference to the prac-

tical application of physical science, but at the Dublin meeting a subsection

was specially appointed, which in 1836 became Section G. The late Mr. George

Rennie, that distinguished son of one of our greatest engineers, presided on the

occasion. His report on Hydraulics presented to the Association in 1834 is full

of research, and should be studied by every one interested in the question of rivers.

    I am glad to be able to announce that my Address will be followed by a series

of Papers on the same subject, the authors of which are certainly very well

qualified to elucidate its details ; and I trust that many of the other eminent men
who are attending this meeting of the British Association will join in the discussion

of these Papers.

    By the Conservancy of Rivers and Streams I mean the treatment and regulation

of all the water that falls on these islands from its first arrival in the shape of rain

and dew to its final disappearance in the ocean.

myI had at first, in      ignorance, contemplated treating the subject in a still

wider manner by referring to the rivers and streams of other countries ; but I soon

found that the vast extent of the field to be traversed would make it extremely

unlikely that I could, with any satisfactory result, attempt the more restricted task

which I have now before me. Indeed, without the promised aid which I have re-

ferred to, I should have shrunk from attempting it at all.
     The question of the Conservancy of Rivers and Streams involves the consideration

of their regulation for the following principal purposes :

1st. For the supply of pure and wholesome water for the domestic and sanitary

wants of the population.

2nd. For the supply of water of proper quality and sufficient quantity for

industrial purposes.
680 report-- 1878.

      3rd. For the proper development of water power.
      4th. For the drainage and irrigation of land.
      5th. For navigation and commerce.
      Oth. For the preservation of fish.
      In the eirly days of the world's history there were attempts to regulate and

--control the waters of rivers some of them devoted to military and dynastic

 objects, but the majority to generally useful ends. Herodotus, speaking of Semira-

 niis, who lived some 2000 years B.C., tells us that she raised certain embankments,

 well worthy of inspection, in the plain near Babylon to control the river Euphrates,

which till then used to overflow and flood the whole country round about. He
also mentions a lady, who lived at a still earlier period, who altered the course of

 the same river, as a defence against the Medes, to such an extent that, " whereas
 the river Euphrates ran formerly with a straight course to Babylon, Nitocris, by
 certain excavations which 9he made at some distance up the stream, rendered it so
 winding that it comes three several times within sight of the same village"
 (Ardericca, in Assyria). " She also made an embankment along each side of the
 Euphrates wonderful both for breadth and height, and dug a basin for a lake a

great way above Babylon, close alongside of the stream, which basin was sunk
 everywhere to the point at which they came to water, and was of such breadth
 that its whole circuit measured 420 stadia (more than 50 miles). The soil dug

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 %

out of this basin was used in the embankments along the water side. When the

 excavation was finished she had stones brought, and bordered with them the entire

--margin of the reservoir. These two things were done the river made to wind,
--and the lake excavated that the stream might be slacker by reason of the number

 of curves and the voyage rendered circuitous, and that at the end of the journey it
might be necessary to skirt the lake, and so make a long round. All these works
 were on the side of Babylon where the passes lay, and the roads into Media were
the straightest ; and the aim of Nitocris in making them was to prevent the Medes
from holding intercourse with the Babylonians, and so to keep them in ig-norance
of her affairs." The same energetic princess made brick embankments and quays,
and a bridge over the Euphrates, and to do this she turned the entire stream of the
river into an artificial cutting, the natural channel being left temporarily dry until

the bridge was finished, when the Euphrates was allowed to flow into its ancient
bed. It was into this very cutting that Gyrus directed the course of the Euphrates
when he took Babylon, 538 B.C. In the time of Herodotus himself, about B.C. 450,
there were embankments to the river at Babylon ; for he says, " The city wall
is brought down on both sides to the edge of the stream ; thence from the
corners of the wall there is carried along each bank of the river a fence of burnt

bricks, with low brazen gates opening on the water."
     The same historian, in his second book, describes the hydraulic works of the

first king of Egypt, Men or Menes, which were not only gigantic in themselves,

but productive of the most important results to the inhabitants of his kingdom.
" Before his time," Herodotus says, " the river flowed entirely along the sandy
range of hills which skirt Egypt on the west side. He, however, by banking up
the river at the bend which it forms about 100 furlongs south of Memphis, laid the
ancient channel dry, and dug a new course for the stream halfway between the two

lines of hills."

      Passing to Greece, perhaps the most wonderful instance of the successful regu-
lation of water is to be found in the subterranean channels (the modern Greek
Katabathra), by which the waters of the river Cephisus are carried through Lake
Topolias (the ancient Copais) into the sea. These tunnels, which are partly natural
and partly artificial, have always served to prevent the lake overflowing the

adjoining country.

     The well-known tunnel, or emissarium, from the Alban Lake is an example of

Roman work. This tunnel, of a man's height, and cut through 6,000 feet of lava,

is said to have been begun in obedience to the Delphic oracle in the sixth year ot

the siege of Veii, B.C. 398. By it, the overflow of the lake which used periodically
to flood the Campagna was prevented, and the waters were conducted through it

in an even flow for the irrigation of the fields which it had formerly laid waste.
                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.            681

Three vertical shafts and one made in an oblique direction still remain ; the marks
on the hard rock show that the chisels employed in the cutting were an inch in

width. Another Roman work of still greater importance was the emissarium

at Lake Fucinus, planned hy Julius Csesar and carried into execution by Claudius.

This was a tunnel three miles in length, extending from the lake to the river Liris

(the modern Garigliano), one mile of it being driven through a mountain of cor-
nelian rising 3,000 feet above the lake. It employed 30,000 men for eleven years.

There are many perpendicular shafts for raising the rock to the surface and lateral

galleries for disposing of the spoil, so as to enable this large number of men to work

without interfering with each other.

The supply of water to different cities of the ancients has been the motive for

the execution of the most stupendous works, which are almost numberless. It

will be sufficient for me to allude to the works constructed for the supply of the

city of Samos, about the time of Polycrates, B.C. 530, in which case a tunnel was

driven through a hill 150 fathoms high, for a length of seven furlongs. Its height
and width were each eight feet, and it conveyed the water from the river Ampelus

into the city. Herodotus tell us that the architect was Eupalinus, the son of

Naustrophus, a Megarian. Sir George Wilkinson, in a note on the text, mentions

the fact that a French traveller, M. Guerin, discovered one mouth of this tunnel to

the N.W. of the harbour of Samos, and cleared it from sand and stones to a dis-

tance of 540 paces.

It is sometimes asserted that the ancients were ignorant of the hydrostatic law

that water finds its own level. This is not the case. Frontinus, who preceded
Agricola, the father-in-law of Tacitus, as Governor of Britain, and who was

Curator Aquarum in Rome under Nerva and Trajan, mentions in his book, ' De

Aquaeductibus Urbis Romae,' that in case of the fracture of an aqueduct, the

water could be dammed up at each side of the point of fracture, and carried over the

Aintervening space in leaden pipes.   great deal of the internal distribution of the

water in Rome was managed by leaden pipes under pressure.

     The aqueduct which Herod is said to have constructed for the supply of Jeru-

-- --salem crossed a deep valley near Rachel's Tomb by means of a stone pipe

working under pressure. This work has been fully described by Mr. Telford

Macneill in the Report made by Sir John Macneill to the Committee for supplying

Jerusalem with water. The construction of this pipe is so remarkable that I shall

give Mr. Macneill's description in detail. It consists of great blocks of stone

through which holes 15 inches in diameter have been cut. One end of each block

has been hollowed out to a depth of 4^ inches, with a diameter of 24 inches

thus leaving a recess 4£ inches wide to form the socket of the pipe. The

other end has a projection of a size to fit a similar socket in the pipe which lies

next to it. This answers to the spigot of a modern cast-iron water-pipe. Both

socket and spigot are ground, so as to tit with great accuracy, and the joint is

made with cement, which has set as hard as the stone itself. The whole line of

these stone pipes is surrounded with rubble masonry. The pressure on the centre

of this very remarkable inverted syphon is not less than 70 lbs. per square inch.

The Arabs at a later period not only knew of this law, but also understood

the operation of what we engineers call the " hydraulic mean gradient." The

aqueducts constructed by them for supplying Constantinople with water have been

very fully described in those most interesting ' Letters from Turkey,' written by

Field-Marshal von Moltke in the years 1835 to 1839. He says that the Arabs

knew that water under pressure reaches its own level (rich gleich stellt), for they

conveyed the water across the valleys in leaden pipes. They had found by expe-

rience that the friction through the aqueduct was lessened if openings were made

in the course of the line of pipes and along hill-sides and in places where the
                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

pipes were not in deep cuttings, funnel-shaped shafts or wells were made, which

acted as air-holes. But in crossing deep valleys, where, of course, no such holes

could be made, they built stone pyramids, called " Suterasi," or water-balances, on

the top of which they placed small basins, into and out of which the water was

conducted by a leaden pipe laid up one side of the pyramid and down the other.

The level of these basins was so arranged that they were at an inclination rather
682 bepobt-- 1878.

greater than the average fall of the aqueduct ; and thus they allowed the water to
take the hydraulic mean gradient due to the head necessary for the delivery of the
water. It is probahle that these " suterasi " were made about 1000 a.d.

    For 400 or 500 years after the last date very little was done in the way of great
public works of this description ; and it was not until the beginning of the sixteenth

century that the state of the rivers in Italy commanded the attention of the great
landowners and scientific men of that country. At that time, chiefly in consequence

of the appointment of a Commission in 1516 by Francis I., works for remedy-

ing existing evils were seriously thought of ; and for a long series of years the most

eminent mathematicians and engineers were engaged in investigating the subject

Aand in designing and carrying out works of greater or less magnitude.  very full

collection, both of the writings of these Italian engineers and of descriptions of

their works, is contained in a book of thirteen volumes, published at Bologna, in

1821-24, entitled ' Raccolta dAutori Italiani che trattano del Moto dellAcque.'

It would seem that about the same time the question began to excite interest in

England, for it was in the reign of Henry VIII. that a public statute first

dealt with river conservancy. But it is to be remarked that neither in Italy nor

in England was the question treated in anything like an exhaustive manner. The

great hydraulic works of Italy relate almost exclusively to irrigation and naviga-

tion, whilst the drainage of lands and the prevention of floods were the objects of

legislation in England. During the same period the Dutch were of course con-
structing many important hydraulic works ; but these, from the special circum-

stances of the country, were not such as to have much bearing on the general

question of the conservancy of rivers.

After the drainage of the Fens, the next great works in England were the

canals, which, in a very few years, extended over the whole of England, and

formed a complete system for the conveyance of traffic. It is superfluous to say

that their construction and maintenance had a strong bearing upon the regulation
of rivers. The well-known saying of Brindley that rivers were " principally valu-

able for feeding canals " sufficiently indicates the subserviency of the other in-

terests involved. Next, the introduction of railways and steamboats, and the

increase in the size of ships, turned the attention of those interested in rivers to

the improvement of the tidal harbours and channels ; and from that time to the

present the greatest hydraulic works of our time have been connected with navi-

gation. The concurrent increase in manufactures necessitated the employment of

water in ways apparently antagonistic to other interests, and introduced the new

element of pollution of our rivers and streams, whilst the demands of sanitary

legislation consequent on the great increase of population made it imperatively
necessary that their purity should be maintained. Indeed, we may say that the

present high state of civilization in which we live has involved greater complica-

tions in this as in other departments of life, and requires special arrangements
to meet them.

Legal enactments for the regulation of rivers, and for defining the rights of pro-

perty in water, have existed from very early times. Solon laid down that to inter-

cept the supply or to corrupt the quality of water is a crime. He also enacted that

if any one dug a well to a depth of ten fathoms (opyvlai) without finding water, he

should be permitted to take from his neighbour's well a pitcher of six x°fs (about 18
quarts) twice a day. Plato, in his Laws, mentions an analogous provision, but con-

fines it to drinking water only. Another law quoted by him is more to the point : it
runs as follows : " If after heavy rains any of the lower riparian proprietors should
injure a neighbour who lives above them, by stopping the downward flow of the

water, or in case, on the other hand, the proprietor living higher up shall injure his

neighbour below, by negligently allowing the water to run down upon him, either
of them may call in the magistrates and obtain a decision for the guidance of both

parties. If either party fail to abide by such decision, he shall be punished for

the enviousness and peevishness of his spirit, and shall pay double damages to the

injured person."

     The Pandects of Justinian, which area collection of all the old legal authorities

of Roman Law, analogous to our own Reported Oases, contain a variety of leading
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                  683

principles which govern the administration of the law of running water : principles

identical mainly with that of our own Common Law. vSome of these related to

fishing, watering cattle, to the interruption of navigation of lakes, canals, and ponds,
to the preservation of the water supply, to the repairs of river banks, and to the
regulation of the summer and winter flow of what were termed public rivers. It
was enacted among other things, that nothing should be done to the stream or banks

of a public river, whereby the flow should be altered from its state in the preceding

summer.

    The earliest record in our own Statute Law of any enactment relating to rivers
is that contained in 25 Edward III. c. 4, which legalised all " gorces, mills, wears,

stanks, stakes, and kiddles " of a date previous to " the reign of his grandfather

Edward I. by which the common passage de neefs et batelx en les grantz rivers
d'Engleterre be oftentimes annoyed," and ordered the immediate pulling down of

all such erections which were of a later date.

    From that time, until the enactment of Henry VIIL, there were various laws

passed, chiefly relating to the navigations and rights of mills, and occasionally to

the preservation of fish. After Henry VIII . very many private Acts and Charters

granting powers for the drainage and reclamation of lands, for improvement of

Anavigation, and matters of a similar kind, were passed from time to time.  great

number also of Royal Commissions and Select Committees have conducted

enquiries, and made reports upon most of the various branches of the subject, e.g.

the pollution of rivers, the water supply, arterial drainage, navigation, fisheries,

&c, but, until the appointment last year of the Select Committee presided

over by the Duke of Richmond, no attempt, as far as I am aware, has been made

to grapple with the question as a whole, and the Report made by them to the

House of Lords omitted to deal with, at least, two of the objects I have indicated

as being necessary to the proper consideration of the subject.

     The recommendations made in the Report of that Committee were most im-
portant, and they will, if carried out, remote many of the difficulties which stand
in the way of a complete system of conservancy of our rivers.

     So much has been written on the engineering details of this subject, by
men far better qualified than I am to deal with them, that I shall confine myself to
the simple statement of the principles which have been recognised by the chief

authorities as essential, and to a few suggestions, which my own experience leads
me to think may be of some value. Almost all the great engineers of former
generations, who have paid attention to this question, Smeaton, Telford, Rennie,

Golborne, Mylne, Walker, Rendel, Stephenson, Jessop, Chapman, Beardmore, and
without mentioning names, many of the most eminent now living, have agreed to

the following general propositions

That the freer the admission of the tidal water, the better adapted is the river

for all purposes, whether of navigation, drainage, or fisheries.
    That its sectional area and inclination should be made to suit the required

carrying power of the river throughout its entire length, both for the ordinary flow

of the water, and for floods.

    That the downward flow of the upland water should be equalised as much as

possible throughout the entire year; and

That all abnormal contaminations should be removed from the streams.

     In carrying out these principles, it is perhaps superfluous to say, that modifica-
tions must be introduced to suit the particular phenomena of each river. In some

watershed areas, it would be easy to construct reservoirs, which would to a great

extent equalise the flow and reduce floods. In others it might be better to con-

trol the floods by means of embankments. In others, to have weirs, and sluices,

delivering into side channels, parallel to the main stream, with the same object.

Sometimes reservoirs, or receptacles, must be made for catching the debris brought
down by the streams. In fact, every river must be treated as a separate entity.

It is therefore, necessary that a systematic collection of data, relating to rainfall,

the geological character of the gathering ground, and the volume of each separate
stream, should be made for each watershed area ; and this should be carried on for
a sufficient length of time to enable a fairly correct estimate to be formed of the
684 report-- 1878.

behaviour of the river hoth in time of flood and in time of drought. The estab-

lishment of self-acting tide-registering gauges at several points of every outfall

should be insisted on. By these means the whole of the phenomena of a watershed

area could be ascertained and recorded, and safe and trustworthy knowledge could
be obtained, which would contribute towards the determination, not only of the
works which ought to be executed, but of the incidence of the taxation by which
the necessary funds should be raised. For instance, it is obvious that where the
geological character of a watershed is variable, one portion of it consisting of a
permeable stratum, such as chalk or red sandstone, and another portion of an
impervious stratum, such as the tertiary clays or the shales of the millstone grit, the
same works would not be adapted to each section of the river, nor would it be fair
to charge all with the expense according to the same scale of contribution. The
former, that is the permeable stratum, is not only, from its absorbent nature, not
the cause of floods, but is, by reason of that characteristic, absolutely constituted
by nature one of the very works which must be devised by art to mitigate the
effects of rainfall on the latter, or impervious stratum.

      Bearing this in mind, I have often thought that nature might be usefully imi-
tated in this operation, by passing the surplus rainfall into the permeable
strata of the earth by means of wells, or shafts, sunk through the impermeable
strata overlying them. This has been done in isolated cases for the drainage of
lands, but not for the deliberate purpose of preventing floods and equalising the
flow of rivers.

    I also wish to remark that artificial compensating reservoirs may be much more
frequently made use of than is generally supposed to be possible, when it is con-
sidered that, so long as the dams are constructed in situations where there is

no danger of their giving way, it is by no means necessary that they should be
water-tight, and that, therefore, they can be constructed at a very much smaller
outlay. In fact, the purpose would be answered by a series of open weirs, which
would collect the water in times of flood and discharge it gradually down the

stream.

     The example of our French neighbours in the more general use they make of

--moveable weirs barrayes of various constructions could, I am satisfied, be

followed by us with very great advantage in many cases.
     The question of water power is one which I think deserves more consideration

than it has lately received. It has been the fashion to consider that small water-
mills are of little or no value, and, in the present state of most rivers and streams,
this is to a very prreat extent true, but only because the supply of water to work
them is so variable and uncertain. Sufficient attention has never yet been given to

the subject of the amount of compensation water which should be given for the use
of riparian proprietors when the watershed areas are dealt with for purposes of
water supply. There is a kind of empirical rule acknowledged by most of the
eminent water engineers, that one-third of the average flow of three consecutive
dry years is a fair equivalent for the abstraction of the water falling on a gathering

ground. I am strongly of opinion that, looking to imperial interests, advantage

should be taken of every opportunity of dealing with a gathering ground to provide

for a much larger proportion of its available water being sent down the streams, so
that the natural water power of the country may be properly developed. The extra

cost of the necessary works must, as a matter of course, be borne rateably by the

interests benefited. It is certain that with the progress of invention many more
ways of utilising this power will be discovered. At present, through the medium

of compressed air, of hydraulic pressure, and of electro-motors, the great disadvantage
of its being only available at the spot where the water runs is overcome, and the

power can be transmitted to any distance, and used wherever it may be most con-

veniently applied.

     Sir Robert Kane, in his most valuable and exhaustive work on the ' Industrial
Resources of Ireland,' has given an estimate of the value of the power allowed to
escape every year in the shape of floods, and the same calculation might be applied
to the sister kingdom. It is probably no exaggeration to say that where run-
ning streams exist the power required for estate piirposes, on the majority of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  685

properties in the United Kingdom, might be obtained by a proper conservation of

the natural water resources of those streams.

     The consideration I have been able to give to this subject has helped to convince
me that, although a vast amount of labour and research has been devoted to it, it,
is nevertheless one in which " a more systematic direction to scientific inquiry " is

urgently needed.

   A vast collection of scientific facts exists, but they require arrangement and

collation, and future observations should be more strictly classified, so that the

bearing of each one, both on the others and on the subject at large, may be properly

appreciated with a view to a practical result.

    In France this is being done to a very large extent, and an excellent Map
showing the phenomena of the rivers and streams of that country is now in course
of preparation. For many years also very accurate observations of the phenomena of

the whole of the basin of the Seine have been taken, and have been centralised

(centralisees) by that eminent engineer, whose loss all who bad the privilege of
knowing him either in his work or in private intercourse are deploring, M. Belgrand,

late Inspector-General of the Ponts et Chaussees, and by his able coadjutor,
M. M. G. Lemoine. These observations have been published in the form of
diagrams, admirable in their simplicity of design, which show at a glance the
bearing of every one of those phenomena on the general character of that river.

     In Italy also, where there exists a distinct department having control of the
hydraulic works of that country, the same exhaustive system of collation and record
has been followed, and the results have been published in a series of tables. In
Germany, although the same complete system is not in vogue, its chief river has
been the subject of most thorough investigation, the results of which have been
published in a beautiful map of the Rhine and its regulating works.

     In our own country, as might be expected from the number of engineering
works which have been executed, there probably exists an amount of detailed

information on special and often minute points which is unsurpassed, and probably

unequalled in the world.

     But, although as I have said before, a great number of eminent men have treated
in an exhaustive manner the phenomena relating to many of the principal rivers of
Great Britain and Ireland yet, as far as I am aware, there has been no attempt

                                                                                                                                 ;

to collect and combine these most valuable, though detached fragments of know-
ledge, so that their relation to one another might be seen, and a general conclusion
arrived at. This can only be done by the establishment of a public department
analogous to those described as already existing in France and Italy.

     I do not wish it to be understood that in suggesting the collection of additional

data relating to the phenomena of rivers, I am advocating delay in dealing with the
existing state of things until the facts have all been ascertained. On the contrary, I
believe thatthe first step oughttobe the establishment of adistinct Water Department,

which should at once address itself to the remedying of the evils which are found
to be most pressing. The time has long since arrived when the present neglected
state of many of our most important streams should be dealt with, and that this was
also the conviction of Parliament and of the Government is evident, from the
appointment of so influential a Committee as that presided over by the Duke of
Richmond last session.

     Even the imperfect sketch which I have been able to place before you
will have made manifest, I think, the enormous importance of the subject

--and of the interests involved interests subject to periodical losses arising

--from the present imperfect organisation, or, I may say, the present entire

want of organisation ; losses which are not only monetary, and therefore to
a certain extent capable of being estimated, but which affect health and
imperil life, and on that account, as is the unhappy experience of the highest
as well as the lowest of the community, utterly incapable of appreciation. How,
for instance, can we estimate the loss sustained by the country at large by the
premature death of that noble-minded and accomplished gentleman, the Prince
Consort, whose life and energies were devoted to the encouragement of all the
objects which this Association is established to foster and promote, and who showed
 686 report-- 1878.

 his strong sense of its usefulness by presiding at one of its most brilliant

 meetings.

     When it is considered that many lives are annually sacrificed, either directly by the

--action of floods, or by the indirect but no less fatal influence of imperfect drainage,
    when it is remembered that a heavy flood, such as that of last year, or that of the

--summer of ] 875, entailed a monetary loss of several millions sterling in the three

 kingdoms, that during every year a quantity of water flows to waste, representing
 an available motive power worth certainly not less than some hundreds of thousands

--of pounds, that there is a constant annual expenditure of enormous amount for
--removing debris from navigable channels, the accumulation of which could be

 mainly, if not entirely prevented, that the supply of food to our rapidly growing
 population, dependent, as it is at present, upon sources outside the country, would

--be enormously increased by an adequate protection of the fisheries, that the same
--supply would be further greatly increased by the extra production of the land when

 increased facilities for drainage are afforded, that, above all, the problem of our
national water supply, to which public attention has of late been drawn by
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, requires for its solution investigations of the widest
 possible nature, I believe it will be allowed that the question, as a whole, of the
management of rivers is of sufficient importance to make it worthy of being dealt

with by new laws to be framed in its exclusive behalf.

   A --new department should be created one not only endowed with powers

analogous to those of the Local Government Board, but charged with the duty of
collecting and digesting for use all the facts and knowledge necessary for a due
comprehension and satisfactory dealing with every river-basin, or watershed area

--in the United Kingdom a department which should be presided over, if not by a

Cabinet Minister, at all events by a member of the Government who can be appealed

to in Parliament.

      The department should have entire charge of, and control over, all estuaries and
navigable channels, both because these are used by foreign vessels, and therefore
the responsibilities attaching to their preservation are international, and because
they must be protected from hostile attack, and on these accounts are essentially
Imperial property. For the same reason the cost of amending and maintaining
them should be defrayed out of the Imperial exchequer.

     As regards the regulation of the remainder of the watershed area, the con-
clusions arrived at in the Report of the Duke of Richmond's Select Committee

--seem to me entirely satisfactory. I cannot do better than give a few extracts from

that Report. The Committee say " That in order to secure uniformity and com-
pleteness of action, each catchment area should, as a general rule, be placed under
a single body of Conservators, who should be responsible for maintaining the river
from its source to its outfall in an efficient state. With regard, however, to
tributary streams, the care of these might be entrusted to District Committees,

acting under the general direction of the Conservators, but near the point of
junction with the principal stream they should be under the direct management of

the Conservators of the main channel, who should be a representative body con-

stituted of residents and owners of property within the whole area of the water-
shed." The Committee go on to say that " means should be taken to ensure the
appointment of a Conservancy Board for each watershed area," but that applica-
tion should first be made by persons interested in the district, and that then the

departmental authorities should send inspectors to make local inquiries and to re-
port upon the " necessities a»d capacities of the district, and suggest the area and

proportions of taxation."

    The scheme with such modifications as may be deemed necessary is then to be

embodied in a provisional order to be submitted to Parliament for confirmation.
It will be seen that this mode of procedure is precisely analogous to that of the
Local Government Board in relation to public health-- a procedure which, as I

am able to state from practical knowledge, works admirably in most cases. The

Committee further recommend that the provisions in any local or other Acts which
would interfere with the proposed scheme, should be repealed. They are also of
opinion that " the Conservancy Boards should be enabled to execute the powers
                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                                 687

conferred on local authorities by the Rivers Pollution and Prevention Act." It

will also he necessary that their powers should extend to the carrying out of any

Acts passed or to be passed for the protection of the fisheries.

     With regard to what is probably the most important point of all, the finding

of the money necessary to carry out these recommendations, the Committee advo-
cate the introduction of a new principle of taxation, the soundness of which cannot

·be questioned. Instead of the principle first introduced by the statute of Henrv the

Eighth, and observed ever since, of levying taxes in proportion to the direct benefit

conferred, the Committee propose that the rates should be distributed over the whole

area of a watershed, including not only the lands, but the towns and houses and

all other property situate within that area. This is in fact no more than a general

application of the law of highways, which in the time of the Eomans, according

to Justinian, applied equally to waterways. It is perfectly just that every acre,

the drainage of which contributes to the flow of the streams and rivers of every

watershed area, should, in some proportion or other, contribute also to the cost of

maintaining the channels of those streams and rivers in an efficient state. The

incidence of the taxation must of course, as has been pointed out, be determined

by the circumstances of each particular case, but there is no doubt that the con-

clusion of the Duke of Richmond's Committee, that " the taxation should be levied

on the basis of rateable value," is the only sound, and at the same time practical,

way of dealing with this difficulty.

     The word " taxation " is not, I fear, generally connected with any idea of profit to

the individual taxpayer. But in this case, as I hope in the course of this address
I have made clear, it is probable that the prevention of large present losses, and the

advantages gained by an improved system, will give not only a fair but an ample

return on the capital expended.

myIt is       firm belief  that an  intelligent  management                                     of  watershed  areas  would

be compatible with an absolute profit to every interest affected ; that we have here

no question of give and take, but that in this, as in every other case, the laws

of Nature, under proper and scientific regulation, can be made subservient to the

needs of the highest civilisation.

The following Papers were read :

              1. On River Control. By J. Clarke Hawkshaw.

The author, after alluding to the growing importance of the question of river

control, pointed out the difficulties with which engineers have to contend when

called upon to deal with rivers piecemeal, owing to the divided jurisdiction to which

the rivers of this country are subject, and to the want of systematic observations on

them. The different j urisdictions to which the river Witham is subject were given as
an example. He then endeavoured to show that the works required for the purpose

of land_ drainage, navigation, and water supply were so connected that they should

be carried out under one authority. In conclusion, he advocated the appointment

of a commission for each river basin, with powers to carry out works, and to rate

all the land  in  the  drainage  area for  that  purpose                                        the rate  to be an  equal rate
                                                                                             ;

levied on all the land, whether covered by buildings or not, according to its annual

value, with the exception of lands liable to floods, which should be rated at a higher

rate until the works for prevention of the floods were carried out.

 2. On the Effect of River or Arterial Drainage Works upon River Floods.
                         By James Dillon, Mem. Inst. C.E.I.

     In this paper the author pointed out the large amount of damage done to pro-
perties in different countries by river floods overflowing their banks, such as the
Thames, Shannon, and other large rivers, and although much had been done
throughout the country to prevent flooding, still much remained to be done. It
was shown that year by year the applications for loans of money to carry out river
688 report--1878.

 or arterial drainage works in Ireland were becoming fewer in number, until last

year there was only one application received by the Commissioners of Public
 Works, although previous to 1863 the Drainage Commission (Ireland) relieved
266,736 statute acres from floods at a cost of £2,390,612 under the Act 5 and 6
Vict., and since 1863 down to July 1878 over 71,000 statute acres were drained by a
further expenditure of £389,000 by Drainage Boards formed under the Act 26 and
27 Vict., c. 88 ; the total number of drainage districts amounting to 157, of which

37 were carried out under the last-named Act.
     The author stated that it frequently happened that when a number of lowland

proprietors promoted a scheme for the improvement of their larger, and consequently
more costly sections, they generally tried to tax the upland proprietors for some of
the additional outlay, and the latter then resist the attempt ; while if the upland
proprietors try to improve their smaller and less costly rivers, they are opposed by

the lowland proprietors, who contend that such works, by the drainage of the up-
lands, would increase their lowland floods. This kind of opposition renders it very

difficult to obtain assent to the execution of works from the owners of two-thirds

of the injured land.

     The author stated bis belief that such objections should not be allowed to have
weight, because, from experiments made by him on flood discharges before and

after the execution of extensive river or arterial drainage works, he found that such
works had not the effect of increasing the river floods either above or below the

termination of the works. The reasons given for this result are as follows.
     It has been proved that the area of land actually covered by flood water (with

scarcely an exception) seldom exceeds seven per cent, of the entire catchment-
basin, or area of land unwatered by rivers, and in 120 districts completed by the Irish
Drainage Commissioners the flooded land did not amount to seven per cent, of the
total area of the catchment-basins, and that thi3 seven per cent, of flooded land was
generally to be found along the river banks or shores of lakes affected by the rivers.

     It also happens that this three, four, or seven per cent., as the case may be, is
always more or less saturated with water, particularly in winter, and that when so

saturated any additional flood waters coming on it will rise and flow over its surface.

     It is believed by many that the waters covering a river valley in flood times

are stationary. This might be so if the river valley had no fall or inclination in the
direction of its length ; but without some such fall the flood waters of former times
could not have scooped out, as it were, a river, bowever insufficient and imperfect

it may have been ; therefore it is a fact that, unless in very exceptional cases, the floods
in river valleys continue to move towards the natural outfall for each valley.

     It is also known that every flooded river valley has its fixed maximum flood
marks, beyond wbicb the floods never rise, and if, when the floods reach this level,

rain should still continue to fall, then the whole of the floods due to this additional
rain must reach the river valley, passing away as quickly as they arrive, or the

flood levels would rise in the valley.

     If, then, the whole maximum flood due to continuous rain passes from an upper

to a lower division of a district, in the natural flooded state of a district before
arterial drainage works are carried out, then it would be impossible that the deepen-

ing or enlargement of so many miles of a river could increase the floods or rainfall

either above or below the improved section of the river.
     It should be remembered that, before the execution of such works, just in pro-

portion as the rainfall ceases, so would the floods subside, were it not that towards
the termination of the rainfall they are largely increased in volume by the escape

of the flood-waters that previously overflowed the river banks.

    It may be said, if the effect of arterial drainage works is to prevent the accumu-

lation of large sheets of flood waters in a river valley, then the floods must be in-

creased by the passing away of these waters.
     This the author believes to be a mistake. For up to the present time he has ex-

pended on main and tributary river works (sanctioned by Government)of an aggregate
length of 150 miles, nearly half of the whole amount expended on such works in

Irefand since 1863. As all these works proved successful, both from a scientific and
financial point of view, he was afforded opportunities of observing the flood dis-

charges before and after the execution of such works as the Inny River "Works,
                                 TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION Q.                              689

where the flood waters were collected from 273 square miles. It has heen already

stated, that the flooded ground seldom averages seven per cent, of the catchment-

basins, and in the Inny District, above referred to, it equalled an average breadth

of 1237 feet, or seven per cent. If, then, a number of tributary rivers, with catch-

ment-basins some two miles in breadth and some eight or ten miles in length, branch

off' at nearly right angles to the main river along which this seven per cent, flooded land

exists, then if you divide these lateral catchment-basins each into 100 parts, allowing

the seven parts near the river to be flooded, it will be evident that the maximum
flood due to the maximum rainfall on the seven parts or seven per cent, at the

junction of the tributaries with the main river will have passed away into the
main river before the maximum floods from the second, third, or tenth miles,

&c., could reach the last-named junction, provided the rivers were not dammed up

with shoals, &c.

So that the time required to allow of the river valleys being covered with

water before the execution of the works would, if properly utilized, be more than

sufficient to allow of the water passing down a properly constructed river-channel
before the maximum floods could reach the main river from the second, third, or

tenth mile back from the main river.

If this holds good in narrow tributary catchment-basins, so will it be applicable

to all forms of catchment-basins, no matter what their direction with regard to the
main channel.

The author believes, then, that the effect of arterial drainage works is to enable

the floods from the fractional 4, 7 or 8 per cent, flooded lands, near the main arteries,

to pass off after the execution of the works many hours or days sooner, according to the

magnitude and length of the rainfall and district, than before the execution of the

works                            andthat, by securing a longer interval of time for the  discharge t>f a flood of
                              ;

given magnitude, arterial drainage works cannot increase the maximum flood-

discbarges of a district.

    As this view of the case is confirmed by the author's observations, he invites

discussion in order to test its accuracy.

    When once it is established that the floods in a river valley are not increased by

the enlargement or improvement of either an upper or lower section of the river

passing through the valley, the author believes that the public and the Govern-
ment would find it more practical to deal with the improvement of rivers in the

following way.

Whenever any considerable portion of a country is flooded by the overflow of

a river or its tributaries, and the parties injuriously affected are desirous of apply-

ing to Government, through the Commissioners of Public Works in England, Ire-

land, or elsewhere, for a loan to improve their land, they should be required to

furnish a section of the rivers to be improved, taking care to extend the sections

down the river whether 1 or 100 miles in length imtil a sufficient outfall is ob-

tained for the successful carrying out of the proposed works.

Should the Board of Works report in favour of the project, the Treasury could,

after the usual formality, advance the necessary funds, thus enabling useful works to
be carried out under the superintendence of Drainage Boards acquainted with the

localities with which their interests are connected, instead of losing many years in

endeavouring to embrace all the tributary districts in one large, costly, and un-

manageable scheme. By this method the works could be commenced in divisions

corresponding to the natural sub-outfalls of the country, commencing at the fall

nearest to or furthest from the sea.

    Should this method be sanctioned by Government on any large scale, now that

             _

it is proposed to grant loans for river works on a moiety of the proprietors assenting

to the project, instead of requiring two-thirds as formerly, a great impetus would be
given to the extension of such works, conferring great benefits upon the country by

increasing the value of land, and giving at the same time additional employment,
and circulating large sums of money among the working classes in agricultural

districts.

    Although the facts thus briefly set/ forth in this paper are now publicly brought
forward by the author for the first time, still in the case of the Great Barrow

River Scheme, which embraces a country of 625 square miles, he has succeeded in

overcoming hostile opposition (based upon increased flooding) to its being executed
in divisions instead of in one unmanageable whole. Of this work two divisions have

already been sanctioned by Parliament and are now nearly completed. The object

of the author in bringing forward these facts is that the practicability of dealing

with large river systems in divisions, instead of in one whole, may become more

universally known and acted upon.

3. On the Control of Rivers* By W. Shelford, M. Inst. G.E., F.G.S.

TM --The author divided the subject under two heads I. Tidal Rivers. After

showing that the importance of British rivers was due to tidal water, and that the
tidal portions of them had been subject to the care of the Government as early as
Charles II., he gave instances of the divided control which existed down to 1867
between the several departments of the Government itself.

  --He alluded to the Thatnes as a case where the controlling bodies the Thames
--Conservancy and the Metropolitan Board were now divided even as to the fact of

the existence of sewage pollution ; and he referred to Smeaton's Grand Sluice on

the Witham as an example of injury undoubtedly done a century ago, and still

felt, through the divided control exercised by the land and navigation interests.

     Passing on to the Fen rivers, he gave in considerable detail the results of an
attempt to improve the Nene on sound engineering principles, which was rendered
abortive by its failing to combine sufficiently the various interests, and drew there-

from the conclusions :
     1st. That' such works should be undertaken on a financial basis which will

secure their completion, and

     2nd. That the taxable area should be as extensive as possible.

    II. Rivers not tidal. He denied that fresh-water rivers could be compared

with tidal rivers, and instanced the difference between the floods of the Tiber and

the Thames.

He illustrated the present condition of the fresh-water portions of our rivers by

details of the Upper Nene, where the ratio of flood to dry weather flow was 430

to 1; of the Cray and Darent (tributaries of the Thames), where the flow was in

the former nearly uniform, and in the latter the ratio of flood to drought was 16 to 1,

thus showing the different treatment required in each case ; and after giving reasons

for stating that, in the absence of a comprehensive conservancy, the jealousy of

the mill-owners and other riparian proprietors had led on the Nene to a scramble

for fresh water, and on the Cray to the use of excellent water chiefly as a carrier

of refuse ; and that the Darent presented a unique example of a valley in which

the watershed had been adopted as the boundary of the rateable area, he classed

--the several functions of a stream passing through a highly civilised community
(though the order of merit varied) as  1st, water-power ;  2nd, water supply                                                                      3rd,
                                                                                                                                               ;

carriage of refuse ; 4th, navigation ; 5th, purity equal to at least the preservation

of fish, and stated that each of them was now guarded independently and without

any comprehensive plan or control. His general conclusions were :
     1st. That each river or tributary must be treated as a whole within the boundary

of its watershed.
     2nd. That all public works within the watershed should be under one undivided

control.

     3rd. That the rateable area for these purposes should be conterminous with

the watershed.

    4th. That the minimum flow of streams liable to floods should be increased by

storage.

     5th. That the separation of good from foul water, the collection and distribu-
tion of wholesome water, the discharge of sewage, the improvement of the channel
both for conserving the dry weather flow and for dispersion of floods, the main-
tenance and improvement of tidal reservoirs and navigable channels, the removal

·of shoals and the erection of piers, and the working of Acts of Parliament, must all
come within the scope of the undivided control which he advocated.

    He considered such an undertaking the more worthy of Government attention,
"because the requisite knowledge and experience would rarely be found in one man

or one hody of men, and was possessed by few even in the profession of civil

engineers, who would necessarily have to occupy the most prominent positions

and take the heaviest responsibility.

4. On Movable and Fixed Weirs, with reference to the Improvement of the
     Navigation, Mill Poiver, and Drainage of Flood Waters of Rivers,
    with especial Notice of the River Shannon* By J. Neville, C.E.,

      M.R.I.A., Dundalk.

     Most rivers in their natural state, even within tidal influence, are but a, succession
·of pools and shallows of different lengths, the conditions of each, or its regimen,
depending on the varying inclinations of the hed, its natural formation, the maxi-

mum, minimum, and average flow from the catchment-basin and tributaries at

different seasons, the scouring of the bed and banks, and the formation of shoals
or deposits. The steepest or shallowest portions, at rapids, are but the accelerated
flow over natural submerged weirs of rock or coarse gravel cemented with clay
and sand, and the pools between, long or short, or extending into lakes (those
natural regulators of flood waters), constitute the deeper stretches of the river.

Where the river alone has to be improved for a limited navigation, a sufficient
depth at the shallows is sometimes obtained by running out spur weirs, thereby
narrowing and deepening the water-way ; or, by making a part of a continuous
weir movable or removable, damming up the water at times of least flow, and
passing down the craft employed, on flushes through the open movable portions of
the weir which is again raised to retain the head. As, however, the application of

this .system of flush navigation is limited and only available for craft of suitable
build, for down-stream traffic, the necessity arises for constructing locks with some-
times lateral navigable passes, or canals, along the shallows to connect the deeper
portions of the navigable river channel above and below/ The gates of such locks,
with their sluices for working, are only movable weirs maintaining a fixed depth
above at seasons when the fl<5w is limited. In some states of the regimen I have
occasionally seen lock-gates left open for a free navigation, the head being entirely
maintained by the natural obstruction of adjacent submerged weirs at the shallows,
and by hack water from below.

      The author, after classing the sluices and gates of movable weirs into those
which lift in a plane, those which turn on a vertical axis, those which turn on a
horizontal axis, and those that act on the principle of the American bear-trap
sluice, used in 1818 on the Lehigh descending navigation, and having given diffe-
rent examples from French and Indian rivers, concluded with reference to fixed

--long weirs as follows : Mill weirs are generally fixed and solid. When the

water supply is limited and in dry seasons, a larger quantity can he stored by ex-
tending the weir basin or pond and lengthening the weir, at the same time the
head for a variable supply is better regulated for a water-engine. To pass the
same quantity of water over the crest, the head there can be reduced to one-half
by trebling the length, and reduced in the ratio of two to three by doubling it.
These advantages with reference to mills must have led to the misapplication of
long solid weirs without even a sluice on the drainage and navigation works of the
Shannon. Long solid weirs sloping or curved two or three times the width can
have no practical advantage over those of the ordinary mean width from bank to
bank, on long upper stretches of a river, without proportionately extending the
width and depth the whole way. On the Shannon the upper obstructions in the
bed between weir and weir were only partially removed, and the works remain in
every way a sad monument for the riparian proprietors of an engineering failure.

 23, 1878.

     If for. large rivers, where navigation only, without drainage, had to be con-
sidered, the necessary weirs to obtain sufficient sailing depth were made movable

down to the bed even when locks were provided, as in France and India, with far
greater reason should they have been made movable down to the bed on the Shan-
non, where the drainage of the Callows and low riparian lands was a part of the

original design.

            5. The Rainfall of Ireland. By Gr. J. Symons, F.B.S.

     The author mentioned that the Irish hills do not appear to exhaust the rain-
clouds so much as the English hills do. With the exception of a dry central area
round Dublin, the rainfall all over Ireland may be taken to be almost the same. At
present, instead of the greatest rainfall being in the south-west, or in Galway,
we had the wettest spot of all (with one exception) under the shadow of Slieve
Donard, in the south of the county Down, the very place which, theoretically,
might be expected to be almost the driest part of Ireland. That showed that
it is really more a question of the elevation of hills than of geographical position.

He exhibited a map showing the number of stations established for the observa-
tion of the rainfall, and the averages at many stations. From 1866 to 1876

there were thirty stations established, at which the rainfall was regularly re-
corded, and at those stations the fall in the ten years was not very different from

that in the five years 1872-76. It was, therefore, a fair conclusion that the

average from 1872 to 1876 was not far wrong. It might probably be wrong

 3 or 4 per cent.

     He had succeeded since the meeting of the Association in Belfast in obtaining
the services of a large number of gentlemen volunteers throughout Ireland, who

had taken charge of the rain gauges supplied to them, and had engaged to
register their observations. There were still large districts, however, in which he
had not been able to establish rain gauges, and the observations were, therefore,
necessarily defective as to the average rainfall. There was a large district in the
neighbourhood of Longford without a single station, and another in the south-
west of Cork, where it was essential that observations should be taken. If he
could induce some gentlemen having property in those neighbourhoods to take
charge of rain gauges, Ireland, instead of having to .depend upon ten stations, as

it did not many years ago, would be fairly repre3ented, both geographically and

physically.

 6. On the Hydrogeological Survey of England* By Joseph Lucas, F.G.S.

      The need of a National Hydrogeological Survey having been admitted at the
 Congress on National Water Supply at the Society of Arts, the author passes on to
 the consideration of how the information collected by the survey may be brought to
 bear so as to produce the result aimed at, viz., the improvement of the water supply

 of the country generally.

      The product of the survey is a map, on which the necessities as well as the capa-
 bilities of each river basin are made to appear. The author proposes that on the
 completion of the map of the first (and each subsequent) river basin the Government
 should invite the competition of engineers to frame comprehensive schemes of a dis-
 tributary character, based on the watershed area, and should appoint a special com-

 mission to examine and report upon such schemes. When this commission had

 rendered its report, a Central Board, consisting of members of the Local Govern-
 ment Board, assisted by members elected from the various County Boards within
 the basin, should be created for the purpose of dealing with the water supply of
 each river basin. This Board should have rating powers over the whole basin, and
 the conservancy of the rivers, and would contain the elements for dealing with cases
 in which the requirements exceed the resources of the basin, and vice versd.

1. On the Drainage of the Fenland considered in relation to the Conservancy
  of the Rivers of Great Britain* By W. H. Wheeler, M. Inst. G.E.

The contention of the writer of this paper is that in the Fenland is to be found

the type on which the future administration for the conservancy of the rivers of

this country should he                                                        founded                                    that as in this large  tract of land  on  the   east

management of four important rivers have been on their trial for long periods

that as by private enterprise alone immense sums of money have been sunk with

a result that has placed this district in the very first rank as yielding corn, cattle,

and agricultural produce of all kinds, so here our legislators may turn in order to

learn what to copy and what to avoid ; that the meeting of the British Associa-

tion affords a fitting opportunity for bringing together the results of local expe-

rience and placing them before those interested in the subject with a fulness and

freedom of expression which no Parliamentary inquiry can bring forth.
     The great lesson the " History of Fenland Drainage " teaches is, that no scheme

·of improvement can be effectual unless the rivers are dealt with as a whole, and

placed under one governing body from their source to their outfall ; that the organi-

sation of the administration for this purpose can only be effected by imperial legisla-

tion, and must not be of a voluntary nature. The whole government of the Fen-
land drainage is made up of piecemeal legislation ; and although the administration

of the several districts is thoroughly efficient, and the aggregate result superb, yet

as each has sought only its own interest, all, more or less, are suffering from the
defective condition of the common outfalls, large areas above the Fens being left

without protection, and year by year subject to greater Hooding. Had each "river

been originally treated as a whole from the source to the outfall, better results

would have been secured, thousands of pounds have been saved, and much future

legislation and outlay avoided.

The subject is treated in the paper under the three heads of Engineering,

Administration, and Finance.

Under the first head it is sought to be shown that the object of all future legis-

lation should not be drainage only, but the regulation of the water supply. The

circumstances of our rivers having been altered by the modern system of drainage,
at becomes necessary to adapt their channels to carry a vastly increased quantity of
flood water at uncertain and distant intervals, and during the- intervening period

to discharge the diminished regular supply in such a way that the channel may
not become choked by weeds and shoals, yet be made available for storing a supply

of water in lieu of that which formerly percolated slowly through the soil. To

effect this, a modification of the plan of wash-lands adopted by the old Fen en-

gineers  is suggested                                                         the river proper being adapted                               for the   ordinary summer    and

winter flow, the flood-banks to be set back sufficiently distant from the channel to

leave a cess or margin to receive the flow of the greatest floods. The space

thus left between the ordinary channel and the banks being only covered by water

occasionally, would, like the wash-lands, afford valuable pasturage. The rapid
voidance of the rainfall by the modern system of drainage leaving a diminished

quantity to feed springs and afford a supply to brooks and watercourses, droughts
have become more frequent. Fen experience here again suggests the remedy. In
all the main watercourses and large arterial drains means are provided for holding
up the water during the summer and periods of drought, and the streams thus
become both carriers and reservoirs. The level of the water throughout the
whole of the divisional ditches in the Fenland, and consequently of the soil itself,
is always maintained at a fixed level, the loss by evaporation, &c, being supplied
from the highland streams. Moisture is thus always within reach of the roots of
the plants, even in the greatest droughts, and lands which would otherwise only

be regarded as medium soils yield large and abundant crops. The writer is of

opinion that the use of water in the cultivation of soil, and its value for purposes
of irrigation is not sufficiently esteemed, and thinks that mills have received a
great deal of undeserved blame for holding up the water, the effect of which is of

the greatest benefit to the surrounding soil, when subject to proper regulations
as to floods. The objection on sanitary grounds to the storage of stagnant water
in the watercourses of the country is met by referring to the result in the Fens, the
health and physique of the inhabitants of which compares favourably with every
other part of the kingdom. By the erection of flood-gates, or properly constructed
weirs across the rivers, a constant supply would be maintained to compensate for

the excess carried oft' in floods, and to provide water for domestic, agricultural,,
and economic purposes. The value of water as a motive power in farm work is

also contended for, and the saving of human labour and coals by this means

pointed out.

     To carry out the necessary improvements for regulating the channels of the
rivers, and their future conservancy, a plan of administration adopted in certain
Fen districts is proposed. Each watershed of a main river to be subject to one
Conservancy Board, the whole watershed being divided into districts, the area
of which is to be determined by the watersheds of tributary streams or other phy-

sical causes ; the sub-districts to be placed under the jurisdiction of commissioners

elected by the occupiers of the land in proportion to their rateable value, and who

shall have the charge of all local interests ; the general Conservancy Board to be
elected from amongst the members of the District Boards, each sending one or
more according to tbe area they represent, and to have control only over the main
stream from its source to its outfall, and of all banks, sluices, and other works affecting

it. Where districts are already in existence they would continue to exercise their

rights and powers, except so far as they interfered with the main stream, and have

their representative on the General Board. By this means the due care of local

wants and interests, and unity of action throughout would be secured, and exist-
ing interests conserved so far as would be compatible with the general good.

     The means for carrying out improvements required, and for future administra-
tion and maintenance, in the writer's opinion, shoidd be provided by a tax on the
rateable value of the whole area of land within the watershed, whether rural or
urban. As every acre of land receives and contributes its quota of the rain-fall,

so it shoidd fairly provide its share of the cost of maintaining the channels for

carrying this off. The objection that high lands can never be injured, and are so
far away from the flooded districts that they do not require any improvement of
the river, is met by the answer, that it is owing to the drainage carried out on
these very lands that water is now poured so rapidly into the rivers as to cause the
floods, and they ought, therefore, fairly to contribute towards the remedy for the

--evil they have caused. As to their distance from the outfall the greater the dis-

tance, the greater use they make of the river, the water from the under drains of
high iands at the head of a river having, perhaps, to travel a hundred times the
length along its channel as compared to land within the area suffering from the
floods. The objection that these lands have a prescriptive right to drain, and that
to impose a new tax upon them would be an unjust burden, is met by the reply
that the altered circumstances of the country necessitate fresh burdens, and the
rates for police, education, and sanitary purposes are adduced as instances of novel
burdens brought about by higher civilisation. Towns, it is contended, should bear-
also their share of taxation. Thorough drainage is a first essential for health, and
this cannot be effected without a good outfall. By sewering the streets and bring-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  695

ing a water supply from distant parts, towns have materially altered the normal
condition of the discharge of the rainfall off the area they occupy, and during
heavy rains send a large body of water into an already overcharged stream, and
thus in a great measure contribute towards the flooding, while the withdrawal of
the water necessary for the town takes away the supply from the springs which

feed the upper part of the rivers.

2ifin the Discharge of Sewage in Tidal Rivers* By Henry Law, M. Inst. C.E.

   A tidal river may be looked upon as a reservoir of a very elongated form, sub-

ject to the following conditions, namely :
     1st. That it is supplied with water of three different qualities from three dif-

ferent sources, that is to say

     The water constantly draining off the surface of the basin forming the water-
shed of the river, and that derived from the land springs which find vent in its bed
this we will designate river water.

     The water entering the mouth of the river from the sea under tidal influence,
which we will distinguish as sea water.

     The polluted water discharged from the sewers, which we will term sewage.

     2nd. That the actual and relative quantities of these are not constant, but vary

within certain limits.
      3rd. That the supply of sea water is not constant, but intermittent, being poured

into the reservoir for a certain number of hours ; and then for a certain period the

reservoir being allowed to discharge a proportion of its contents.

    Now the subject of our inquiry is, what, under the conditions assumed above,

will be the mean or average composition of the water contained in the reservoir or

river ?
      In order to obtain a practical result, let us investigate this question, adopting

the mean values for the several quantities which apply in the case of the river

Thames.
     First, then, as to the extent and capacity of the reservoir. The tidal portion of

the river Thames extends from Yantlet Creek to Teddington Lock, a total distance
of about 60^ miles ; its breadth varies from about 200 feet to 22,800 feet, or about
4^ miles, at its mouth ; its superficial area at high water is 720,594,410 square
feet, or nearly 26 square miles.

   -- --The mean range of the tide at the mouth that is, at Yantlet Creek is 14 feet,

at London Bridge 17 feet 4 inches, and at Teddington Lock 3 feet.
     The mean tidal capacity of the river, that is to say, the difference in the

quantity of the water which is contained by the river at high water and at low
water, with the above-stated mean range of tide, is 14,179,538,300 cubic feet.

     Now, as has been already stated, this body of water is derived from three sources

namely, the sea, the land drainage, and the sewage ; and it is necessary in the next
place to ascertain the relative quantities furnished from each of these sources.

     The downward flow of the Thames, or, in other words, the mean daily dis-
charge from the drainage of the Thames Valley, may be estimated at 1,923,626,000
gallons, a quantity which, we may incidentally remark, is about one-third of the

 rainfall.

     From the above, however, must be deducted 100,000,000 gallons which is daily
abstracted from the river above Teddington Weir for the supply of water to the

 metropolis ; leaving a total quantity of 1,823,626,000 gallons, or 291,780,160 cubic

feet, for the mean daily discharge, being 145,890,080 cubic feet as the mean quan-

tity of river water contributed each tide.

      The mean quantity of the sewage discharged into the Thames from the two
outfalls at Barking and Crossness maybe taken at 120,000,000 gallons daily, equiva-
lent to 9,600,000 cubic feet every tide, making with the river water a total of
 155,490,080 cubic feet, which being deducted from the mean quantity already

      * This paper was published in extenso in ' Engineering,' for August 30, and in
the ' Journal of Gas Lighting,' for September 3, 1878.
696 report-- 1878.

stated as that which enters the river every tide, we have 14,024,048,220 cubic feet
as the mean quantity of sea water which enters the Thames every tide.

It is difficult to form a true idea of the relative values of such large numbers,

and therefore it is better to reduce them to a percentage, when we obtain the result,

that the mean composition of the Thames water is as follows, namely :

Sea water           98-91

River water         102

Sewage water        -07

                                                                                        10000
     That is to say, the actual mean quantity of sewage in the tidal portion of the
river Thames, extending from Teddington to Yantlet Creek, is only -07 per cent.,
or otherwise expressed, only one 1477th part of its whole bulk.
     Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that, owing to the circumstance of the

river water always being delivered at the upper end of the elongated reservoir, no
less than 60 miles in length, while the ultimate discharge is wholly from the lower

extremity, the composition of the water varies greatly, being always much freer

from sea water and sewage in the upper portion than the lower. In point of fact,
it must be evident that, in the case of a stream which has a certain quantity of

river water, that is, as we have already defined it, water derived from the rainfall

and discharged into the river by surface drainage and land springs, there must
always be a point, even in the tidal portion, above which no contamination can
exist from sea water or other matters which enter the river near the lower portion

of its course.

     The foregoing is a statement of the average result ; the actual amount of con-
tamination by sewage at any given time and place must depend upon the recent past
rainfall, and upon the state and condition of the tides, but at no time, and under
no circumstances, can the amount of the sewage contained in the Thames water be
raised sufficiently above its average value of one 1477th part to produce any ap-
preciable pollution, far less to afford any ground for the statements to which pre-
vious allusion has been made.

     This bridge carries a short branch of the Midland Great Western Railway of

Ireland across the Royal Canal immediately below Newcomen Bridge, at the very

oblique angle of 25 degrees and, though the canal is only 15 feet wide, the-

bridge carrying the railway requires to be nearly 40 feet long on the skew.

The trains run over this bridge at about two feet over ordinary water level, and

whenever a boat is passing along the canal the bridge is lifted from 8 to 1&

feet, according to the height of the deck load, so as to permit the boat to pass
                                                                                                                        _

beneath. The bridge is formed of two strong single-plate girders of the usual type,

which lie underneath the rails, with cross girders and side brackets over which the

platform is laid. This bridge is lifted by means of a lever 40 feet long, formed of two-

plate girders braced together horizontally, and attached rigidly at right angles to the

centre of the bridge, and this lever is itself balanced at its centre on blunt steel

knife edges like the beam of a pair of scales. The weight of the bridge at one end

of the lever is counterpoised by an equal weight of metal attached to the other end,

so that the whole structure turns freely on the knife edges, which work in steel

pillow blocks on the top of metal standards, one on either side of the lever. The

opening and closing motions are regulated by a small crab-winch and chain worked

by hand                                    the ends of this chain are  attached  to the lever  at  several feet on either
                                        ;

side of the knife edges, and its centre is wound on or off from the barrel of the
winch, which is itself bolted down to a mass of concrete extending beneath the-

metal standards.

The man in charge works this arrangement with the greatest ease, and it is so-

regulated that the bridge is opened or closed in about one minute. It might be

moved much faster than this, as the friction is reduced to a mere trifle by the knife

edges, but it is not convenient to put so large a mass in rapid motion when there is

nothing to be gained by so doing. It was essential that the bridge should be

erected speedily and so as to interrupt the traffic as little as possible, and the first

engine passed over it in about twelve weeks after the contractors, Messrs. Courtney,

Stephens and Bailey, of Dublin, got instructions to proceed with the work and the

traffic was interrupted for only about one week during erection. The lever sloping

upwards has a somewhat singular appearance when the bridge is in position for

trains to pass over and, on the other hand, the bridge itself has a singular effect

--when it is tilted up into the air for canal boats to pass beneath ; but the author has

successfully obtained what he aimed at namely, simplicity of design, strength,

ease of working, little aptitude to go out of order and last, but not least, very

moderate cost.

4. The River Shannon : its present State, and the Means of Improving the
                 Navigation and the Drainage. By James Lynam.

    The flood drainage of the River Shannon district has been sought for and ex-
pected during the last fifty-seven years. On April 5, 1821, the first Mr. Rennie
wrote the following letter to his assistant, John Grantham :

                                                                                    " London, April 5, 1821.

--"Sir, His Excellency the Loid Lieutenant of Ireland having through the

Right Honourable Charles Grant directed me in his letter of November 8 last to

get a survey made of the River Shannon, as to its levels between Killaloe and

Roosky, with a view to lower its surface, in order that the water from the bogs

lying on each side of it may be more effectually got off, I request, in the name of the

Irish Government, that you will set out for that place to ascertain the practicability

of carrying the above wish into execution.

                                            " I am, Sir, &c,

                                                              " John Rennee.

" To John Grantham, Esq."

      Since 1821 three select committees of Parliament have sat inquiring into the
Shannon improvement projects. Three Acts of Parliament have been passed for it.
Ten engineers have been employed by the Government to plan for it ; £11,000 were

formerly paid for plans and reports; £557,016 were expended on works, &c, in it ;
£22,000 have been expended in maintaining it ; £10,000 have been recently spent

in inquiries about the results.
--700 report 1878.

The results are : The floods do not now rise so high, nor cover so much land, nor

last so long, as they formerly did ; but all the good land that was formerly flooded

is still flooded. The difference between the former high floods and the recent,

covered generally poor margins, or gravelly and shrubby beaches.

     Twenty-four thousand acres of low lands are still damaged by floods. The out-

Alets of seventeen rivers are obstructed. Several public roads are flooded. swamp

150 miles long is maintained. Many dwelling houses are flooded. On one occasion

I counted thirteen of those flooded houses. I went into some of them. The water

was a foot deep on the floors. They had the fireplaces raised over the water. They

had stools and chairs as steps from the fire to the beds ; they slept in their beds with
6 in. to 18 in. of water under them on the floor.

I was able to measure accurately the greatest height the flood had been by the

marks it had left on legs of the tables.

    Near Athlone the people abandon their houses when the floods rise high, and go

into lodgings in the town. When the flood falls they go back and clean out the

houses ; but it sometimes happens that another flood comes and drives them out

again. These great floods never occur in spring, summer, or autumn, but in

December, January, or February. During spring the low lands, when not flooded,

are saturated to a very injurious extent.

Near Oarrick it often happens that the water is low and the lands dry in March.

The farmers then put down crops in the low lands, and in April a flood may come, a

small flood which rises merely to the level of the land surface for ten or twelve days,

Abut it rots the seed.  small amount of sluice in the weir would prevent this.

These are the sad results of the expenditure of more than half a million pounds

Howunder Government control.  is this great evil to be remedied, and at what cost ?

This is what I am going to explain. During eighteen years, since 1860,1 have been

studying the subject, surveying, sounding, calculating, and writing to promote the

much-needed improvement. May I hope it is now to be really forwarded ?

    The Shannon Commissioners reported to the Lords Commissioners of Her
Majesty's Treasury, in 1850, that " It is probable that at some future period it may

become necessary to make additional excavations at some comparatively confined

channels of the Shannon at and below Shannon Bridge, and immediately above the

weir at Meelick." These are all the works the Shannon Commissioners who knew

the river so very well considered necessary to make a completely effective flood drain-

age of the Shannon district. They then reported, " Fortunately such works, though

probably indispensable, will not be very expensive." (Eleventh Report, pages 8 and

9, March, 1850.)

   A very eminent engineer employed by the Government in 1862 to 1867 made a

minute engineering survey of the whole river and reported. His estimate for works

is £290,000 to improve 24,000 acres, being £12 an acre English. This was for

seven divisions or levels of the river. Subsequently an Act of Parliament was passed

for works to drain 17,500 acres in three and a half out of the seven divisions, at a

cost of £300,000, being £17 an acre English. At this rate the regulating of the

whole river would cost £435,000 now, in addition to the £557,000 before, making

£992,000. To many minds it must occur that this large estimate is probably founded

on mistaken views of the requirements of the case.

    The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, by their minute dated May

21, 1866, appointed me the tenth engineer to make an engineering survey of the

Shannon, and to design and estimate for all works " necessary for securing the low

lands from summer and autumn floods, and from ordinary winter floods." I did so,

and the Parliamentary paper I hold in my hand is my report dated April, 1867, and
printed by order of the House of Commons, May 15, 1867. My estimate is £144,000

for 24,000 acres, or £6 per acre.

   My object in coming before you is to prove that this smaller estimate is much

nearer the truth than any of the others. I will not trouble you with any mathe-

mymatical or engineering calculation. I will accomplish  object by describing and

explaining the facts and circumstances of the river.

The Erne and Shannon rivers have three features which render it peculiarly easy

to regulate their floods and prevent the inundations. First, they have large super-

ficial areas of lakes ; second, their channels between the lakes are wide and deep
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                                701

eo capacious as to carry their floods with an inclination of less than an inch a mile
third, their floods rise slowly, 4 in. to 8 in. in twenty-four hours, very rarely a foot
in twenty-four hours. The Shannon has a fourth feature very valuable. All the
mill weirs and fish weirs have been purchased and removed, and all the shoals have
been deepened at a cost of £557,050 7s. 6^d. (See Eleventh Report of Commissioners,
dated March, 1851.) Its rain basin contains 87,000 acres of lakes.

     In the length from Battle Bridge, above Carrick-on-Shannon, to Killaloe Bridge
of 118 miles,

The lakes occupy                                                                            Miles.

           ,, broad, deep channels extend for             ..                                 50f
                                                                                     . 61
           ,, confined portions of the channel occupy merely                         5.

The portions of the channel so confined as to be visibly obstructions are but two,

each half a mile long. Neither mill weir nor fish weir stands in the way of the cur-

rent. The floods scarcely ever rise a foot in twenty-four hours. The great floods

are but 3^ ft. where deepest on the land, and generally but 2 feet deep, and merely

18 inches deep over large areas. It is clearly the most easily regulated river in the

world. Surely less than £400,000 might do it.

The Shannon river is accurately shown in plan on the Ordnance 1-inch map. It

rises in a rather desolate valley in the Leitrim Mountains, in latitude 54 deg 14 min.

3 sec, and longitude 7 deg. 55 min. 7 sec. Its source is a circular basin locally

called the " Shannon Pot," 55 feet in diameter, and about 20 feet deep. The water

is a fine clear bluish colour. "When I saw it, in 1875, its surface was 5 feet under

the land, and the stream from it was but 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep. In wet

weather it rises over the surface of the land, its centre appears to be higher than its

circumference, and an immense quantity of water issues from it and rushes down

11£ miles to enter Lougb Allen, which is seven miles long.

From Lough Allen to the tide of the Atlantic Ocean at Limerick, a length of

140 miles by the sinuosities of the river, the Shannon has been made navigable with

a depth of 6 feet of water. It lies naturally in eight separate levels ; but the lowest
at Limerick is very small and detached from the others by a length of five miles and

a fall of 90 feet. The upper level at the outlet from Lough Allen has a fall of 20

feet in six miles, and affords no matter for discussion here. Therefore, we will con-

sider only the six levels from Carrick-on-Shannon down to Castle Connel.

The lowest of these levels between Castle Connel and Killaloe is but small, con-

taining only 641 acres of low land, liable to be flooded in summer or autumn, and

rarely covered with more than from 1 foot to 1| foot of water. In twenty years

they were  flooded as follows :  In  the month of August  once ;                in   September once                                                               in
                                                                                                                                                               ;

October five times. The owners have not asked for any improvement of the Shannon

river, they have never joined any of the deputations, signed petitions, nor subscribed

money. Would it not be very wise to leave them out of consideration ? The works

proposed for the upper divisions will do them  some  good                       let  them  have it.  The
                                                                             ;

exempting of this division from a general measure of improvement will appear the

more judicious when I tell you that the Government estimate for freeing the 641
acres of meadow from being flooded is £37,200, being at the rate of nearly £60 an

English, or £100 an Irish aore. This would reduce the Government estimate from

£300,000 to £263,000 for 16,700 acres, and reduces the cost on the lesser area from

£17 an acre to 15 guineas.

  --The Shannon floods may be well studied in three classes namely, small floods,

great autumn floods, and great winter floods.

The small floods have occurred every year and in every month. They have kept

the land saturated and cold during March, April, and May, which has prevented the

growth of good grass, and promoted the growth of sedge and weeds. This herbage

grows only late in the season, and is late coming to maturity. The mowing of the

crop is thrown back into the rainy season, and the saving of it is laborious and ex-

pensive and often impossible. In the Shannon large flat meadows there are three

qualities of hay, viz. sedge mixed with tall soft weeds, varieties of carex, lets at £2

to £3 an acre Irish ; second, brown bent grass with some natural rye-grass, and great
quantities of meadow sweet, lets at £4 to £5 an Irish acre ; third, Timothy grass,
--702 eeport 1878.

phleurn nodosum, excellent hay for hunting horses, and lets for £6 to £8 an acre. I
 have dug up and examined the soils of the three qualities of meadow, and failed to
discover any difference. The difference in the values of the meadows results from a
difference of the levels of the lands. The Timothy grass (such good horse hay)
meadow lands are 9 inches to 15 inches higher than the others, and are consequently
above water a month earlier in spring, when they shine forth beautiful bright green
 islands. The sedgy, weedy meadows are the lowest by some inches, and are satu-
rated longer tban the others. The kindness of the soil of these is evinced in many
places by the following interesting fact : on examining the surfaces closely numerous
 plants of clovers and some fine species of grass are to be seen, healthy, but small and
distant. Of course if these lands were freed from saturation during spring, summer,
 and autumn, the clover and fine species of grass would flourish and extend in a
material degree, and in a few years these meadows would become much increased

 in value.

      The aggregate amount of injury to the crops from small floods in thirty years far
 exceeds the amount of damages that have actually occurred from the one great

 autumn flood that has occurred in that period.
      The quantity of water flowing off in the river at Killaloe from a rain basin of

 4,000 square miles, 2,560,000 acres, in all those small floods is under 300,000 cubic

 feet per minute. The present river channel is fully broad and deep enough to carry
 off that quantity and more at a moderate velocity. The only obstructions are the
 weir mounds. While all the low land for 120 miles lies scarcely flooded, but
 steeped in water, the weir "mounds, with a fall of several feet at each, but without
 any sluice or flood-gate, act as permanent artificial barriers to the flow of the river.
 Fifty lineal feet of open sluice in each weir would relieve all the low land in the

--Shannon valley from saturation.
      The Great Autumn Floods. One great autumn flood has occurred in the Shan-

 non during the last thirty years. It destroyed the whole of the crops on 16,300 acres,
 and injured 3,000 acres more. It began to go out on the ground at Portumna on
 August 13, 1861, and rose 1 foot 3 inches in five days. It remained at that height
 for five days more, when it began to fall. The very lowest lots of land were covered

 with water 1 foot 9 inches deep. The large areas of meadow were covered merely
 1 foot 6 inches deep. The flood began to fall on August 24, and continued to fall at
 the average rate of an inch a day till September 9, then there was no water on the

 meadows, and so it remained till September 23, fifteen days; but the water in the
 river and the drains was even with the surface of the land. In working at the hay,

 men's feet sank into the ground. The muddy water rose after them. The hay lay

 there under the owners' eyes rotting, scarcely covered, but wholly saturated, for
 fourteen days. There was during all that time a fall of 3 feet over the Killaloe

--' weir mound.
     It is important to note well here two things how slowly the flood rose on the

 land, merely 22 inches in six days, or 3§ inches average in twenty-four hours;
 second, what a small depth of flood water there was on the land, viz., 19 inches
 depth of water for five days, 13 inches depth for ten days, 10 inches depth of water
 for twelve days. Saturation merely then for fifteen days more up till September 24,
 yet it rotted the whole crop ; but it must be easy to prevent such small inundation.

       Another very important fact to note ; there is no obstruction whatever in the
 Shannon at or near Portumna to prevent the free flow of its flood waters into Lou^h
 Derg, which is a wide and deep lake of 30,000 acres, 22£ miles long. This wide
 deep water, having no appreciable fall in the surface, goes to within 800 feet of the

 great weir mound at Killaloe. This channel for 800 feet length is 470 feet wide,
 with 8 feet depth of running water, and an inclination of 1£ foot per mile down
 to the weir. Over the weir mound there is a sudden fall of the water of 2 feet

  2 inches.
       This diagram section annexed represents accurately the relative levels and incli-

 nations of that flood above, at, and below Killaloe weir. It is drawn from levels
 taken by myself there with a spirit level in August, 1861, when that flood was at

  its highest.

      There was, as measured by me in the height of that greatest of autumn floods,
 on August 21, 1861, a cataract, a clear fall of 2 feet 2 inches over the weir. The
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                  703

iriver channel thence downwards to Killaloe Bridge was more than 470 feet wide by
<>$ feet deep, with a surface inclination of 3£ feet per mile. From the bridge down-

wards there is a fall of 4 feet in one-quarter of a mile, as shown on the diagram

section.

    I ask, Was not that weir mound on that occasion a great obstruction P Evidently

it was.

     If that weir mound had not been there on that occasion, where would have been
the levels of the flood surface from its site upwards to Portumna and Meelick ? I
submit for your consideration that they would have been as I now point out on the

diagram.

     Let a line be drawn from the surface of the water just below the weir, upwards
to the broad deep water, and parallel to the surface of the flood river, as it was on

August 21. Had the weir not been there the water a few feet above the site of the

weir would have been a fraction of an inch higher than that line, and 800 feet up-
wards, which is above the head of the shoal, and in Lough Derg the surface of the
flood water would have been 6 inches above that line.

     The flood water would be running in a channel 6 feet deep instead of 8 feet deep,
and must run faster, and must have a greater inclination. The velocity in the 8 feet
deep channel was 281 feet ; in the 6 feet channel it would be 375 feet per minute.

    An increase of 6 inches in the surface fall from the broad deep water to the site

of the supposed removed weir mound would suffice to increase the velocity so as to

·carry off the same quantity of flood water in the same time with 2 feet less depth as
required. Of the 2 feet 2 inches that would be gained just above the site of the
supposed removed weir, 6 inches would be lost in generating the required greater
velocity for the shallowed channel, and 20 inches would be gained in Louo-h Derg
and by that lough the same would be gained at Portumna, that is, the flood water
would be 20 inches lower, while the meadows were covered only by 20 inches of flood

water, and that for merely five days. Therefore, if the weir mound had not been
at Killaloe in August, 1861, the low lands above it. at Portumna would not have
"been covered at all by flood water. They would have been merely saturated.

Instead of being flooded for twenty-seven days, the lands would have been merely
saturated for ten days, and thenceforward all the lands would have been quite dry
for twenty-eight days, and the crops might have been saved.

     If the Killaloe weir mound were removed and replaced by a movable regulating

weir, another important element would come into favourable action. The immense
capacity of Lough Derg as a storage reservoir, hitherto valueless, would be utilised.
The lake contains 30,000 acres = 1,306,800,000 square feet. The proper level for
steamboat navigation proposed and recommended by the Shannon Commissioners
and legalised by the Shannon Act is 2£ feet under the surface of the meadow land.

The capacity of that reservoir is 3,200 millions cubic feet. When the great rainfall

occurred on August 13, none of it was available. It had been filled up gradually
during the previous month by ordinary wet weather and small floods. It mi^ht
have been all available that time to store an immense quantity of flood water while
the rest would be flowing off gradually to the sea. The quantity of water in the
river during the previous month was under 400,000 cubic feet per minute. The
channel was fully capable of carrying off that quantity at the legal navigation level

and keeping the surface of the Shannon river and of Lough Derg down to the legal
2J feet under the surface of the low land. Had it been so, the rise of 21 inches
caused by the rainfall of August would have left that water surface, when highest
some inches under the low lands.

     Fifty wholly removable regulating weirs were constructed in (he Seine several

years ago. When quite closed up in summer they maintain the required depth of
water for an immense steamboat navigation. When wholly open in floods there is

no fall in the river surface. They occupy no part of the natural fall of the river
Asurface.
           remarkable one of these has been in excellent action for several years at

a place called Port-a-FAnglais, above Paris, and above the junction of the Seine

and Marne. I saw it when all open. There was not a ripple on the river flowing1

by. I saw it raised and lowered with ease and facility. I have here a letter from

M. Oambuzat, the chief engineer of the River Seine, in which he informs me that

all those wholly removable regulating weirs in the Seine are remarkably effective and

suitable for regulating: that great commercial river.
704 REPORT-- 1878.

    Let me now put forward the following proposition :
    If in July, 1861, a month previous to the great flood, the Killaloe weir mound

had been wholly removed, and a removable weir constructed at a proper level, and
subsequently properly manoeuvred, during the month of August none of the crops
in the level of the Shannon above that weir would have been materially injured.

    No other flood of so great a quantity of water as that of August, 1861, has

occurred during the last thirty years. It has been estimated to be 900,000 cubic feet

per minute from a rain basin of 2,600,000 acres, being one-third cubic foot of flood

water from each acre of land per minute.

   --To prevent all floods of that magnitude all summer and harvest floods from
--going on these lands all that is necessary is, to make a channel that will let off that

quantity of water at a level of 1 foot 9 inches lower than it was in August, 1861.
The removal of the weir mound and constructing a movable weir would accomplish

that.

     To have the crops quite safe from saturation the flood should pass off at a foot
lower level. That must be done by excavation 210 feet wide, 3 feejt deep, and 2,400

--feet long; 56,000 cubic yards, at 4s. =£11,200, will accomplish that.
     The Navigation. From Limerick to Portumna, Meelick, Banagher, and Shannon
Harbour at the junction of the Grand Canal from Dublin, there was a good naviga-
tion before the Shannon works were planned. There was a large trade, and many
passengers travelled in the steamboats. I was myself a passenger many times, and a

very pleasant passage it was.
    The parties then using the navigation were the Grand Canal Company and the

City of Dublin Steam Packet Company. When the Shannon improvement project

went before a Select Committee of the House of Commons those parties were repre-
sented by the Chan-man of the Canal Company and the Manager of the Steam Packet

Company, Charles Wye Williams. They gave very strong evidence that the boats
then on those waters were sufficient, and that great new locks and canals were not
necessary. The Commissioners thinking they knew what was wanted better than

the navigation companies, built" new canals and locks at great expense.*
                                                                                                _      now
The  results  are :  The state of the  navigation  at  Killaloe  and                               is       a
                                                                      Meelick

little better in summer and low-water times than it was before. But in floods it is
worse at Killaloe, and at Meelick in the new sailing channel. In high floods at
Meelick the current is too strong for the steamboats in the new channel ; they cannot

jro against it, they go up through the old canal and the old lock. Of course where

they°go up with ease they may come down. Therefore the great new lock may be
left unused during floods. Therefore the great weir mound by it is then doing no

good for navigation. It might be all out of the river during floods. Therefore a

movable weir there open more or less to keep sufficient depth of water in the old

canal would cause no injury to the navigation. It might be wholly shut in summer
without injuring the land. The weir mound stops 5 feet of water in floods. Of

course if these °5 feet of fall were distributed along the surface of the river, the

--velocity would be increased and more water would pass off much quicker.
     The Killaloe Rapid. At Killaloe the old navigation channel was a canal, pro-

tected from the rapid river "by a strong permanent embankment, which was one of

the public walks there.

     The Commissioners cut away a large portion of that embankment, and let the
river run into and along the old canal, which made it a very dangerous rapid in

mid floods and in high floods it stops the navigation for weeks. No steamboat

could go against it, nor with it.

     I saw steamboats going up it with several men and horses hauling in aid of the

steam power.
                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,
    In going down the boats go stern first, with cables from the stem to great posts

which the Commissioners fixed in the bank. One rope is wrapped round a post,
eased off to let the boat go down opposite another post, round which another rope

is wrapped, and so on.
     I have read in the annual reports of the Canal Company's directors that the

navigation at Killaloe was stopped by the floods for an unusually long time that

season. Such has been the state of the Shannon navigation during the last thirty

years.
  --Improvement of the Navigation. The necessary works for improving this navi-
--gation are : To replace the protecting embankment at Killaloe by a concrete wall.
AFortunately they did not cut it all away.
                                                                                    length of 800 feet is enough to build.
When that wall would be built the proposed movable weir could be operated with-

out injury to navigation. It would be well to dredge a foot deep of dredgable

Aclay from Deny Shoal and White's Ford.                                             jetty 20 feet wide might be built

at the pier head. The Meelick Canal, two miles long, should be cleaned. The

obnoxious corner called the Devil's Elbow above the canal should be cut off.

These are all that are required for the navigation in order to improve the drainage.

 Upwards        to  Athlone                                     and  Oarrick-on-Shannon, the      state     of the  navigation  is

_

quite  good  enough                                    but  it  is  almost. wholly  useless  for  want  of  trade  above  Athlone.
                                                    ;

The tolls received at the eight landing quays amount to but £100 a year, which is

£12 10s. a year to pay each lock-keeper or receiver. The four weir mounds there

are firmly maintained for the destruction of crops, and the disgrace of the govern-

ing power. Is it an enemy who maintains them so ?

The Storage Capacity of the Lakes.--Taking the area in square feet of the

Shannon lakes, and the depth in feet of the legal navigation level under the surface

of the land, there results 6,000,000,000 cubic feet. If at the beginning of great

rain-falls the lakes were all down to the navigation level, which they will be with

removable weirs, there would be a storage reservoir of 6,000,000,000 cubic feet.

This woidd store 300,000 cubic feet of flood water per minute for fifteen days, while

the rest would be ppssing off to the sea through the open weirs.

The greatest autumn flood lasted but seven days, and then fell regularly for and

remained low for twenty-six days. The lakes would store 500,000 cubic feet per

minute for eight days. Would these storage reservoirs have failed just when

wanted on that very important occasion ? Surely not.

The Injurious Effects of the Weir Mounds.--In ordinary wet weather, during all

seasons, they keep the water so high as to saturate the lands, which is a great evil

to the crops and to the agricultural and sanitary state of the country. In medium

wet weather, as no opening can be made to let oft" ordinary surplus water, they

cause the lakes to be filled to the brim, which is 2^ feet over the legal navigation

level. When that occurs there is a natural fall from Carrick-on-Shannon Bridge

to Killaloe Bridge of 37 feet, and out of that 37 feet no less than 21 feet fall are

wasted by the weir mounds, leaving only 16 feet fall in the surface of the river

to propel the stream. In the highest autumn floods 16 feet are so wasted.*

Mitchell Henry, M.P. for Galway, and I boated over many miles of meadows

where the hay lay, part in grass, cocks half covered, part in swarths wholly covered,

between Athlone and Meelick. When we got to Meelick there was a cataract over

the weir mound of 5 feet. There was but 1 foot to 2 feet of flood water rotting

the hay.

    If in planning for the improvement of the drainage of a river we begin by
robbing the surface of the stream of half of its natural fall, of course we must

estimate for very large excavations. Take, again, the channel at Killaloe as an

instance. The natural actual fall there in great autumn floods will be from the
deep wide water of Lough Derg down to the bridge 1 foot 3 inches in 2000 feet, or
3£ feet per mile. The present channel is 470 feet wide, and with this fall aud a
depth of 6 feet of running river it would as it is cany off 900,000 cubic feet of
flood water at a level that would keep Lough Derg and the river at Portumna
under the low lands.

    Now I beg your careful attention to a fact. The Government engineer, after

building the protection wall which would protect the navigation channel from
the river, proposes to construct a weir across the river that will of itself occupy

2 feet of the natural fall, and deprive the river surface of it. Of course he must

estimate for a very large quantity of excavation to make a sufficient channel with

only the remainder of the fall ; so he does.

                                                                                                               £

One more curious fact is the place he excavates the rock ; that mass of rock on

the side of the river which is 20 feet over the river. There he has to excavate hard

rock 20  fest deep before getting  to  the  river  surface                                     he  then  cuts  down  6  feet
                                                                                            ;

deep in the river : he cuts 26 feet of hard rock to get 6 feet of new waterway to

carry off 6 feet of water. Six feet excavated from the bed of the river will in-

crease the waterway to carry off as much water. as 26 feet excavation on the high

side, and it may be done for less cost per foot, because the bed on the other side is

not rock. Below the weir it is dry in dry summers, and may be easily made dry

in any summer. Above the weir may be dredged. Is this good river engineering ?

It is an example of his principle all the way up the Shannon. His proposed weirs

at Killaloe, Meelick, Athlone, Tarmon, Roosky, Jamestown, each occupy during

floods 2 feet or 2 feet 2 inches of fall, thus taking from the river surface nearly half

its natural fall. He has acted on mistaken principles in other points, which, added

to those explained, have made him estimate for three times more excavation, par-

ticularly in rock, than is necessary.

    The estimate -of 1867 for the whole river is £290,600. The sum which the
Government estimates for works in three and a half out of the seven divisions of
the Shannon is £300,000, which is one-half added to the estimate of 1867. At this
rate this revised estimate for the seven divisions would be t4?6,000. I submit for

consideration the following propositions :

     1. The circumstances of the Shannon render it very easy to regulate its waters

and prevent injurious floods.

    2. The navigation and the drainage of the Shannon district may be improved
to the full extent necessary or desired for a third part of the sum which the
Government has been advised to insist on as necessary. This may be effected by
means of simple and safe removable regulating weirs, which may be all built in

one season, and by dynamite blasting and steam dredging.
     I have all the details to prove this for each division of the river. I have minute

accurate large scale maps, sections, and cross-sections of every strait and shoal,

with the regime tabulated for the present and for the proposed state of the river in

floods.

  5. On the Present State of Electric Lighting. By James N. Shoolbred,
                                         B.A., M. hist. G.E.

     Electric lighting has only attained to its present development by certain marked

stages of progress.

     Though the electric light was first produced at the commencement of tbe

century as a chemical experiment, yet its first stage of practical application did
not take place till towards 1849, when, on the recommendation of Professor

Nollet of Brussels, the large cumbrous magneto-electric machines of Holmes of
London, and of the Alliance Company of Paris, were constructed to produce a

current alternating in direction for the supply of a single light of considerable
intensity. Machines of this kind were erected at the South Foreland Lighthouse

in this country, in France at those of Cape Grisnez and of Cape La Heve, and at a
few other lighthouses in the North of Europe. With these exceptions, these
machines may now be considered as obsolete.

     The next stage of progress in electric machines was the result of the important
discovery in 1867, almost simultaneously by Sir Charles Wheatstone, Dr. Siemens,
and by Mr. S. R. Varley, of the principle of " reaction " between the currents created
by the rotation of one electro-magnet in front of another fixed one, whereby
                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                                                                                                                                            707

these currents, on being1 passed backwards and forwards between them, are

gradually augmented to a very considerable decree, the result being a small,
economical, and much more powerful machine, termed " dynamo-electric " (electro

magnets being used) than are the previously described "magneto-electric'' ones

(where permanent magnets were employed). The best known machines of this
class are the " Siemens " and the " Gramme " in this country, and in the United
States the " Brush " and the " Wallace-Farmer."

The third and present stage of electric lighting is that of the divisibility of the

lisrht, i.e., the production of a number of lights from one machine. This has been

effected in practical use by Lontin with his double-machine, and the double-Gramme

feeding the well-known Jablochkotf candles. With these last, an Alliance machine
was at first used, but latterly ML Gramme devised his second machine, and which

has the appearance of the already existing Lontin.

In the double machine (of Lontin, and also in that of Gramme), the current

is created in a small one, termed the "generating" one, and passed on in one con-

tinuous direction current to the larger or " dividing "                                                                                                                         one                     on the outer envelope of
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

which it is received divided into a number of distinct circuits, which may be

coupled together at will. The Lontin machines, so far, have produced twelve

circuits from such a machine with a maximum, in lengthened use, of thirty lights
while the Gramme generally works with four circuits and feeds sixteen Jablochkotf

candles.

Of the lamps or regulators, those most in use for single lights are the Serrin and

the Siemens ; while, where many lights are producid, the Jablochkotf" candles" and
the divers forms of Lontin regulators are available. The Jablochkotf candle con-

sists of the two carbons placed vertically side by side, with an insulating layer of

plaster of Paris between them                                                                                                                                              which is an attempt to dispense with the delicate

mechanism of the regulating apparatus, and attended with only very moderate success.

The arrangements of the Lontin regulators are very ingenious, and very sensitive
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

some of the forms may be placed in any position whatever and be used with

currents, either continuous or alternating in direction.

The very careful preparation of the carbon-sticks between which the electric

light is produced is at present receiving attention, so as to render their composi-

tion as homogeneous as possible, and thereby to reduce the flickerings in the light

produced.

The motor power to cause the necessary rate of motion to the revolving electro-

magnet or induction coil (generally between 400 and 1000 revolutions per minute)
may be either hydraulic power in the form of a turbine or otherwise, or a gas

engine, or a steam-engine. But, whichever of the three is used, extreme regularity

of motion is an absolute necessity ; otherwise any want of steadiness in running

is productive of flickering in the electric light. Therefore, where possible, the

engine performing this duty should be special for the purpose, and not have other

work to do at the same time.

   A most important consideration in connection with electric lighting is, apart from

the prime cost of the machines, motor, lamps, &c, the amount of the working expenses

thereof, and chiefly the proportion and cost of the motor power to the amount of

Alight produced.  rough estimate of this is given by the designers of these

machines as one indicated horse power for each light of 1000 standard candles.

Where the number of lights is considerable, this may hold good ; but for a few, or for

single lights, a larger allowance for engine power should be made, even when running

ordinarily, and without the sudden and severe strains to which they are exrosed.

Many manufacturers at and near Paris, at Rouen, and at other places in France,
have made use of electric lighting in spinning and weaving sheds, in iron works,

&c, for the last two years, and they generally consider that they have been sup-

plied with a vastly augmented amount of illumination at considerably less than

one-half the cost of the previous, and much poorer one, by means of gas.
    Though electricity may replace gas lighting to some extent in the illumination

of large areas, and in certain manufactures, yet it cannot pretend to trench upon

the special, and the most extensive field for the use of gas, the lighting of private

                                                                                                                                                                           zz2

from the present carbon sticks be discovered.

     Nor should the sanitary advantages of electric illumination in buildings over
that by gas be overlooked.

6. On a Process for Cutting through Sand-bars in Rivers and Harbour
                       Entrances. By C. Bergeron, G.E.

     The process requires the prolongation of one of the piers or jetties at the end of
which the sand-bar is formed. The new pier is to be made on iron piles, in the same
style as the numerous jetties or piers at watering places, such as Brighton, South-
port, Llandudno, &c. They offer no resistance either to the waves or to the currents

of the sea.

     The pier is to support a pipe of 8 or 10 inches diameter, into which water, coming
from pumping-engines on the shore, is forced at a pressure of 10, 20, 40, even 50

atmospheres. The pressure is in proportion of the resistance of the sand or shingle

of which the bar is formed.

    At every forty metres there is a branch pipe which carries down the water to

another pipe of the same length of forty metres. This pipe is to be put horizon-

tally between the piles of the pier and supported by them.
     That horizontal pipe, which is at the level of the water at low tide, and which

it is easy to reach every fortnight at the epoch of spring tides, has twenty outlets
of one inch diameter at two feet distance from each other.

     India-rubber flexible pipes of a sufficient length are tied to those twenty out-
lets ; they are exactly like tire-engine hose ; they are tied two and two to a plank
lying at the bottom, which forces the jet of water to strike the sand at a con-

venient acute angle.

     The jetties are prolonged as far as the total length or width of the sand-bar.

    When the cross-section of the sand-bar has been properly measured, the highest

parts, which correspond to a certain section of the feeding pipe on the jetty, are
removed by the jets of water of that section, working only during a few minutes.

     Every sectional pipe is connected with the main feeding longitudinal pipe by
means of a valve. It is only four inches in side diameter, which is quite sufficient
to feed twenty india-rubber flexible pipes of four-fifths of an inch diameter. The

valves are to be opened one after the other.

The operation of cutting the sand-bar must take place at the moment of high

tide, when the tide begins to recede. It is at that moment that the current of the

flood tide is most rapid, and when all the water accumulated in the harbours or

rivers begins to run into the sea. At that moment, all the sand removed by the

Ajets of water is carried away.  very larue ditch or furrow is formed at the end

of the jets of water, and ships are no longer prevented entering the harbour.

1. On the Use of Wind Power for Raising Water, Disposal of Sewage, and
    Drainage, with special reference to Ireland. By James Price, M. Inst.

     C.E., M.A.I.

The power of the wind, though so immense, as shown by its action on the

surface of the ocean, and by its effects in conveying such an enormous weight cf
water in the form of rain clouds at so great a velocity, is yet but sparingly used by

mankind : still it always has been, and will be, used at sea for ships, and saves an
immeasurable quantity of coal which would be otherwise expended if steam

entirely replaced sails.

The crude wind power measured for a height of 70 feet constantly acting over

Ireland amounts to 360 millions of horse power. The convenience of steam power

has led to the disregard of the common forces of nature. Wind power being

almost without limit, it becomes unnecessary to complicate the machine for

utilising, it so as to save waste, as in the case of water power ; the only necessity
being to have the fans or sails self-adjustable, according to the force of the wind

to guard against injury by storms.

    Wind power is not suitable for constant work except as an assistant to steam

to save fuel, taken alone it is adapted to intermittent work, only such as

1. Water supplies for small towns.

2. Disposal of sewage in rural districts.

3. Drainage of marshes and peat bogs.

     1. Deep springs are generally easily found in the neighbourhood of small

towns, affording sufficient supply. Conducting water from a distance may in some

cases be too costly, whereas a wind engine of 20 feet in diameter with proper

pumps, costing not more than £200, might be relied upon for supplying a town of

1000 inhabitants with water at high pressure, even allowing for considerable cessa-

tion of wind : fair-sized reservoirs being necessary to provide for calms; or else

arrangements for using animal power.

2. The infiltration process to purify sewage is advocated by the author ; to be

applied by pumping out the under water of porous ground, and thus causing the

liquid part of the sewage deposited on the surface to soak down, and be pumped

out after having passed through a great thickness of earth. To carry this out, it is

proposed to form an annular cesspool with porous bottom, with a deep well sunk

in the middle of the island to be kept constantly pumped out by wind power, the

surface sludge being occasionally removed by scraping, new clay being substituted.

Long calms would not affect this process, as the cone of earth once dried would

hold a vast quantity of liquid before being saturated ; from experiments of the
author, say from 30 to 40 per cent, of bulk of earth.

3. The advantages of drainage in Ireland are much greater than the value of the

land saved from floods. The climate of Ireland would be improved ; its chief defect
is a want of summer heat, which is from 2° to 3° lower than it ought to be, as the

swamps and grass lands act as the envelope of a wet-bulb thermometer, which on

an average of two summers was found by the author to reduce the temperature

of the mercury 3°68.

The undrained land in the basins of the River Shannon and River Erne,

containing 5,000,000 acres, very much affect the heat required for ripening of

cereals                                    a few degrees in the  British  Isles being of  vast importance,  as the average

 summer temperature is about 58°, which is just the lowest at which cereals 'will
ripen. For draining bogs wind power is specially applicable, from the fact that
the bog, once dried, becomes like a dry sponge ; so that if wind ceased even for
weeks, the surface waters would not appear, but be at once absorbed ; as to drain-
age by pumping, even when steam is used, the cost is not formidable. Mr. J.

Woodward Stanford owns a property of 2200 acres of slob land south of Wex-
ford Harbour, now drained by steam power, averaging one horse power for every
244 acres. It may be safely taken, allowing for intermittent work, that a one horse

power wind engine would drain 100 acres from the natural rainfall. There are
numerous sites for wind engines in Ireland, the interior being flat and free from
trees ; the velocity of the wind is high, averaging fourteen miles per hour.

     Very portable wiud engines and others of large dimensions, having all necessary
improvements, are manufactured by Messrs. John Warner and Sons, of Crescent
Foundry, Cripplegate, who also furnish all pumps and appliances for raising water,
their noria or chain of tumbling buckets being very suitable for drainage ; also their
Archimedean screw suits wind-power well. American wind engines of very simple
construction were exhibited by Messrs. McKenzie and Sons, of Daw-son Street, in
Dublin, at the last Agricultural Show held in this city, they were made by the

United States Wind-engine and Pump Company of Batavia, Illinois. These range

from 8 to 60 feet in diameter, and are of an annular form, somewhat like Messrs.
Warner's ; they are much used in America for farm purposes and lifting water.

2. A System of Ventilation by Means of Fans and Punlahs worked by Com-

     pressed Air for use in Hospitals and Barracks in India and other

     Tropical Climates. By the Hon. R. C. Parsons.

     Many here are no doubt aware how extensively the punkah is used in India, and
that among the European inhabitants it is characterised as essential to the pre-
servation of health. The form of punkah which (especially among1 the medical
authorities) is considered the most effective is that known as the " Pole Punkah.''
This consists of a heavy wooden pole about 10 feet long from which a, curtain of

coarse canvas covered with calico is attached. This pole, with its curtain, which is
about three feet deep, is then suspended from the ceiling of the apartment in which
it is required, and it is ready for use.

     In the case of hospital wards the punkahs are generally worked in sets of from
four to six in a row placed parallel to each other. The coolie whose duty it is to
pull the set of punkahs is placed at the end of the row, and by meaDS of light
cords which attach the punkahs to each other keeps up a swinging motion through-
out the line.

     Working in spells of two hours at a time, two or three relays of coolies main-
tain more or less a constant swinging in a set of punkahs throughout the hot
season, which, on an average, extends from the months of March to October in-

clusive.

      But the great difficulty which has always been experienced is the very natural
offence of the coolie going to sleep at night, when most needed. The great evils
arising from this oflence are the chills w Inch are produced-by an intermittent action
of the punkahs, which, after they have been repeated upon Europeans several times,

frequently terminate in attacks of fever.

     The cooling action of the punkah depends entirely upon the agitation of the air
in its vicinity, and also, as a matter of course, upon the evaporation of the perspi-
ration from the bodies of the human beings situated near it; consequently its cool-
ing action ceases whenever the surrounding air is charged with moisture, which is
often the case »t particular seasons. In order that the punkah shall produce its
full effect, it is absolutely necessary that the pole from which the curtain bangs
shall receive a sudden jerk at the commencement of the swing, so as to raise the
curtain more or less into a horizontal position ; the punkah should then move on
to the end of its swing at a regular speed, during which time the curtain flaps
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  711

 downwards, carrying with it a current of air which strikes the persons seated

 beneath it.
       This flap of the curtain with punkahs pulled by coolies is only produced on the

 forward swing, and consequently the backward swing is almost devoid of cooling

  effect.

      Having briefly sketched the punkah system as at present carried out in India, the
 author proceeds to indicate how, in course of time, it maybe replaced by machinery.
 The system which the author proposes to describe is that which has been advocated
 for some years by Captain Palliser.

      In this system the coolie is replaced by a small machine actuated by com-

 pressed air.

      The machine is attached to the wall of the room in which a row of punkahs
are required, and connected to them by means of light bamboo canes.

      Immediately upon the compressed air being admitted to the machine, the pun-
kahs begin to oscillate, and a jerk is imparted to them both on the forward and
backward swing.*

      In this system, as applied to large barracks, cantonments, or other large buildings
in India, the air is to be compressed at a central station by means of a steam-engine,
and transmitted through cast-iron pipes to the various buildings where punkahs are

required.

     The author now proposes to pass on to consider a few points connected with the

proper ventilation of buildings in hot climates.

     In hot climates where there happens to be no breeze and a broiling sun, the
temperature of the houses becomes the same as that of the external air, and when
this is the case the air within becomes exceedingly foul, in consequence of no cir-

culation being maintained.

      In order to remedy this defect, fans, termed in India " Thermantidotes,'' are
worked at the present time by coolies. These fans, which are generally situated

within the houses, draw in the external air through mats made of "Khus Khus,"

called in India " Tattees." The preat disadvantage of the " Thermantidote " is the
chilling draught which it very often produces.

     After much consultation with Captain Palliser the author has designed a venti-
lator which is also actuated by compressed air, and which is intended to be placed

in the ceilings of buildings where a thorough system of ventilation is required,
whether in India or other countries where the climate is more temperate.

      This ventilator consists of a fan revolving on a vertical axis. Attached to this
axis is a small engine of very peculiar construction, into which is admitted high-
pressure air, similar to that used for working the punkah machines. Immediately
upon the air being admitted, the ventilator begins to rotate, and the foul air is
removed from the ceiling where it had collected.

     This system of ventilation is similar in principle to that now in use in the

Houses of Parliament in London, where no expense has been spared to ensure

success.

     This last system of ventilation which the author has described could be applied
with much advantage to buildings such as law and police courts, where the atmo-

sphere is usually exceedingly unpleasant.

     The author has carefully gone into the cost of working punkahs by the method
already explained, and it seems perfectly clear to him that, where a system similar
to that already described is carried out upon a tolerably large scale, it will prove a

decided financial success.
     This question is a very important one, both in a sanitary, and also in a financial

point of view to the Indian Government, inasmuch as last year it cost them £47,000
in coolie hire to supply the hospitals and barracks with punkah power.

     The author is glad" to be able to state that the Indian Government are fully
alive to the importance of the question, and have recommended a trial of the above
system to the Government in India.*

4. The Design and Use of Boilers * By F. J. Rowan, M. Inst. M.E.

The close relation between the engineer and the physical philosopher, though

obvious and often pointed out, has not been fully admitted. Yet the fact necessitates

the possession of accurate scientific knowledge in dealing with engineering problems,
and none demands it more strenuously than does that of the designing and working

steam boilers, and especially marine boilers, for various reasons. The proper genera-

tion of steam and circulation of heated water and gases are now attracting more

general attention than hitherto, and this is hopeful, because attention to principles

of thermo-dynamics has led to vast improvement in the steam-engine. On these
principles we must decide wh'at is the best pressure of steam to "work with, and
then we must study scientifically the characteiistics of a good boiler.

     Professor Osborne Reynolds's table of pressures of steam in relation to economy
and development of power is quoted, and also one compiled from Regnault and

other authorities to show the weight of water raised from 0° 0. to the state of

vapour at various temperatures by 1 lb. carbon.

     It being proved that high pressures of steam, say 150 to 200 lbs. per square inch,

are most economical, we need to find in a good boiler
     1. The most economical and efficient means of generating steam of that pressure.

2. Strength to carry it with safety under all the exigencies of practical working.

3. Facility of construction and repair.

1. Under the first head (a) combustion is first considered, and the theoretical

effect of the perfect combustion of 1 lb. carbon being known, we have a standard to

go by.

But varying qualities of coal and unvarying defects in the mode of mixing the

coal and air produce bad results.

  -- --Suction draught by jet blast is no real improvement. Mechanical stoking meets

imperfectly more or less only one evil ; and a combination of mechanical stoking
with forced combustion, or combustion under pressure, is needed for all the diffi-

culties of the case.

   A plan which the author proposes is illustrated and described.

     (b) Circulation of the heated gases necessarily comes in as an important ele-
ment under this head. The elements of quality of heating surface and time of

contact require to be taken into consideration, and show that the speed of travel of

the hot gases must be under control ; while surface is valuable in proportion as it
can deal with the heat brought to it by quickly transmitting it to a medium which
will convey it away.

The plan of turning the gases downwards before they escape to the funnel prac-

tised by the author's late father, in conjunction with tbe plan of forcing in the pro-

ducts of combustion just proposed, allows the time of contact to be quite under

control, and only the heaviest, i e., the coolest, gases escape-- not the hottest first, as

in up-draught arrangements. An interesting instance of saving in heat by giving

gases a downward current is quoted in a note.

     (c) Heating surface is then considered ; and the laws of thermal conductivity

are referred to. Formulae by Wiedmaun and Franz, and by Clerk Maxwell, express-

ing the quantity of heat which can be passed through the metal of boilers in a given

time,   are quoted                                                     and  also the results of Angstrom's investigations of the same
                                                                    ;

subject. These show that the relative values of different kinds of heating surface

must be determined by the facility of access which they afford to the heated gases

on the one hand and to fresh portions of the water on the other, and not by any

arbitrary rule as to their being in a horizontal or vertical position.

(d) Circulation of water thus appears as one of the most important, though it is

one of the most generally neglected points in boiler design and working.
     The specific heat of water and that of steam being so different, it is necessary to

                                                                       * Published by E & F. N. Spon, London.

have a proper supply of the former to the surfaces through which the heat of com-

bustion is passed. The fallacy of making steam by " foaming " or " vapour circula-

Wyetion " for boilers is pointed out, and Mr. 0.  Williams's table of the relative

effects of water, steam, and air in contact with the plates of a boiler which are

heated, is quoted.

    The natural action of circulation in boiling is well known to consist, first, in the
directly upward motion of the heated portions of water, and the vertical escape of

the steam, and second, in the colder portions of the water seeking the coolest means

of descent, when possible, undisturbed by opposing currents.

   A correctly designed boiler will provide for the free action of these simple prin-

ciples, which are contravened more or less by boilers of the ordinary marine type, and

by all those having horizontal or horizontally inclined water tubes, of which several
examples are named. None but a boiler of vertical water tube design satisfies indis-

pensable conditions.                              .

2. The form of the boiler introduces the question of strength, in which there are

two important factors, viz. (a) the best form for resisting pressure, and (b) equal

distribution of the strains due to expansion by heat, (a) High pressures demand

diminished areas, with of course an absence of flat or large-rending surfaces or large

diameters, and thus boilers of water tube design are required. Boilers of ordinary

marine type, which have large external diameters, also are defective in exposing

large surfaces to loss of heat by radiation, and so increasing the strains caused by

unequal expansion, (b) The force exerted by expansion is considerable, and is

enough to prove that the even distribution of heat by proper circulation and design

has a large influence upon the strength and wear of boilers. Cases of boilers

which suffered damage from expansion unequally distributed are quoted, and the

author refers to various measurements of this force given bv Professor W. Allen

Miller ('Chem. Phys.,' 4th ed., p. 261), and by J. Milton ('"Strength of Boilers,'

Proc. I.N.A.)

3. In considering facility of construction and repair, the author refers to the

drawings illustrating his paper, and recapitulates the defective points of various de-

signs, which have come up in the preceding remarks, and he contends for simple
operations in making, and for the minimum of different kinds of parts composing a

boiler.

It is being generally' understood and admitted that boilers ought to be worked

exclusively with fresh water, and with precautious against corrosion such as are

suggested in the Report of the Admiralty Committee on Boilers or in the author's

paper on 'Boiler Corrosion' (British Assoc, September, 1876), it becomes unneces-

sary to provide for access to all the internal parts. Facility of removal of parts for

repair is therefore all that is nece.-sary under these circumstances.

         6. On a Nciv Ship-raising Machine. By Thomas A. Dillon.

An oval-shaped floating canvas mattress larger and wider than the ship to be

raised, and having a deep curtain of strongly netted and roped canvas brailed up

all round, is lowered fore and aft over the wreck, when masts are supposed to have

been cut way, down below low water as far as convenient. The canvas curtain,

well weighted and chained, is by suitable means allowed to fall so that when it

Anreaches the bottom the ship lies in the centre of an oval bell-tent.        ordinary

suction pump is put in action at first ; the result is that the vacuum created in the

upper portion of the bell-tent induces the water on the bottom to try and fill it.

This it cannot do : it merely compels the bottom of the tent or flexible diving-bell

Ato grasp the wreck.  running rope or wire cable running string which had been

rove round the mouth of the bag is hauled taut.

The suction pump now ceases, and the air pump is worked. The water is

driven out of the bell by air pressure, and when an amount of water equal to the

weight of the ship is expelled, the ship rises in the grasp of this octopus.

The Student's Edition of the Speaker s

      Commentary on the Holy Bible.

           Abridged and Edited by JOHN M. FULLER, M.A.

                              Vicar of Bexley, formerly Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.

                    To be completed in 6 Volumes. Vol. I. Crown &vo. ys. 6d.

    The Speaker's Commentary on the Bible h;is secured for itself a recognized place as the
foremost work of its class available for English readers. Numerous testimonies to the merits
of this work, and to the fact that it meets a real want in religious literature, have been
received from various countries and different schools of thought. America and Germany,
Churchmen and Nonconformists, clergymen and laymen, have alike found in its pages wise
and liberal views upon points of confessedly disputed interpretation, and a storehouse of
scholarship and research upon questions philosophical, archaeological, and historical.

    The object of the present Abridgment is to give information sufficient to enable any reader
to understand the Holy Scriptures, to acquaint him wr ith the conclusions of learned investiga-
tions, and to supply him with satisfactory answers to current misinterpretations.

                                                                                         ·

" Lady Anne Blunt is entitled by descent to be an authoress, since she is the grand-daughter

of Lord Byron. Having previously explored the Sahara south of the Atlas range, she spent
last winter with her husband among the wandering Arabs of the Syrian desert. Admitted by

their hosts to the privileges, not only of hospitality but of sworn brotherhood, the travellers

lived with them in their tents, moved with their encampments, and were even spectators of

some of their feuds and strifes. Although the chief tribes were in arms, and war was raging

in the desert at the time, the English visitors were honoured as friends and admitted to all the

privacies of tent life." Athoneum.  +

History of Egypt under the Pharaohs.

      Derived entirely from Monuments.

     WITH A MEMOIR ON THE EXODUS OF THE ISRAELITES.

    The History of Egypt now offered to the English reader is distinct from the long train of
able and interesting works which, in opening to the last and the present generations the life
and story of the Old Egyptians, as by a new revelation, have at the same time thrown a clear
and vivid light on many portions of Holy Scripture.

     It embodies the Herculean task of weaving the testimony of the Egyptian records, whether
inscribed on the monuments or written on the countless rolls of papyrus, into a consecutive
history, derived solely from these ancient and authentic sources, and free from all the
colouring of external traditions.

   A Scientific Expedition may be said to have two histories. The one treats of the special

objects of the Expedition, the other of the personal adventures of those concerned in it. It is
only the former which finds permanent record in the transactions of Scientific Societies ; the
latter too often remains unwritten.

     This little work must be regarded as one side of the history of one step, and derives its
interest from its truthfulness as a record of an attempt to solve a great problem, viz., the
Distance of the Earth from the Sun.

     "The present edition has been prepared from the notes and manuscript which the late Sir

Gardner Wilkinson left behind, with the addition of fresh matter contributed by the Editor.

Very little of the original text has been omitted, and only those statements and opinions which

the  progress  of  science  no  longer  regards  as  useful  or  correct                                        while  new views                                               and  facts

acquired by the progress of Egyptian research have been embodied in notes or inserted in

the text.

     " The great merit of the acute observation of the Author, and the exhaustive illustrations of

Egyptian manners and customs as depicted by the monuments, have made the present work a

text-book on the subject,       both for the general  public     and  individual                                       students                                                its  chief

    Though this work is admitted to take rank with White's "Selborne" and Walton's
"Angler," no attempt has hitherto been made to illustrate the scenes, anecdotes, and feres

--natures so graphically described by Mr. St. John. This want to which attention has often
--been called it is the object of the present edition to supply. Great pains have been taken in

illustrating this edition, accurately to enter into the spirit, and, where possible, to depict the
actual scene of the events described in the text.

    " For 47 years, as a public man and a missionary, he worked, he wrote, he spoke, and in
countless ways he joyfully toiled for the people of India. While viceroys and governors,
scholars and travellers, officials and merchants, succeeded each other, and passed away all too

rapidly, he remained a permanent living force, a mediator between the natives and the
governing class, an interpreter of the various Asiatic races, creeds, and longings, to their

alien but benevolent rulers. From Central India to Central Africa, and from Cabul to
Comorin, there are thousands who call John Wilson blessed." Author's Pre/ace.

"Since the publication of the former edition of this work in 1848, many important

discoveries      have  been  made     in  Etruria                                                    and  the  interest  in  such  discoveries  has so greatly

increased that museums have been established in not a few provincial towns, and private

collections have become numerous. I have had the gratification of learning that the former

edition of this work, apart from literary and antiquarian considerations, has received the

approval of not a few who have used it as a guide, on account of the conscientious accuracy

of its descriptions. I trust that the present issue will maintain its reputation in this respect,

for to ensure correctness has been my primary endeavour. "--Author's Preface.

reader's appreciation of this interesting period of our Church history. The great men whose
names head these lectures are sketched for us by firm and skilful hands. 'Masters^ in
Theology' ought to take a noticeable place among our current theological literature."--
