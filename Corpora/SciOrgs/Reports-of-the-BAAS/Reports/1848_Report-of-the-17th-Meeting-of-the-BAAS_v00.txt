Report of the Proceedings of the Council in 1840-47, presented to the
       General Committee at Oxford, Wednesday, June 23, 1847.

Report of the Council to the General Committee.

    1. With reference to the subjects on which the Council was requested by
the General Committee at Southampton to make applications to Her Majesty's
Government, the Council has to report that the following official replies have
been received : --
1st. In respect to the publication of the meteorological observations
made by the officers of the Irish
and the Pigeon House since the     Trigonometrical                                  Survey at Mountjoy
                                   year 1834, -- the                                Master-General and

Board of Ordnance have informed the Council that the Lords of the
Treasury have approved of a grant for that purpose being included
in the estimates for 1848.
                         request of the British
2nd. In reply to    the  made of the parallel                            Association that a  p--arMticaujolar-r
                     be                                                 roads of Glen Roy,
    survey should
General Colby, Director of the Ordnance Trigonometrical Survey,
has replied that it would delay the progress of the survey of Scotland

to take up isolated positions ; but that he hopes that no essential
inconvenience will be found to result from deferring the survey of
the parallel roads until they come into regular course of progress.
The survey will then give all the levels and other information which

is known to be required, and thus answer the objects which the British

Association has in view.

   2. The Council has to announce that the publication of the Star Cata
logues of Lalande and Lacaille, for which a grant of £1000 was placed by
Government at the disposal of the British Association, has been completed,
                                   REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                             xvii

and that copies will lie on the table of the General Committee when this
report is presented. The Council, having requested the opinion of the Com

J.mittee for superintending the publication as to the best mode of distribution

and sale of these catalogues, has received from Sir F. W. Herschel, Chair
man of the Committee, the following communication, and has adopted the

recommendations contained therein.                               " Cambridge, Feb. 25, 1847.

    "After mature consideration of the best mode of publication of the Cata
logues of Lalande and Lacaille, Mr. Stratford, the Astronomer Royal and
myself, are agreed that it will be the best course for the British Association
to publish them in the usual manner, at a price of £1 Is. for the Catalogue
of Lalande, and 5i. for that of Lacaille ; and, not troubling the Govern

ment further on the subject than to report their readiness for publication, and
the total absorption of the grant, to acknowledge the liberality of the aid
given, and to inquire how many copies the Government would desire to have
for official distribution beyond those hereafter mentioned for the public
observatories, and to request their sanction for the disposal of the remainder

at  "theWeredaureceddecpidriecdes   above named.
                                   in recommending
                                                    that copies should  be presented  to the

British and East Indian public astronomical observatories, but that no dis

tribution should take place to private individuals beyond the press copies in
sheets as printed off, which have passed into the hands of the Committee in
the progress of the work for remark or correction.
                                                                  " J. F. W. Herschel."

"Public Astronomical Observatories to which Catalogues arc proposed to be

                                                         presented.

   "Royal Observatory Greenwich, Dublin, Edinburgh, Cape of Good Hope.
Observatories of Cambridge, Oxford, Armagh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Durham.
The H.E.I. Company's Observatories at Madras and Bombay."

   3. The Council had added to the list of Corresponding Members of the
British Association the names of the following gentlemen: -- Mons. Boutigny
d'Evreux, Dr. Eisenlohr, Prof. Forchhammer, Baron de Selys-Longchamps,
Prof. Matteucci, Prof, von Middendorf, Prof. H. Rose, and Dr. Svanberg.

    4. Doubts having been expressed whether Swansea, from whence an invi
tation for the year 1848 was presented at Southampton, possesses sufficient
accommodation to receive conveniently a meeting of the British Association,
the Council requested Mr. Phillips to visit Swansea for the purpose of exa
mining and reporting on its means of public and private accommodation, and

    " The inquiry      which       you  requested   me to make,   as to the accommodation

which might be found in Swansea for a Meeting of the British Association,
has been rendered comparatively easy, and capable of an accurate answer,
by the excellent arrangement of Mr. Grove and the zealous assistance of his
friends at Swansea. The town had been, in fact, surveyed, and the views of

the principal inhabitants and neighbouring residents ascertained, before my
arr"ivIalwtahse, rein  in the beginning of April.

                        consequence, enabled, in
expectations of Mr. Grove and his friends, that suitable accommodation for
the public purposes of the Association could be found in the Royal Institu

rooms ; and that the situation of these buildings is in general such as to

for the individual comfort of non-resident members, depends far more on the
feeling with which the inhabitants regard the Association, than on the number
of houses or extent of population. The gentlemen already referred to have,
in the course of their minute and systematic inquiries, ascertained this feeling
to be very favourable, and have, in consequence, estimated that above two
hundred persons may be referred to private hospitality in Swansea and the

vic"inTithye. y further estimated, that in the different principal inns and lodging-
houses, and in houses where, for the visit of the Association, beds may be

furn"isFhreodm,   more than         400 persons may be accommodated.                                                                                  ;  they correspond

  would have been quite impracticable, but for the prior establishment and
  creditable support of the Royal Institution of South Wales, which is therein

    Oxford, June 23, 1847.
                       RESEARCHES IN SCIENCE.                  xix

Recommendations adopted by the General Committee at the
                         Oxford Meeting in June 1847.

Involving Applications to Government and Public Institutions.

   That an application be made to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty,
to appropriate a suitable vessel for the purpose of an investigation of the
Phenomena of the Tides.

   That application be made to the Court of Directors of the Honourable
East India Company, to carry into regular and continued operation the Tide
Observations, which it is understood they have already ordered to be made ;
and to direct the nature and extent of these observations to be reported to
the British Association, with a view to their being discussed and reduced,
and connected with any others which have been made or may be made in
other seas.

   The British Association feels deeply the great importance of instituting
a direct comparison, or a comparison with as few intermediate steps as pos
sible, between the standards of length used in the survey of the great Russian
and Swedish Arc of Meridian now in progress under the direction of Pro
fessor Struve and the scientific men of Sweden and Norway, and that used
in the survey of the great Indian Arc, under the authority of the Honour
able East India Company, by Lt. Col. Everest, of which an account has
lately been published: and the Association, in the full confidence that every
facility will be given by the Court of Directors for effecting this comparison,
and that they will, if possible, consent to an arrangement by which the two

Standards may be brought together, and thus directly compared, instructs the
Council, that an application be made to the Honourable Court of Directors
of the East India Company, to grant the needful facility for effecting this

comparison.

   The General Committee, having had the satisfaction to receive amongst
the eminent Foreign Guests of the British Association at Oxford, Professors
Langberg and Esmark of Christiania, and Professor Nilsson of Stockholm,
take this opportunity to request those gentlemen, to convey to the distin
guished Scientific Societies with which in their own countries they are re
spectively connected,
to the establishment,  the    importance    which  the British Association attaches
                              be possible,         Magnetical and Meteorological
                       if it                 of a
Observatory in Finmarken, as a station where the phaenomena of those
sciences could be most advantageously studied ; and also their hope, that
the observations which have been carried on for some years past with such
indefatigable zeal at Christiania may be continued, and that the observations
may be published at as early a date as from circumstances may be found
convenient.

                    Recommendations not involving Grants of Money.
    That Mr. Ronalds and Mr. Robert Hunt be requested to continue the
Experiments with the Actinograph at Kew.
    That Dr. Andrews of Belfast be requested to prepare a Report on the Heat
developed in Chemical action.
    That Mr. Mallet be requested to continue his investigations on the cor
rosion of Iron Rails in and out of use.
   That Dr. Smith of Manchester be requested to report upon the chemical
analysis of Air and Water of Populous Towns.
XX REPORT 1847.

   That Mr. W. Thompson be requested to prepare a Supplementary Report
on the Fauna of Ireland.
   That Mr. Robert Hunt be requested to prepare a Report on the state of
knowledge of the Chemical Influence of the Solar Radiations.

That the Committee for conducting Experiments with Captive Balloons be
re-appointed, and to consist of the Rev. Dr. Robinson, Professor Wheatstone

and Colonel Sabine.

That the following Communications presented to this Meeting be printed
at full length among the Reports to the Association : viz.

On the Mean Temperature of various places on the Globe, by Professor
Dove.
On the Turbine, by Mr. Glynn.
That Sections D. and E. be incorporated under the name of the Section of

Zoology and Botany, including Physiology.

   That the Council be authorized, if they shall think fit, to divide the publi
cation of the Transactions into two parts, to be published successively, at
their discretion, in order to ensure an earlier delivery of such Papers as may
be at once ready for publication.

my eminent friend, who did honour to this Chair, took a comprehensive

planet Neptune ; but though Uranus had just been added to those bright
orbs which to mortal eyes, for more than 2000 years, have been known to
circle around our sun, we are bound to recollect, that Lalande was making
these observations before Piazzi, Olbers, and Harding had added Ceres,
Pallas, Juno and Vesta to that number, and before by those discoveries it
was proved, not only that the planets of our system had passed the mystic
number of seven -- since Herschel had confuted that ancient belief -- but that
others might also remain to reward the patient labours of other observers.
He therefore distrusted his own eyes ; and preferred to believe that he had
been mistaken, rather than that the existence of another new planet had
been reserved for the discovery of this latter age. What his eyes saw, but

what his judgement failed to discriminate and apply, has since become a

Irecognized fact in science.

      will not presume to measure the claims of the two illustrious names of
Leverrier and Adams ; of him, in our own country, who, in midnight work
ings and watchings, was the first to predict the place of an unseen planet, and of
the hardly happier philosopher, who, in God's providence, was permitted and
enabled to be the first, after equal workings and watchings, to predict and to
                                                                                and assured him to

expect.                                              only two observations :
hope that the rivalry not merely of the illustrious Leverrier and of my illus
trious countryman Adams, but of the two great nations which they represent,

France and England, may always be confined to pursuits in which victory is
without woe, and to studies which enlarge and elevate the mind, and which,
Iif rightly directed, may produce alike glory to God and good to mankind :
and the other, my equal hope, that for those (some of whom                           trust may

now hear me) who employ the same scientific training, and the same la
borious industry, which have marked the researches of Leverrier and Adams,

great, perhaps, for any one individual -- are supplied by the combined exer
tions of many kindred followers of science.

   It is another result of the circulation of these star-maps, that a new visitor,
a comet, can hardly be within the range of a telescope for a few hours with
out his presence being discovered and announced through Europe. Those
comets which have been of larger apparent dimensions, or which have con
tinued longer within view, have, indeed, for more than 2000 years been
observed with more or less accuracy ; their orbits have been calculated ;
and the return of some has been determined with a precision which in past
ages exercised the wonder of nations; but now, improved maps of the heavens,
and improved instruments by which the strangers who pass along those hea

vens are observed, carry knowledge where conjecture lately dared not to

penetrate. It is not that more comets exist, as has sometimes been said, but

more are observed.

   An Englishman -- a subjpct of this United Kingdom --cannot refer to the
enlarged means of astronomical observation enjoyed by the present age
without some allusion to the noble Earl, Lord Rosse, one of the Vice-Pre
sidents of this meeting, who, himself educated amongst us here in Oxford, has
devoted large means and untiring labour to the completion of the most won
derful telescope which science,
perfect ; and which the Dean        art, and wealth    have ever        yet   combined     to
                                                      worthy to       praise    the work
                                    of Ely -- a man                                       --

pronounced to be a rare combination of mechanical, chemical, and mathema
tical skill and knowledge. Its actual operations have been suspended by a
cause not less honourable to Lord Rosse in another character than the con
ception and early progress of his great instrument were to him as a man of
Iscience. They have been retarded, so far as he himself is concerned, by the

more immediate, and, will say, higher duties which, as a magistrate, as a
landowner, and as a Christian gentleman, he owed, and has been paying to

m*3 neighbours, his tenantry, and his country, during the late aweful visitation
which has afflicted Ireland. Yet perhaps my noble friend will permit me to
say, that while we not only do not blame him -- we even praise him cordially
for having devoted his time, his mind, and his wealth to those claims which
could not be postponed,                    affected the lives of those who in God's
providence surrounded      since     they
                                    there  were, and there arc, others, two, at least,

speak without any communication on the subject from that great observer
and greater philosopher), who might have carried on the observations with
this wonderful

of the empire,                                        new planet, at  least  the first  assured
                                    discovery of the
knowledge of its form and of its satellites.
The Catalogues of Lacaille and of the Histoire Celeste arc now before the
Iworld ; and with the Catalogue of our Association constitute a series of most
important gifts conferred on astronomy.               have already said that I will not
presume to measure the relative merits of two eminent individuals ; it is as
little within my power to measure the value of such gifts to science. That
value can be duly appreciated by none but the great masters of this, the
greatest of the sciences: but I may be permitted to add, that here, also, come
into beneficial action the powers and the uses of such an Association ; which,
rising above the mere calculations of pecuniary profit, provides for the few,
who only are capable of extracting the just benefit from such works, those
materials of advancing knowledge which are beyond the reach of individuals.

paper which I have just received from him, to make me the vehicle of com

municating his wisdom to you on a must important and interesting discovery
of                 year : --
    "thIenpathste   lunar theory
                                  a  very  important step  has been made  in  the  course

of the past year. When, near the beginning of the present century, a con
siderable number of the Greenwich lunar observations were reduced by Burg
for the purpose of obtaining elements for the construction of his Lunar
Tables, and generally for the comparison of the moon's observed place with
Laplace's theory, it was found impossible to reconcile the theoretical with
the observed places, except by the assumption that some slowly varying error

affected the epoch of the moon's mean latitude. From the nature of the
process by which the errors of the elements are found, the conclusion upon
the existence of this peculiar error is less subject to doubt than that upon
any other error. So certain did it appear, that Laplace devoted to it one
entire chapter in the Mecanique Celeste, with the title ' On an inequality of
long period by which the moon's mean motion apptars to be affected.' Guided
by the general analogy of terms producing inequalities of long period, he

suggested as its probable cause an inequality whose argument depends upon
a complicated combination of the longitude of the earth's perihelion, the lon
gitude of the moon's perigee, the longitude of the moon's node, and the
moon's angular distance from the sun. But he made no attempt to calculate

its theoretical effect. He also suggested an inequality depending on a pos
sible difference in the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth. Many

years elapsed before these suggested theoretical inequalities were carefully

examined by physical astronomers. At length the introduction of new
methods enabled Poisson and Lubbock successfully to enter upon the inves
tigation of the theoretical values ; and they proved that inequalities depend

ing on the arguments suggested by Laplace could not have sensible values.
The theory was now left in greater doubt than ever ; and suspicion fell even
                      of the reductions of the observations.

the British Government, at the representation of the Association, sanctioned
the complete reduction, on an uniform plan, of all the observations of the
moon made at the Royal Observatory of Greenwich since the year 1750 :
and the immediate superintendence of this work was undertaken by the As

tronomer Royal. The reductions are now printing in all necessary detail ;
and the press-work is at this time very far advanced. In the last summer
the corrections of the elements of the moon's orbit were generally obtained ;
and the errors of epoch in particular at different times were found with great
accuracy. These results confirmed those of Burg, and extended the law of
the inequality to a much later time. In this state they were exhibited by
the Astronomer Royal to Prof. Hansen of Gotha, who was known to be en

gaged in the Lunar Theory. Prof. Hansen immediately undertook a search

for their theoretical causes. His perfect knowledge of the state of the ex
isting theories enabled him at once to single out the class of disturbances
produced by the action of the planets as that in which the explanation of
this inequality would probably be found. In the course of a systematic
search, many inequalities of long period were found ; but none of sensible
magnitude. At length two were found, both produced by the disturbing
force of Venus, of a magnitude entirely unexpected. One depends upon the
circumstance that eighteen times the mean anomaly of Venus diminished by
sixteen times the mean anomaly of the Earth, increases at very nearly the
same rate as the mean anomaly of the Moon : its coefficient is 27" and its
period 273 years. The other depends upon the circumstance, that eight

times the mean anomaly of Venus increases at very nearly the same rate as
thirteen times the mean anomaly of the Earth : its coefficient is 23" and its
period 239 years. The combination of these two explains almost perfectly
the error of epoch, which had so long been a subject of difficulty. The
discovery of these two inequalities, whether we regard the peculiarity of
their laws, the labour expended upon the investigations, or the perfect suc
cess of their results, must be regarded as the most important step made in
physical astronomy for many years."
   The doctrine of the influence of the moon and of the sun on the tides was

no sooner established than it became eminently probable that an influence

exerted so strongly upon a fluid so heavy as water, could not but have the
lighter and all but imponderable fluid of air under its grasp. I speak not of
the influence attributed to                                                                                            of

of the moon and of the sun upon the air. It is now clear, as the result of the

observations at St. Helena by my friend Col. Sabine, that, as on the waters,

so on the atmosphere, there is a corresponding influence exerted by the same

causes. There are tides in the air as in the sea ; the extent is of course de

terminable only by the most careful observations with the most delicate in
struments; since the minuteness of the effect, both in itself and in compari
son with the disturbances which are occasioned in the equilibrium of the at

mosphere from    other causes, must always present great difficulty in the                       way

at the Meteorological and Magnetical Observatory at St. Helena, have now

placed beyond a doubt the existence of a lunar atmospheric tide. It appears
that in each day the barometer at St. Helena stands, on an average, four-
thousandths of an inch higher at the two periods when the moon is on the
meridian above or below the pole, than when she is six hours distant from

the meridian on either side ; the progression between this maximum and

minimum being moreover continuous and uninterrupted ; thus furnishing a
new element in the attainment of physical truth ; and, to quote the expres

ledge of facts is the first process of philosophical induction ; and the col
lection and arrangement of the facts connected with this subject formed
consequently one of the objects contemplated by the establishment of the
British Colonial Observatories.     The solution of the problem with which

these facts are connected has, to a great degree at least, been accomplished

in the past year, by an examination and discussion of the phsenomena as they
presented themselves at the widely-separated stations of Toronto, St. Helena,
the Cape of Good Hope, and Van Diemen's Land. The connection of the
diurnal variation of the magnetic declination, with the sun's position in re
gard to the terrestrial equator, has thus been manifested : the epoch of the
sun's passage of the equator is found to be also the epoch of an almost
immediate augmentation of the magnetic movements in the hemisphere to
which he is passing, and of a diminution of those movements in the hemi
sphere from which he is receding ; whilst on the confines of the respective

hemispheres, the epoch is still more strikingly marked by a singular inversal
of the order and direction of the movement, which, whilst the sun is in the

northern signs, corresponds to the direction followed by the magnet in the
northern hemisphere ; and, when the sun is in the southern signs, corre

sponds to the direction followed by the magnet in the southern hemisphere.

It may be confidently anticipated, that, in the present rapidly-advancing state
of magnetical science, the reason of this connection will ere long receive an
explanation ; and that a discovery of the mode in which the effect is pro
duced will follow closely on a knowledge of the facts.

   In reference to this subject, I should not omit to notice the increased pro
bability which the facts, now brought to our knowledge, have incidentally
given to the opinion, that the line of least intensity of the magnetic force is
the physical line of separation on the surface of the globe between the

northern and southern magnetic hemispheres ; for it is this line which appears

to separate the opposite phncnomena of the diurnal changes which characterise

they had produced no other fruits than those which were first expected and
desired, namely, a clear and exact knowledge of the distribution of terrestrial
magnetism ; if they had proved nothing except the grand principle of the
independence of the gaseous and vaporous envelopes of our globe ; or than
the recognition of those wave-like propagations of magnetic disturbance over
wide tracts of continent and ocean, we should still have felt ourselves repaid.

public attention was so generally called to the subject as it has been in later

sacrifice of domestic comfort, and at a risk of life, not in the ordinary duties

perhaps, though with great deference, as a lesson to others also. It is taken
from a great master of the English language in the best age of English lite
Ifrature, Henry Peacham. He is referring, in substance, to the parallax of

the fixed stars, and his illustration is to this effect :-- from two points of
                                     same star appears of the same bigness,

the earth's orbit (between which extremities not less than 180,000,000 of
miles intervene) there is no parallax, or the smallest measurable, between
the position of a star seen from one extremity and the position of the same
star seen from the other extremity, in reference to one other star or to all

other stars, how great must be the distance and the size of the stars --how

covery which will long place the name of Dr. Charles Jackson, its author,
among the benefactors of our common nature.

   At the same time, much careful observation on the modus operandi of this
most singular agent seems still requisite before a general, systematic, safe,
and successful application of it can be established for the relief of our suffer
ing nature. So great, however, is the number of well-recorded instances of
its having saved the patient from the pain of a surgical operation without
any ill effect in reference to his subsequent recovery, as to make the subject
of the influence of the vapour of ether upon the nervous system, and the
modification of that influence on different temperaments, one eminently de
serving the attention of the Physiological Section of the British Association.
With regard to the functions of the primary division and parts of the brain
itself, there has been of late a happy tendency to substitute observations on
the modifications of those parts in the series of the lower animals in the place
of experimental mutilations on a single species, in reference to the advance
ment of cerebral physiology. Experiment              is,

those the functions of which it is the object of the comparative anatomist to
elucidate. An elaborate and valuable contribution with this aim was com
municated by Dr. Carpenter to the Physiological Section of this Association,

at its meeting at Southampton ; having for its subject the homologies and
functions of the parts of the encephalon.
   It is needless  to dwell on the obvious necessity of the                         of the
                   --signified by the true definition and name  k--noowf leeadcghe

the animal series, in order to ensure correct reasoning on the physiological
import of the varieties of such part in the lower animals. The British As
sociation has already manifested its appreciation of the value and necessity of
this preliminary step in comparative physiology by calling for the Report on
the homologies of the vertebrate skeleton ; and that Report, just published,
is itself the best evidence of the importance of the subject, and a model of
the mode in which it should be treated, and in which, happily for this Asso
ciation, it has been treated by the Cuvier of England, Professor Owen.
In no department of the science of organized bodies has the progress been

greater or more assured than in that which relates to the microscopic struc
ture of the constituent tissues of animal bodies, both in their healthy and in
their morbid slates ; and this progress is specially marked in this country

during the period which has elapsed since the communication to the British
Association by Professor Owen of his researches into the intimate structure
of recent and fossil teeth.
The result of these researches having demonstrated the constancy of well-
defined and clearly appreciable characters in the dental tissues of each spe
cies of animal, (by which characters such species could be determined, in
many instances, by the examination of a fragment of a tooth,) other ob

servers have been stimulated to pursue the same minute inquiries into the
diversities of structure of the tissues of other organs. Such inquiries, for
example, have been most ably and successfully pursued by Dr. Carpenter
in reference to the microscopic structure of recent and fossil shells ; and the

anatomist, the naturalist, and the palaeontologist are alike indebted to the
zeal and the skill of that eminent physiologist : while, in another sense, all

are indebted to the British Association for aiding and stimulating his inqui
ries, and for the illustrations with which the publication of Dr. Carpenter's
Report has been accompanied in the Transactions of the Association.
   The hairs of the different mammalian animals offer to the microscopical
anatomist a field of observation as richly and remarkably developed as the
teeth, which formed the subject of Professor Owen's communication in 1838,
and as the external coverings of the testaceous mollusca, which formed the
subject of Dr. Carpenter's communication in 1846.
   The structure of the softer tissues of the animal frame has not been less

successfully investigated by microscopic observers. One of the most extra
ordinary, perhaps, of the recent discoveries by the microscope is that which
is due chiefly to Purkinje and Valentin, and which in this country has been
confirmed by Dr. Sharpey, relative to the important part in the motion of

fluids on internal surfaces, performed by the vibratile action of myriads of
extremely minute hairs or cilia which beset those surfaces. These ciliary
movements, for example, raise the mucus of the windpipe to the throat
against gravity. They have been detected in the ventricles of the brain, as
well as many other parts.

   Microscopic anatomy has been chiefly indebted to Ehrenberg, Remak, and
Dr. Martin Barry, for the exposition of the ultimate structure of the nervous

and cerebral fibres.

Association at its present meeting, one evening, Tuesday the 29th of June, will
be specially devoted to an exhibition of microscopic objects. The beautiful
discoveries of Sir David Brewster (whom, in this Association, we must always
mention as one of our earliest friends and patrons, three times one of our

Vice-Presidents,) have been carefully confirmed ; and many interesting va
rieties have been noticed in the structure of the crystalline lens of the eyes
of different species of animals.
The most brilliant result, perhaps, of microscopic anatomical research has
been the actual observation of the transit of the blood from the arteries to

returns to his own locality and to his own particular department of science
with renewed interest, with increased zeal, and perhaps also with a better

direction given to his observations.
   The rapid progress of the scientific knowledge of the animals of our own

islands, and the great advance in the determination of the British Fauna,
may be produced in illustration of the benefit which has followed these as
semblages, and of the encouragement which the British Association, as a
body, has given to the investigation of the facts and to the publication of the

results.

   In no department of the living works of the Creator has this been more
manifested than in that humble and heretofore much-neglected class of the
molluscous or gelatinous animals which people the seas around our island.
Among the naturalists who have rescued this branch of zoology from neglect,
the name of Edward Forbes deserves early and honourable mention. The
stimulus given by his successful exertions with the dredge and with the
towing-net in collecting new species of Conchifera, Echinoderma andAcale-
pha, and the brilliant generalizations which he has deduced from the fruits
of these researches, may be discerned in the beautiful monograph by Messrs.
Alder and Hancock on the British Nudibranchiata, now in course of publi
cation by the Ray Society, in the interesting work on British Zoophytes, just
completed by Dr. Johnston, and in the new discoveries annually communi
cated to the Zoological Section of the British Association by Dr. Allman,
Mr. Thompson, and other eminent naturalists, from Ireland ; by Prof. Goodsir
and other excellent observers in Scotland ; by Mr. Price, as the fruit of his
observations on the shores of Birkenhead; and by Mr. Peach, from the

other reports which have been suggested or encouraged by the grants of
the British Association will best attest the influence of this Association in
the promotion of natural history in general and of home zoology in parti

  II cannot utter one or two of the technical terms which have lately ad

dressed to the meeting without adding one passing reference to the great
ancient authority from which they are derived ; and which, high as its value
is in its proper place in relation to those unchanged sciences of morals and
mind, the cultivation of which is the distinguishing object of the academical
education of Oxford, is likewise high even in natural science also : for, while
the ethics of Aristotle remain the monument of his profound reason, his
claim to eminence as a great observer of Natural History remains also, after
     experience of 2000 years,

of the living plant, and as to the analogies in the vegetable world in its fos

Systematic Botany is constantly receiving additions to the number of

   In England, for the greater part of the accession to the plants in cultiva

tural Society's collector in China, who has recently published an account of
his mission ; and we are not less indebted to those who, as collectors and
correspondents in various parts of the world, communicate the results of
their labours to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. That establishment,

productive, so far as we at present know, in the department of Botany. The
animal productions of New Holland, so wonderful in their forms and struc
tures, have long formed the most remarkable characteristic of its vast region :
nor is its botany without distinctions of much interest. It may be said,
however, in reference to the results of these later expeditions which have
penetrated further inland, that they have not brought to our knowledge any
peculiarities in the vegetable kingdom so various and so striking as those
which exist near the coasts, and which are sufficient to distinguish New
Holland from the other regions of the world.

four and five thousand plants of the famous Tussac grass have been di

spersed from the Royal Gardens at Kew during the past year." I take
these facts from the last Report to Parliament.
The increase in the number of visitors to that most flourishing establish
ment is some evidence at least of an increase of a taste for the development
of science, and probably of that increase of the love of science which it is
one of the objects of the British Association to encourage in all classes. In
1841, the number of visitors was 9174; but they are nearly doubling every
year. In 1844, they were 15,114 ; in 1845, 28,139 ; in 1846, 46,573.
In Vegetable Physiology, microscopic observers have of late been much
occupied in investigating the phsenomena of fecundation, and especially as
to the mode of action of the pollen.
On this subject botanists are still divided. Several experienced observers

adopt the theory lately advanced and ingeniously supported by Professor
Schleiden of Jena ; while others of great eminence deny the correctness on
which this theory is founded. Among these, the celebrated microscopic ob
server, Professor Amici of Florence, very recently in an essay -- communi
cated to the Scientific Meeting held in 1 846 at Genoa -- has endeavoured by
a minute examination of several species of Orchis to prove the existence of
the essential part of the embryo anterior to the application of the pollen,
which, according to him, acts as the specific stimulus to its development.
This view receives great support from some singular exceptions to the
general law of fecundation.
xlii REPORT 1847.

Of these the most striking occurs in a New Holland shrub, which has
been cultivated several years in the Botanic Garden at Kew ; and which,

though producing female flowers only, has constantly ripened seeds from
which plants have been raised perfectly resembling the parent ; while yet
there is no suspicion either of the presence of male flowers in the same plant,
or of minute stamina in the female flower itself, nor of fecundation by any
related plant cultivated along with it. This plant has been figured and de
J.scribed in a recent volume of the Linnean Society's Transactions, under the
name of Ceelebogyne ilicifolia, by Mr.  Smith, the intelligent curator of
the Kew Garden, by whom, indeed, this remarkable fact was first noticed.

It is not the least curious part of the history of the CceUbogyne, that male
flowers have lately been discovered in New Holland unquestionably of the

same species.
Professor Gasparini of Naples has more recently communicated to the

scientific meeting held in that city in 1 845 his observations and experiments
on the cultivated fig, which, though entirely destitute of male flowers, pro
duced seeds having a perfectly developed embryo, independent of fecunda
tion : access to the pollen of the wild fig, generally supposed to be carried

by insects, being, in his experiments, prevented by the early and complete
shutting up of the only channel in the fig by which it could be introduced.

   An elaborate memoir has very recently appeared in the Transactions of
the Linnean Society, by the late Mr. W. Griffith, ' On the Structure and
Affinities of Plants Parasitical on Roots.' These singular productions have

been regarded by several distinguished botanists as forming one natural
class, which they have called Rhizanthece. Mr. Griffith, on the other

hand, who was eminently qualified, both as a systematic and physiological
botanist, to judge of such a question, has adopted the opposite view taken

by other observers, namely, that these plants really belong to several di
stinct, and not even nearly related families ; the points of internal structure
and external appearance which they have in common arising from the pecu
liar mode in which they receive their nourishment.
   The extension of the means of communication by the Electric Telegraph
is yearly facilitating intercourse, almost as rapid as light or as thought, be
tween distant portions of England, and between distant provinces in the vast
Iempire of our Queen.
                            had in my hand before leaving home yesterday
   The last pamphlet which
was a Report presented to the Legislative Council and Assembly of New
Brunswick, relative to a project for constructing a railway, and with it a line
of electro-magnetic telegraph, from Halifax to Quebec.
Distance is time ; and when by steam, whether on water or on land, per

sonal communication is facilitated, and when armies can be transported
without fatigue in as many hours as days were formerly required, and when
orders are conveyed from one extremity of an empire to another almost like
a flash of lightning, the facility of governing a large State becomes almost

equal to the facility of governing the smallest. I remember, many years ago,
in the Scotsman, an ingenious and able article showing how England could
be governed as easily as Attica under Pericles ; and 1 believe the same con
clusion was deduced by William Cobbett from the same illustration.

   The system is daily extending. It was however in the United States of
America that it was first adopted on a great scale, by Professor Morse in
1844; and it is there that it is now already developed most extensively.

Lines for above 1300 miles are in action, and connect those States with Her

Majesty's Canadian provinces ; and it is in a course of development so rapid,

be, and so lively is the interest felt in its accomplishment, that it is scarcely

doubtful that the whole of the populous parts of the United States will

within two or three years be covered with a telegraphic network like a

spider's web, suspending its principal threads upon important points along

confidence in the efficiency of telegraphic communication has now become

so established, that the most important commercial transactions daily trans
pire by its means between correspondents several hundred miles apart.
Ocular evidence of this was afforded me by a communication a few minutes
Iold between a merchant in Toronto and his correspondent in New York,
distent about 632 miles."         am anxious to call your attention to the advan

in Boston, in January 1847, with the news of the scarcity in Great Britain,
Ireland and other parts of Europe, and with heavy orders for agricultural
produce, the farmers in the interior of the states of New York, informed of
the state of things by the magnetic telegraph, were thronging the streets of
Albany with innumerable team-loads of grain almost as quickly after the
arrival of the           at Boston as   the news of that arrival could ordinarily
have reached    steamer                 that, irrespectively of all its advantages
                 them.   I may add,

to the general community, the system appears to give already a fair return
of interest to the individuals or companies who have invested their capital
in its application.
   The larger number of the members of this Association have probably

already seen in London an exhibition of a patent telegraph which prints
alphabetical letters as it works. Mr. Brett, one of the proprietors, obli
gingly showed it to me, and stated that he hoped to carry it into effect on
the greatest scale ever yet imagined on the American continent. Professor
Morse, however, does not acknowledge that this system is susceptible of
equality with his telegraphic alphabet for the purpose of rapid communica
tion ; and he conceives that there is an increased risk of derangement in the

Imechanism employed.

      cannot refer to the extent of the lines of the electric telegraph in Ame
rica without an increased feeling of regret that in our own country this great
                                                        So far at

yet carried the electric telegraph further from London than to Watford and

Slough.
   In England, indeed, we have learnt the value of the electric telegraph as

a measure of police in more than one remarkable case ; as a measure of

government it is not less important ; from the illustration which I have

drawn from America, it is equally useful in commerce ; but as a measure
         of social intercourse                      of

for the most rapid sketch of the progress of other sciences, the time would

fail me in the attempt to convey it to you. I abstain from any reference to

yet, perhaps, sufficient time has not elapsed to test its full value. We all
know that an experiment succeeds perfectly in the case of a model, or in a

laboratory, which may not succeed so perfectly when the miniature steam-
engine, for example, is extended to its ordinary size in a manufactory, or

when the operation is transferred from ounces to tons. But if the hopes,

expectations and confidence of the discoverers be realized, their plan will
be of the greatest value to this country, and of even greater proportionate
value to some of the Queen's most important colonies. It appears, that
nearly 4000 tons of copper ore were sent last year from South Australia and

the adjoining regions to be smelted in England ; and that they produced

little more than 800 tons of metal*. It is evident, therefore, that if by
this process of smelting by electricity, the refuse, say 3000 tons, can be left
on the spot, 3000 tons of shipping are liberated for other purposes of com

    From the sciences cultivated, extended or encouraged, advert to con
sideration of the Association itself. The importance of these meetings
national. Their direct results have been eminently beneficial to science
their indirect effects, in uniting men of the same pursuit from different parts
of our common country, and not less in bringing together those whom seas
and empires divide, but whom the same zeal for knowledge happily asso
ciates as in this place, are equally remarkable. Those antipathies

use too strong word) which once separated us from our brethren in other
realms, and from which even men of science were not always exempt, are

the advancement of science ; and it may be well assured that such sugges

to advance the public interests, as well as the mere incidental honour of the

claim the confidence of the State.
The interest of our nation in science has kept pace with the encourage

thankfully, with those of other countries ; remembering also that many of
our collections are little more than half a century old.

    We can never forget that the earliest, and every sense the first of the

scientific bodies of England, the Royal Society, derived, as we learn from
Bishop Sprat, its original and contemporary historian, its foundation
                                                                            e           this

honoured friend the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford in the government of Wad-

natural science ; and without for a moment undervaluing the mighty names
which do honour to Cambridge -- which do more, which do honour to En

gland and to our common nature -- we may claim in Oxford the distinction of
having nourished and sent forth the men who first laid the basis of the
greatest of the scientific Associations of the world.

    Here, then, The British Association gladly accepts the welcome now ten

dered to it within this illustrious University. It was cordially received fif

teen years ago, when  this Chair was worthily occupied,                                                                and far more               appro

the natural sciences, and of the researches which The British Association
has eminently encouraged ; and that the members of our Association will
look with kindness and respect at the venerable seats of ancient learning,

Iyour notice. Lest you should have forgotten my earlier mention of them,
repeat this statement ; and add again, that it is enough for me to be allowed
to call such men my friends. My own avocations in later years have with
drawn me, as I have said, from the active pursuits                                                                     of science ; yet it was

add my firm belief, that every advance in our knowledge of the natural
world will, if rightly directed by the spirit of true humility, and with a
prayer for God's blessing, advance us in our knowledge of Himself, and
will prepare us to receive His revelation of His will with profounder re

verence.

                             By Chr.
tural Philosophy in the University of Christiania.

In many chemical and physical researches where sulphuric acid takes such
a prominent part, it is of importance to determine with facility and accuracy
the quantity of sulphuric acid which the diluted acid contains. The specific
gravity seems here, as with other fluids diluted with water, to afford the

easiest method of arriving at this result, and it is therefore generally used.
Many experiments have been made to determine the specific gravity of sul
phuric acid at different degrees of dilution, and tables are published by

Dalton, Parkes, Ure, &c. Of these tables, that of Ure in his Dictionary of
Chemistry, is generally acknowledged to be the most correct ; but no certain
scale exists either for the accuracy of Ure's or the other tables, although the
importance of these tables, as well as the special difficulties that are insepa
rable from a precise determination of the specific gravity of sulphuric acid,

Iought long since to have demanded an examination of their accuracy. It is

this have endeavoured to do by calculating Ure's experiments according to
the method of the least squares, and thus to determine the probable error of
this series of experiments, and the most probable value of the specific gravity
of the sulphuric acid deduced from Ure's tables.

   The results of the experiments of Ure, which were all made at a tempera
ture of 60° Fahr.*, are collected in the appended Table where the specific

where * signifies the specific gravity, p the quantity of the acid free from

water (anhydrous) contained in one part of the mixture, and a, b, c and d
are constants, whose probable value should be determined. In the uncer

tainty of the relative goodness of the observations, I have by the calculation
given them all the same weight, and with this presumption found

If the values of A are squared and the sum of all these squares is taken,
it will be found equal to 0-003507, and consequently the mean error of this
series of experiments  is = 0-0060,      or the probable error of a single observa
tion = 0-O041.
This error appears to be more considerable than could reasonably be ex
pected, and the regularity with which the differences A proceed, seems to
show that five  terms of   the formula (1.) are
observations.   As the    greatest uncertainty      not sufficient to express all       the

  If the differences A in the fourth column of the above table are squared,

the sum of these squares will be found = 0*000102088, and consequently the
mean error is equal to 0-001244, and the probable error of a single observa

Iftion = 0-00084.

       all the uncertainties and difficulties these observations are subject to
Iare taken into consideration, it is hardly to be supposed that this error is

greater than the unavoidable errors of observations, and believe therefore
that the first five terms of the series formula 1 with sufficient accuracy express
this part of Ure's experiments.
  IAs in the meantime the logarithmic formula has some advantages in the

application, have as a comparison also calculated the same seventy obser
vations according to the formula

                        log * = a\s,                                      (2.)

and found the most probable value of the constant

            a = 0-3515280 + 0-0002102.

  The sum of the squares of errors is = 0*000052053, consequently the
mean error of log s = 0-0008685.

   The differences between the values of s observed and calculated according
to this formula, are written in the fifth column of the above table. The sum
of the squares of errors will be found =0*000618695; consequently the mean
error according to this formula = 0*00299, and the probable error of a single

observation 0*00202.
6 REPORT-- 1847.

   The accuracy of formula (2.) is therefore to the accuracy of formula 1 as
1 : 2'4.

   That the calculated values of the specific gravities according to my formula
do not differ much from the truth, or that the differences between the calcu
lated and observed values are within the limits of the errors of observations,
is plainly shown by a comparison between the results of the experiments of
Ure and Parkes, which experiments seem to have been executed with almost

the same accuracy. I have calculated both series of experiments by the
method of least squares according to the formula log » = a P, from P = 0

to P = 0*30, where P signifies the quantity of the first hydrate of sulphuric
acid (SO, + II40) which one part of the mixture contains.

    Parkes's experiments* gives from thirty-eight observations the most pro
bable value of

                                   a = 0-282437 ±0000318,

with a mean error of log t = 000037 ; and Ure's experiments give from thirty

observations     a = 0-285432 + 0000236,

with a mean error = 0*00034.
   As the acid used by Parkes, the weight of which in the mixture = P, had

a specific gravity of 1*8494, and that of Ure a specific gravity of 1-8485, and
as both series of experiments were executed at the same temperature,
60° Fahr., one might expect that the specific gravity, according to Parkes's
experiments for each value of P, would be somewhat greater than according
to Ure's. This is really the case for the higher degrees of concentration,
until P is about 0-68 ; but for a more diluted acid the above values of a
show that the specific gravity according to Parkes is less than according to
Ure. The difference between both is for P = 0-3 equal to 0-0025, Conse

quently three times greater than the probable error of a single observation

formerly found. It seems therefore that one of these series of experiments,

or perhaps both, are affected by a constant source of error.
   The average of Ure's and Parkes's experiments within the given limits are

                               a = 0-284737 ± 0*000214.
   It Is generally thought that sulphuric acid can only In four determined

proportions chemically combine with water, or in other words, there are only
four particular hydrates of sulphuric acid, viz. two equivalents of acid with one
equivalent of water (subhydrate), and one equivalent of dry acid with one,
two and three equivalents of water. Some chemists however have lately

believed that there is sufficient reason to suppose that there also exists a

combination of one equivalent of dry acid with six equivalents of water.

  If therefore one equivalent S03 cannot chemically combine with more than

six equivalents of water, and to a certain quantity of acid more water is poured
than is necessary to form this hydrate, so at length every equivalent of S03
will unite itself with six equivalents of water, and the fluid must consequently
be considered as a simple mixture of that hydrate (SO., + 6H20) with the
remaining water. In this case there is reason to expect that the specific
gravity of the mixture will be equal to the mean specific gravity of both its

the mean error in this same series of experiments is only = 0*00085. In
addition to this the constancy of the signs of A shows that the formula 4

cannot express the observations.

   It must therefore be considered as proved, that when sulphuric acid, pre
viously diluted by ever so large a quantity of water, is mixed with more water
of the same temperature, both fluids will act so on each other that the volume
of the mixture, wlten it has again attained tlie original temperature, becomes
less than the sum of the volumes of the mixed fluids.

   It is a well-known fact that when concentrated sulphuric acid (SO, H40)
is successively mixed with more and more water, the volume of the fluid
suffers a contraction, which reaches a maximum when 100 parts of the mix
                                                                                          of water, or

one   equivalent                (SO.,) and three                                  water.    It is how
                   of dry acid                                equivalents of
ever easy to show that every mixture of sulphuric acid and water, of what
ever degree of dilution, must present a similar maximum of contraction when
it is further mixed with more water. If, for instance, the acid already con

tains two atoms of water, and by degrees more water is added, the volume of
the mixture suffers its greatest contraction, not as formerly, when it contains
three atoms of water for one atom of dry acid, but when its composition is
one atom of dry acid and 7*5 atoms of water. Again, if the acid employed
contains three atoms of water, the maximum of contraction will arrive when
the mixture has eleven atoms of water. That this is the case by every degree
of dilution of the sulphuric acid will be seen in the following manner. Add
to a diluted acid which contains p' parts of dry acid, and which has the spe
cific gravity so much water that one part of the mixture contains p parts
of dry acid, then the mean specific gravity S, which the mixture would have
if no contraction had taken place, is equal to

                                  S=  1       1

Now, if s denotes the true specific gravity of the mixture, the contracted or

                                     c
true volume is equal to -- when the sum of the volumes of both components

Iof the mixture are put equal to 1 . As S is equal to s for the two extreme

values, p =p' and p = 0, and have already proved that * is greater than
S for all values o(p which are between the limits 0 and p', so it is clear that
--g must have a minimum, or in other words, that for every diluted sulphuric

ON THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OP SULPHURIC ACID.                                                                      13

error of the specific gravity * according to Table II. (A.), on which the cal

culation of the contractions of the volume is founded.

    Under all circumstances, according to the formulas (1.) and (3.), it may
be taken as a general rule, that when to sulphuric acid of different degrees of
dilution so much water is added that the volume of the mixture reaches its
maximum of contraction, then the value of this contraction can be repre
sented by the length of the ordinates of an equilateral hyperbola (the asymp
totes being parallel to the axes of the co-ordinates), when the number of
atoms of water, which in the acid employed are combined with 1 atom of dry
acid, is taken as the abscissae.

   As it must constantly be taken as a rule that heat is evolved by a dimi
nution or contraction of volume of a body, and it is known that by mixing
an already much diluted sulphuric acid with more water a sensible quantity
of heat is evolved, it was natural to believe that the heat so produced stood
in some relation to the decrease of the volume. Such a relation in the mean

time has not been proved, and chemists have denied the possibility of any
such direct relation between the contraction and the heat evolved, for the
reason that there are other bodies, for instance, alcohol of certain degrees of
dilution, which by mixing with water increase in volume instead of decreasing,
and yet produce heat. But it appears to me that this objection is not deci

sive. It cannot well be said that the production of heat is a direct or imme
diate effect of the change of the volume, as it would certainly be a paradox

that an extension and a contraction of volume should have just the same
effect ; but more correctly it may be supposed that the change of the volume
as well as the production of heat are both the effects of a higher cause,
namely, the endeavours of the chemical or molecular forces to obtain a new
state of equilibrium; and as the value of both these effects must be in pro
portion to the intensity of the acting force, it is not improbable that the
increase of volume as well as the contraction may be expressed as a function

of the heat evolved, or the contrary.
   The consideration that the molecules of the fluid, when the volume of the

mixture has reached its minimum, must be supposed to be most symmetri
cally arranged, and to have obtained a stable equilibrium, which they even
with a certain inertia try to retain, because the volume in the neighbour
hood of its minimum is subject only to excessively slow change upon the
addition of   m--otrheiswactoenrs, idienraittsionp,ropinortcioomn btoinatthieonsuwmithofthethefovlloolwuminegs   of the
mixed parts,                                                                                                    experi
ment of Parkes, induced me several years since to endeavour to find a path
to discover the relation between the change of the volume and the heat
evolved, which at length, at least so far as sulphuric acid is concerned,

appears to have led to a satisfactory answer to the question.

   Parkes has tried several experiments of the temperature which is produced

when concentrated sulphuric acid and water are mixed in several propor
tions. He found that when to a great quantity of water greater and greater
quantities of acid were added by degrees, the temperature of the mixture
increased to a certain maximum, and decreased again with the further addi
tion of acid. This maximum temperature (216° F.) took place when the
quantity of water and acid was in the proportion of 10 : 25, consequently

when the mixture contained 1 equivalent dry acid and 3 equivalents
water, or it occurred with the same degree of dilution as the maximum of
contraction.

   By his important thermo-chemical experiments Hess has endeavoured to
show, that when the several hydrates of sulphuric acid SO, HsO, S03 2H20,
SO33H5O, 4c. are mixed with an excess of water, then the quantities of heat
14 nEPOHT-- 1847-

evolved by the combination of acid and water (when this heat is not in
creased by a new addition of water) are in the same proportion to each other
as the numbers 10 : G : 4 : 3 : 2 ; or, with the exception of the first hydrate,
which has the relative number 10 instead of 12, the heat produoed is in
inverse proportion to the number of atoms of water in the acid employed.
But this is precisely the same rule which we have discovered for the value of
the maximum of contraction for the corresponding hydrates. In order to
make a comparison between the value of the contraction and the quantity of
heat observed by Hess, 1 have chosen that series of experiments whiob he
himself seems to regard as the most complete and most accurate. The de»
termination of the heat evolved seems yet to be embarrassed with so great
difficulties, that the several series of experiments, as well by one and the
same as by different observers, at least as regards the absolute quantity of

heat, have given very different results.

   Hess has thus found *, that when to an acid, of the composition stated
below, an addition of water is given to that extent that the heat evolved is
not further increased, then the heat produced by one atom of dry sulphurio
acid is equal to the numbers in the 3rd column of the following table.

The mean error in this series of experiments is consequently equal to 4*876,
and the most probable error of a single observation -- 3' 154.
Regarding the heat evolved by one atom of concentrated acid (SO' + H,,0),
for which Hess in another series of experiments has found the value to be
229'41, this acid should, if it followed the same law as the other hydrates,
produce six portions of heat or 278*41, and the difference between the ob
served and calculated value would be equal to -- 59*0. Hess supposes there
fore that it only produces 5 portions of heat, or 232*01 , and the same difference
Ifwill only be -- 2*50.
        now we suppose that the diffused heat is proportionate to the maximum
of contraction of an acid, which in one atom

from which we obtain m! = 4034*14 + 86*49, and the probable error of a
single observation 4-01.

   As the probable error in these two cases is very slightly different from the
uncertainty of the values of the quantities of heat calculated according to
the hypothesis of Hess, it may be supposed with the same degree of proba
bility, that the heat evolved by a certain hydrate of sulphuric acid on the
addition of an excess of water is proportionate to the maximum of con
traction of the same hydrates; or that both are inversely proportionate to
the number of atoms of water which the aoid employed contains combined
with one atom of pure acid.

   This law at least appears to hold good for the larger degrees of dilution.
Regarding the acid S03 HsO, Hess supposes, as previously stated, that it
16 REPORT 1847-

with an excess of water diffuses only five portions of heat instead of, as in the
above law, six. We have previously seen that the maximum of contraction
for the more concentrated acid is also greater than, according to that law, it

should be.
For such a discontinuity in the law which determines the quantity of heat
it is difficult to see any grounds, and, as we previously have shown (Table V.),
Ifit does not exist in the maxima of contractions, as these with sufficient accu
racy can be calculated     by formula (5.).            now the quantity of heat  in

Table VIII. is calculated  according to the same formula

it will be seen that these values, even for the concentrated sulphuric acid,
only slightly differ from the observed.         The values of a and b, which
agree with all the observations in Table       VIII., are the following :--   best

   The probable error of a single observation according to this formula
will only be 2-109, whilst according to the hypothesis of Hess it is equal

to 3-154.

   It is worthy of observation, that the constants b and ft in the formula? (1 3.)
and (5.) are determined with the same accuracy by the observations of con

tractions as by those of the heat evolved, whilst the constants a and a. are
much more accurately determined by the latter than by the former. This

Ifis seen by comparing the equations (14.) and (6.).

      therefore it is considered as proved that the maximum of contraction
as well as the production of heat by the addition of an excess of water
can be expressed as functions of the atomistic constitution of the acid em-

-ployed by help of the 'formula? (5.) or (13.), that consequently C =         ft ~ ,

The experiments connected with this investigation have been extended over
a period of seven years ; they have been made at every season of the year ;
and the locality in which they have been carried on has been changed from
the south-western extremity of the kingdom to the neighbourhood of the

metropolis.

Although there are many important points which remain open for inves
            and others, which

of their
                               more minute research, I believe
to lay before this meeting o.f the British Association a series of important
facts connected with the processes of germination and vegetable growth, as

affected by solar radiations.                         reports  has been the " Influence of

   The title heading each of my former
Light, &c." I have now changed that form of expression and adopted the
above. My reasons for this are, that much confusion has arisen from our
habit of referring all the effects observed in the processes of vegetation to the
agency of light, whereas it appears that some agencies which are not lumi
nous materially influence the phenomena of vegetable vitality.
Without entering into any discussion in this place on the probable ex
istence, or otherwise, of a principle distinct from light and heat in the sun's
rajs, to which to refer the curious chemical changes produced by solar influ
ence, it will be sufficient to admit the existence of three distinct classes of

phenomena, which cannot, I think, be disputed.

   These are luminous influence, calorific power, and chemical excitation.
   The problem which these researches were directed to solve, was the pro
portion and kind of influence exerted by light, heat and actinism -- as the

principle   supposed   to be active               in  producing the chemical phaenomena     of  the
solar rays   has been                            the  various stages of vegetable growth.
                       called -- in

The means we have of separating these phaenomena from each other are
not very perfect ; indeed, in the present state of our knowledge, it is impos
Ifsible to have evidence of the operations of either light, heat or actinism ab
solutely separated from each other.                   we use the prismatic spectrum, we
have over every portion of it a mixture of effects. Even in the mean yellow,
or most luminous ray, we have a considerable amount of thermic action, and,
under some circumstances, evidence of chemical power. In the violet rays,

which have been particularly distinguished as chemical rays, we have light
and heat ; and in the calorific rays we have decided proof of both luminous
and actinic power. In the experiments which have been made with the pris

matic   sapepcatrrtuimcu, lawr erayha--vethaint  fact no certainty that the results stated  to be
due to                                           ray being regarded as the representative
                                                                                             of a
particular phenomenon -- are not the combined effect of the three forces.
The same objections apply to absorbent media, but the amount of each
influence is readily determined ; and we are therefore enabled to refer any

particular result to a tolerably well-defined agency.

  All the experiments recorded in this report have been made under the
action of those radiations which have permeated variously coloured media,
such as tinted glass and coloured transparent fluids. It is not sufficient to state
that a yellow, red, or blue glass or fluid was employed, as it by no means
follows that these media are permeated only by the rays corresponding in
colour, or by the influences due to a given order of refrangibility.
The difficulties which oppose themselves to experiments made with coloured
media have been strong- ly- felt by- other observers. Dr. Daubeny says in his
                                                                                      c

the effect of light upon plants corresponds with its illuminating, rather than
with its chemical, or calorific influence ; and to waive the more difficult in

quiry, whether its operation upon the vegetable kingdom exactly keeps pace
with the increase of its own intensity."
   In my previous reports to the British Association          in         1842 and  1844,  I have

stated the kind of examination to which I then subjected each coloured
                                                              to time presented themselves,

have convinced me of the necessity of a still                 more close examination
order in which radiant principles permeate                    the media employed.         I have

therefore in every case examined with all care the illuminating, calorific and
chemical effects of the solar rays which have passed the media employed.
The amount of light has been determined by measuring off the prismatic
rays which pass the screen. This is preferable to any system of measuring
which depends upon the power of the eye to appreciate either light or shadow.

influences of the solar rays as quite independent of the colour of the ray with
which they may be associated, but in these experiments on plants, it appears
to mc, we can only deal satisfactorily with the total amount of radiant heat which
is active under the conditions of the experiment, the terrestrial heat being

in all comparative experiments the same.

   It has indeed been shown by Dr. James Stark (Philosophical Transactions,

vol. exxiv. 1 833), by direct experiment, and indirectly by other observers, that
colour exerts a very powerful influence on the conduction, radiation and
permeation of heat.

   The determination of the chemical principle of the solar rays, or actinism,

was satisfied with using tolerably sensitive chloridated photographic papers for

the same purpose.

   The experience of many years enables me now to state that we are not ac
quainted with any transparent medium which is absolutely opake to actinism.
Although nitrate of silver, or indeed any of the salts of silver remain unchanged
behind yellow glasses and fluids, yet chlorophyl is deoxidized and turned
yellow by the chemical principle which is enabled to permeate them. Upon
all those bodies on which light exerts a direct aud determinate influence, as
    INFLUENCE OP SOLAR BAYS ON THE GROWTH OP PLANTS. 19

upon the organized compounds, we find that the changes due to actinic power
are but slightly interfered with, whereas upon all those inorganic bodies which

undergo a change when exposed to the solar chemical radiations, that change

being entirely due to            actinism, light acts as a  pfoorwceesr--fullliyghitntaenrfderainctginisamgen--t.
The conditions under             which these antagonistic

operate upon each other are unknown to us, but it is certain that every com
bination of an inorganic salt with an organic body presents a different scale
of action.

    Nitrate of silver uncombined with organic matter undergoes no change by
the influence of any portion of the solar spectrum, or of white light ; spread
it on paper, or combine it with gum or gelatine, and all that portion of the

spectrum above the green ray blackens it ; and if we combine this salt with

unstable organic compounds, the blackening is found to take place, eventually,
under every spectral ray. The other salts of silver, and metallic salts in
general, are affected in precisely the same manner. From a knowledge of
these facts it became evident that some means must be devised for ascertaining,
as correctly as possible, the entire quantity of this chemical principle passing
Iany particular media, without which knowledge any result would be almost
valueless. In every instance                   have therefore determined the influence of

the modified radiations ; first, upon the most sensitive silver salts ; secondly,
upon organic bodies, as the coloured juices of leaves and flowers, and on
                                               combinations of the organic and inorganic
chlorophyl;       Inandthisthwirdayly,I  upon  arrived at a degree of correctness which has
materials.                               have

not been hitherto reached, and the results of the experiments have conse

quently a higher value.

   I have repeatedly stated that seeds would not germinate under the influence
of light deprived of that principle on which chemical change depends. This
statement has been objected to by Dr.          Gardner (American Journal of Science,
Jan. 1844, vol. xlvi.) on the results           of some experiments tried by him in
1840 in Virginia with the prismatic
                                               rays themselves. It however unfortu
nately happens that we are not furnished with any knowledge of the degree

of stability which he was enabled to ensure for the prismatic rays with his
heliostat Dr. Gardner's researches corroborating those of Dr. Draper, are

Iwithout doubt valuable, but for the reasons which I have already given,
must contend that we do not secure a separate action of light and actinism
Iby the prism so effectually as by the use of absorbent media.
                                                                                 shall have

to mention a modification of my views as to the production of chlorophyl ; but
lam still convinced, after the experience of many years, that light is injurious
Ito germination, and that Dr. Gardner's experiments must have been decep

tive. Indeed cannot do better than quote the remarks of Mr. R. Harkness
                           xxv.  N. S.                     reply to Dr. Gardner
"--(PhilW. Meakgn.owvo,l.  both  from    p.340, 1844) in    of Ingenhousz and    on this point :

well as from daily experience, that the absence of solar light is one of the
conditions almost necessary for the germination of seed, and consequently
we should not expect that ray in which the maximum of light is found to
facilitate germination, but on the contrary, as in Mr. Hunt's experiments,

to  "reTtahrids,  it.
                  however,
                                 is not the only objection to which this statement is liable,
for if the yellow ray be the operating cause by which carbonic acid is decom
posed (as stated by Dr. Gardner) and chlorophyl produced, we should also
expect that, so far from assisting in germination, it would exercise a highly
injurious influence. We know that the presence of oxygen is necessary for
the vegetation of seeds, and also that this oxygen is absorbed, and by uniting
with a portion of the carbon of the seed reappears in the form of carbonic

                                                                          c2

acid, a process the opposite of that which takes place when chlorophyl is
produced. This change is required in order that the amylaceous principle
in the seed may be rendered sufficiently soluble for the support of the germ,
previous to its being able to obtain the requisite nutriment from the soil ; so

that, if the decomposition of carbonic acid be owing to the yellow ray, this
same ray ought to be the last to produce any effect on the germination of seeds."
   As it                                            of error may exist in my expe
riments,  is  however possible that some source     apparatus employed by me, and
              shall distinctly state every form of

   In the first place shall record my experiments on germination.
   It became important to determine if any effect was produced
light. For the purpose of ascertaining this a quantity of common cress (Le-
pidium sativum) and turnip-seed (Brassica napus) was placed upon moist
earth and very lightly covered with fine sand ; one half was screened from the
light by a blackened board, and the other freely exposed. Under the shaded
halt the germination was between two and three days in advance of the

exposed portion.
   This experiment was repeated, using a glass trough containing a weak so

lution of bichromate of potash half an inch in thickness over the illuminated
portion. This solution admitted the permeation of 87 parts of the luminous
rays, 92 of the calorific rays, and 27 of the chemical rays. The object in

this instance was to ascertain if any greater retardation was produced by the

Iluminous rays, from which the chemical principle was to a considerable extent

removed, than by pure white light, which it will be borne in mind propose
to regard as a compound of 100 parts of each, light, heat and actinism. The
result was that the seed under the influence of this yellow medium did not
germinate until five days after the seeds in the dark part of the box.

   Upon substituting a solution of sulphate of chromium and potash which
admitted the permeation of 85 parts of light, 92 parts of heat, and only 7 of
actinism, the germination was prevented entirely in four experiments ; and in
the fifth, ten days after the seeds in the dark had germinated, half a dozen
of seeds of cress showed symptoms of germination. These experiments were
many times repeated and always with similar results. We have thus satis
factory evidence that light deprived of the principle or power of chemical
action arrests the development of the plant, by preventing the vitality of the

germ from manifesting itself.
Although the visible sign of germination is the process of chemical com
bination of the carbon with oxygen and hydrogen, yet the power influ
encing this change is of   an occult character,
some external excitation,                           though   evidently dependent on

a box was prepared, in which was placed moist flannel, and this was kept wet
by an under layer of water. One half could be completely screened from
the light, and the other half exposed to any influence which it was thought

desirable to try.
The luminous rays were obstructed by the interposition of a series of blue
          and by solutions of sulphate of copper,    or ammoniate   of

   The trough of sulphate of copper obstructed more heat but admitted the
passage of a larger quantity of light. It gave on examination, light 60,
heat 54, and actinism 93 parts.

   The solution of ammoniate of copper was of so deep a colour that only 25
parts of light passed and 48 of heat, whilst from 93 to 95 of actinism

    Common cress (Lepidium sativum), Mignionette (Reseda odorata), Ten-
week Stocks (Mathiola incana) and Minor Convolvulus, were placed on the
moist flannel, and the tested glass frame being placed over the undarkened
half, the box was exposed to sunshine in warm room. The cress under
the actinic influence exhibited signs of germination within twenty-four hours,

but no change was observable beyond a swelling of the seed from the
absorption of water over that portion in darkness on the second day all the

on moist flannel. In every experiment the seed germinated in much less

extended below it. The result was, that obtained the most satisfactory evi
dence, that under the influence of the rays which passed the blue glasses,

germination was set up at a depth below the surface, at which under the or
dinary conditions did not take place. The common cress, placed an inch
below a somewhat clayey soil, germinated with difficulty under the ordinaryit
conditions, but the influence of the actinic radiations was such that germina
tion was but slightly retarded. Various other seeds were tried, as,

nation were not so great. These experiments were however very satisfactory,
as, being enabled to regulate with considerable nicety the relative propor
tions of light and actinism, they afforded the means of ascertaining the retarda
ing influence of the luminous power. After great number of experiments,

  became evident, that as the relative quantity of the luminous principle was
increased, so was the influence of the chemical radiations diminished. In
using the ammoniate of copper, as stated, the germination of all the seeds
tried became more rapid and that this was not the mere influence of shading

          was evident from the fact, that germination under the influence of the deepest
          coloured solution of the ammoniate of copper, provided it was transparent,

          was always more rapid than in the dark.

            It is evident therefore, that this first spring of vitality is due to some power
          or principle of solar origin, which is very broadly distinguished from the lu
          minous or colour-giving principle. The manner in which this power is exerted

          on seed beneath the soil is not clear to us ; we know not if it is a mere dis

Coloured solutions were employed, and their results compared with similar

employed were the cress, ten-week stocks, and Venus's looking-glass. An

Plants growing in the shade in like manner contain more water than those
growing in full sunshine, hence we cannot infer that anything more than the
Ideprivation of light influences the condition of the plants in these experi
ments.  have ascertained that quite as great a difference exists in the water
found in plants growing in artificial shade, and plants of the same class grow
ing unsheltered, under the ordinary conditions of sunshine. It is therefore
evident that all those experiments which have been made on the increase
of grass crops by littering the fields with boughs of trees and the like, are

liable to the error alluded to ; and it is very questionable if the increased
product of an acre is not principally due to water, rather than to any car
bonaceous product, consequently the increase of the nutritive property is not
in the ratio of the increase of weight.
By continuing however the experiment for a longer time under the influ
Iences already described, we do learn that the actinic radiations exert a power
on the plant, which, although have previously described    a iIt,  shall particu

larly call attention to this place.in

  It frequently happens, when the media employed cut off         large quantity
of light and admit the actinic principle freely, that no formation of leaves
takes place after the development of the plumule or first leaf-bud the young
stem instead of solidifiying remains soft, and, without increasing in diameter,;

continues to elongate until at last it attains to an enormous length. Nothing

like this occurs under the influence of either light or heat. It would appear
that this abnormal condition is due to the excitement of the actinic rays, acting
possibly with great power upon the living principle in the roots, by which the
elaboration of some organizable matter is produced, which they supply as food
to the stem ; but, as there is but little power to decompose carbonic acid, there
is not the necessary supply of carbon to give rise to those stems and leaves
which naturally form upon the primitive stem.
That this is something like a true explanation is further proved by the

fact, that in the practice of planting shoots the use of blue media is highly
advantageous. It appears to increase the tendency to the development of
            it is satisfactory to learn that  bsloumeeglgaasrsdeesnteorsaidhaivne,thweit"hosutrtikainngy
roots, and  of the cause, employed cobalt
knowledge
of cuttings." Dr. Lindley (Theory of Horticulture, p. 215), referring to the
experiments of Dr. Daubeny, seems disposed to regard the effects described as
due to the absence of light merely ; it is however evident that the chemical
principle of the solar beam materially assists in the development of new roots
from cuttings. The formation of woody fibre depending on the secretion of

carbon from the carbonic acid absorbed by the leaves, and decomposed, by
some functional power of the plant, under the influence of external excitement,

it has ever been considered important to determine if this was due to the lu
minous rays or to any others.
   The experiments of Sennebier (Mem. de Phys. Chim. torn. ii. p. 55) went

to prove that plants decomposed the carbonic acid they absorbed by the

leaves much more readily under the influence of the violet rays than any

others ; and in my early experiments I thought I had proved the correctness

of Sennebier's position. Dr. Daubeny in England and Dr. Gardner in Ame
rica have repeated the experiments, and they both conclude from their results
that the decomposition of the carbpnic acid increases with the increase of
                                              influence of
light, and that it is more rapid  under  the                the yellow                                     ray than any
other. The natural inference       from  the   experiments                                                 have already
                                                             which I
described, in which it is shown that the larger quantity of woody matter is
found in those plants which have had the largest amount of light, is, that
light is essential to the formation of woody fibre.
   Numerous experiments have been made by placing the leaves of plants in
water containing carbonic acid, and then subjecting them to the influence of
the modified radiations after permeation of coloured media. Although the
quantity of carbonic acid decomposed, or of oxygen liberated by the plant is
very different, for the same plant, under different conditions of radiation, it

is evident that under any circumstances where light is admitted, the de
composition of the carbonic acid is effected in some cases slowly, in some with

rapidity.
  IThis power of decomposing carbonic acid under the influence of the solar

rays is a function due to some vital principle ; for have again and again

et broyfie ne donne plus de trace d'oxygene quand on 1'expose au soleil dans

more oxygen is given off from a growing plant than from a branch broken
from the plant ; and that still less is given off" from the leaves cut from the
branch than when they are attached to it.
   Different plants not only decompose carbonic acid in different rates, but
they exhibit greater or less sensibility to luminous influence. This will be

apparent from the following results. The coloured media used were the same

It will be seen from these results that the common cabbage-leaves give
more gas under the influence of the luminous rays than the others, but
much less under the influence of the actinic principle, combined as it is
with 51 per cent, of light. On the contrary, the ten-week stocks and the
sage give less gas than either the cabbage or the mint under luminous influ
ence ; but relatively a much greater proportion under the influence of the che
I Imical and luminous rays combined.
                                             have made, every reason to
      have, from numerous experiments which
believe that it will be found that there is as great a difference between the

effects produced on growing plants by the prismatic rays, as we know to be

the case on photographic preparations ; the maximum effect altering, per- »
Ihaps, for every variety of plant.

   The conclusions am induced to draw from these experiments are, that
the luminous principle of the sun's rays is essential to enable the plants to
effect the decomposition of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere and form

the woody structure ; that some plants require more light than others to
effect this decomposition ; as, for instance, we find the sage and ten-week
stocks decomposing carbonic acid with less light than the cabbage or the
mint; and it would appear that the increase of the luminous excitement be

yond a certain point does not produce a corresponding increase in the quan
tity of gas liberated from the leaves of these plants. We may infer from all
26 REPORT 1847-

the results obtained and described in this and former reports, that the de
composition of the carbonic acid by plants under the agency of light is not a

simple chemical operation, as has been supposed by some, effected by the
chlorophyl, but the result of an exertion of the vital principle of the growing
plant, which requires the external stimulus of light to call it into action.

   A great number of experiments have been made with the prismatic rays,
hoping to be enabled to settle a point on which an American philosopher

and myself are at issue, this gentleman having published results the very

opposite to those which I have obtained and published. The method pur

sued has been to place leaves in small tubes filled with water impregnated
with carbonic acid, and to place these tubes across the rays formed by a very
Ifexcellent flint-glass prism. The results have varied with every experiment.

    we place a small sprig covered with leaves in the tube, we get the largest
quantity of gas iu one ray ; if we remove the leaves from the branch, we

shall then get the most gas under another ray. No two plants, as far as I
am aware, give the same quantity of oxygen, in the same time, under the in
fluence of the same ray, and the age of the plant most materially alters all
the effects ; the same plant at one age giving evidence of being excited most
readily by the blue rays, and at another by the yellow or the red rays. More

over, I am satisfied that by removing a member, whether a branch or a leaf,
from the plant, we give a shock to the living system, which prevents our
obtaining any result which shall actually represent the true conditions of the
growing plant. On this point the experiments of Matteucci (Cimento, Juillet
et Aout, 1846) are most satisfactory.
   In all experiments on plants, it must be borne in mind that we are dealing

with an organized body endowed with peculiar vital functions. As these are
ever liable to derangement from numerous causes which are almost beyond
the reach of our examination, it is only by a great number of experiments

Ithat anything like an approximation to the truth can be arrived at As
have pointed out, anything which at all interferes with the functional powers
of the growing plant, materially alters all the conditions which we are desirous

of examining ; hence I am perfectly satisfied that all the experiments made
with leaves in tubes of water exposed to the prismatic rays are fallacious, and
do not at all represent the powers of the plant to which the leaves belong.
It is however evident, from a careful comparison of all the results obtained,

that light, as distinguished from lieal and actinism, is the principle on which

the secretion of carbon and the evolution of oxygen by plants depend.
   Decandolle succeeded in producing the green colour of leaves by the strong
light of lamps, which we know give out a much larger quantity of yellow
rays than any others; consequently it was inferred that light was necessary
to the production of chlorophyl. Dr. Daubcny however obtained no result
from the action of incandescent lime, which emits a much purer white light,

producing also chemical effects in a marked manner.
Dr. Lindley refers the formation of the colouring matter of leaves to the
"effect of decomposing       carbonic acid
of light, the intensity of  colour being in  agnedneerxahl a"liinngporoxpyogretnio"nbtyo  the  agency

posing cause, that is to say, to light." This view is adopted also by Mac-
quart, from whom indeed Dr. Lindley takes it (Theory of Horticulture,
p. 86). More recently Dr. Gardner has published a memoir ' On the Action
of Yellow Light in producing the Green       Colour    of   Plants,'  &c. (the Ameri
can Journal of Science, vol. xlvi. January     1844),        which    he contends that

chlorophyl in leaves. It is evident from the statement of results as given by

as infer, by the mean red. These experiments were made with great care,

found that every variety of plant employed appeared to be influenced by dif
ferent rays. Cress and mustard became green the most rapidly in the green

ray, mignionette in the yellow, and peas in the blue. It must be however
observed that the influence was always most decided between the limits of the
mean orange and the mean blue ray, and that it took much longer to green

    Such are the results
                          I
Iing that objections have been urged against the use of coloured media in

experiments of this class, am, after many years' experience, convinced that
there is no other way of obtaining correct results. All the colours of the
spectrum are merely modifications of the intensity of luminous power, and it

has been shown that light, heat and chemical action, or actinism, are common
to every ray, the difference being only proportional. Therefore, because an

effect is produced in the yellow ray, we have no evidence that light alone is
the agent; it may be due to the combined influence of light and the other
principles. We have the means of analysing with great correctness the per
meability of coloured media, and we can with considerable facility, by in
creasing the colour or thickness of a fluid medium, produce almost any order
of radiation, which may be maintained for days or months in a constant cha

racter. A yellow medium does not imply the use of a yellow light, or a red
one the passage of red rays only ; but a well-regulated yellow medium
will give the most li^ht with the least quantity of actinism, and a blue one
the largest amount of actinism with the least quantity of light. It will now

be understood that I place more confidence in the results obtained under

coloured media than any which can be obtained with the prismatic spectrum

upon growing plants.
We have seen that light is required for the secretion of carbon and the
liberation of oxygen ; we know that the green colour of plants depends upon
solar agency ; but unless we can suppose light to be at one and the same time
decomposing carbonic acid and composing carbon, oxygen and hydrogen in
the form of the waxy matter chlorophyl, which is not according to the usual
order of natural phenomena, we must look for information beyond that
Iafforded us by the experiments named. Indeed, under a solution of bichro

mate of potash, and under a full yeUo\v,glass, have had plants growing,
28 REPORT 1847-

which, if not etiolated, were very deficient of greenness. This has several
times occurred under a glass which cut off seventy-five per cent, of actinism,
and admitted ninety-five per cent, of light. Again, behind a cobalt blue
glass admitting eighty of actinism and not more than twenty per cent, of light,
plants have been quite as much etiolated. It is clear, therefore, that the for
mation of chlorophyl is not directly dependent upon either light or actinism

regarded as isolated principles.

   In the greater number of ray experiments with the prismatic spectrum,
the greening of the plant has commenced over the space occupied by the
green rays ; and, under green glasses, which admitted all the rays above
the orange ray, plants have invariably grown of a very green colour. The
influence of the solar rays upon the green colouring matter of leaves removed
by infusion and pressure, extends with tolerable uniformity over every ray
of the spectrum, from the red to the violet (Sir John Herschel, 'On the Action
of the Rays of the Solar Spectrum on Vegetable Colours,' Phil. Trans., vol.
exxxiii.). In this case the green colour is however destroyed, and a ruddy
brown of the same character as the brown of the leaf in autumn, is produced.

This change appears to be due to light rather than actinism, and presents
a curious                                                          Here we

gous to the decomposition of carbonic acid by the living plant. It is difficult,
however, to apply experiments made with dead vegetable matter to matter

possessing the principle of life. I am led to infer from the facts, that plants
will grow of a pale green colour under the influence of strong light (as
admitted through yellow glass), and also under the radiations which permeate
deep blue glass (actinic), whilst the heat radiations which pass glass coloured
with oxide of gold, and very lightly smoked glass, have a constant tendency
to produce a certain degree of ruddy brownness, even in healthy green plants ;
and that chlorophyl is not formed by the agency of either of those principles
alone, but that it results from the combined influence of light and actinism.
In every experiment made with media which cut off the heat rays, but which
admit the luminous and actinic rays, the plants grow of a lively green ; and
the extracted green of their leaves is preserved without change much longer
than under any other conditions. To produce chlorophyl, a recombination

combined influences of light and actinism in exciting one of those mysterious
functions of plants which excite the admiration, but elude the curiosity, of

eveIryhavveegeptraebvleioupshlyysisotlaotgeidst. that I have rarely succeeded in getting plants to

flower under the influence of any of the media which cut off those rays
usually termed the calorific rays. For instance, under intense yellow, deep
blue, or very dark green glasses, however carefully the plants may have been
attended to, there was seldom any evidence of the exertion of their reproduc
tive functions. This evidently arises from the necessity of some check upon
the chemical actions which depend on light and actinism, and which exhaust
the elements in the formation of wood and vegetable juices which are neces
sary for the production of those principles which go to the preservation of
the species. By removing plants when in a healthy condition from the in
fluences of isolated light or actinism to a situation where they may be exposed
to the effects of those heat radiations which are of the least refrangible class,
flowers and seed are rapidly produced.

   This is not an effect of heat (quoad heat), since the same temperature may

be maintained under all the circumstances, yet if the red rays are obstructed,
flowers will not form. It is therefore evident that this very remarkable pro
perty must depend upon some function peculiar to this class of rays. The
researches of Sir John Herschel, Dr. Draper, M. Claudet and myself on

the action of the rays of the spectrum on photographic preparations, must
materially assist us in explaining this phenomenon.

   Sir John Herschel (Philosophical Transactions, vol. cxxxi. 184-0) has
shown that the red rays in some cases exalt the oxidation of a silver salt ;
that they exert a protective power, and even prevent the darkening of paper
covered with chloride of silver under the influence of diffused light (Report

of ItnhethBeritPishhilosAospsohciciaatlioMna, g1a8z3in9e),. vol. xvi. N. S. p. 272-3, I have described

several experiments, which prove not merely the protecting power of this
red ray, but a power of producing the closer combination of the chemical
elements of a compound exposed to its influence. More recently Dr. Draper
(Philosophical Magazine, 1846), and M. Claudet, who communicated his
experiments to the Meeting of the British Association at Oxford, an abstract
of which appears in the present volume, have shown that this class of rays
does not merely protect the chemical compound from any change, but that
after the sun's rays have produced a change, they have the power of again
restoring the compound to its original condition.

    All these experiments have been repeated with many modifications, and
particularly the influence of this class of rays on growing and dead vegetable
matter has been particularly observed.

    Leaves inspire carbonic acid and give out oxygen. It has been shown by
Priestley, Scheele, and Ingenhousz, that flowers consume much more oxygen
than any other part of the growing plant. Saussure has shown that flowers
will not be developed without oxygen ; that, so far from giving out oxygen
when exposed to sunshine in larger quantities, as leaves do, they consume even
more oxygen than before. Here we find the process which has brought the
plant to this stage of growth is reversed, and in place of the decomposition
which is effected by light and actinism, we have a process of reoxidation or of
a close assimilation of elements, precisely analogous to that which we detect
upon the Daguerreotype plate and on photographic papers under the influ
ence of the red rays.

    The results to which my experiments have led me, are --
    1 st. Light prevents the germination of seeds.
    2nd. Actinism quickens germination.
    3rd. Light acts to effect the decomposition of carbonic acid by the growing
 plant.
    4-th. Actinism and light are essential to the formation of the colouring
 matter of leaves.
    5th. Light and actinism, independent of the calorific rays, prevent the
development of the reproductive organs of plants.
    6th. The heat radiations corresponding with the extreme red rays of the
spectrum facilitate the flowering of plants and the perfecting of their repro

Iductive principles.

       have been led to detect some very remarkable differences in the compo
 sition of the solar rays by frequently examining the condition of the solar
 radiations, according to the plan described at the commencement of this
 Report, for the purpose of ascertaining as nearly as possible the exact con
 ditions in which the luminous, actinic, and calorific principles exist. During
 the year 1846 and the commencement of 1847, being engaged in selecting a
 glass for the glazing of the great Palm House in the Royal Botanic Gardens
30 REPORT-- 1847-

at Kew, of which sonic account appears in this Volume, this examination has
been more exact and continuous.

   In the spring I find the actinic principle the most active, and, as compared

with light and heat, in very considerable excess.
   As the summer advances, the quantity of light and heat increases relatively

to the actinic principle, in a very great degree.
    In the autumn, light and actinism both diminish, and the calorific radi

ations are, relatively to them, by far the most extensive.

   It should be again explained, that by light I mean to express all those rays
of the spectrum which are visible to a perfectly-formed human eye ; by

actinic principle, the principle to which the phenomenon of chemical change
under solar influence belongs ; and by calorific radiations, not merely those
effects which are traceable by any thermometric instruments, but also those
which we can detect by the protection from change, produced by a class of
rays existing near the point of maximum heat in the spectrum.

    These discoveries bear most strikingly upon all my experiments ; and, at
the same time as they appear to confirm in a most satisfactory manner the
conclusions to which my results have led me, they point to an order in the
natural arrangement which is singularly interesting.

   In the spring, when seeds germinate and young vegetation awakes from
the repose of winter, we find an excess of that principle which imparts the
required stimulus ; in the summer, this exciting agent is counterbalanced
by another possessing different powers, upon the exercise of which the struc
tural formation of the plant depends; and in the autumnal season these are
checked by a mysterious agency, which we can scarcely recognise as heat,
although connected with thermic manifestations, UDon which appears to
depend the development of the flower and the perfection of the seed.

 In this Report some progress has been made ; a number of authors and re

 cords of various sorts have been collated, and extracts made. Tabular forms
 and maps have been contrived for the more convenient classification and
 arrangement of the facts recorded, having regard to their import and the
degree of scientific credence and value that may be attached to the statements
of the various authorities.

   It has been found indispensable to arrange these facts with reference to
theoretic views, for the sake of perspicuity. The author trusts he will be

enabled to present his Report complete to the next meeting of the British
Association. Meanwhile he cannot avoid again expressing his earnest desire
that the experiments upon the modulus of elasticity of rocks, &tu, recom
mended by the Committee of Section C. at the Southampton Meeting to be
made, should be proceeded with; such experiments constituting the most
important of all data demanded for the further prosecution of earthquake
dynamics, and the means without which the latest researches upon this sub
ject are incapable of being tested.

On the Primitive Inhabitants of Scandinavia. By Professor Nilsson
   of Lund. Translated from the Swedish by Dr. Norton Shaw.

have endeavoured to explain that the southern part of the country has
from a very remote period been undergoing a gradual depression of the

Isurface, while the northern has undergone a corresponding rise of the same;

and from zoological data have sought to prove that the southern parts of
Sweden were formerly connected with Denmark and Germany. The northern
parts of the Scandinavian peninsula were, on the contrary, at the same time
in a great measure covered by the sea. This was probably the appearance
of the country subsequent to the disturbances of nature that scattered the

diluvial strata over its surface. It may be readily perceived that at a time
when southern Sweden or Scania was connected with northern Germany,
and the northern parts of the country were still under water, that the
former, or Scania, must have received its first postdiluvian flora from the
south, or from Germany. With the gradual increase of the vegetable
kingdom different graminivorous animals emigrated from the south. The
north being under water, these could not have come from that quarter. In
the great bogs of Scania are found the skeletons of several species of these
          which
animals,  species  had wandered from the                            Germanic continent,                 among whom
are four                                                                                                the wild boar,
                   of the ox --just as many                         of the stag--some of
horse, and others. Carnivorous animals in search of food soon followed in
the footsteps of their graminivorous predecessors ; and last of all came man,
to be fed by their flesh and clothed by their skins. These events seem to
have occurred at a time when the Bos primigenius and Ursus spelceus existed
in the country ; and in proof thereof we possess in Lund a skeleton of the
former pierced by an ancient arrow ; and of the latter a skeleton found in a
peat-bog in Scania, under a gravel or stone deposit, with implements for the
chase used by the aboriginal inhabitants of the country. That the primitive
inhabitants of the country stood upon the same low state of civilization as
those in our days denominated savages, may be concluded from a comparison
of the different implements used by them. They correspond in every respect,
seem intended principally for fishing and hunting, and were formed of stone
or bone. These primitive instruments are found not only in our bogs, but
likewise in the ancient tumuli of the aboriginal inhabitants of the north.
These tumuli are built of large, rough stones, and have always attached to
them on the south or sea side, a narrow, long entrance.
   We find also the skeletons of this primitive race in these barrows, and
from the peculiar shape of their crania, the race may be easily distinguished
from the subsequent inhabitants of Scandinavia. The skeletons of the dogs
used by these beings to assist them in the chase, are likewise found. The
skulls of the aboriginal inhabitants found in these ancient barrows are short
(brachy-cephalic of Retzius), with prominent parietal tubers, and broad

and flattened occiput. It is worthy of remark, that the same form of cranium
exists among several very ancient people, such as the Iberians or Basques of
the Pyrenees, the Lapps and Samoyedes, and the Pelasgi, traces of whom
are still found in Greece.
32 REPORT-- 1847-

Next in succession to this aboriginal race, subsisting by fishing and hunt
ing, comes another with a cranium of a more lengthened oval form and pro

minent and narrow occiput. I think this second race to have been of Gothic
extraction, to have first commenced the division of the land for agricultural
purposes, and consequently to have had bloody strife with the former inha
bitants, who, as already mentioned, lived as fishermen and hunters. This is

a natural conclusion, and has been the case wherever an agricultural people

has met with another living by fishing and hunting. It is the case in Ame
rica, and has been so in ancient times in Europe. A strong and decided
proof of the bloody struggle which had taken place between these different
people is furnished by an investigation of the skull I here have the honour
of showing. This skull is perforated by a lance, the point of which is formed
by one of the points of the elk horn. This weapon of bone has no doubt be
longed to a people very uncivilized, and probably the first inhabitants of the
country, but the skull pierced by the lance is one different in form from that
of the first race that peopled Scandinavia ; it is on the contrary of a length
ened oval form, called by Retzius the Dolico-cephalic. This cranium was
with the other bones of the skeleton found in South Scania, together with
thirty to forty skeletons of the same race ; and among them were found stone
weapons by which they probably had been killed. Around the arms of one
were seen spiral rings of bronze, which seems to prove that they had already
been in contact with other people more advanced in civilization than them
selves, and from them received articles of bronze. Different implements of

bone or stone for digging in the ground were likewise found, and are here
placed before the Section for investigation.
The third race which has inhabited Scandinavia came possibly from the
north and east, and introduced bronze into the country ; the form of the

skull is very different from that of the two former races. It is longer than
Ithe first and broader than the second, and withal prominent at the sides.

 consider this race to have been of Celtic origin. In my hand I have a skull
of very similar form from the rich museum of Dr. Buckland, found in a tin-
mine in Cornwall, at a depth of 500 feet. Another cranium of exactly the
same form, found in a hillock in Rohuslehn at a height of more than 50 feet
Iabove the surface of the sea, lies before me. In the same place was found a
cranium of the preceding, or as I consider, the second race.  have another
skull of like form from a so-called Phoenician catacomb in the island of

Malta. (For further details upon the subject I must refer to my geological
paper.) The fourth race that has inhabited Scandinavia (the true Swea
race) is the colony described by Sturleson as having settled in the Malardall,
and thence spreading itself in different directions, formed in Russia the
dynasty of the Vareger, and in Norway that of the Norraena family, from
which, during the time of Harald Haarfager, a branch extended itself to
Iceland. This race it is quite certain brought with it into Sweden wea
pons and instruments of iron, although such may possibly have been
known in the country beforehand. From the fourth race are descended the
majority of the present inhabitants of the country, and with this race com
mences, strictly speaking, our history. The period of the first settlement of
Ithis race in Scandinavia is not so far distant as has generally been supposed,

and think may be placed some time in the sixth century.

            Section I. On the Phenomena and Tlieories of Volcanos.
Any theoretical exposition of the geological phenomena of elevation, and the

physical causes to which they may be attributable, would seem to be imper
fect without some attempt to explain the origin of the forces which have
elevated and fractured the crust of the globe, as well as the mechanical effects
I Iresulting from them.
                       shall therefore avail myself of the range which
understand the Association to allow me in making this Report, to consider,

Iin the first place, the probable nature and origin of the mechanical agency

in question. And here may remark, that in speculating on the causes which

have operated at past geological epochs, we are naturally led to refer to
present causes as at least suggestive of the probable nature of those which
have formerly acted, however remote may have been the period of their
action. Thus in speculating on the physical causes which have produced
those dislocations which so curiously characterize the surface of the earth,
our attention is directed to existing volcanos as likely to indicate the agency
by which the phaenomena in question have been produced. The frequent
existence, in highly disturbed districts, of masses of rock which have been

apparently injected into the general mass of sedimentary deposits, or ejected
over their surface, and which are now universally allowed by geologists to
be of igneous origin, presents analogies with the effects of volcanic action at
the present time which cannot fail to suggest the idea that the general phe
Inomena of elevation are attributable to the same kind of action.
                                                                                                  shall

therefore enter, in the first instance, into such considerations on the charac
ters of volcanos and their modes of action as may appear to bear immediately
                  of  the phaenomena of
on   the subject  --                      elevation generally.
    1. Volcanos.      A volcano consists   of a mass of fluid
                                                                                 lava  contained  in a

cavity of the solid crust of the earth. The most important characters which
we are here called upon to recognise in volcanos are the following :--
   (1.) The cavities containing the fluid matter have direct communication
with the external air by means of volcanic vents. The dimensions of the

cavities are unknown.

   (2.) The volcanic mass is maintained in a state of fluidity by its elevated
temperature ; and its composition is such that the formation of elastic gases
is constantly taking place, if not in every part of the mass, at least to a con

siderable depth beneath its surface.

   (3.) The elastic force which these gases are capable of exerting at the high
temperature of the mass in which they are generated is extremely great.

   2. With respect to the containing cavity, we may observe that its vent is
an essential character, that on which the mode of action more especially
termed volcanic depends. Respecting the dimensions of the cavity, very
different opinions have been maintained. Some have considered the fluid
matter of all volcanos to communicate with, or rather to be a part of, a cen
tral fluid nucleus constituting the great mass of the earth, and enveloped by
a solid shell of not more than a few leagues in thickness ; while others have
supposed, independently of theoretical views respecting the existence of a
fluid nucleus, that a communication exists between volcanos not too far re-

may seem to indicate. The hypothesis that the thickness of the solid crust

hypothesis to be untenable ; and independently of this consideration, it is
manifest that if that view of the subject were correct, the upper surface of
the fluid mass of every volcano not in a state of eruption must be a portion
of the same surface of equal pressure, and consequently at the same height
above the level of the sea ; nor would it seem to be possible for an eruption
to take place at a great elevation in one volcano, without producing simul
taneous eruptions at least from neighbouring volcanos situated at lower levels.
The same remarks would be applicable to any local group of volcanos freely
communicating with each other, except that the common level of the sur
faces ot the volcanic fluid in one such group might be different from that of
another, the communication being independent of a common fluid nucleus.

It does not appear, however, that we have the slightest evidence of an
equality of altitude of the incandescent mass of neighbouring volcanos, and
it is certain that there is no synchronism in the epochs of their eruptions.
The great eruptions of Etna have not been accompanied by simultaneous
eruptions of Vesuvius, while the intermediate volcano of Stromboli has pre
served its comparative tranquillity during the most violent disturbances of its
neighbours, and remained without a single recorded eruption during 2000
years ; and possibly this comparative repose may have been of much longer
duration.

   Such facts as these would seem to prove beyond doubt that the fluid nu
clei of different volcanos have generally no perfectly free communication
with each other, and may so far, in their actual state, be regarded as insulated

   eenomena. In what degree this insulation may have originally existed, or
   w far it may have beeu the result of physical causes acting during long
periods of time, are questions which we shall have hereafter to discuss.
    3. With reference to the gases above mentioned, we may remark that we
are not here concerned in any degree with their chemical nature, but merely
with their property of elasticity. Distinct evidence of the continuous gene
ration of gases in the interior of the volcanic mass, and their consequent

continuous ascent to the surface, is afforded by such volcanos as that of

Stromboli and Kirauea*, which remain for long periods of time in sensibly
the same state, uninterrupted by those periodical explosive eruptions which
form the most striking feature in volcanic action. The fluid masses in these
volcanos remain at nearly a constant elevation, and are observed to be in a
constant state of comparatively quiet ebullition, arising, undoubtedly, from the
continuous disengagement of elastic vapours formed within them. The fact
also of the constant escape of such vapours from volcanic foci is well esta

blished by observation.

   4. That the fluidity of the volcanic mass is due to heat is universally al
lowed, but it has been doubted, and with apparent reason, whether it be pre
cisely of the same nature as the fluidity of a perfect fluid, or that of an ordi-

* A volcano in Owhyhee, one of the Sandwich Islands. An interesting account of it is
given by Captain Tarleton    in Blackwood's Magazine (November 1845). It is also described in
Ellis's Narrative of a Tour  in the Sandwich Islands, p. 199. In this volcano, as well as in that
of Stromboli, the surface of the fluid lava is visible. They consequently afford important evi
dence respecting the position of the surface of the volcanic fluid with reference to the level
of the ocean. Volcanos in general afford no evidence of this kind during the periods of
comparative repose which intervene between their eruptions. Kirauea is 4000 feet above
the level of the sea.

nary metal in a state of perfect fusion. In the latter case it is conceived that
no particle of finite dimensions retains its solidity, whereas in the case of fluid
lava it has been supposed that a large portion of the mass consists of small
but finite particles, which retain severally their solidity, while their relative
mobility is maintained by the remaining portion of the mass intervening in a
more perfect state of fluidity between the solid particles, and consisting partly
of internal elastic vapours, which by their ascending movement keep the
component particles of the mass in a constant state of ebullition, and give to
it an apparent fluidity, much greater than that of lava, immediately after its
ejection from a crater^. Be this however as it may, it is important to
remark the influence which this constant movement of internal gases must
exercise in counteracting the tendency of the upper portion of the mass to
solidify in consequence of the loss of heat. It should also be remarked how
much this influence may be increased by the contraction of the containing
cavity as it rises towards the external vent. For the currents of ascending
vapours, in their ascent to the surface, will produce a degree of internal
movement inversely proportional to the area of the horizontal sections through
which they pass; and therefore, whenever the fluid mass rises into the nar
rower part of the volcanic vent, these currents will preserve the more super
ficial part of the fluid in a state of ebullition the more violent in proportion
to the contraction of the channel through which the vapours ultimately escape.
Thus the incipient solidification or freezing of the surface of the fluid may
be prevented long after the temperature has descended to that which would

be the temperature offusion of the mass if it were placed in a state of perfect

rest

   5. The enormous expansive force which the elastic vapours of volcanos
are capable of exerting is attested by the violence of volcanic eruptions.
When disengaged from the fluid lava their power is shown by the velocity
with which solid masses of rock, as well as looser materials, are frequently
projected from the mouths of volcanos ; and while existing within the fluid
mass, their hydrostatic power is distinctly proved by the column of lava
which they must have to support during the time of its overflowing from the
mouth of an elevated volcano. When we further consider how rapidly the
expansive force of vapour increases with its temperature, we may conceive
how enormous a force these volcanic gases may have been capable of pro
ducing at former geological epochs, if we allow that the temperature of the

earth's crust may then have been considerably greater than at the present

time.
  6. Mode of Action of Volcanic Forces. --The immediate effects
                                                                   of the more
energetic action of volcanic forces are so generally exhibited in  the form of

violent explosions, that we might, without due consideration of the subject,

be led to suppose that sudden and explosive action constituted an essential

character of such forces. It must be recollected, however, that to produce
an explosion two conditions are necessary. In the first place, a force of great
intensity must be produced almost instantaneously, or the resistance opposing

a force already in action as instantaneously removed ; and secondly, the mass
on which the force acts must be so small as to admit of a very great velocity

being almost instantaneously communicated to it. A force like that in ques
tion is suddenly produced by the ignition of an explosive compound, and the

resistance to an enormous expansive force is as suddenly removed by the
bursting of a boiler filled with steam at a high tension ; but in neither case
would an explosion be the result, unless the mass acted on were small. We

       * See Scrope ' On Volcanos,' p. 19.
3G REPORT-- 1847.

must not therefore conclude, that because volcanic forces produce violent

explosions when acting under the actual conditions which existing volcanos
present, they would produce similar effects under different conditions. Such

would certainly not be the case if the inertia of the masses on which the forces
acted should be sufficiently great*.
   The permanent state of ebullition and gentle intumescence observed in

Stromboli, Kirauea, and a few other volcanos, is manifestly the consequence
of the constant generation of elastic vapours, and their regular ascent to the
surface through which they escape into the atmosphere ; but it is difficult to
obtain any evidence respecting the precise cause of that discontinuous and
paroxysmal action which constitutes the usual characteristic of volcanic action.
Perhaps a careful study of the great intermittent hot springs of Iceland, the

Geysers, is as likely as any means we possess, to elucidate the subject.
   One explanation which has been given of the intermittent action of these

springs is founded on the hypothesis of the existence of reservoirs of steam
in the internal cavities, with which the external vent, in the form of a long

cylindrical tube, communicates. These reservoirs may be conceived to be
formed, in some cases, in those parts of internal cavities where the roof

rises higher than the outlet. Steam may be formed in them after each
explosion, of sufficient elastic power (if the heat be great enough) to press
down the surface of the water at first filling the cavity, till it descend to the
level of the outlet, through which a portion of the steam may then make
its escape. The steam thus escaping will rise rapidly through the water,

to escape by the external vent. Under these circumstances, if the quantity
of steam which escapes at the same instant, and its elastic power, be suffi
ciently great, and the water rise into the narrow cylindrical tube, the water
occupying the tube will be expelled by the steam in exactly the same manner
as the contents of a gun-barrel are expelled by the elastic force of the vapour
instantaneously generated by the ignition of the gunpowder employed.
   The conditions assumed respecting the form of the internal cavities appear
highly probable, and the accumulation of steam in them would probably be
a necessary consequence of their existence. The part of the explanation
which appears to me least satisfactory, is that which assumes the sudden escape
of the accumulated vapour in sufficient quantity to produce the observed
effects, and so far to exhaust these reservoirs as to render necessary consider
able periods of repose before the renewal of a similar action. The above
explanation is equally applicable to the intermittent action of volcanos ; and
perhaps the difficulty just mentioned may not be so great as in springs like
the Geysers, because the tension of the elastic vapours in the former must

be enormously greater than in the latter case, and may possibly in the deep

regions of a volcano produce disruptions in the containing rocks by which

the vapour may be suddenly liberated in sufficient quantity to produce a
violent eruption. Possibly.however the explosive action of volcanos may be
connected with some modification yet unknown to us in the process of gene

world presents to us, by referring them to the agency of natural causes ; but
in our more extended speculations on geological causation we are necessarily
driven to the consideration of the limits beyond which we are compelled to
recognise the operation of those higher causes of which physical science can

take no cognizance. It is far from my object to enter into a discussion of
questions of this nature, but before we can proceed to the examination of
theoretical views, and the hypotheses on which they are founded, it is essen
                        have some rule      for  our guidance on this point. The

mena which geology presents to us as objects of physical investigation, we
must refer them to natural causes, so far as it can be proved that the pheno
mena would be the necessary consequences of such causes acting under con
ditions the former existence of which may be deemed admissible. But in

the application of this principle we are bound to be especially careful that
the dependence of the phenomena observed on the causes assigned be
established by accurate reasoning, and not by vague assumptions. It is to the
gross neglect of what the rule as above enunciated dictates in this respect,
that we must attribute so many indeterminate speculations and objectionable

opinions which have been offered to the world as geological theories. It is

easy to substitute speculative notions for rigorous demonstration, but let us
not forget that no one can thus build up geological theories without violating
all the rules of inductive philosophy, and overstepping the caution and
modesty which are essential for our safe guidance in these remote regions of

physical science.
There are two fundamental hypotheses on which theories of volcanos have

been founded : one of them assumes the earth at some former epoch to have
been in a state of fluidity ; the other assumes it to have been originally con
stituted with an unoxidized solid nucleus. The first of these hypotheses, it
will be observed, does not assume a fluid state to have been the primitive
state of the matter composing our planet, but merely one antecedent to its
present state, and manifestly does not interfere with the hypothesis of a still
Ifanterior gaseous state of the earth, or of the matter composing the whole solar
system.     the second hypothesis be intended also not to define the abso
lutely primitive state of the globe, it may be demanded of the theory founded
on that should give at least some probable explanation of the assumed

existence of the solid unoxidized nucleus as the consequence of previous
state of the terrestrial mass. If, on the contrary, the state assumed by this
hypothesis be regarded as the primitive state of the earth, the hypothesis
would seem in itself to be less simple than that which, without professing to
define the primitive state of matter, supposes our planet to have once been

gaseous or fluid. According to this latter hypothesis, the terrestrial mass
must have been more entirely free to receive all the modifications of consti
tution and form which physical and mechanical .causes may have tended to

only evidence on which the truth of our primary assumptions can stand. But
some persons have appeared to think that the hypothesis of the original
solidity of the earth     is in itself so    far preferable, that any
required, as it were,     a justification.     In the preceding brief  ortehmear rkhsypoIthheasivse
wished to show that, instead of such being the case, the hypothesis of the

than that of its primitive solidity. But whatever hypothesis we adopt, weis is,
must ever recollect that the final test of its truth must always be sought in
the process of an accurate deduction of consequences resulting from our
original assumptions, and a careful comparison of such calculated results
with observed phaenomena. In no science perhaps                  so essential as in

the fundamental hypothesis         is

perhaps three or four miles, consists of an unoxidized solid mass.                                  sup

on the hypothesis that the thickness of the earth's solid crust does not exceed
twenty or thirty miles*. According to this theory, volcanic eruptions are
due to column of water admitted through the solid crust, its upper extremity
communicating with the sea or some other permanent supply of water, and
its lower extremity with the general incandescent fluid mass beneath. He
shows the possibility of column of water preserving its liquid form, though

temperature of the Geysers show that the temperature of ebullition in ver

of pressure, much more rapidly than the terrestrial temperature increasesa

above explained in the chemical theory. The lower extremity of the column

iscapable of finding access beneath the solid crust to another canal terminating

near the same point, and forming volcanic vent, up which the fluid lava
supposed to be impelled by the elastic force of the steam, with sufficient
violence to produce an external eruption. Now the internal fluid had no
tendency in its state of repose to rise through any open channel to point higher
than the average level of the lower surface of the solid crust, this explanation,

though still open to objections, might not be deemed altogether inadmissible
on mechanical grounds. But there the strongest reason to believe that, on

one) are concentric and spheroidal, having their axes in the axis of rotation.

time of rotation to be able to determine the ellipticity of the external surface ;

fundamental hypothesis. We have no data, however, for determining more

the law which it follows were known, together with the time of rotation, the
ellipticity of the external surface could be calculated ; but the law of density
is essentially an unknown element of the problem, and mathematicians have

therefore been obliged to assume a law, and leave the accuracy of the assump
tion to be proved, in common with any other hypothesis involved, by the
general harmony of the results. This assumed law is represented, as is well

known, by A 8in ~ a, which expresses the density at any point of a surface of

equal pressure and density, whose axis = a. By assigning a proper value to
the constant q, we obtain a value of the ellipticity of the external surface co
inciding with that determined by observation. This accordance, however,
unsupported by any other, would afford no conclusive proof of the earth's
former fluidity, since the result depends on an arbitrary assumption respect
ing the density, and therefore we must examine whether this assumed law of
density which accords with the observed value of the earth's ellipticity, also
accords with other observed phenomena. Now with our assumed law of
density we can calculate the ratio which the mean density bears to the den

sity at the surface ; and the mean density has also been determined in the
first instance by the experiments of Cavendish, and lately by similar experi
ments conducted by the late Mr. Baily with the most refined precautions
against the influence of disturbing causes. The comparison of the theoreti
cal and experimental results shows that the same law of density which accords
with the observed ellipticity of the earth, gives also a value of the ratio of the
superficial and mean densities, which accords very approximately with the
experimental determination of the mean density, and of that of the rocks
generally composing the earth's surface*.

   The accordance between the results of observation and those of calcula
tion, with respect to the form of the earth and its mean density, seem to be

as perfect as we could possibly expect, and we may therefore assert that this
theory clearly accounts for the observed spheroidal form of the earth by the

operation of natural causes f.

motions of the earth and moon, depending on the earth's oblateness, which

afford evidence in favour of the above theory. I allude to the motions of

precession and nutation of the pole of the earth, and a corresponding small

inequality in the motion of the moon. If the earth's external surface and all

the interior surfaces of equal density were spherical and concentric, the mu
tual attractions of the earth and moon would be equivalent to a single force
passing through the spherical centre, or centre of gravity of the earth,
and would therefore not tend to impress on the earth a motion of rotation
about any axis through its centre ; nor, on the other hand, would this force
have any tendency to draw the moon out of a fixed plane passing through
that centre. But, the earth being oblate, it is easily seen that when the moon
is out of the plane of the equator, the resultant force of her attraction will
not pass through the earth's centre, because her attraction on the portion of
the equatorial protuberance nearest to her will be greater than that on the
opposite and more remote portion. Consequently this attraction will tend to
impress on the earth a rotatory motion about an axis through the earth's
centre, and perpendicular to a plane through the earth's axis and the moon's
centre. This angular motion, combined with that of the earth's daily rota
tion, produces lunar precession and nutation. The solar precession and nu
tation admit of an exactly similar explanation. Again, since the attraction
of the earth on the moon is exactly equal and opposite to that of the moon
on the earth, it must tend to draw the moon out of the constant plane in
which she would move if she were acted on only by a force passing accu
rately through the earth's centre. The inequality in the moon's motion due

to this cause has been accurately determined by very numerous observations;
and the lunar precession and nutation are also accurately determined by ob

servation. The calculation of these motions according to the theory of gra
vitation, depends on the ellipticity of the earth and the law of its density.
Taking the value of the ellipticity determined by observation, and the assumed
law of density already mentioned (art. 10), the results of calculation agree
to a close degree of approximation with those of observation, thus affording
a strong corroboration of the truth of the hypotheses on which the calcula
tions are founded*.

    12. In estimating the value of the evidence derived from the earth's form,
it must not, however, be forgotten, that under certain conditions, centrifugal
force would impress on a rotating solid mass a form approximating to the
spheroidal form of a fluid mass in similar motion. Thus, if a solid sphere of
the dimensions of the earth were put in rotation with the earth's angular ve
locity, the centrifugal force would cause it to bulge out in some degree at its

Iequator, all matter being supposed to have some degree of extensibility.

am not aware that any accurate solution of the problem has been attempted,
and consequently the form which the mass would assume is not known with

any exactness. It is evident, however, that it could never attain the degree of

ellipticity which would be attained by a fluid mass under the same conditions,
provided the solid should be able to retain for an indefinite time any finite
cohesive power to resist the tendency of the centrifugal force to extend the
mass in directions perpendicular to the axis of rotation ; for it is only in the
absence of such resisting force that the limiting form of the. fluid spheroid is

attained. It may perhaps also be stated as probable, that with a finite cohe

sive power, the defect in the excess of the equatorial over the polar radius,
as compared with that excess in the fluid spheroid, would be of the same

    * In the usual mode of calculating the amount of precession and nutation according to the
theory of gravitation, the earth has been supposed to be perfectly solid. It has recently been
shown, however, as will be explained in a future article, that results sensibly the same are ob
tained if we suppose the interior of the globe to be fluid, provided the thickness of the solid
shell be not less than about one-fourth or one-fifth of the earth's radius.

order of magnitude as the excess itself. Without dwelling, however, on in
ferences which have not received the sanction of accurate analysis, we may
observe that whatever influence we allow to centrifugal force and that of
gravity acting on a mass of great dimensions, we cannot still consider the
present form of the earth as a modification of any very different form result
ing from the action of those forces on a mass originally solid, without having
recourse to particular hypotheses. It would seem necessary, for instance, that
the axis of rotation in the initial motion should have been at least nearly co
incident with a permanent axis of rotation ; and also that there should be
some particular law of density of the mass in its original form, to ensure in
its final form a density which should have a certain symmetrical relation to
the axis of rotation, such as doubtless exists in the actual density of the globe.

It is the absence of the necessity for all such additional restrictive assump

tions that constitutes the great recommendation of the hypothesis of the earth's

former fluidity, and which enables us to account, on that hypothesis, in so
simple and satisfactory a manner, for the present form and density of the
earth, as the results of mechanical causes.

   13. Another mode has also been suggested of accounting for the sphe
roidal form of the earth, independently of the hypothesis of its former fluidity*.
Suppose, for instance, its original form to have been spherical, and the period
of its rotation the same as at present. The equatorial region would form one

continuous ocean, while the land in the polar regions would rise above the

level of the ocean, attaining its greatest height at either pole. But these
polar tracts of land would be slowly removed by that constant operation on
its shores by which the ocean is now wearing away the land which protrudes
above its surface, and an approximation to the spheroidal form would doubt
Iless thus be produced if sufficient time were allowed for the operation.

      am not aware that any one has advocated this view of the subject as a
probable one, and the distinguished author of the work just referred to, in
               has made the following remark: --"We are far from meaning

ginally and (so to speak) perversely constituted otherwise."It it       may also be
observed that geological observation has afforded no indication, as conceive,aa
of any greater accumulation of sedimentary deposits in the equatorial than
in the polar regions. Still this mode of accounting for the earth's spheroidal
form might be appealed to (as, in fact, has been by distinguished geolo

gist) as one not inconsistent with physical principles and admissible condi
tions, and therefore as tending to diminish our confidence in the theory which
ispresents the spheroidal form of the earth as proof of its former fluidity.  it

   therefore desirable to submit this idea of the possible origin of the sphe     It
roidal form to as accurate test as we are able. But for this purpose will
be necessary to make some hypothesis respecting the internal constitution ofa
the earth as well as its external form.
                 it                      may perhaps be deemed the sim
plest supposition, that the primitive matter of the earth would have been of
uniform density under uniform pressure. Adopting this hypothesis in cona
junction with that of the earth's primitive sphericity, would follow that the
                                                              it

interior surfaces of equal density would be spherical, having for their com
mon centre the centre of the earth. After the earth had been thus consti

tuted, we must suppose to have received its spheroidal form by the denu
dation of its polar regions, and the deposition of the transported matter to

                           * Herschel's Astronomy, page 120.
44 REPORT -- 1847.

the region of the equator. To test the truth of this hypothesis, we may appeal
to the phenomena already mentioned (art. 11) of precession and nutation,
and   the corresponding inequality in  the moon's motion.
       the density of the earth were   uniform, the resultant  attraction  of the
  If
moon or sun on the portion of the terrestrial mass contained within a sphere
having its centre coincident with the centre of the spheroid, and its l adius

equal to the earth's polar radius, would manifestly pass through the centre of
gravity of the earth, and would, therefore, have no effect in producing pre
cession and nutation. In such case these phenomena would be due solely
to the attraction on the protuberant equatorial mass which forms the excess
of the spheroid above the sphere just mentioned. In like manner the cor

responding inequality in the lunar motion would also be due entirely to the
attraction of the same protuberant portion of the earth's mass on the moon.

Supposing the earth's mass and external form to be the same as at present,

the annual precession of the pole, as due both to the action of the moon and
of the sun, would amount to nearly 58"; and the coefficient of the term ex
pressing the inequality in the moon's motion would amount to about 10".

   Again, if we suppose the removal of the superficial mass from the polar to
the equatorial regions to take place without affecting the density of the re
maining portion of the mass, the resultant attraction of the sun or moon on
that portion would still pass through the earth's centre of gravity, and would

consequently have no influence in producing the phenomena in question,
which would therefore depend entirely, as in the former case, on the equato
rial protuberance. Hence, the mass of the earth and its ellipticity being the
same in the two cases, the calculated lunar inequalities would be proportional
to the densities of the equatorial protuberances, and the calculated proces

sional motions would be proportional to the densities directly, and to the mo
ments of inertia inversely. In the first case the density is the mean density
of the earth ; in the latter, it is the superficial density ; and these densities
(art 10) may be taken in the ratio of nearly 2$ to 1 . The moments of inertia
may be taken in the ratio of about 6 : 5, tak'ing the variable density as above

(art. 10). Consequently, if the spheroidal form of the eartli were due to the

cause to which it is here assigned, the annual luni-solar precession would only
be about 28", and the coefficient of the lunar inequality about 4". Their

actual values, as established by observation, are respectively about 51" and 8",
presenting the discrepancies of about 23" and 4" respectively.
   In calculating the above amounts of the precession and the lunar inequality,

assuming the hypothesis we are considering respecting the earth's spheroidal
form, it has been supposed that the general interior mass would retain its

primitive density. This would manifestly not be strictly correct, since the
density must necessarily be more or less affected by the removal of so large
a mass from the pole, and its deposition about the equator. Let £0 denote
the modulus of elasticity for the solid matter of the earth before being sub
jected for an indefinite period of time to any more considerable pressure than

that to which it would be subjected on the surface of the earth ; and let E

denote the modulus for the same matter after having been subjected for an
indefinite period of time to that enormous pressure to which all matter at

considerable depths below the earth's surface must be subjected. Then,
without entering into the intricacies which would be involved in the general
problem, it may be easily shown, at least for points not too remote from the

surface, that if E = E0, the surfaces of equal density after the change in the
earth's form would be approximately similar to the external surface ; but
                  E
                                                                                                          if,
on the contrary,  be much greater than E0, the surfaces of equal density
would remain approximately spherical, notwithstanding the change of pressure

due to the change of external form. If this latter be the true supposition, as

it will probably be thought to be, the above calculated results will be approxi
mately true, and will furnish unquestionable evidence of the inadmissibility
of the hypothesis we have been considering respecting the origin of the earth's

spheroidal form ; for though the quantities we have to compare as the results
of observation and the results of calculation are so small, the limits of error
in the determination of them are too narrow to admit of even very much
smaller discrepancies than those exhibited in the results stated at the close of
the preceding paragraph, if the hypotheses on which the calculations are
founded are true.

These particular discrepancies, however, only prove the inadmissibility of
the above mode of accounting for the earth's spheroidal form, when we adopt
Ifthe hypothesis above made respecting the primitive density of the terrestrial
mass.  we should adopt some other hypothesis respecting that density,

we might undoubtedly account by this theory, not only for the earth's
actual form, but also for the other                                  above mentioned. But it is

theory which assumes the earth's primitive solidity, it is necessary to make
some arbitrary hypothesis respecting its primitive law of density ; so that, in

such theories as those discussed in this and the preceding article, while we

admit the general principle of reasoning before laid down (art. 7), in seeking
for some secondary cause to which the earth's form may be attributed, we
reject in a great measure the application of that principle with reference to
the earth's density ; since we can only profess to account for it in such theo
ries, by means of some particular and independent hypothesis adopted for
the purpose. In the theory which admits the former fluidity of the earth,
there is no such inconsistency. No assumption is there made respecting the
primitive constitution or density of the terrestrial mass, for the fluid state is

only assumed to have been some antecedent, and not necessarily its primitive
state ; and the present density of the earth becomes as much the necessary
consequence of physical causes as its form. The results also of this theory
are all in perfect harmony with each other ; and we can assert the undoubted
adequacy of the causes assigned by it to produce the observed phenomena ;
while, in the other theories we have discussed, a similar adequacy of causa
Ition is, conceive, extremely doubtful.                                                             --J
If then we admit the general principle of reasoning above alluded to, it
appears to me that the theory which asserts the former fluidity of the globe
has a much stronger claim to our preference than any other. If, on the con
trary, we reject that principle as a guide in our speculations in these remoter
regions of geological science, it would seem more consistent, in assuming the

earth's original solidity, also to assume that its present spheroidal form was
originally impressed upon as being that form which would alone admit of
an admixture of land and sea in all latitudes, and which thus best adapts its

the subject to explain why, in thus denying that the earth's form and density           a
are to be referred to secondary causes, they reject, with reference to these
phenomena, principle of reasoning and interpretation which they admit with
       a

reference to geological phenomena in general, and without which, in fact,
geology could have no existence as physical science.

      In the
of cooling, of which one belongs to bodies which are either solid or imper
fectly fluid, and is termed cooling by conduction, and the other to masses in
that state of more perfect fluidity which admits of a free motion of the com
ponent particles among themselves. In this case the cooling is said to take
place by circulation or convection. The nature of the former process has
been ascertained with considerable accuracy by experiment, and the laws of the
phenomena have been made the subject of mathematical investigation, but of
the exact laws of cooling by the latter process we are comparatively ignorant.
It is manifest, however, that since time must be necessary for the transmission
of the hotter and lighter particles from the central to the superficial parts of
the mass, as well as for that of the colder and heavier particles in the opposite
direction, the temperature must increase with the depth beneath the sur

face ; and, moreover, that this increase will be the more rapid, the more
nearly the fluidity of the mass approaches that limit at which this process of
cooling would cease, and that by conduction begin, since the rapidity of cir

culation would constantly diminish as the fluidity should approximate to that
limit But still, even in this limiting case, it seems probable that the ten
dency to produce an equality of temperature throughout the mass will be
much greater, and consequently the rate of increase of temperature in ap

proaching the centre much less, than if the cooling of the mass had proceeded

by conduction during the same time, the conductive power being very

Ifsm"all. the matter composing the globe was originally in a high state of fluidity

from heat, the process of cooling would undoubtedly, in the first instance,
be by circulation. The manner in which the transition will take place from
this mode of refrigeration to that by conduction, depends on certain con
ditions, of which, in our speculations on this subject, it is important to form
a distinct

mass is cooling by circulation, the tendency to solidification, so far as it
depends on this cause, will be greatest at the surface and least at the centre ;

but, on the other hand, the pressure is least at the surface and greatest at

the centre ; and consequently the tendency to solidify, as depending on this
cause, will be greatest at the centre and least at the surface. To estimate

this tendency under the joint influence of these causes, it would be necessary,
in the first place, to know the law according to which the temperature in
creases in descending from the surface to the centre, while the mass is cooling

by circulation ; and secondly, the influence of the temperature in resisting
solidification, as compared with that of the pressure in promoting it. These,

incrustation of the surface could take place so long as any inferior portion
of the mass retained its perfect fluidity, because as the superior particles
should become condensed they would continually descend into the perfect
fluid beneath, always supposing the mass in that state in which an increase
of specific gravity would result from a decrease of temperature. The pro
cess of circulation would thus go on till every part of the mass should have
lost that degree of more perfect fluidity, which admits of a motion of the
particles among themselves being excited by their unequal refrigeration.
The circulation, therefore, would cease nearly contemporaneously in every
part of the mass, which would then begin to cool by conduction, rapidly at
the surface exposed to the low temperature of the planetary space, and ex
tremely slow in the central parts, on account of the small conductive power
of the matter composing the earth. Consequently the globe would consist,
after a certain time, of an exterior solid crust, and interior fluid matter, of

which the fluidity would increase in approaching the centre, where it might
still approach to that more perfect fluidity which admits of cooling by con
vection. With reference, however, to the mechanical action of any forces
producing either motion or hydrostatic pressure in the interior mass, the
whole of it might, as an approximation, be considered perfectly fluid. No
attempt has yet been made to determine the present probable thickness of
the earth's crust, assuming it to have been originally in a state of fluidity,
on account of the difficulty already mentioned, arising from our ignorance

of the influence of high temperature in resisting solidification, compared
with that of great pressure in promoting it. All that has hitherto been
                                     that the present state of the earth's surface

is              us now recur to the other        case above       mentioned,  that in which the
               a
increase of pressure in descending towards the centre of the mass supposed
                                                                              is

perature in preventing it. Supposing the mass to have been first in state
in which every part was cooling by convection, this process would first
cease, and that of cooling by conduction begin at the centre, while the supe
rior portion would still continue to cool                     by

would take place in the process of solidification, which                      important to
remark. The superficial parts of the mass must all cases cool the most
rapidly, and now (in consequence of the imperfect fluidity) being no longer
able to descend, crust will be formed on the surface, from which the pro
                        a

cess of solidification will proceed far more rapidly downwards, than upwards
on the solid nucleus. Consequently, then, our globe would arrive at that
state, according to the mode of cooling we are now considering,

would be composed of a solid shell, and a solid central nucleus, with matter
in a state of fusion between them, the fluidity of which, however, would
necessarily be less than that which might exist in the fused mass very near
                in the

as in the former case, i. e. it may be small compared with the earth's radius.
What would be the radius of the solid nucleus at the instant of the first in
crustation of the surface, or that which would correspond to any assigned
thickness of the exterior shell, it is quite impossible to determine from the
want of all experimental evidence respecting the tendency of great pressure
to promote solidification at very high temperatures, and our ignorance of
the temperature at which the superficial incrustation of a large mass would
begin, when exposed to the temperature of the planetary space. It is, there

fore, manifestly impossible to decide by any such reasoning as the above,

   * " M. Poisson was, I believe, the first to advocate the hypothesis of the solidification of

the earth having commenced from the centre, and has stated in general terms that, in such

case, it would proceed to the surface which would be the last to solidify (Theorie de la Chaleur,

p. 428). It is manifest, however, from what has been advanced, that this could not be lite
rally correct, but that the solidification must necessarily commence at the surface before the
whole internal portion had become solid. The distinction is of little consequence as respects
the object which M. Poisson had in view, but is of the highest importance with reference
to geological speculation, because it shows that, supposing the earth once to have been fluid,

it must be now, or have been at some antecedent epoch, in that state in which a solid exte

rior crust rests on an imperfectly fluid and incandescent mass beneath. It is important to
know, that this state of the earth, assuming its original fluidity, is one through which it must
necessarily have passed in the course of its refrigeration, whatever might be the process of its

solidification."

Sir James Hall*, in which he succeeded in fusing several calcareous sub
stances. But in these cases the effect of pressure was manifested in the
prevention of the escape of the carbonic acid, which being thus retained

appears to have acted as a flux on the other portions of the substances
which were experimented on. Thus fusion was in this instance promoted
instead of being impeded by the pressure necessary to retain portions of the
substance which would otherwise have been volatilized ; but nothing was
decided in these experiments as to the consequences of increasing the pres
sure far beyond that point, which is here the real question at issue. More

over, the substance acted on was so entirely different in its chemical con
stitution from the general igneous masses which probably form so large a
portion of the globe, that no inference can be drawn respecting the effect of
great pressure in the solidifying of those masses, from the experiments of

which we are speaking.

quence of which the interior generation of elastic gases is constantly pro

ceeding, a property which I assume to belong to the primaeval fluid mass,

by virtue of the analogy which it is assumed to bear to existing volcanic
masses. The obvious effect of this production of gases would be to retard
the solidification. It would lengthen the duration of the process of cooling
by circulation, and after that process had ceased with reference to the parti
Icles of the mass itself, the gases would still impede the solidification by pre
venting the entire internal repose of the mass.     have stated in general

terms that no incrustation of the surface would take place 60 long as the
cooling by circulation continued, provided the loss of heat were accom
                          of density.      In considering the process of                                       solidifica

by speculative geologists, not only that the central portion of the earth is
fluid, as we have shown it may be, but also that the solid crust which enve
lopes it does not exceed a few leagues in thickness; and on this assumption
theories of volcanos, as we have seen, have been founded. In seeking for
some determinate evidence on this point, on which our previous reasoning
leaves us in perfect uncertainty, it occurred to me some years ago, that it
might possibly be found in the delicate but well-defined phenomena of pre

cession and nutation, of which I have already had occasion to speak. To
state the more distinctly the problem which it was necessary to solve for

this purpose, I may remind the reader that during the annual revolution of
the earth, its axis does not preserve a perfect parallelism iu its different posi
tions, so that the point of the heavens to which it is directed at any time is
not exactly the same as that to which it pointed at any previous epoch
when the earth was at the same point of her orbit. This angular motion
Iof the axis, though very slow, has been determined with great accuracy by
astronomical observation.         have already stated it to be due to the cir
cumstance of the resulting force of attraction of the sun and moon on the

different particles of the earth's mass not passing through the centre of gra
vity of the earth. The consequence is, that the attraction of the sun con-

stautly tends to communicate to the earth an angular motion about a diameter
perpendicular to the plane passing through the axis of the earth and the
gun's centre ; and an exactly similar proposition holds with respect to the
moon's attraction. It is the composition of these two angular motions with
that of the earth's daily rotation which produces the luni-solar precession
and nutation. Now it will be manifest at once to those who are familiar

·with physical investigations of this nature, that if the central portion of the
earth be fluid, the direct effects of the attractions of the sun and moon
in producing the angular motions above mentioned, must be very different

from the effects which these attractions would produce if the central portion
were solid. The latter, however, was the only hypothesis on which the pro
cessional motion of the pole had been investigated. The result thus obtained
depends on the ellipticity of the earth and the law of its density, and is found
to agree, to a very close approximation, with the observed amount of pre
cession and nutation, taking the same value of the ellipticity and the same
law of the earth's density as are deduced from independent considerations in
the manner already explained (art. 10). This exact accordance seemed to
render it improbable that an equal accordance should exist between the
observed amount of precessional motion and the amount calculated on the
hypothesis of the earth's internal fluidity, though it was impossible to say
beforehand how far compensations might exist which would render the re

sulting motions very approximately the same, though the forces producing

them acted under such different conditions. Without the required accord
ance on the hypothesis of internal fluidity, we should be under the necessity
of recognising the earth's entire solidity.
   In my first Memoir,                 in Part II. for  1839 of the    Transactions of
                          published                     of luni-soiar
the Royal Society, I     investigated    the amount                    precession and

nutation, assuming the earth to consist of a solid spheroidal shell filled with

Ifluid. To solve the problem, in the first instance, in its most simple form,
  supposed the solid shell to be bounded interiorly by a determinate sphe
roidal surface, of which the ellipticity was equal to that of the external sur
face, the transition from the solidity of the shell to the fluidity of the internal
mass not being gradual but abrupt. The densities of the shell and fluid
                                                                 arrived at, under
were also  assumed to be    uniform and equal.     The  results
this form                   were the following
           of the problem,                      :--

   (1.) The luni-solar   precession would be    the same, whatever     might be the
thickness of the shell,                         were homogeneous       and solid.
                         as if the whole earth

   (2.) The lunar nutation would be the same as for the homogeneous solid
spheroid to such a degree of approximation, that the difference would be

inappreciable by observation.
    (3.) The solar nutation would be sensibly the same as for the homogeneous
spheroid, except the thickness of the shell should approximate very nearly
to a particular value, something less than one-fourth of the earth's radius, in
which particular case this nutation might become much greater than for the
solid spheroid.
   (4.) In the expressions for the co-ordinates which determine the instanta

neous position of the true pole, we have, in addition to the terms of which
the results just given are the interpretations, other terms which depend on
the internal fluidity, and disappear entirely when the whole spheroid is solid.
The interpretation of these terms that in addition to the above-mentioned
motions of precession and nutation, the pole of the earth would have small
circular motion, the radius of the circle thus described being greatest when
                                       is,
                                                                                                             a

the thickness of the shell should be least. The inequality thus introduced,
however, could never exceed a quantity of the same order of magnitude as
the solar nutation, and for any but the most inconsiderable thickness of the

shell would be entirely inappreciable by observation.
Thus far then the results obtained afforded no evidence as to the thick

ness of the solid crust, supposing the earth constituted as above assumed.
In a succeeding memoir, which appeared in the Transactions of the Royal

ISociety (Part I. for 1840), resumed the investigation without the limita
Itions which imposed in the first instance, assuming both the solid shell and
the internal fluid to be heterogeneous. The result showed that under this
more general hypothesis, the amount of precession and nutation depended
on the difference between the ellipticities of the external and internal sur

faces of the shell, and on its thickness, or on this latter quantity alone, if we
consider the ellipticity of the inner surface to be a function of the thickness,
as ft necessarily would be, supposing, as we have done, the solidity of the
Ishell to have resulted from its refrigeration. In a third memoir in the
Transactions of   the Royal Society (Part  I. for 1842),   applied the   general

result obtained   in my second memoir to    determine the               value of
the thickness of the crust corresponding to the present observed amount of
precession. The result obtained was that the thickness of the solid shell
could not be less than about one-fourth or one-fifth of the radius of its external

  IThe form in which have enunciated this result, implies in itself some

degree of numerical indeterminateuess, which in fact must necessarily exist
from the nature of the data on which the calculation rests. At the same time

I have no doubt of its being a real approximation to the minimum thickness
of the crust consistent with the observed amount of precession. It is not, how
ever, the more or less exact determination of this thickness which I regard as

the most important object of this problem. The real question of importance,
as regards at least our theories of elevation and volcanos, is not whether the
thickness of the solid crust of the globe be somewhat more or somewhat less
than 800 or 1000 miles, but whether it be or be not very much less than
the least of those quantities. On this point the problem affords us distinct
evidence ; for it is demonstrated that if the thickness of the solid shell were
very small with reference to the earth's radius, the precession would be sen
sibly the same as if the earth were a homogeneous spheroid with its actual
ellipticity, or would be greater by about one-eighth part than the observed

amount

  IThis is the result to which have before alluded as inconsistent with the

hypothesis made by M. Bischotf and others, that the solid crust of the globe
does not exceed twenty or thirty miles in thickness.

   16. Here it is important to remark the bearing of this result on the ques

tion to which I have before alluded, viz. whether high pressure has any in

fluence on the temperature of fusion of solid substances. The result that
the thickness of the earth's crust is large, is in fact inconsistent with the con
clusion that the temperature of fusion is the same at different depths beneath
the surface, or is unaffected by high pressure, if we admit the existing tem-

   · In obtaining this result the solid shell was supposed to be bounded internally by a de
terminate surface, or that the transition from the solidity of the shell to the fluidity of the
internal mass, was immediate and abrupt, whereas in any actual case like that of the earth
the transition must be gradual. For the determination of the limits of the uncertainty in

this and other cases, and for the demonstration of the accuracy of the various and often deli

cate approximations involved In the problem, I can only refer to the memoirs containing the

entire solution.                                           k2

perature of the Interior of the globe to be due to its original heat. For in
such case the increase of temperature in descending must be nearly propor
tional to the depth (as it is observed to be near the surface), so long as the
ratio which the depth bears to the earth's radius is sufficiently small ; and the
rate of increase determined by observation is such that the temperature at
depths much less than the thickness of the solid shell according to the results
above obtained, would probably be far greater than the temperature of fu
sion for the matter forming the crust of the globe, under the ordinary atmo
spheric pressure. In other words, the thickness of the solid crust would, in
such case, be very small instead of being large, as it must be according to
our previous determination. Allowing then the correctness of that deter
    mination, and supposing that it should be hereafter determined by experiment
i that high pressure has no appreciable effect in increasing the temperature of

fusion, we must necessarily conclude that the existing terrestrial temperature

cannot be due to the earth's original heat. But let us suppose that pressure
does affect the temperature of fusion ; then as the depth increases we shall
have with the increased tendency of heat to prevent solidification, an increased
tendency of pressure to promote

higher temperature, and            manifest, that             the latter tendency always

increase as rapidly as the former, the earth must be solid at all depths, as
well as at the surface. We may consider the terrestrial temperature to in
crease 1° Fahr. for 60 or 70 feet of depth and in order that the tendency
of pressure to promote solidification may increase at the same rate, the tem
perature of fusion for the terrestrial matter must increase   1° for an increase
of pressure on square foot of surface, equal to the weight of column of
Ifwhich the length 60 or 70 feet, and the transverse section one square foot.

    then the temperature of fusion for the matter constituting the globe
should be found to increase by pressure at the rate of 1° Fahr. for an increase
of pressure equivalent to that of about five atmospheres, we might conclude
that the earth must be solid at least to those depths to which the terrestrial

Iftemperature may increase according to the law observed near to the surface.
       the temperature of fusion increase at more rapid rate than here stated
with the increase of pressure, the above conclusion will a fortiori be true

under which solidification would commence at the centre. In this case,

    17. Process of Solidification considered
considered generally the process of the earth's refrigeration and consequent
partial or complete solidification, let us now examine this process somewhat
more in detail, from the time when the superficial incrustation began. This
incrustation may have constituted the very first step in the solidification, or
it may have taken place after the formation of a solid nucleus surrounded by

Ia superficial fluid envelope, according as the solidification began at the sur

face or centre ; but in either case, as have already intimated, the super
ficial crust when first formed must necessarily have reposed on a fluid mass
beneath. Let us conceive a thin incrustation to have been formed ; the
escape of the elastic gases would then be arrested, and their tension would
consequently increase, till their elastic force should be sufficient to rupture
the containing crust. Thus refrigeration would constantly tend to augment
the thickness and strength of the crust, while the elastic vapours would tend
to break it up, and, so long as the crust remained sufficiently thin, innume
rable dislocations would probably take place, but without leaving any dis
coverable traces behind them, on account of the dislocated masses, unlike

stratified beds, having no character to indicate their original undisturbed
positions. As the resisting power of the crust increased, and the elastic power
of the gases diminished in consequence of diminished temperature, it would
require longer periods of time for that accumulation of the vapours which
would be necessary to give them elevating force sufficient to raise and dislo
cate the superincumbent crust. By the action of irregular causes, some por
tions of the crust would doubtless become more compact and unbroken, and
                           ; so that while the former might be able to resist
others   more dislocated    forces, the latter might long remain subject to    the '
efforts  of the elevating                                                      re-

peated disturbance and fracture. Moreover, when this distinction between

the more tranquil and more disturbed portions of the solid crust should have
been once established, other causes also would tend to perpetuate it. For
the dislocated portions, while the crust was comparatively thin, would doubt
less contain many internal cavities, some of which would form receptacles
for elastic vapours, and others by their communication with the external sur
face would act as volcanic vents ; and thus the internal vapours would ascend
with more active energy beneath the fractured portions of the crust than
under those which remained comparatively unbroken. The gases formed
beneath the unbroken crust would, in part at least, ascend obliquely towards
the regions of easier escape, and thus while they would leave the upper part
of the fluid mass immediately beneath the unbroken parts of the crust in
comparative repose, they would assist in keeping the fluid mass under the
dislocated portions of the crust in a state of greater ebullition. Under such
circumstances, it is manifest that the solidification would proceed more
rapidly beneath the undisturbed than beneath the disturbed portions of the
crust, and the tendency would be to increase and perpetuate the distinction
between them as above asserted. Moreover the eruptions of a paroxysmal
character, which, it may be presumed, would take place from time to time,
would not only produce a temporary interruption of the process of solidifica
tion, but would also destroy by a great disturbance of the mass in which it
should occur, much of what might have been effected in the incipient stages
of the process during a previous state of repose.

the solid envelope, would form what may be described as inverted hollows in
its lower surface. Let us first take the hypothesis of a previously existing
solid central nucleus. The thicker undisturbed portions of the solid shell
would become united with it by continued solidification, before the more
disturbed parts would become so, and thus the hollows above mentioned
would become cavities more or less determinate, bounded in all directions by
solid rocks, and filled with fluid matter. Their horizontal dimensions might

in the first instance be very large, but continued refrigeration would not only
tend to diminish them, but also to divide each cavity into a number of smaller
ones, by a process exactly similar to that by which these larger cavities were
themselves formed from the general fluid mass, the position of each minor
cavity being determined by the points in the roof of the larger one where
previous fractures had left the most perfect volcanic vents. By a continua
tion of this process it is obvious that the superficial crust of our globe must
    at length arrive at what I conceive, for reasons above assigned (art. 2), to be
/ its present condition, that of a solid mass containing numerous cavities filled
with fluid incandescent matter, and either entirely insulated or perhaps com

municating in some cases by obstructed channels.
The above explanation would manifestly be equally applicable whatever may
have been the process by which the globe may be conceived to have arrived

envelope. Poisson seems to have thought it probable that the earth had
long lost all traces of its original heat, and that the present terrestrial tem
perature was due to the circumstance of the solar system having passed
through a region of space in which the temperature was much higher than

in that which the system now occupies. It would require an extension of
the hypothesis which might perhaps considerably increase the difficulty of
admitting its probability, to suppose the superficial portions of the earth to
have been thus reduced to a state of fusion ; but whether we suppose this

state of superficial fusion to have been produced by this or any other con

Ifceivable cause, the validity of the above reasoning will remain the same.

       we take the hypothesis of the solidification having commenced at
the surface, the preceding reasoning ("art. 16) will still be applicable to
account for the solidification of the roofs and walls of cavities like those above

mentioned, but we have here no previously existing solid nucleus to form
their floors. The efficiency of the ascending vapours in preserving the
fluidity immediately beneath the fractured portions of the crust will be at least
as great in this case as in the former ; to account for the formation of a solid
floor .beneath the part of the fluid mass whose fluidity is thus maintained, we
must assume that at a certain depth the pressure would be sufficient to pre
vent the generation and ascent of elastic vapours, though, by hypothesis, the
effect of pressure in preventing solidification must be much less in the case
we are considering than in that of the preceding urticle. Admitting this
assumption of a limit beneath which the pressure would prevent the forma
tion of elastic gases, it is manifest that the fluid mass below that limit would

solidify when its temperature became sufficiently reduced, viz. when the so
lidification of the portions forming the solid walls of the cavity had reached
that limit. At greater depths the solidification would not be interrupted by
the causes hitherto specified, and would therefore (unless other and unknown
causes should operate) produce a continuous solid mass, while above the
limit just mentioned the solidity would be interrupted by portions of the mass
still in a state of fluidity.
According to the mode of solidification here contemplated (that in which
ON THE THEORIES OF ELEVATION AND EARTHQUAKES. 55

the process begins at the surface of the general mass), the effect of increased
pressure at greater depths, in promoting solidification, must be less than that
of increased temperature in preventing while the formation of solid floors
to the internal cavities, according to the above reasoning, requires that thea
effect of increased pressure at greater depths in preventing the generation ofis
elastic gases should be greater than that of increased temperature in proit,

moting it. These assumptions may not be inconsistent with each other,
though they may be regarded, perhaps, so far opposed to each other as to
diminish materially the degree of probability belonging to the theory which
essentially involves them. The theory which supposes the solidification of
the earth to have commenced at the centre, assumes the efficiency of great
pressure both in promoting solidification and preventing the generation of

elastic gases, and therefore involves no such possible inconsistency as that

now indicated.

18. In the previous reasoning, as applied either to the case of the solidifi
cation beginning at the centre, or to that in which begins at the surface,
   supposed that though the constant state of motion in which the superficiala              a it

particles of the general fluid mass were maintained by the ascent and escapeit
is

                                it a
of elastic gases, ceased to be sufficient to preserve the fluidity at the surface
at the time of the incipient superficial incrustation, still, that the same cause

was sufficient at subsequent epochs to arrest, in great degree, the process
of solidification immediately beneath the dislocated portions of the crust.
This may possibly present itself as a difficulty; but we may remark that the
external temperature to which the external surface at the time of incipient
incrustation would be exposed, would be very much lower than that to which,
after the formation of thin superficial crust, the portion of the fluid mass
immediately beneath would be exposed. Consequently
                                                              a  much less agi

tation of the fluid particles among themselves produced by the ascent of
vapours, would suffice to arrest the process of solidification than that which

would be necessary to prevent its commencement. Again, previously to the
superficial incrustation, the elastic vapours would have an equally free egress
from every point of the general surface, whereas, after the formation of
crust, this egress would be restricted to particular localities to which the
ascending streams of vapours would converge in their ascent, and thus be
come by their union more effective in arresting solidification in those locali
ties, as already explained. At later periods, also, another change in the
conditions of the mas3 would take place, which might be of considerable im
portance. When the solidification of the surface began, the whole of the
present fluid matter on the globe must have existed in gaseous state in the
form of an atmosphere, producing at every point of the surface pressure
enormous as compared with the present atmospheric pressure. Allowing,
therefore, the influence of pressure in preventing the generation of elastic

19. Hypothesis of the former nebulosity ofthe Solar Systems--To those who
are disposed to admit the adequacy of the evidence                                  in favour of the former
fluidity of the earth, another question will naturally                              present itself, --Was the

state of fluidity its primitive state, or did the matter composing it pass from
Ifan anterior gaseous state to the state of fluidity above contemplated ?                             that
matter was once combined with a quantity of heat sufficient to hold it in a
state of fusion, why should it not at a previous time have been maintained
by still greater heat in the state of an elastic vapour ? The one hypothesis,
considered merely as such, is as admissible as the other ; but here we should
be careful to observe the difference between the force of the evidence above
          in support of the                                                           of all equally

by extending the analogy to existing nebulosities generally,                                has doubtless

been weakened  the fact, that the more our telescopic power of vision has

been perfected, the greater has been the number of nebulae which have been

                               Section I. Theories of Elevation.

   IThe theory of elevation which shall now proceed to explain may be

regarded as independent of the speculative views which have been developed
in the first Part of this Report, if we commence with certain hypotheses re
specting the constitution of the superficial portion of the earth's mass. With
this view of the subject, the fundamental hypothesis would be, that portions
of the solid crust of the earth, which, in some cases, were of large horizontal
dimensions, had reposed, at some past epochs, on fluid matter capable of
exerting an expansive force on the superincumbent solid masses sufficient to
elevate and dislocate them. The superficial boundaries of each particular
area which has thus been elevated, are supposed to have been determined
either by the greater thickness and consequent stability of the crust beyond
the limits of the disturbed district ; or by the boundaries of the fluid masses
themselves, supposing them to have existed as internal lakes without free

intercommunication through a general fluid nucleus, or by other means. It
is immaterial to this theory how this state of the globe may have been pro

Iduced, whether it was a primitive state or one derived from an anterior state

by the operation of natural causes. It is desirable think, in the actual
state of geological knowledge, to place the theory in this distinct and inde
pendent point of view. At the same time we should deprive the science of
some of its most interesting speculations, if we were to assume the non-exist
ence of physical causes active in producing physical phenomena, at epochs
anterior to that at which we are here commencing in the history of our

planet.

                         § Primary Phenomena of Elevation.
   20. State of Tension of the Elevated Mass It is not essential to this

theory that we should suppose the subjacent fluid to have been confined to
internal lakes ; it is only necessary that portions of the crust around the con
fines of the disturbed district should have been sufficiently firm to resist the
effect of the elevating forces which dislocated the thinner and weaker part
of the crust within the boundaries of the elevation. The condition however

may perhaps be more distinctly conceived if we suppose the fluid mass to

have been contained in determinate and separate cavities, though it might
be equally well satisfied by the state of the internal surface of the solid crust
described in articles 16 and 17, previous to the completion of a distinct
cavity by the formation of solid floors.

   Supposing the subjacent fluid to expand by the generation of elastic
vapour, the portion of the crust within the boundaries thus defined, would
be acted on by the expansive force of the fluid, producing a hydrostatic
pressure, which would be approximately equal at every point of the lower
surface of the solid mass elevated by supposing the elastic force of the
fluid to increase by the continuous and not by the sudden and instantaneous
58 REPORT -- 1847.

generation of the elastic vapour, so that the action of the force should not
assume the character of an explosion. The portion of the solid crust ected
on may, as a simplification of the problem, be first considered of uniform
thickness and of uniform density.
Under these conditions the crust, when acted on by a sufficient fluid pres
sure beneath, would first be elevated through a certain space without dis
location, since it would possess some degree of extensibility. Let us conceive
it elevated into that position in which it should be just on the point of dis
location, so that by the smallest additional elevation fissures would begin to
be formed. The boundary of the elevated district would then be strictly
defined by the line beyond which the crust had suffered no sensible disturb
ance, and which may be regarded as identical with the superficial line which
would mark the boundary of the internal lake. Under these circumstances
the case presents to us a determinate mechanical problem. The principal
points which offer themselves for determination are those connected with

the tension to which the mass would become subjected by its elevation.
With respect to this tension there are certain general propositions which
would hold independently of the particular conditions of the problem, and
of which it is important to have a distinct conception, both in the present
problem and in one which will present itself to us in the following section.
To explain these propositions, as far as may be necessary for our immediate
purpose, conceive a plane of indefinitely small given area (*) to have its mid
dle point coincident with  any proposed point (P) in the     interior of a   solid
mass having some degree    of extensibility, and in a state  of constraint,   like

that, for instance, of our elevated mass. The particles in contact with each
other, but on opposite sides of this small geometrical plane, will act on each

other, and the resulting force between them may be represented by ps.
The forcepand the angle which its direction makes with a perpendicular
to the plane will vary with the angular position of the plane ; but there are
always three positions of the plane in which the direction of the force and
the perpendicular to the plane will coincide. The three corresponding
directions of the perpendicular are called principal directions, and the three
corresponding values of p are called principal tensions or pressures. These
directions are perpendicular to each other ; and of the principal tensions, one
is always a maximum, and another a minimum, with reference to the dif
ferent values of the tensions at P, in different directions through that point.
In the case of the elevated but still unbroken crust above-mentioned, two of
the principal directions, one of which would be the direction of maximum
tension, would be approximately parallel to the surface and the third per

pendicular to it.  of Fissures. -- In  considering the  formation  of fissures,
    21. Formation

which are here termed the primary phenomena of elevation, we must direct
our attention to that state of the uplifted mass in which it is just on the point
of dislocation, which would be the case at the instant when the maximum
Iftension at some point (P,) just became equal to the cohesive power at that
point.  the tension were then increased by any indefinitely small quantity,

the cohesion would be overcome, and a fissure would begin to be formed;

and it is sufficiently manifest that a plane perpendicular to the direction of
maximum tension at P, would be a tangent plane to the fissure, or what we

may term the plane of the fissure at that point. Thus, if the direction of

maximum tension at any point where a fissure begins were known, the plane
of the incipient fissure would be also known. Such planes in the particular
case before us would be approximately vertical, since the direction of maxi
mum tension would be approximately horizontal.
        ON THE THEORIES OF ELEVATION AND EARTHQUAKES. 59

The points at which the formation of fissures would begin will frequently
not be determinable by calculation, because there might be an indefinite
number of points at which (under the assumed condition of the perfect
homogeneity of the mass) the maximum tension might become equal to the
cohesive power at the same instant, in which case a fissure would be Just as
likely to begin at one of these points as another. In actual cases, where the
condition of homogeneity could only be approximately satisfied, the points
of incipient dislocation would be partly determined by accidental circum
stances. The planes of such dislocations at any assigned point would, as
above explained, be strictly determinate in position.
The direction of propagation is the next point to be considered in the
formation of fissures. When a fissure had begun to be formed there would
be a very rapid modification of the state of tension in its immediate neigh*
bourhood, but if the fissure should be propagated through portions of the

mass in which the maximum tensions at every point had become nearly equal
to the cohesive power, previously to the commencement of any dislocation,
it is easily shown that the position of the plane of the fissure at every point
(P), through which it would be propagated as well as at the point (P,) at
which it would commence, would be at least approximately perpendicular to

the direction of maximum tension at (P), at the instant before the formation
of the fissure begun at P^ Hence the direction of maximum tension at
each point being known at the instant previous to the commencement of
fracture, the position of the fissure subsequently formed could be very ap
proximately determined. The velocity with which the fissure would be pro
pagated in such case would be very great.
   The intensity of the instantaneous tension at any point of the mass would

be different for different directions through that point, and would vary con
Iftinuously with the variation of direction, from its maximum to its minimum
value.  there should be little difference between the greatest and least

tensions, the tendency to form a fissure would not be much greater in one
direction than in another, and therefore the direction of a fissure might, in
such case, be easily affected by accidental circumstances, which, on the con

trary, would have comparatively little effect if the maximum were much
greater than the minimum tension at each point. In the former case the
permanence of direction in tho fissure would be much smaller than in the
latter.

  If the cohesive power of the mass should vary continuously in passing
from one point to another, but should remain the same in all directions

through each point, the position of a fissure would be the same as if the
cohesive power were the same for every point Neither would the position
be affected by a discontinuous variation of cohesive power along planes per

pendicular to the direction of maximum tension. Thus, if the fissure were
propagated vertically, it would not be affected by the discontinuous varia
Iftion of cohesion in passing from one horizontal bed to another.

great number of internal planes and surfaces of discontinuity without any

   22. Formation

from the instant a fissure should commence, a modification of the state of
tension of the mass in the immediate vicinity would take place almost instan
taneously. A similar modification would be propagated very rapidly to
points more remote, but still a finite time would be requisite for this pur
pose. The formation of the fissure would, in fact, cause a vibration like
those which will be fully described in the succeeding section, and the corre
sponding modification of the tensions would be propagated with the same
velocity as the vibration itself. Now let us conceive two fissures to com
mence simultaneously at two different points in a straight line, which we
will suppose to coincide with the direction of maximum tension at each
point. The velocities of propagation of the two fissures, as already stated,
would generally be very great, exceeding possibly that of a vibration, and

therefore, if these velocities were nearly equal, either fissure would arrive at

each point through which it would be successively propagated, before the
tension at that point could have been relaxed by the formation of the parallel
fissure. If, on the contrary, the velocity of propagation of one fissure should
be considerably greater than that of the other, the tension on either side of

the one formed most rapidly, might become so relaxed at points through

which the one formed more slowly was tending to pass, that the propagation
of the latter fissure might be entirely arrested. If, instead of two fissures,
any number should commence simultaneously, the same remarks would
apply to their propagation ; and thus we may conceive the simultaneous
formation of a system of fissures characterized by a degree of parallelism to
each other, dependent on the parallelism which existed between the direc
tions of the maximum tensions at different points at the instant previous to
the incipient dislocation of the mass.

   Immediately after the completion of this system of fissures, it is manifest
that all tension in directions perpendicular to the plane of a fissure and in

its immediate vicinity, would be destroyed; and therefore (assuming the
absence of pressure in this stage of the process of elevation ) the direction of
maximum tension there would then become parallel to the fissure. Conse

quently, if the tension should go on increasing in consequence of a continua
tion of the elevation, till it became greater than the cohesion, another system
of fissures might be formed, such that each fissure should be approximately
perpendicular to each fissure of the previous system at the point of their in

tersection.

   We may here remark that the formation of systems of fissures as above
described, would be most likely to take place in those cases in which, at the
instant of the formation of the fissures, the elevation should be as rapid as
should be consistent with a continuous, as distinguished from an explosive

considered as a mechanical theory, consists in our inability to determine by
accurate mathematical investigation, the principal directions of tension for
any but the most simple forms of the boundary of the elevated district In
a geological point of view, however, the defect is of little importance ; for

knowing the principal directions in certain simple cases, we can obtain them

by inference in such more complicated cases as usually present themselves,

to a degree of approximation sufficient for all geological purposes. Thus
suppose the elevated district bounded by two parallel straight lines, and to
be of indefinite length. It is manifest, assuming as heretofore the homo
ON THE THEORIES OF ELEVATION AND EARTHQUAKES. 61

geneity of the mass and the uniformity of the elevating pressure, that the
principal directions would be parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the
district, the former being that of maximum tension, and the latter that of
minimum tension, which, in this instance, would be zero. Consequently
the system of fissures first formed in this case would be longitudinal or
parallel to the axis of the elevation. Again, if the boundary of the elevated
district were circular, it is sufficiently manifest from the conditions of sym
metry, that one principal direction at any point would lie in a vertical sec
Iftion through that point and the summit of the elevation ; and another would
be perpendicular to that section.  the vertical axis of the elevation should
be perforated, as in the case of a volcanic mountain by its vent, it is easily
seen that, in the higher part of the elevation, the tensions in the latter direc
tions would be the most efficient in forming fissures, of which a system

Ifmight thus be formed radiating from the central point of the elevated mass.

       the area of the elevated district be bounded by an oval more or less
elongated, the case will be intermediate to the two former above considered ;
and it is not difficult to see that the two principal directions of tension
would not generally be parallel and perpendicular to the longer axis of the
district as in the first case, nor would they be exactly like those in the
second, but would form two systems of lines of an intermediate character.
This would also be true with respect to the resulting systems of fissures.
Moreover, as in the two first and extreme cases, the two systems of fissures
(if both were formed) would coincide, the one with the dip and the other

with the strike of the elevated beds, at the instant when their formation com
menced; so the intermediate character of these systems in the intermediate
case of the oval area will render the same rule approximately applicable to
Ifthat case also.

       the irregularities in the line of boundary of the elevated district be great
in proportion to its whole area, it is impossible to lay down any general rule
for the directions of the fissures. The influence however of irregularities
of the boundary is not likely to be very sensible throughout the whole cen
tral portion of an extensive disturbed area, to which therefore the above rule
will generally be applicable.
But here it may be asked, how are the directions of the dip and strike at
the instant of incipient formation of the fissures to be determined. In
answer to this it should be observed, that the general directions of the dip
and strike of the beds at the epoch just mentioned would depend, in the
assumed absence of considerable difference of intensity of the elevating force
at different points, on the form of the boundary of the elevated area, and
can be approximately determined when that form, provided it be not too
irregular, is known. We may also observe that the continuance of the ele
vation after the formation of the primary fissures, whatever might be the
local effects, would not generally affect in any great degree the mean strike
of the elevated beds, which would always tend to parallelism or perpendi
cularity to the two primary systems of fissures respectively. The formation
of anticlinal ridges might alter the magnitude of the dip, or might reverse
its direction, but these circumstances will not affect the application of the

preceding rule.
Hence then it may be laid down as an approximate rule of very general
application, deducible from the theory we have been developing, that two

systems of fissures may result from the simultaneous elevation of an extensive
area, and such tliat the mean direction of the fissures in one system, at any
point of that area, shall approximately coincide with the mean direction of the
strike, and in the ot/ter system with that of the dip of the elevated beds at tfte
proposed point.
G2 REPORT -- 1847.

IfThe more nearly the elevating force shall have acted with uniform inten
sity, the more approximately will the above rule be applicable.       the force
should act with greater intensity, oc the resistance to it should be less, at
particular points of the elevated district, it forms a part of the general inves
tigation to determine the consequent variations in the directions of the pri
mary fissures. I shall not enter however into any discussion of this part of
Ithe problem ; the details already given will suffice to explain the general
principle on which this Theory of Elevation is founded.               shall merely
observe with respect to these variations in the directions of the primary
fissures, that they will usually be such as still to render the preceding rule

approximately applicable, though the approximation may be less accurate in
this than in the case of uniform intensity of the elevating force.

             § Secondary Phamomena of Elevation.

   24. The formation of anticlinal ridges and valleys, faults, dykes, tec, by
the continued action of the elevating force after the primary dislocation of

the uplifted mass, is easily conceived. The fissures, as already stated, are
the primary plwenomena ; the secondary phenomena are such as those just
mentioned. Their distinctive characters will obviously depend in a great
                                                                The same parallelism
measure on   the fissures from which they are derived.         systems of fissures, or
             have shown, must frequently characterize
which, as I

the divergency which will distinguish them in particular cases, will equally
characterize the secondary phenomena derived from them, and the law above
enunciated connecting the directions of fissures with those of the dip and
strike of the elevated beds, will be equally applicable to faults, dykes, mine
ral veins, &c. Though such laws may be frequently masked in some de
gree by the operation of irregular causes, the careful observer may always
expect to find them more or less distinctly developed. For examples of the
Iapplication of the theory to the explanation of such secondary phasnomena
as those above mentioned,   may refer to my memoir ' On the Elevation of

the Weald and Bas Boulonnais, vol. vii. of the Transactions of the Geolo
gical Society, and to a paper ' On the Elevation and Denudation of the
Lake Districts of Cumberland and Westmoreland,' read before the Geologi

cal Society some time ago.
Though it is unnecessary to dwell on the theoretical explanation of the
Imore common of the secondary phenomena, there are a few to which, as

being of more difficult explanation, may here direct attention.

   To account for this law, let fig. 2 represent a vertical section of an ele
vated district, perpendicular to the direction of the longitudinal fissures, at
the instant the formation of those fissures is completed, and previous to any
relative displacement by further elevation. The planes of the fissures will

seldom be exactly vertical, and would generally meet if sufficiently produced.
They will consequently divide the mass into complete or truncated wedges.

Under these circumstances it is evident that the subjacent fluid, by the intu
mescence of which the elevation is supposed to be effected, will exert a
pressure on the wedge-like portions whose broadest end is downwards,
greater in proportion to their mass, than on those whose narrowest end is
downwards, while no direct pressure of the fluid may act at all on those
portions which form complete wedges. Consequently the continued action
of the elevating force will produce a relative elevation of those portions of
the mass which present the broader surfaces to the fluid pressure, and the
whole will immediately assume the form represented in fig. 3. These rela

tive displacements, after the levelling of the surface by denudation, will
be shown by the relative positions of different portions of a stratified bed

neath. The general elevated mass would thus tend to descend by its own
weight, but would manifestly be unable to subside into its original position
Ifon account of the relative displacements of its wedge-like portions.                the

fluid pressure should be entirely removed, and the whole mass, together
with its lateral abutments, should be sufficiently firm, it would be supported
on the principle of the arch. In this case an enormous horizontal pressure
would be produced. Generally, the fluid pressure might probably be only
partially destroyed ; the more it should approximate to the extreme case just
mentioned, the greater would be the horizontal pressure, which might thus
become much greater than the vertical pressure to which any portion of the
Ifuplifted mass could possibly be subjected.

       the elevation should be continued to a much greater extent than sup
posed in the above case, the fissures would be widened, and afford room for
far more irregular and varied modes of subsidence after the great effort of
the elevating force had ceased, than would be possible in cases of smaller
disturbance. Let fig. 4 represent a transverse section of a disturbed district
across three primary longitudinal fissures, nearly at the instant of its greatest

elevation, and therefore previous to any considerable subsequent subsidence.

                                    Fig. 4.

If the intumescence of the subjacent fluid, and consequently its supporting
power, were immediately afterwards diminished by the escape of elastic
vapours, there would be an immediate subsidence, which, in cases of vio
lent disturbance, would probably be governed in a great degree by acci
dental circumstances. Thus it might happen that the two central portions
should be so brought in contact with the neighbouring lateral portions about
the points N and N', as to be prevented from subsiding except by turning
round those points as pivots, the lateral portions receiving some accidental
Ifsupport not afforded to the central ones. In such case the two central
masses would be brought into contact at M.                     the masses should be nearly
equal, similar, and similarly situated, the resultant pressure between them

would be approximately horizontal. Let MR be the direction of the pres
sure on the mass PS, and NQ a perpendicular on MR. Then the support
ing power of this force would be measured by the product of the force and

line NQ. Also, if G be the centre of gravity of the mass PS, GH vertical,

66 REPORT -- 1847.

In these explanations the elevated mass may be supposed to have been
Iffissured, either previously to the movement which we have been more espe
cially considering, or during that movement.  they were formed, as they
might be, by the subsidence, and not during the elevation, those at A and
A' (figs. 4, 5), and that at A (fig. 6) would commence at the surface, and
would be propagated downwards only to a certain depth, beyond which
the horizontal pressure would prevent their further progress. The fissure at
S (figs. 4, 5, 6) would proceed from below upwards, till their propagation
should be arrested in like manner by the horizontal pressure. In such

cases, if a sufficient quantity of matter should be subsequently carried away
by denuding agents, the external surface might be left without any trace of
such fissures as those at A and A', but presenting all the effects of intense
horizontal pressure without vertical dislocation in the portions of the mass
 n which those effects would be exhibited.

   It has already been intimated that it is necessary to suppose the lateral
masses respectively on the left of AN and on the right of A'N' (figs. 4, 5)
to have been better supported at the instant of their highest elevation,
than the intermediate portions; and the same supposition is necessary in

the case represented in fig. 6, with reference to the mass on the left of
AN. It should be remarked, however, that the support required would only
be necessary for the extremely short time (a few minutes, or possibly a few
seconds only) necessary to determine the manner in which the subsidence
would take place. This instantaneous support may probably be best re

ferred to accidental causes.

   It may perhaps be thought that the supposition of great subsidence imme
diately consequent on great elevation, is not essential to account for the

effects attributed to subsidence in the preceding explanations, since these

effects might bo referred t6 the direct action of the elevating force. But,
in order thus to account for those effects, it would seem necessary to sup
pose the elevating force to have acted with much greater intensity along
certain lines than along other lines very near and parallel to them. Thus,
for example, in the case represented in fig. 5, it would be necessary to
make the supposition (or an equivalent one) that the force had acted with
much greater intensity along the two anticlinal lines perpendicular to the

plane of the section and passing respectively through A and A', than along
the intermediate synclinal line through M -- an hypothesis so restrictive and
arbitrary as to render any theory reposing on it of no value as a physical
explanation of the phaenomena of elevation. The explanation above given
requires no such restrictive hypothesis, but merely assumes the instanta
neous influence of those local and irregular causes which must always be
called into action in mechanical operations like those we are considering.

It should also be recollected, that in the theory more immediately before us,
the agency by which elevation has been usually produced, is supposed to
have been that of an intumescent fluid mass, a supposition so strongly sanc
tioned by numerous observed phaenomena, that no point of geological theory

can, perhaps, be regarded as more completely established ; in such case, any

law of linearity in the action of the elevating force, like that above men
tioned, would seem to be impossible. Moreover, the theory appeals to ex

isting volcanic masses as affording by analogy the strongest reason to believe
that the intumescence of the fluid mass must have been due to the elastic
gases generated within it; and it also appeals, in support of the same con
clusion, to the absence of any other cause hitherto suggested, adequate to

produce the intumescence in question. But if these hypotheses be admitted,

subsidence immediately after considerable and sudden elevation must be re

arbitrary and independent assumption ; for the escape of the elastic vapours,
and frequently of the intumescent fluid itself, through the fissures of the up

stratum which afterwards becomes folded, as represented by the continuous
lines, each fold being approximately symmetrical with reference to a ver
tical line through its vertex. Such at least will be the general type of the
folds, independently of irregular causes which may modify their form.

   In the next place, let us suppose the strata inclined to the horizon as re
presented by the dotted-lines in fig. 8, the compression still being horizontal.

The folds will then be such as indicated by the continuous lines. One
side of each fold is here much longer than the other.

Again, it is immediately seen by inspecting the figs. 4, 5, that the com
pressing horizontal forces acting on the central and subsiding masses PS and
P'S' must distort each mass from its original form, in such a manner that if
the vertical sections of those masses when undisturbed were rectangular, the
angles at P and S, and at P' and S' would become acute, and the other

angles obtuse, by the distortion produced by compression. The compres
sion of the rectangular mass PMSN (fig.
would not destroy its rectangularity ; but if  8)   has been supposed   such  as

represented, the axis of each fold being inclined to the vertical, and dipping
in the same direction as the uncompressed beds.

    The flexures which have been directly contemplated in the above expla
nation are those on a scale comparatively small, but the same explanation
would be applicable to those on any larger scale. The mechanical cause
of the phenomena, according to this view of the subject, is horizontal pres
sure ; the unsymmetrical character of the folds in fig. 8 is attributable to
the oblique position of the beds with reference to the horizontal direction
of the compressing force ; and the inclination of the axes of the folds as
represented in fig. 9, is due to that action of the compressing forces by
which the form of the whole mass containing the folded strata has been
twisted and distorted from its original form, as above described. This
oblique character of flexures on a large scale, has been particularly observed

by Professors W. and H. Rogers in their interesting description of the Apa-

lachian Chain*.

large that the vertices of any of them might be cut off by denudation, while
the lower portion should penetrate to a sufficient depth to conceal the in
verted curvature, the strata might present the character of inverted and not
that of folded strata. Instead, however, of such a mass as PS (fig. 6)
being compressed into folded strata, and retaining the general position re
presented in the diagram, the whole might, as already intimated, be com
pletely turned under the lateral contiguous mass, and thus present an
instance of inverted stratification on a much larger scale than that which
would probably result from the folds in the manner just mentioned.

§ Thickness of the Fractured Portions of the Earth's Crust.

    29. The preceding investigations may enable us to form some conjecture
respecting the thickness of those portions of the earth's crust which have
been elevated and dislocated in the manner represented in figs. 4, 5, 6. In
considering the two masses PS and P'S' (fig. 5), an obvious difficulty pre
sents itself in conceiving how there can be sufficient space to admit of
their turning into the positions there represented. In fact, this angular

movement necessarily requires either that the distance AA' should be con

siderably increased by the upheaval, or that the masses should become so
compressed that the sum of their diagonals MN, MN' should be reduced to
Iflittle more than the original lengths of the sides MP, MP'. Similar remarks
will apply to the case of fig. 6.             PM should be considerably greater
than the depth MS, the angular movement offers no difficulty either in a
geometrical or mechanical sense; for then the sides MP, MP' would ap

proximate more nearly to equality with the two diagonals, and the support
ing power would become less able to counteract the tendency of the force
of gravity to communicate the angular movement in question. If, on the

                                                                       I conceive, be

into the relative positions represented in fig. 5. Now cases are probably
not unfrequent in which anticlinal and synclinal lines occur with alterna
tions of opposite and rapid dips, at intervals not exceeding a few miles. In
such cases it appears difficult to understand how the elevated crust also can

exceed a very few miles in thickness.

                        § Contraction of the Earth's Crust.
30. It appears to have been the opinion of some geologists that many of
the phenomena of elevation, especially those which have apparently re
quired the action of an intense horizontal force to produce them, might be
best accounted for on the hypothesis of a contraction of the earth's crust
due to the loss of heat by the central nucleus contained within it. This
Iview of the subject however has never assumed that determinate form which
can demand for it here more than a passing notice.                     have shown that the

hypothesis  on which    it rests is           not essential  to account for the most intense
horizontal  pressure ;                        also remark,   that so far from a contraction of
                        and I may
the general elevated area being necpssary to account for phenomena of ele
vation, one of the principal difficulties of the subject consists in conceiving
great angular displacements, such as have been above described, without
supposing the transversal dimensions of the elevated area to have been in
creased instead of diminished.

been put forth respecting contemporaneity in the former sense is that of M.
Elie de Beaumont, according to which all chains of mountains parallel, in a
Icertain sense, to each other, are regarded as being of contemporaneous
origin.  am not aware however that any physical cause has been assigned

for the geometrical law which this theory asserts, and consequently the
examination of the theory does not fall within the province of this Report.
Restricting ourselves to limited areas, we may define as a distinct district,
any area throughout which the phenomena of elevation are connected by a
continuous geometrical law ; and the theory which has been developed in
this section would assert that that elevatory movement, or those successive

movements which impressed on the phenomena thin continuous law, must

have been contemporaneous throughout the whole district. We have seen,
in fact, that the primary fissures must bear certain relations to the form of

the area contemporaneously elevated ; and therefore, if a whole elevated
district were upheaved in separate portions at different times, the primary

fissures could not be grouped according to the same continuous law as if

the whole district had been elevated contemporaneously.
   The question of contemporaneity, with respect to vertical elevation, is one

of more difficult determination. There are probably few geologists disposed
to advocate the extreme opinion that the elevation of each disturbed district
has been effected by one single upheaval, or the opposite opinion, that it has
been the result of an indefinite number of almost infinitesimal movements.

The question may rather be stated to be, whether the existing elevation has
been produced by a small number of comparatively great and decisive
movements, or by a greater though not an indefinite number of smaller ones.
In discussing this question, let us in the first place suppose the elevatory

movement to have been sufficient to uplift the mass a little beyond that
height at which the primary fissures would be formed. We shall then have
the case represented in fig. 3. After the collapse of the dislocated mass, the

different portions would be maintained by friction in their new relative posi
tions. When another upheaval took place a similar effect would be produced,

the relative displacements being increased at each successive upheaval ; and
thus any observed amount of vertical displacement may be as easily con
ceived to have been the result of a great number of smaller displacements,
as of a smaller number of greater movements. In the same manner equal
horizontal pressures might be called into action, and therefore equal relative
horizontal displacements might be produced in both these modes of elevation.
   The only kind of displacement, in addition to those which are vertical or
horizontal, which any portion of the disrupted mass could receive, would be
that arising from its angular movement. Now at each small upheaval a
small displacement of this kind might be given to any portion, only differing
from those represented in fig. 5, in being very small. But here it must be
observed that, on the collapse and subsidence of the mass, the horizontal

forces, as already explained, would exert an enormous power to restore
contiguous portions of the mass to their original angular positions relatively
to each other. And this constitutes the great difference between this case
and the previous one, in which the forces necessarily called into action would
be as effective in preserving each successive small vertical displacement, as
they would be in destroying each small angular displacement in the case we
are now considering. Where any single displacement should be sufficiently
great, we have seen (art. 26.) that there might be only a small tendency, or
even no tendency at all to restore the displaced mass to its original angular
position ; but that tendency would become greater as the angular disturbance

should be smaller ; and hence, the probability that a great angular displace
ON THE THEORIES OF ELEVATION AND EARTHQUAKES.

ment should result from a great number of small movements is extremely
small compared with that of its resulting from a small number of greater

Imovements.

   It must, think, be allowed that these considerations furnish powerful

evidence in favour of the theory which regards those existing elevations
which have been accompanied by great angular displacements of the elevated
beds, as the results of movements, some at least of which must have been

of great magnitude. It should also be observed that the number of up
heavals of this kind, in the same district, may have been much greater than
the existing elevation of the district may seem to imply ; for each of these

upheavals might be, and according to the previous reasoning, almost neces
sarily would be accompanied by subsidences of corresponding magnitude,
and existing elevations can only be the result of the upheavals combined
with the accompanying subsidences.
Throughout this theory it is assumed, that though the elevating force may
have acted with variable intensity, or may have encountered a variable re
Ifsistance at different points of an elevated area at the same instant, such vari
ations have not been generally rapid and irregular.         however we adopt
any other hypothesis, it may be doubted whether we can diminish the diffi
culty of conceiving how any great angular displacement can have been given
throughout extensive areas, to masses so thick as those which have un
doubtedly in many instances been elevated, without supposing such displace
                                                            upheaval. It
ment to have been    accompanied   by great instantaneous                 should
also be recollected                this particular kind of  displacement   could
                     that even if
be accounted for more easily by means of the hypothesis of any irregular
action of the elevating force, the hypothesis would be inadmissible in all
those cases in which the general phenomena of elevation should approximate
to determinate geometrical laws. Instances may exist in which the phe
nomena present no such approximation, but such can scarcely be considered
objects of theoretical investigation. The theory we have been considering
professes to offer an explanation of the various phenomena of elevation, so

far, and of course so far only, as they may be characterized by distinct ap

proximations to certain geometrical laws, by referring the phenomena to a
simple and general cause -- an elevating force acting as already described
with a certain approximation to uniformity of intensity, but modified by
particular conditions of the elevated mass, and by accidental causes called

into action during the resulting movements. It is only so far as this or any
other theory may accomplish this object, that any real value can attach to
it as a physical theory.

   § Slow Movements of Elevation and Depression, and their Relations to

                                        Paroxysmal Movements.

    32. According to the preceding views, the forces which have elevated
and dislocated the earth's crust have originated in the elastic vapours gene
rated in a subjacent fluid mass, in the manner in which such vapours are
known to be generated in existing volcanos. The analogy seems to justify
the conclusion that it would be principally by long accumulation that the
confined vapours would acquire sufficient elastic force to elevate the super
incumbent mass, though we are not sufficiently acquainted with the mode
in which they are generated, and the conditions which may influence the pro
cess, to assert that they might not in certain cases be generated with much
greater rapidity than under the more ordinary conditions to which the ele
vating fluid was formerly, or the existing fluid masses of volcanos are actually
subjected. Admitting however the gradual accumulation of elevating power,
72 REPORT -- 1847.

Ifit is manifest that its first effect would be a gradual, and possibly a slow and
long-continued elevation of the superincumbent crust.  this proceeded
till the crust became dislocated, the process of elevation might then assume
instantaneously a paroxysmal character, in consequence of the sudden dimi
nution of resistance which would result from the dislocation of the mass,
and independently of any sudden increase of intensity in the elevating force.
The degree in which this paroxysmal character would manifest itself, would
depend on the completeness and rapidity of the dislocation, and the amount
of resistance instantaneously destroyed by it. In order that the mass should
be elevated to the point of dislocation, it would be necessary that the up
ward pressure should exceed the weight of the uplifted mass by a force

(which we may denote by F) sufficient to overcome that part of the resist
ance to the movement which depends on the cohesive power of the mass.
Those who are accustomed to mechanical investigations of this kind, will
perceive that the nearly horizontal tension depending on the cohesion acts

at a great mechanical disadvantage in opposition to the nearly vertical fluid

pressure, so that F would probably always be small compared with the
weight of the elevated mass. Still it is easily conceivable that F might be
of sufficient magnitude to produce a great paroxysmal movement. Suppose,
for example, that F should be equal to one-fiftieth of the weight of the mass,
Ifand the dislocation to be so complete as to destroy all sensible effect of
cohesion in impeding the upward movement.  this force continued to

act with uniform intensity for one minute, it would raise the mass through
about 1250 feet; if it acted for two minutes, the elevation would be four
Iftimes as great ; if for three minutes, nine times as great, and so on.  F

were only one-half, one-third, &c. as great as above supposed, the corre
sponding elevations would only be one-half, one-third, &c. as great as those

just specified. It should here be recollected, in estimating the probability
of paroxysmal movements from theoretical considerations, that, in this ex
position, we have taken no account of the possible sudden increase in the
expansive force of the intumescent fluid at the instant of paroxysmal eleva

tion, such as the violent explosions of volcanos would appear to indicate,
Iso long as we can offer no more complete explanation of such explosions than
  think we can at present, without referring them to a comparatively sudden

generation of elastic vapours. At all events, the above examples show how
small an excess of the fluid pressure over the superincumbent weight would

suffice to produce a paroxysmal elevation.

   In those cases in which the elevation assumed a paroxysmal character, the
subsidence immediately consequent upon it would doubtless assume a similar

character, but it is extremely improbable that the downward movement
would immediately cease. On the contrary, the disturbed mass would be
likely to continue to subside very slowly for a long period of time ; and

thus as great dislocating movements must probably have been preceded by
gradual elevation, so it is also probable that they have been generally fol
lowed by gradual depression of the elevated area.

   This theory does not require the recognition of any cause external to
the elevating fluid, as necessary to excite its intumescence, since the ex

citing cause is by hypothesis the original heat to which the fluidity is as
sumed to be due. Still, extraneous and secondary causes are not to be
neglected ; they may be, on the contrary, of great importance. The opera
tions of denudation and deposition may thus exercise an important influence
in the processes of elevation and depression. Let us suppose a sedimentary
mass of several hundreds, or possibly several thousands of feet in thickness,

to have been deposited (as such masses have been) over an extensive area.
ON THE THEORIES OF ELEVATION AND EARTHQUAKES. 73

The tendency of this mass would be to produce a subsidence of the surface
Ifon which the original deposition took place, and on which the whole sedi
mentary mass reposed.  the solid crust of the earth were sufficiently thick,
the depression would probably be insensible ; but if the weight of the sedi
mentary mass acted on a solid crust of large area, but not of a thickness

greater than what we have already shown (art. 29.) to have been the pro
bable thickness of those portions which have been subjected to great angular

displacements, we easily perceive that a slow but considerable subsidence
would, under simple and probable conditions, be the necessary consequence.

   This reasoning would lead us to the conclusion that, in any proposed area,
         of great sedimentary deposition had
periods  Now that such has been actually the  been periods of  gradual subsi
dence.
                                               case, we have,  I conceive, the

most conclusive and independent evidence. The admirable researches of
Professor E. Forbes seem to establish beyond doubt, that comparatively few
species of marine animals are capable of existing in the full exercise of their
animal functions at depths exceeding 1000 or 1200 feet Consequently we
may conclude that during the deposition of a mass of fossiliferous beds,
having a thickness greater than 1000 or 1200 feet, there must have been a
subsidence equal at least to the difference between the actual thickness of

the stratified mass and that just mentioned ; and if the stratification be con

formable throughout, we may also conclude that the depression must have

taken place, not by any paroxysmal movement, but by slow and gradual sub
sidence, a conclusion in exact accordance with that above enunciated.

  Sir John Herschel was the first, I think, to direct attention distinctly to

the possible effect of a great mass of sedimentary deposits, in depressing the
portion of the earth's crust on which it rested. He also suggested the pos
sible influence of the depression of one portion of the crust in producing an
elevation of a neighbouring portion ; and, in fact, if both portions were
superincumbent on the same continuous mass of fluid or semifluid matter,
Isuch elevation would probably be the necessary consequence of the neigh
bouring depression.    am not aware however how far geological observa
tions afford evidence of the synchronism of such opposite movements in

adjoining areas.

  Another consequence of spdimentary deposition was suggested, I believe

contemporaneously and independently, by Sir John Herschel and Mr. Bab-
bage. The temperature of sedimentary matter at the period of its deposi
tion must be approximately that of the superficial temperature of the earth
at the place of deposition, but the effect will be to increase the temperature
of the mass beneath, by causing the rise of the internal isothermal surfaces.
Any subjacent fluid mass would thus receive an accession of temperature

which might again* give to its expansive force sufficient energy to elevate
and dislocate the superincumbent mass. The effectiveness of this cause in

producing elevation, as well as the weight of sedimentary matter in pro
ducing subsidence, would manifestly be increased where the thickness of the
crust should be comparatively small.
   Mr. Babbage has deduced from this rise of the isothermal surfaces, an

explanation of the slow upheaval of large areas, by referring it to the
columnar expansion that must result from the augmentation of temperature
in the subjacent rocks. This deduction however appears to me inadmissi

ble. In the first place, if this theory were true, a period of great sedimen
tary deposition in any assigned area would be a period of elevation, instead
of being (as we have above shown it must have been) a period of depres
sion, since the rise in the isothermal surfaces would necessarily be contem
poraneous with the process of deposition ; and in the second place, the rate
74 REPORT --1847-

of deposition must  generally  have been so   exceedingly        slow when considered
with reference to   extensive   areas, as to  leave little
                                                                 or no doubt, I think,
that the positions of the isothermal surfaces at any proposed time during
the process of deposition would approximate extremely near to that limit

beyond which they could not have passed had the deposition ceased at that
time. In such case, the ascent of the isothermal surfaces and the conse

quent columnar expansion would necessarily cease soon after the deposition
of the whole sedimentary mass was completed, and could never be effective
in raising the surface of the mass above the level of the sea. The theory
would therefore fail to account for the elevation of the surfaces of whole

continents to considerable heights above that level, the only great pheno
menon of elevation, perhaps, which we could profess to account for by
columnar expansion.

Section II. VibratoryraMneoatnionFsorocfetshe--EEaarrtthh'qsuaCkreuss.t produced by Subter

  83. In the preceding articles I have considered the mechanical effects of

subterranean forces in elevating and dislocating the portions of the solid
crust of the earth immediately superincumbent on the fluid matter, in which
the elevatory forces have been supposed to originate. Other mechanical

Ieffects would also result from these sudden dislocations and the explosive

action which would doubtless accompany them. The effects allude to are

the vibratory motions which would be excited in the solid or fluid masses
in the immediate vicinity of the disturbed district, and propagated with great
rapidity to others more remote. In those great disruptions which we have
heretofore contemplated, these vibrations would be of great intensity near

the regions where they originated, and it is possible that they might extend,
in such cases, to very extensive portions of the globe, before their intensity

should become sufficiently weakened to be no longer sensible. These
secondary effects of the great elevating forces which have left so many phae-
nomena as records of their primary effects, not being calculated to produce
any permanent modification of character in the rocks through which the
vibrations were transmitted, are matters of little interest to geologists as re
gards their existence at remote epochs ; but they become, on the contrary,
of especial interest when considered with reference to modern earthquakes.

Many persons have regarded these phaenomena as due in a great measure to
vibrations like those just mentioned*, and the subject has lately been brought
under our notice in a memoir by Mr. Mallet, ' On the Dynamics of Earth
Iquakes' f, in which he has treated it in a more determinate manner, and
in more detail than any preceding writer.                now proceed to consider

the manner in which vibratory motions may be generated and propagated

Igated.    shall therefore commence the following explanations with this
hypothesis. It should also be understood that the results deduced from the

mathematical investigation of the problem depend on the assumption that
the displacement of each vibrating particle from its place of rest, is very
small, an assumption which may be considered as true to a sufficient degree
of approximation in such vibratory motions as those frequently experienced

the tube AB of indefinite length to be filled with atmospheric air, and

have the same properties, the one being propagated to the right and the

to the wave in its uninterrupted progress along the tube, and before it has
been modified by reaching the extremity. We are not immediately con

is passing through them.         They may therefore                        be termed waves of condensa

of the bottom of that part of the canal. The surface of the superincumbent
fluid will be elevated in nearly the same degree, and being then left to itself

then be left at rest. Consequently                                   wave of this kind will be attended by
a current, the velocity of which will depend on the height of the crest of the
wave and the depth of the canal.

    the front of the wave will be steep, the descent from the crest to the pos
    terior boundary being a gradual slope.

       The total difference in the characters of these two waves will be at once
    apparent. In the first case the waves depend entirely on the compressibility
    and elastic force of the fluid, the motions being independent of gravitation ;
· while in the latter the motion depends on gravitation, and is independent
    of the compressibility and elasticity. In ordinary cases the velocity of pro
    pagation is very much greater in the former than in the latter kind of waves.
    In the larger disturbance which is necessary to produce the superficial wave
     of sensible magnitude, the disturbing force does not necessarily act with
    sufficient intensity at any instant to produce much compression, or therefore
    to cause a vibratory wave of the first kind of considerable intensity. When
    produced simultaneously, they will, in ordinary cases, separate very rapidly,
    on account of the great difference between the velocities with which they

are propagated.           in Fluids                                    in all directions from  a centre.-- The

interior of a fluid mass, perfectly or imperfectly elastic, the disturbance being
restricted within a space which is small compared with that into which the

time, the vibratory motion will be rapidly communicated to the neighbour

S8. Vibrations propagated along a solid Bar. -- The next case I shall
consider is that of a long solid bar, as one calculated to elucidate the more

Ifcomplicated case of vibratory waves diverging in all directions through a
solid substance.                       a bar, of which the transverse section is the same in

every part, and of which the density is uniform, be acted on for an instant
by a force of sufficient intensity applied parallel to the axis, and uniformly
on every point of its terminal section (supposed to be perpendicular to its
axis), a wave will be propagated along the bar very nearly similar to those
already described as propagated along tubes filled with perfectly elastic or
common fluid. But a solid bar admits also of a different kind of vibration.
In the case just stated, the direction of vibration is longitudinal, or parallel

to the axis of the bar* ; whereas, in the case I now allude to, the direction

of vibration is transverse, or perpendicular to the axis, and analogous to the
ordinary transverse vibrations of a musical string, though not identical with
them. As in the small transverse vibrations of the string the tension of the
string suffers no sensible variation, so the transverse vibrations of a solid bar

do not produce those alternations of condensation and dilatation which ne

cessarily attend longitudinal vibrations. Consequently the elasticities called
into action in the propagation of longitudinal and of transverse vibrations
are of different kinds. In the former case the elasticity depends upon the
force which any element of the substance is capable of exerting to recover
its natural volume, when compressed or dilated by the direct action of pres
sure or tension ; whereas, in the other case, the elasticity called forth de
pends on the force which an element is capable of exerting to recover its
unconstrained form when distorted from that form without any alteration of
its volume. In the former case the compressing or dilating forces are sup
posed to act normally on the surface of the element ; in the latter case the

distorting forces must act tangentiaUy on its surface. Thus suppose the
bar to be a long rectangular parallelepiped, and that we take a very small
                                                   parallel to those of the bar,

Ifthis distortion may take place without changing the volume of the element.

   such a distortion be produced at one part of the bar, it will be communi
cated to the other parts in succession by transverse vibrations, the propa
gation of which will take place according to laws exactly similar to those

falready stated.
   Poisson's molecular theory assigns a general relation, for all solid bodies,
between the coefficients of the two kinds of elasticity above mentioned, and

certain experiments on the musical notes produced by transverse and longi
tudinal vibrations would appear to sanction the theory, while other experi

ments are opposed to it. It will be safer, therefore, not to allow our con

clusions to rest on an uncertain theory, but to consider these two coefficients
Ias two constants to be determined for different substances, by experiment.

  may here state however that in all cases the coefficients of elasticity for
transverse vibrations is less than that for longitudinal ones. Hence, if Vj and
Va denote the velocities of propagation for the longitudinal and transversal

Ifvibrations respectively, V, will be greater than Vg.

for the elucidation intended. The same must be understood of the transverse vibrations
tmentioned afterwards.

for a very short time (as the blow of a hammer), both kinds of vibrations
will, generally, be excited, and two corresponding waves of definite length
will be propagated along the bar with velocities V, and Vt respectively.
The longitudinal vibrations will be propagated in the manner already men
tioned, and the transversal vibrations will be propagated exactly in a similar
manner, except as regards the directions of the vibratory motions. Conse
quently, supposing the bar of indefinite length, the two waves at a certain
distance from their common origin will become entirely separated from each
other, and the vibrations excited in any proposed particle by the first wave
will then be entirely completed before those excited by the second will be
gin. We shall find a similar separation of the two waves in the more gene
ral case to which we shall now proceed.
   39. Propagation of Vibrations through a solid Mass.-- In the general

case to which we are now proceeding, we may conceive the disturbance ex
citing the vibrations to take place at any points in the interior or on the

surface of the mass ; but for the greater distinctness, I shall suppose it to
take place in the interior, to act for a very short time (as an explosion in a
mine), and to be restricted as in the previous cases to a space small com
Ipared with that into which the vibrations afterwards diverge.
                                                                shall also

suppose the density and elasticity of the mass to be the same at every point.
In this case, as in the one immediately preceding, the original disturbance,
unless it be of a very particular kind, will produce two waves, each of which
will diverge in a manner exactly similar to that in which a spherical wave
diverges in a fluid as already described (art. 37). Their velocities of pro
pagation (V, and Vs) will be different, and therefore they will become com
pletely separated from each other (as in the preceding case of article 38)
at a distance from their origin, depending on V,, the difference between V|
and Vo, and the breadth of the first wave. After this complete separation
has taken place, the direction in which a particle will vibrate in the first
wave will coincide with a line passing through that particle and the centre
of disturbance. These are normal vibrations ; they will be completed and
the particle restored to rest before the second wave reaches it. The same
particle will then commence its second vibration in a direction perpendicular

to the former, L e. in some direction in a plane perpendicular to the line
through the proposed particle and the centre of disturbance*. Such vibra
tions are tangential. We shall hereafter see the importance of this differ
ence of character in the two waves, provided instruments can be obtained
of sufficient sensibility and accuracy to detect the distinction between their

characteristic vibrations.

    Before the separation of the two waves has been completely effected, one
of them will overlap, or will be partially superimposed upon the other.
Within that space in which this superposition exists each particle will move
under the simultaneous influence of both the above kinds of vibration. The
breadth of the waves will depend on the time during which the original dis
turbance is continued, so that if this time be not very short, the breadths of
the waves may be too great to admit of their complete separation within the
limits of sensible vibration.

The ratio of the intensities of these two sets of vibrations may vary in
any degree, 6ince either of them may altogether disappear with particular
        of the original disturbance.

essential to ascertain to some degree of approximation, the velocities of pro

pagation through such solid masses as constitute, or may be presumed to
constitute generally the solid crust of the globe. To explain the relation
between these velocities and the elasticities of the substances through which
the waves are propagated, and the nature of the experiments by which the
elasticities must be determined, it will be necessary to enter into some de
Itails respecting the elementary notions on which the mathematical theory of

vibratory motions is founded. The theory here speak of is independent of

     I have already explained (art. 20) that, for every point of a continuous
solid mass in a state of constraint, there are three principal directions and
three principal tensions. The fundamental hypothesis on which M. Cauchy
has founded his investigation of the differential equations of vibratory motion
in solids, is that the principal tensions are proportional, partly to the linear

and partly to the cubical expansion. Thus, if e,, Cj, es denote the linear ex
tensions at any point in the principal directions, y the cubical expansion,
and ply p', ps the principal tensions, we shall have

where k and K are two constants to be determined by experiment. These

two constants, or others equivalent to them, will necessarily enter into the

differential equations of motion. If, instead of introducing k and K, we in
troduce A and B where

these equations will assume the form (adopting the usual notation and call

it will be necessary to bear in mind that the coefficient K of cubical expan
sion must be determined as well as k, the coefficient of linear expansion.

   Both K and k are essentially positive quantities, and therefore V! is neces
sarily greater than Vj, as has been already stated with reference to the pro
pagation of normal and transverse vibrations along a solid bar.

to his theory of molecular action, obtained differential equations of motion,
which involve only one constant, and with which the equations above given
become identical, if we make B=--A .                                                                                                               V

pagated is one in which the den

42. To simplify the application of the theoretical conclusions above stated,
to the case of               vibrations,  such as are frequently experienced in
                terrestrial  suppose, as
earthquakes, I  shall first               I have already done, that the original

disturbance or shock from which the vibrations proceed takes place within
a space comparatively small, as would be the case, for instance, if the shock
were produced by a deep-seated volcanic explosion, the falling in of the roof
Iof a subterranean cavity, or the sudden rending of the solid rock around it.

  shall also first suppose the crust of the earth to be homogeneous ; it will
afterwards be easy to trace the modifications of the general results in more

complicated cases.
The most important point, perhaps, which we may hope to determine with

some certain approximation to the truth, is the position, and more especially
the depth, of the volcanic foci or other sources from which earthquakes pro

ceed, a subject on which we are at present left to vague conjectures. I shall
proceed to show how this may be effected if we can determine with suffi
cient accuracy the velocity of propagation of a wave in the interior of the
                                                                                                     of

wave, and also the horizontal direction of propagation at any proposed point.
This direction, under the conditions stated in the preceding paragraph, will
coincide with a line through that point and the point on the earth's surface,
vertically above the centre of disturbance. We may suppose the velocity of
propagation (V) determined in the first instance by a previous knowledge of
Ithe two coefficients of elasticity ; the horizontal velocity by observations

which shall indicate, and the horizontal direction by an instrument designed

Ifor the purpose.

     suppose the instrument here spoken of capable of determining the di
rection of vibralioii of the particles of the earth's crust at the place of ob
servation, or at least the horizontal projection of that direction. But here it

is important to bear in mind the characteristic distinction above indicated

(art. 39) between the two waves, which will generally proceed simultaneously
from the same centre of disturbance. We have seen that the vibrations in
one of these waves take place in directions perpendicular to the direction of
propagation, and therefore the horizontal projection of this direction of
vibration will generally be entirely different from the horizontal direction
of the wave's motion. On the contrary, when the vibratory motions take

place in directions coinciding with that of propagation, or are normal to the
surface of the wave, the horizontal projection of the vibration will coincide
         ON THE THEORIES OF ELEVATION AND EARTHQUAKES. 83
with the horizontal direction required *. This apparent ambiguity however
will be removed in all cases in which the observed direction of vibration is
that of the particles at the Jirst instant of their motion ; for it has been shown
(art. 40) that the velocity (V,) of propagation for the normal vibrations is
greater than that for the tangential vibrations (Vj), and consequently the
normal vibrations will always be those which arrive first at any point of the
mass, and by which therefore every particle of it will be affected at the first
instant of its motion. In many cases also the approximate horizontal di
rection of the wave, as known from other circumstances, may serve to re
move the ambiguity above-mentioned.

   43. Position of the Centre of Disturbance Let O (fig. 13) be the centre

of disturbance ; OC a vertical line meeting the surface H'H in C ; P, P' two

points on the earth's surface, situated on different lines through C. The
directions of the horizontal projections of the normal vibrations will deter
mine the directions of PC and P'C, whose intersection will determine the

point C. It is manifestly desirable that, for this particular purpose, the
angle PCP' should be nearly a right angle.

P To determine the apparent horizontal velocity of the wave at P, suppose

    so situated that CP' is not much greater than CP. Let the time of the
first instant of the shock at each of the places P, P' be observed. Then the
difference of the distances CP, CP' divided by the difference of the ob
served times of the two shocks, will give the mean velocity with which the
wave will pass from P through a distance equal to the difference between

CP and CP. The velocity thus determined (as will appear by the next

paragraph) will be somewhat less than the horizontal velocity at P, but will
be approximately equal to it. Practically, it is desirable that the angle PCP'
should not be large for the particular purpose here considered.

   Let v be the horizontal velocity at P, COP=fl, and V the velocity of pro
pagation of the wave within the earth. Take p a point indefinitely near to
P in the line CP produced. Draw P.v perpendicular to OP ; then while the
wave is actually propagated from s to p, it will be apparently propagated
from P top, and we shall have

real velocity at points remote from C.

   Let CP as above determined --a; then

                                            V

This would appear to be the simplest formula for the determination of CO.
A formula may also be obtained independently of the previous determina
tion of the point C. For let v' be the horizontal velocity of the wave at a

point distant a' from C ; then

                co=«<^Ev4,

which will determine CO in terms of the difference of the distances of P and
P' from C. This formula might be useful when P and P' are known to be
nearly on the same line of horizontal propagation ; for in that case we
might substitute the distance PP' for a'-- a. This would be the case in
which the
thod before  position of C would    be least accurately determined    by the  me  ;
              indicated (art. 42),
                                    if we had to use observations   at P and  P'

for the angle PCP' being small, a small error in the determination of the
directions of horizontal propagation would make a comparatively large error
in the position of C, the point of intersection of those directions.
   It may be worth while also to indicate a formula far determining the
direct distance OP, and depending on the retardation of the wave in which
the vibrations are transversal, with reference to the wave in which they are
normal. Let V, be the velocity of the latter wave, V4 that of the former ;
V, will be greater than V4. Also let t, <2 be the respective times in which

the waves pass from O to P, and T the observed interval between the
arrivals of the two waves at P. Then

                           OP=V,<p
                           OP=Vj2,

                           h 'i = T ;

                           OP(i-I)=T,

If the general character of the geological formations through which the
vibration is propagated be known, V,, as well as V, may be supposed to be

approximately known by experiment. The determination of T would re
quire an instrument of sufficient accuracy and sensibility to detect the dif
ference in the nature of the vibrations in the two waves proceeding simul
taneously from O. The distauce OP must also

Ifand the position of C found as in article 42, the position of O will be imme

Twaves can be frequently and distinctly recognised, the determination of
may probably be found more easy and convenient than that of the horizon
tal velocity of the wave.

44. In the preceding calculations the mass through which the vibrations
have been propagated has been considered homogeneous; but it will be
easy to indicate the nature of the modification which will be introduced
into thieofprdeicffeedrienngt  results if we suppose
                                                       the wave to be propagated through

the general explanation it will suffice to consider a single horizontal stratum

resting on the mass in which the centre of disturbance is placed. Let H'H
be the surface of the earth, and h'h, parallel to H'H the common surface of
the upper and lower media. Let V denote the velocity of propagation in

the lower medium, and          V1 that in  the   upper;   and let/>P be    the direction in
which the wave from            O arrives          after  refraction at p.     The absolute
                                           at P
direction of vibration will be changed by refraction at p, as well as at P,
but the direction of the horizontal projection of the normal vibrations will
not be altered. Consequently the rule before given (art. 43) for finding the

Ifpoint C will be equally applicable in the present case.

wave at each point of those lines respectively, and show how the wave is
refracted in passing out of one medium into another. The consecutive
fronts of the wave are represented by the curved lines, which meet all the
directions previously mentioned at right angles. It is supposed that, in
these three media, the velocity of propagation is least in the water, greatest
in the solid crust, and intermediate in the subjacent fluid. It will be ob
served that the direct wave (the reflected waves are not here noticed) will
reach the shore H, through the solid crust and through the sea, at the same

instant.

4-5. Vibratory Waves resulting from Disturbances of which t/te original
sphere is not small.--- We have hitherto considered the original disturbance
restricted to a small space, and not to be of too great intensity. Let us now
Ifsuppose the disturbance to take place simultaneously beneath a portion of
the earth's crust of considerable extent.      the intensity of the force be not
Ifsmall, we shall have the case already considered (Sect. I. Part II.), in which
permanent elevation is produced in the superincumbent crust.                    the in
tensity be so small that a vibratory motion only results from a wave will

                                                                           it,
be produced, the front of which, in the mass situated vertically over the
area of disturbance, will be plain and horizontal while in the portions of
the crust situated beyond that area, the wave will be bounded by a curve
surface of which, after what lias been stated, will not be difficult to form

general conception. Immediately over the disturbed area the wave would
a

     I
manifestly reach all points of the surface at nearly the same instant, so that
what have called the apparent horizontal velocity of propagation would be

infinitely great. Contemporaneous shocks observed over an extensive area
would afford the strongest proof of the horizontal extent of the original
disturbance, though would be necessary to bear in mind that disturb
ance of greater intensity proceeding from a single centre at much greater

at which vertical line through the centre of disturbance should meet the

disturbance should be much greater than in the cases hitherto considered,

while the space through which it extends is small, the movements excited
in the immediately surrounding rocks, but more especially in those situated
vertically over the disturbance, will be greater than those to which the re
sults above given would be strictly applicable. Still the resulting waves
would be propagated in nearly the same manner, and, at a sufficient distance,
the vibrations would become small enough to render the results already
enumerated as applicable to this as to the former cases. In strictness we

should regard the original disturbance as extending to those limits within
which the disturbance should be too great to be propagated according to
the laws of propagation of small vibrations. The distinction however is

perhaps scarcely worth much attention, in the application we are now
making of the theory of small vibratory motions to a case which can scarcely
admit of any but somewhat rough approximations.
   The difference between this case and those considered in Section I. of

Part IL, consists in the horizontal extent of the disturbance. A superficial
elevation will be here produced, but it will be only of small horizontal ex
tent compared with those produced in the other cases just referred to, and
will not here call for further remark, unless it be produced in the bed of the
ocean. In this case a sea wave will be generated of the nature of that
                    (art. 36). This    wave will             in all                           directions from
already discussed   of the disturbed  portion of  diverge  bottom.                               Let ht be the
the central points                                the sea
depth of the sea,
                    h the height of the crest of the wave above the surface of
the sea; then if A, be much greater than h, the velocity with which the
Vwave will be propagated will = gh, nearly, and will therefore depend on
Ifthe depth of the sea.  the depth be uniform, the velocity of propagation
will be the same in all directions, and the front of the wave will form a

circle whose centre will be the point from which the wave diverges. After
a certain time the point of the surface of the sea which was first disturbed
will come to rest, while the wave will continue to diverge. It will then be
bounded internally by a circle concentric with that which forms its outer
boundary, the space occupied by the wave being thus a circular annulus of
which both the outer and inner radii are constantly increasing, while their
difference, or breadth of the wave, remains nearly the same. The height of
the crest of the wave will be nearly in proportion to the reciprocal of the
square root of the space through which it has diverged. This wave will
also be accompanied by a current, the velocity of which depends on the

                                                                  It is generally much less
than that with which the wave is propagated, especially in deep water.
IfIn the above description, the depth of the sea has been considered uni
form.  the depth decrease the velocity of propagation will decrease, or
the converse ; and consequently, if the wave diverge into parts of the sea
of different depths, its front will no longer preserve its circular form. The
rapidity with which the wave will rise from its external boundary to the
summit of its crest will depend on the rapidity with which the bottom of
the sea and the superincumbent water have been elevated from their un

disturbed position. If the elevation take place slowly, the distance between

    § On the production of a Surface Wave in the Fluid beneath the Earth's
             Crust, and its possible effects on the Elevation of the Crust.

   47. The great sea wave above described has been supposed to originate
in the sudden elevation of the sea bottom, but it might manifestly be equally
produced by any sudden expansive action within the water itself, the con
dition being, in all cases, that the cause producing the wave shall act so
suddenly as to elevate the fluid situated immediately over the seat of action
before the internal fluid pressure arising from the compression produced by
this sudden action, has had time to equalize itself by propagation to other
parts of the fluid. A wave of the same kind might also be produced in the
Iffluid mass which we have supposed to exist beneath the earth's solid crust.

    the crust were thin, light and flexible, a surface wave might be produced

with nearly the same facility as if the surface of the fluid were perfectly

free ; but on the contrary, the crust should be thick, heavy and inflexible,

rapidity with which the propagation and equalization of fluid pressure will

take place,    must be observed that the explosive action here supposed

with the velocity of this vibratory wave.               the surface of the fluid were

compression of the fluid in the immediate vicinity of the centre of explosion.
In such case the intensity of the vibratory wave of compression, and the
pressure propagated by would be comparatively small, while the surface
wave would be comparatively large. On the contrary, the crust being heavyby

the velocity with which such wave propagated

the fluid, and

ration of this short time, manifestly could not be produced at all. Thus
suppose the explosive action to arise from the rapid production of elastic
vapour within the fluid, and along median line from one extremity of the
fluid mass to the other. Also, suppose the process of generating the elastic
vapour to be such as to require certain number of seconds (which we may

probably be considerably more. Assume                                 to be one mile per second.
Then, in n seconds the vibratory wave, and with an increase of pressure,
will have travelled n miles on each side of the median line of action. This

shows how rapidly the additional pressure produced                       the compression of
the fluid, would be propagated to distant points, and how inconceivably rapid
must be the generation of elastic vapour to produce an elevating force suffi
cient to cause considerable elevation along the median line of its action,
not exceeding few miles in breadth, and before the remoter portions ofit,
Ifthe superincumbent crust should be subjected to the action of the elevating

  If however this narrow linear elevation were to be thus instantaneously
raised, an undulatory movement would doubtless be propagated on either
side to the remoter portions of the crust reposing on the fluid beneath, ex
actly analogous to that of great sea wave, except that the height of the
wave would probably diminish rapidly in its progressive movement, ona
account of the inflexibility of the solid crust. Each portion of the crustby
would thus be elevated successively in great surface wave, and fissures

    a modification of that which has been already developed. The primary

point of view, to which we may expect observations on earthquake vibra

ceed and we may observe that the roughest approximation to this position

would constitute very important geological element, and might sweep away
much that vague and fanciful in geological speculation. The approxi
mate determination of the point (fig. 13) directly above the focus (sup
posing the motion to proceed from single centre), would probably present
little difficulty, and would only require two instruments placed at points on
two lines from C, making an angle with each other not too remote from a
right angle. This would require instruments capable of registering merely
the horizontal projection of the direction in which the points, where they
were respectively placed, shuuld move at the first instant of the vibratory
motion. The distinction between this initial motion and that which any
particle may have subsequently, must be carefully attended to, because, as
                                      only the initial motion which can be de

methods might also be adopted for the determination of C. Suppose for
instance two points were known, at which the vibratory wave arrived at the

same instant, then, if we bisected the line joining these two points, and drew
another line perpendicular to it through the point of bisection, the latter
line would pass through C, assuming always the spherical form of the general
vibratory wave. In some cases also, as in those of earthquakes in the neigh
bourhood of insulated volcanos, circumstances may indicate, antecedently to

the determination of v, two instruments would be necessary merely to record
the exact times of the initial shock at two places, which ought to be situated
as nearly as should be convenient on the same line through C. They ought
not to be too near C, because the variation of horizontal velocity would there

be very rapid ; nor ought they to be so far removed from that point that the

difference between v and V would then be so small that a small error in the

the portions of the earth's crust through which earthquake vibrations are

propagated. And here I would again remark on the insufficiency of attend
ing only to the coefficient of linear expansion ; that of cubical expansion
must also be determined. We might also determine V by observing tho
horizontal velocity at such a distance from the origin of the motion, that the
horizontal and absolute velocities of propagation might be considered as
approximately equal, and in the present imperfect state of our knowledge
respecting the velocity with which vibratory motions are propagated through
solid masses, this would probably be the best way of determining the quan
tity in question.

In a region surrounding an active volcano, it is probable that a sensitive
instrument would detect a great number of slight earthquake shocks which
would pass entirely unnoticed without some special means of observation ;

example, we should have case in which, as already remarked, the position
of the point above denoted by C, might be considered as very approximately
known, assuming the shocks to originate in the interior of the volcanic moun
tain. Such a region will naturally suggest itself as one in which we should
best commence our instrumental observations, and soonest ascertain the capa
bilities of our instruments. With the assumption just mentioned respecting
the origin of the vibratory wave, the only essential requisite of the instru

the absolute direction of propagation of the wave within the earth. This
direction will coincide with that of the normal vibrations of the wave arriving
first at any point within the earth ; but it should be observed that the par
ticles situated at the surface will not generally vibrate in the same direction
as those within the vibrating mass. Consequently, supposing we had an in
strument with the above-mentioned requisites, it would be necessary, for the
object here proposed, to place it at a curtain depth below the surface of the
earth ; and here again the interference of the wave reflected back from the
surface into the interior mass, with the incident wave, would render the ob

servations useless, unless the instrument were placed at a sufficient depth.

Let this depth =A, and let 0 denote the angle of incidence, as in figure 13;
then it is easily shown that the interval of time between the arrival of the

incident and reflected waves at the point of observation =??.^*??i -?.  Now,

since the sounds usually resulting from these vibrations are continuous sounds,
so many vibrations must take place in a second, that if the instrument were
placed, for instance, in a mine at the depth of a few hundred feet, several
complete vibrations of the incident wave might be completed at the point of

observation before the arrival of the reflected wave ; and if the instrument

should be capable of recording the absolute direction of these initial vibra
tions, independently of the subsequent ones due to the combined effects of
the two waves, the absolute direction of propagation of the wave in the in
terior of the terrestrial mass would be determined as required.

   The advantage of this method would consist in its requiring only a single
instrumental observation ; but the exactness with which the observation

must be made, and the few localities in which the instrument could be placed

at the   requisite depth, must necessarily render the    method    cfoomcpi.araItivhealyve

would be required in the adoption of any method depending on the deter

methods above indicated, depending on the horizonal direction of vibration,
will probably be found far more simple in application, and far more deserving
of confidence. We may remark, however, that the determination of the
absolute directions of vibration, if it was found practicable in any one
locality at a sufficient depth below the surface, would be highly interesting
on account of the experimental knowledge it would afford of the characters

of vibratory motions propagated through solid media. It may also be re
marked, that though we could not for this purpose avail ourselves of similar
determinations made upon the surface of the vibrating mass, these latter
might also give results affording interesting tests of theory; and, moreover,
in giving the vertical as well as the horizontal parts of the superficial vibra
tions, they would afford us a knowledge of one of the essential elements of

earthquake movements considered with reference to their disturbing and

dislocating effects on objects placed on the earth's surface and subjected to
their influence.

                                          Introductory Remarks.

In my former Report I gave an account of the principal varieties of elemen

tary structure, which had presented themselves to me during a minute and

extensive examination of the shells of Mollusks; and I described the peculiar

combinations and arrangements of these elements, which are characteristic
of the following groups of Bivalves, namely, the Brachiopoda, the Placunidce,

IOstracea>, Pectinidce, Margaritacem and Nayadea. On the present occasion

   shall enter into similar details in regard to the remaining families of the
Lamellibranchiata ; and shall state the results of my inquiries into the
structure of the shells of the Gasteropoda and Cephalopoda. These last are,
however, chiefly of a negative character.

   IBefore proceeding, however, to this continuation of my former Report,

shall make a few additions to the facts contained in it, as to the structure of
the shell in certain of the groups therein described, which have resulted from
the continuation of my inquiries into their organic peculiarities.

          I. Observations Supplemental to former Report.

   57. Brachiopoda When drawing attention (§         41) to the               very remark
able system of perforations presented by the shells  of certain
                                                                             species of Te-
rebratula and allied genera, I was obliged to express my ignorance of the
relation which these passages have to the structure and ceconomy of the
animal ; not having had at that time the opportunity of examining a shell, the
animal of which had been preserved in situ. This opportunity, however, by

Ithe kindness of Mr. Cuming and Mr. MacAndrew, have since enjoyed ;
Iand can now communicate the results of my inquiries, which, though not

fully satisfactory, will be found, I think, to possess much interest.
   58. The species on which my observations have been made, are the T.
australis, and the T. .caput serpentis (?) lately discovered to be a native
of our own seas. When a thin portion of a shell of either of these (and
probably therefore of any of the perforated species of Terebratula) which
has been preserved with the animal in spirit, is ground down from the inner
side, so as to leave the outer surface unchanged, it will be seen that each

perforation in the shell is covered-in by an oval membranous disc, whose
texture appears very firm (fig. 1 ). When a thin section thus made is ex
posed to the action of dilute acid, so as to remove from it the calcareous
matter, it will be seen that these discs are connected together by a layer
of very pellucid membrane, in which no distinct structure can be made
out (fig. 2) ; this membrane, differing as it does from the membranous
basis of the interior layers of the shell, is probably to be regarded in the
light of an epidermis. When a portion of the shell, not reduced in thick
ness, is completely decalcified by immersion in dilute acid, and the mem
branous residuum is then examined, a very remarkable structure presents

itself, such as is found in no shells of the Lamellibranchiate Bivalves. At
tached to the membranous films are a series of tubular appendages, corre
sponding in diameter to the perforations in the shell, and arranged at the
same distances (fig. 3). The free extremities of these appendages are much
larger than those by which they are attached to the membrane, and have
distinct cacal terminations, which appear by the straightness of their border

to have been flattened against the discs that dosed the orifices of the per

forations in the shell. Indeed in some instances these discs have remained

adherent to them, when the shell-membranes were torn asunder; and are

seen edgeways, as in fig. 3, a. There can be no doubt, therefore, that these

membranous caret occupied, in the living animal, the perforations already
described as penetrating the shell from one surface to the other. This will
be still more evident on reference to fig. !39 of my former report; in which
it will be seen how exactly the shape of the caeca corresponds with that of
the perforations, when the hitter arc laid open lengthways by a section of
the shell perpendicular to its surface. The tower margin of that figure cor
responds with the outer surface of the shell, and the diameter of the perfora
tions is seen to be there greatly increased. With regard to the office of

these caeca, however, I am unable as yet to give any distinct explanation.
Their contents are of a brown granular character, in which I have recog
nised distinct cells (fig. 1), such as are to be met with in the tubuli and
Ifollicles of ordinary glands ; and their whole aspect satisfies me that they
must be regarded as possessing a glandular character.        have not been able,

however, to discover the nature or destination of their secretion *. The in
ternal orifices of the perforations obviously constitute the outlets of the
effica ; but there does not appear to be any system of tubes or canals for col
lecting the matters poured out from them, each caecum having its distinct
and independent termination on the internal surface of the shell. Although
the unusual degree of adhesion between the mantle and the shells of Tere

bratula:, first  noticed by Professor Owen,   formerly led   me to  sshueslpl,ecIt   that  the
mantle might     send prolongations into the  perforations  of the                  have   not

been able to discover any vestige of such. On the contrary, it has appeared to

me that the mantle, which is a nearly homogeneous membrane where not
traversed by vessels, is simply applied to the iuternal orifices of the caeca,
and continued over them ; no trace of any connection with them being visi

ble when it is detached from the shell. 1 may mention, however, that 1 have
found the surface of the mantle in contact with the shell to be scattered

over with minute cells, corresponding in size and aspect with those con

tained in the ceecal tubes (fig. 4, a).
59. The physiological purpose of this curious structure, therefore, is at
present a mystery ; but there can be little doubt that it is a very important one
in thececonomy of the animal, when we see the shell thus rendered subser*
vient to the special protection of these csecal appendages. And there is
evidently strong reason for regarding the presence or absence of the perfo
rations in the shell as a character of greater value in the subdivision of the
genus Terebratula and its allies, than those more trivial indications furnished
by the external conformation of the shell, which seem to have little to do
with the structure or ceconomy of its inhabitant. I am very happy to find
this opinion sanctioned by so high an authority on the classification of the
Brachiopoda as Mr. Morris, who has laid great stress on the presence or
Iabsence of these perforations,

rived from the relation of the
                                   as exactly corresponding  with characters de

                                                             areaf. And I am
quite content to accept his correction of an error into which had fallen
(through an accidental disarrangement of my sections) in the classification

by supposing that the first-formed or external portions of the shelly layers are
usually abraded, perhaps in consequence of the comparatively active move
ments of these animals. My expectation has been in some degree justified by
Ithe discovery of a thin but beautifully distinct layer of this substance on the
exterior of Pecten nobilis, as represented in fig. 6.                   would suggest it to

presented in the shell of Pinna and its allies, I drew attention (§ 11) to the
transverse markings which are seen upon the membranous walls of the pris
matic cells, and also upon the calcareous prUms which they enclose, when
these two elements of the structure are obtained in a separate form. And

I stated my reasons (§§ 12, la) for not assenting to the interpretation of

this appearance offered by Mr. Rowerbank, who regards these striae as indi
cative of the presence of tubes ; but for considering them as produced by a
simple thickening of the cell-membrane, at the points where successive layers
of flat epithelium-cells have coalesced in piles, so as to make up the long
prismatic cells or tubes which characterize the fully-formed shell substance.

Since that time 1 have made repeated and careful examinations into this
question ; and 1 have now to present what I believe to be demonstrative evi
dence of the correctness of the view which I had taken. Amongst the
various species of Pinna which I have examined, the Pinna rudis is most
remarkable for the large quantity of animal matter interposed between the
linings of contiguous cells, and also for the clearness and strength of the
transverse markings on their walls. In making vertical sections of its decal

cified membrane, I have several times found them disposed to split, in the
manner represented in fig. 5. The fissures have always taken place exactly
in the line of the striations; showing just that          tendency to separation at

these parts of the prisms, which might be expected        if the supposed coalescence
had imperfectly taken place. In some instances it will be seen that the
layers thus separated still contain two, three, or four of the single original
layers ; but at a, a will be seen the edges of single layers, which have become
detached for a part of their length from those with which they were pre
viously incorporated ; and at b, b are portions of similar layers that are so

twisted upon themselves, as to exhibit their surface as if it had been ex
posed by a section in the contrary direction. This surface presents the
division into irregularly-hexagonal cells, which is characteristic of the struc
ture ; and we have thus an excessively thin layer, separating itself naturally,
but showing us precisely the appearances of a similar layer artificially ob
tained. No trace of a vessel is here to be seen, the divisions of the cells
being formed by the deposit of animal matter between them in unusual

thickness.                         section  of the Bhell of                ,

a longitudinal direction (fig. 9), have exactly the same characters as those

composed of two layers of very different texture, and it does not specify

whether both these  layers are thus formed by the         entire

reference to fig. 8 will, I think, clearly show the mode in which the operation
is effected. This figure represents a section of the margin of one of the
valves of Unio occidens, taken perpendicularly to its surface, and exhibits
the two layers of which the shell is composed ; the upper one being the outer
or prismatic layer, the cells of which are traversed longitudinally by the sec

perly constitutes the inner layer of the shell. The outer or prismatic layer,
is
on the other hand, only formed where the new structure projects beyonditis
the margin of the old and thus we do not usually find one layer of over-

and appears to me to indicate that, even when the shell has attained its
full dimensions, new laminae continue to be formed one after the other, the
entire shell being lined, as before, with thin layer of nacre, whilst the lip

   64. we revert to the mode in which the well-known shell of Oslrea is

enlarged, we shall perceive that there is such an essential conformity be
tween the two cases, aa may justify us in founding our general description of
the process upon the indications which they present. A cursory inspection

of the shell of the Oyster shows us that it is composed of two different sub
stances ; the principal part of its thickness being made up of the white inner

layer (which I have termed sub-nacreous, § 29), the successive laminae of

which have comparatively little adhesion to each other; whilst the margin of
each of these laminae is covered on its exterior with a border of a more

elastic brownish-yellow substance, which the microscope shows to be com
posed of prismatic cellular structure. Now these external layers are quite
disconnected, instead of being continued by the junction of their edges one
with another as in Unio ; and we thus see plainly that, as long as the shell
continues to grow, it is only where the new inner layer projects beyond the
margin of the old, that the outer layer is generated. But we may observe at
the margin of a full-grown oyster exactly that which has just been described
in the lip of Unio, namely, a succession of lamina; of prismatic cellular
structure, superposed one upon another, although (like the other layers of

So long as the animal continues to increase in dimensions, each new interior
layer of shell projects so far beyond the preceding, that the new border com
posed of the outer layer is simply joined-on to the margin of the former one ;
so that the successive formations of the outer layer scarcely underlie each
other. But when the animal has arived at its full growth, the new laminae
cease to project beyond the old ; and as each is still composed of a marginal
band of the external substance, attached to the edge of an entire lamina of

the inner, these bands must now underlie each other, being either quite free as
in Ostreee, or closely united to each other as in Unio and most other Bivalves.
We shall hereafter see that the additions to the shells of Gasteropoda are

really made upon the same plan, although it has been commonly supposed
that they are only attached to the edge of the old shell, instead of being con
tinued over its internal surface.

       II. Continuation offormer Report.

   66. In passing from the families of Bivalve Mollusca considered in the
former Report, in which the lobes of the mantle are unadherent, to those in
which they are partially or completely united, we encounter a gradual change
in the texture and condition of the shell. We have seen that in the Margari-
tacecc (which may probably be regarded as the types of the former division,
§ 56), the external portion of the    shell is composed of a                                                                 substance which al
ways retains its cellular character;  the partitions between                                                                 the cells being firm,

tenacious membranes, which altogether bear a large proportion to the cal
careous substance they enclose. In the group we are now to consider, how-
                                                                                                                             h

ever, the animal basis is usually very small in amount, and cannot be distin
guished from the calcareous constituent by the simple examination of a trans

parent section of the shell-substance. When the shell is submitted to the ac
tion of dilute acid, so as to dissolve away its mineral portion, the only residue
is usually a set of lamina;, more or less numerous, of a pellucid membrane of

extreme tenuity, in which no distinct cellular structure can be discerned.

A few detached cells are occasionally to be observed, scattered amongst its

folds; but these are destitute of the firm walls which bound the calcareous
prisms of the Margaritacta. There are certain genera, however, in which
the structure of the shell is nearly the same as that which characterizes the
last-named family ; of these the most remarkable are Pandora and Solcmya,

to which a more particular reference will be made hereafter.

   67. It is not to be inferred, however, from the comparative deficiency of
animal matter, and from the general absence of distinct cellular structure, in
the shells of this division of the Lamellibranchiate Mollusca, that they are

Ioriginally formed upon a plan altogether different from that which is followed

in the preceding groups. For think that there is good evidence, that, how
ever dense and apparently homogeneous the texture of the. fully-formed shell
may be, it is generated in the first instance in the same manner as the di-

calcareous integument of the Crustacea, which, as we shall hereafter see,

corresponds with dentine in its principal characters. This feature in the
structure of the shells am about to describe, therefore one of consider

position of a homogeneous, intercellular substance between the cells ; which
substance answers the double purpose of giving additional firmness to the
cells, and of holding them closely together. It is evidently of a horny cha
racter, and seems to correspond with that which forms the byssus in Pinna,
and which is thrown out as the periostracum in other families. The fact that
in Perna we occasionally find, between the calcified layers, membranous
laminae, consisting chiefly of horny matter interposed between rounded cells
that are widely separated from each other, seems to add weight to this view
(see fig. 12, Plate VI. of former Report); since it shows that the degree of
proximity into which the cells may be brought, depends upon the amount of
material thus interposed between them.

III. MytilacecE.

69. Referring to my former Report (§ 53) for a statement of the reasons
which appear to require the removal of  Pinna from this            into a closer
approximation with Avicula and other                      family  at present to
                                        Margaritacece, I  have

Idescribe the structure of the shell in the genera Mytilus, Modiola, and Litho-

domus ; to these we must add Dreissena, which, as shall presently show, is
distinguished from Mytilus as much by the intimate structure of its shell as
it is by other characters. These shells all possess a periostracum of horny

membrane, in which I have not been able to detect any distinct structure.
Between the periostracum and the shell a thin layer of minute cells may be
frequently detected ; they are very obvious, under a sufficiently high power,
in Mytilus edufis. The shell itself presents two layers, which may usually
be readily distinguished by their colour, as in the common mussel. The
internal layer is frequently iridescent, and nearly always possesses something
of the nacreous lustre. Neither inner nor outer layer in Mytilus or Modiola
presents any very distinct organic structure; and nothing but a delicate
membranous residuum is left when the calcareous matter has been removed
by acid. In Lithodomus, on the other hand, the external layer has a remark
able tubular structure, which strongly resembles that of dentine. The tubules
are of such extreme minuteness as not to admit of accurate measurement;

their diameter, however, certainly docs not exceed l-20,000th of an inch.

Instead of having the irregular reticulated arrangement which they have been
shown to present in Anomia and Lima, the tubuli run, like those of dentine, in

in this tubular substance, analogous to those which Prof. Owen has dis
covered in dentine. The structure of the shell of Dreissena polymorpha

(formerly Mytilus polymorphus) is so different from that of Mytilus, as fully
to justify its generic separation. The internal layer is here composed of
large prismatic cells (fig. 12), of which the transverse sections made by a
plane parallel to the surface of the shell are shown at a, whilst at b are seen
Isimilar cells divided obliquely. Notwithstanding the distinctness of the

boundaries of these cells in a section of the shell itself, have not been able
to obtain any indications of them in the decalcified membrane, the original
partitions between them having altogether disappeared. Between the internal
white layer and the periostracum, is a layer of a brownish colour, in which
also traces of cellular structure present themselves, especially in a section made
perpendicularly to its surface, which brings into view a decided prismatic ar
rangement But here, too, there is an entire absence of any cellular structure
in the delicate residuum which is left after the action of acid on the shell.

                                                                  h2

               IV. Tridacnacece.

70. Of the shells of this family there is but very little to say, since neither
in Tridacne nor in Hippopus is there any distinct organic structure. Here
and there obscure traces may be discerned, indicative of their cellular origin ;
Ibut the                                          are occasioned by what
I have                                          structure (see § 18, and

fig. 43                                          structure, as elucidated
principal departures from perfect homogeneity
termed on a former occasion the corrugated

of first Report). Of the real nature of that

by my subsequent observations, shall have more to say immediately.

                                  V. Chamacea.

   71. In the foliated species of the genus Chama we again encounter a re
ticulated tubular structure, closely resembling that which has been already
described in Anomia ephippium and Lima scabra. (See §§ 30, 31, and fig.
40 of first Report.) This is chiefly found in the outer layer of the shell and
around the bases of the foliations. In those species, however, in which these

                                  case
and as I find the same to be the

that this structure has usually some relation to the formation of these curious
appendages. In one portion of a section of the middle layer of a non-foliated

Chama, I have met with a cellular arrangement (fig. 13, a) so distinct as to

be unmistakeable, notwithstanding that it does not present itself in the mem
branous residuum. By a change in the direction of the layers of the shell
relatively to the plane of the section, the latter passes (at b) more obliquely
across the partitions of the cells; and by a still further change, it traverses
I(at c) the divisions in a longitudinal direction. Now these divisions are such

as have before supposed to indicate mere corrugations in the basement
membrane ; but from the appearance here presented by the transverse sec

tion, and from other indications, I am now disposed to regard them as formed

of long prismatic cells, bearing a general resemblance to those of Pinna, but
much less regular in form. As the long prisms of Pinna are made up by
the coalescence of a pile of flattened cells (§ 62), so would it appear that
these less perfect structures have a similar origin, since delicate striae may

from this family ; its thick external layer of highly-organized prismatic

And I                                   specimen in which the         testaceous

structure is preserved, am not yet in a condition to speak positively as to
the minute characters of the fossil genus Diceras, which has been supposed
by some to be the connecting link between the Cfiamacea and the Pudistes.

Nothing, however, that I have yet been able to observe sanctions such an
opinion ; as there is not the least trace, in such specimens as I have examined,

of the very peculiar cancellated structure characteristic of that group (§ 32
of former Report).

                                      VI. Trigonacea.

   72. The structure of the shell of Trigonia and Castalia, the two genera
included by Lamarck in this family, is such as to bring us back towards the
Nayadece; for whilst the interior of the shell is composed of a thick layer of

     utifully iridescent nacre, and the exterior is covered with a horny perios-
   ·cum, there intervenes between them a distinct and well-developed cellular
ON THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF SHELLS.  101

 layer. In Castalia this may always be distinguished where the epidermis is
 eroded near the umbo; a dead-white surface being seen where the erosion
 has not laid bare the nacre. In fact, as regards the structure of its shell,
 Castalia does not differ from the true Nayadea; ; and by this character it
 should be united with them. We have here another interesting example of
 agreement between the intimate structure of the shell and the general con
 formation of the animal ; since Deshayes and other recent systematise have
 expressed the decided opinion that the genus Castalia must be merged in
  Unio, as no valid distinctive characters can be assigned to it. In Trigonia,
 on the other hand, the cellular layer is very thin, and the cells, instead of
 being polygonal, have their angles rounded off, very much after the manner
 of those which lie immediately beneath the epidermis of Unio (fig. 51, first
 Report*). The internal or nacreous layer of Trigonia presents a few scat
 tered and irregular tubuli ; but from their minuteness and want of definite
arrangement, their existence can scarcely be regarded as characteristic of it.

                                        VII. Arcacea.

   I73. In this family have examined shells from the genera Area, Pectun-

cuius, and Nucula ; the conformity in the structure of which is generally
very close. The texture is usually the same, or nearly so, in the inner and
the outer layers, although their colour may differ, as in Area Noce or Pec-
tunculus pilosus. The shell contains but a small proportion of the mem
branous element ; and no other definite arrangement of its components can
be made out, than is indicated by that kind of corrugated aspect already de
scribed. In many species of Area and Pectunculus there is a very regular
tubular structure, the tubuli commencing on the internal surface of the shell,
in the intervals between the ribs, and spreading out as they pass towards the
external surface, so as to meet each other from opposite sides of the ribs

I(fig.14). The diameter of these tubes varies from about l-7000th tol -5000th

of an inch. All the species of Area, in the shells of which have met with
them, namely, A. Noa, A. lactea, and A. barbata, belong to that division of
the genus in which the valves gape for the passage of the byssus, or rather

Iof the tendinous prolongation of the foot, by which the animals attach them

selves. The only species have examined of that division in which the
valves close completely, is A. senilis, in which the tubular structure is alto
gether absent. Should this difference be found to exist constantly between
the species respectively belonging to these two groups, it will be another
interesting example of conformity between the general structure of the animal
and the characters furnished by the minute organization of the shell. In
Nucula margaritacea the inner layer has the truly nacreous structure, as
might be inferred from its iridescent lustre. In the outer, a small amount of
tubular structure may be observed ; and here, as elsewhere, the tubuli in
their course outwards seem to be directed towards the ribs, so as when they
reach the surface to leave the spaces between these altogether free, whilst in
the deeper parts of the tubular layer the tubuli are chiefly found in these
spaces. In fig. 15 is shown a portion of the external layer, the section being
made as near the outer surface as possible ; the tubuli are seen to open upon
the dark bands a a, bb, which correspond with the ribs of the shell, whilst

   * By Mr. Bowerbank these cells have heen described (Transactions of the Microscopical
Society, vol. i. p. 23) as belonging to the periostracum itself. His whole account of them,
however, so exactly corresponds with the appearances which the periostracum of Unio will
exhibit, when it is detached from the shell by the agency of acid, but carries with it a por

tion of the layer beneath, that I have no hesitation in regarding my own description of their

position as the correct one.
102 REPORT 1847.

in the translucent  intervening spaces some vestiges of cell-boundaries may
be discerned.
                               VIII. Cardiacecc.

   74. Of the structure of the shell in this family there is little to be said, as

I Iit is very nearly the same with that of the preceding. In various species of

Cardium which have examined, have found a considerable amount of

tubular structure in the external layer, whilst in Isocardia there is scarcely
a vestige of it ; thus bearing out the general statement that the presence of
the tubular structure has a relation to the costations, foliations, or other
sculpturing of the external surface. There is usually but little organic struc
ture to be discerned in the internal layer; and the only characteristic of the
external layer, independently of the tubular structure, is its corrugated aspect.
These negative characters, however, are not without their value, for they
show that the structure of the shell in this family has nothing whatever in
common with that of the remarkable Plettrorhynchus hibernicus, formerly
termed Cardium hibernicum, with which some of the species of Cardium
correspond so closely in external form. The structure of this remarkable

shell has been described in my former Report (§ 34).

                         IX. Conchacea.

   75. Still less of organic structure is presented by the shells of this family,
some of which are the hardest that are to be met with amongst the Bivalves,

approaching the porcellanous Univalves botli in density and in the almost
entire absence of any trace of animal matter. The internal and external
layers here differ in little else than their relative translucency, the latter being
often rendered semi-opake by the deposition in their substance of a quantity
of calcareous matter in a non-crystalline condition. In some species, a few
scattered tubuli are to be met with ; but these are seldom so definite either
in size, number, or arrangement, as to be at all characteristic of the shells

.which present them. In several members of this family, however, I have

detected such traces of cellular structure, as indicate that the original mode

of formation of the shell is not different from that of other Bivalves. These

traces are chiefly to be met with (as in other instances) beneath the epider
mis, where such exists ; and they are especially evident in the translucent

shells of various species of Cyclat. In some of these, too, there is a more
definite animal residuum than in most other Conchacea, and traces of cells

may be discerned in it.  X. Nymphaceec.

   76. The shells of this family closely resemble those of the preceding in the
solidity of their texture ; but they usually display clearer indications of or
ganic structure. Both in the external and internal layers we frequently meet
with appearances which can scarcely be due to any other cause than a pris
matic cellular structure, although the prisms are far less regular in form than
in the Margaritacea, and are not so definitely divided by animal membrane.
The direction of the prisms too is different from that which they have in the
group just named, for instead of having their axes perpendicular to the sur
face, so that their extremities present themselves when that surface is exa

mined, they lie nearly parallel to the surface, or rather in a slightly oblique
manner, so as to crop out upon it. Their ends are usually rather pointed than
truncated, so that they might be termed fusiform cells. The direction of these
elongated cells in the two layers, however, is not the same ; for whilst in the
external layer their axes usually lie in lines radiating from the hinge to the
margin of each valve, they have a direction transverse to this in the internal
ON THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF SHELLS.                     103

layer, their ends pointing towards the two extremities of the valve. This
fusiform structure is very commonly larger or coarser in the external layer
than in the internal, as will be seen in figs. 16 and 17, which represent sec
tions of the two layers in Tellina, both taken parallel to the surface and in
the same direction. The tubular structure occasionally presents itself in the
shells of this family, but chiefly in the neighbourhood of any prolongations
of their surface in ridges, points or foliations.

                                       XI. Mactracece.
   77. Passing by the small family of Lithophaga, which presents nothing
remarkable as regards the intimate structure of the shell, we come to the
extensive group of genera allied to Mactra. In most of these, the texture of

the shell presents the same general characters as in the preceding family,
but the indications of organic structure are more distinct. Thus, on the ex
ternal surface of Mactra stultorum (fig. 18) is a layer whose cellular cha
racter cannot be questioned, although the cells are irregular in form and
somewhat indefinite as to their boundaries; and in the inner layer of the
same shell the boundaries of the elongated cells are extremely distinct In
fig. 19 is shown a section of the internal layer of Lutraria elliptica, which
has passed somewhat obliquely to the elongated fusiform cells, and shows
their extremities cropping out, one set above another. In Erycina cardioides
the external layer contains a large amount of minute tubuli, corresponding
with the sculptured character of its surface ; and the fusiform cellular struc
ture is also very evident in some parts of this layer. In Amphidesma, also,
clear indications of cellular structure may be discerned upon the surface.

                                             XII. Myacece.

  78. Under this title I bring together (merely for the sake of convenience)

the two Lamarckian families, Myaires and CorbuMes ; since between Mya
and Corbiila there is no clear line of demarcation. As will presently appear,
however, the structure of the shell in Pandora is so different from that of
Mya and its congeners, as fully to sanction the separation of that genus from

Schizzodesma,

These are of a particularly interesting nature in Mya arenaria, the careful
examination of whose shell has thrown much light on several doubtful points
of my inquiry. We have here a distinctly cellular structure in some parts

(fig. 20), giving way by such imperceptible gradations to an almost perfectly
homogeneous arrangement in others (fig. 21), that no separation can be

made between them ; so that we must regard the latter as having had the
same origin with the former, although its primary character has been lost.
Near the external surface of the shell is a layer of cells having distinct boun
daries and large dark nuclear spots (fig. 22) ; and yet in other parts of that
same layer the boundaries of the cells are completely obliterated, and only

the dark nuclear spots remain to show their original divisions (fig. 23). In

some instances the continuous cells seem to coalesce in sinuous rows, so that
wavy lines are left (somewhat resembling the boundaries of the furrows of
Meandrina) dividing one series from another (fig. 24). Near the external
surface some very large cells arc disposed without any regularity, amongst
those of which the layer is chiefly made up (fig. 25) ; and the external sur
face itself is composed of small cells of rounded form, in by no means close
104 REPORT -- 1847-

approximation with each other. In the tooth also we find a considerable
variety of structure, in addition to those forms presented by the shell. Thus,
in fig. 26 is seen a group of large cells, the calcareous contents of which are
disposed in a very regular radiating plan, which looks as if some force had
been in operation within them, analogous to that which produces the similar
arrangement in radiating Arragonite or Wavellite. The borders of this
group pass into another cluster of cells (fig. 27), that presents no trace of
this curious structure (of which, however, there are some indications in the
shell) ; whilst the latter gradually passes, by the obliteration of its cell-
boundaries, into a layer of very homogeneous aspect. Besides these, there
are several curious forms of elongated cells, some of them with square ter
minations, as in fig. 28, and some pointed or fusiform, as in fig. 29. In these
                             stria?, closely resembling those of the long pris
last may be seen transverse  probably due to the same cause, -- namely, the

matic cells of Pinna, and
coalescence of piles of flattened cells, whose original thickness is indicated by
the spaces between the striae which indicate their lines of junction. Upon

this last circumstance I am disposed to lay much stress, as indicating the

really compound nature of the long irregular fusiform cells, of which we
have already seen some examples, but which are peculiarly characteristic of
the univalve group. Neither in the shell nor the tooth of Mya armaria is

there animal matter enough to give anything more than a delicate membra
nous residuum, in which no vestige of cell-walls can be traced.

   79. In Corbula we find the outer layer composed of large fusiform cells,
whilst the inner is nearly homogeneous. At the lines of junction of the suc

cessive additions to the margin is a yellow layer, probably owing its colour to

an intermixture of horny matter, such as might, if poured out upon the sur
face, have formed a periostracum. In this layer there is a very definite and
beautiful cellular arrangement, the cells being in some parts polygonal and
having their edges in contact, whilst in others they are rounded and isolated

(fig. 30).
   80. The genus Anatina     (as is well  Ikhnaovwen)exhaamsinneodt  been so strictly defined
as to make its boundaries    certain.                                 three species however,

in all of which the characters were the same or nearly so. The inner layer
is more or less nacreous in character, and is sometimes perforated by very
minute tubes. The outer layer is almost everywhere distinctly cellular, but
the cells are not sharply defined at their edges (fig. 34), and sometimes do
not even come into contact; the spaces between them are then filled up
with opake matter, which presents a perfectly black appearance under the
microscope. The contents of the cells have somewhat of the radiated ar

rangement seen in fig. 26. The surface of the shell in some species, as A.

truncata, is roughened by innumerable minute projections ; these on exa

mination are found to be formed by a set of large scattered cells, super
posed upon the proper external layer, closely resembling those which will be
described and figured in the next genus.

  I81. In Thracia these characters are still more definitely exhibited. The

external surface of the shell, in three species which have examined, is
roughened by a multitude of minute elevations. These are due to the pre
sence of numerous large isolated cells filled with calcareous matter, which

form a superficial coating superposed upon the ordinary external layer (fig.
31), the periostracum being continued over them and sinking down into their
interspaces, just as the human epidermis covers the papillary surface of the
true skin. The proper external layer is composed of polygonal cells, with

sharply-defined boundaries, having large nuclear spots (fig. 32) strongly re
sembling some of those which present themselves in Mya arenaria. Not

withstanding that the sharpness of the divisions would seem to indicate the
presence of membranous partitions between the cells, no trace of such can
be discerned after decalcification, the total amount of animal matter being
extremely small. This is a fact of considerable importance, as showing un
equivocally that the absence of every indication of cellular structure in the
animal basis must by no means be taken as a proof that the shell has not
been originally formed by the calcification of a cellular tissue ; since nothing
can be more unequivocal than the existence of cellular structure in the solid
shell of Thracia, although, when the lime has been dissolved away, the walls

of the cells cannot be made out. In this respect such shells may be com
pared with the fossilized shells of Pinna, Avicula and other Margarilacece,
in which the cellular structure is as perfectly shown as in the recent species,
although no trace of the animal basis remains. The internal layer of Thracia
presents no well-defined structure.
82. The shell of Myodora striata closely corresponds in structure with
that of the Anatina, having a nacreous interior, and a well-defined cellular
layer on the exterior. The cells of this layer are large and somewhat pris
matic in form, the prisms being arranged somewhat obliquely to the surface,
and cropping out upon it (fig. 33). In Schizzodesma nitida the structure
of the shell more resembles that of Mya ; the internal layer being nearly ho
mogeneous ; whilst the exterior has an indistinct cellular structure, the cells

being small, rounded, and closely packed together.
83. The shell of Pandora is remarkably distinguished from all the pre
ceding, by its complete conformity with that of the Margaritacea in all their
essential characters ; namely, in the regular prismatic arrangement of the cel
lular structure of the exterior, the axes of the prisms being perpendicular to
the surface (fig. 35) ; in the existence of distinct membranous partitions be
tween these, forming a tenacious membrane that is left after decalcification ;
and in the truly nacreous structure of the interior. The views of those who
would regard it as the type of a distinct group receive confirmation therefore
from the peculiar structure of its shell, which has no counterpart amongst
any of the Lamellibranchiata that have the lobes of the mantle in great degree
united. Its close relationship to the preceding genera, however, is indicated
by the circumstance, that in no other member of the neighbouring families,
save in                                              meet with anything like the same definite

   84. In accordance with the close affinity which exists between the animals
of this and the preceding family, we find the structure of their shells bearing
a strong resemblance. In Solen and Solecurtus the external layer has a very
definite cellular structure ; the cells are elongated prisms, their walls as
straight and parallel as those of Pinna (fig. 43)*; but their axes lie nearly
parallel to the surface, cropping out somewhat obliquely upon the exterior,
where their rounded terminations with distinct nuclear spots may sometimes
be met with (fig. 41). The internal layer is very dense and nearly homo-

is very different, however, with Solemya australis, which has a remarkably
firm cellulo-membratious residuum (fig. 4-0). The external layer of this shell
is composed of long prismatic cells, whose axes lie nearly parallel to its sur
face (tig. 39), whilst its internal layer also exhibits in many parts a cellular

arrangement that strongly calls to mind the prismatic cellular structure of
Pinna and its allies, not merely in the form and collocation of the cells, and
the detinitencss of their membranous boundaries, but also in the existence
of many of the peculiar dark cells referred to in my former report (§ 14).
This cellular arrangement, however, is not equally distinct in every part of
the shell. In figs. 37 and 38 is shown a very interesting gradation, from the
definite boundaries which present themselves in some portions of the internal

as well as in the external layer, to the fainter and more interrupted markings

                             XIV. Tubicola.

    85. The remaining genera of the Lamellibranchiate Bivalves do not pre
sent any special peculiarity in the structure of their shells, which for the
most part exhibit few traces of organic arrangement. We shall stop, how
ever, to describe the shelly tube of Sejilaria gigantea, a microscopic exami
nation of which brings into view several points of much interest. This tube,
formed (like that of the Teredo) from the surface of the respiratory siphons,
is often several feet in length, and from half an inch to an inch in thickness.
When broken across, the fractured surface has a very crystalline aspect, such
as might easily be supposed to be given by prisms radiating from its centre
to its circumference ; corresponding in this respect precisely with the aspect
presented by the calcareous external cone of the Iielemnite. This appear
ance is however deceptive ; for microscopic examination shows that the sup
posed prisms have by no means the straight angular borders which they

would possess if they were the products of crystalline action, but have irre

gular sinuous edges, resulting from the manner in which they were at first
produced by the action of the calcigerous cells. The shelly tube is every
where composed of at least two layers. The outer one is thin, and contains
a good deal of uncrystallized calcareous matter, giving it an opake-white
chalky appearance ; it is easily detached from the inner layer, and is ex

tremely fragile; its appearance, when traversed by a section as nearly pa
rallel to its surface as its cylindrical form will permit, is shown in fig. 44.
The divisions there shown are so well defined, that notwithstanding their

large size (which renders them almost visible to the naked eye), I am dis
posed to regard them as the boundaries of cells, formed perhaps by the coa

lescence of smaller ones. Another view of this outer layer, as seen in a sec
tion transverse to the axis of the tube, is seen in fig. 46 a; its cells are here cut
longitudinally, and are seen to have somewhat of a prismatic form, lying
parallel to each other, side by side.

  I86. It is to the inner layer that the thickness of the shelly tube is chiefly

duo. From the appearances presented by transverse sections, am inclined
to believe that the same method of addition is followed in the extension of
the tube as in the enlargement of the valves. It is to be remembered, that,
as the animal penetrates deeper and deeper into the sand, the respiratory
                 ON THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF SHELLS.

tube becomes more and more elongated, and the new portion, like the bor

der of the mantle in an ordinary bivalve, will form both layers. But the por

tion already surrounded by a shelly tube seems only to throw out a very thin
layer, which lines the interior of that previously formed ; and thus we find,
when we examine a transverse section of the older part of the tube (fig. 46),
a very thick layer, b (the one first formed), and a succession of very thin
laminae, c, at its inner margin. Such a transverse section shows us a
series of dark, somewhat wavy lines, at considerable distances from each
other, passing in a radiating manner from the inner to the outer margin.
Between these are more numerous fainter lines, having a direction generally
parallel to the preceding. The principal lines are evidently those along which

Ithe fracture takes place when the tube is broken across ; and consider them

to be the borders of large cells of an irregular prismatic form, made up by
the coalescence of smaller cells both in a longitudinal and lateral direction.
The longitudinal coalescence is very apparent from the multitude of concen
tric lines which cross the preceding at right angles, and which seem to be
the exact representatives of the transverse striae on the prisms of Pinna
(§ 62), regard being had to the circumstance that the shell is here cylindrical,
whilst in the latter case it is nearly flat. Each long irregular prismatic cell
then, whose lateral boundaries are marked out by the fainter lines, appears to
be formed (as in Pinna) by the coalescence of a row of smaller cells directed
 from the centre to the circumference of the tube. But there is besides a
 lateral coalescence of the smaller prisms into larger, which is particularly
 evident when a section is made in the direction of a chord to the circle, so
 as to cut the prisms transversely (fig. 4-5). The relative character of the
 fainter and stronger lines is then apparent, the former being the boundaries
 of the smaller prisms, a number of which coalesce in a sort of bundle to form
 the larger, whose outlines are marked out by the latter. At the inner part
of the principal layer in fig. 46, the smaller prisms are seen (when examined
 with a higher power) to remain isolated, and no coalescence appears to have
 taken place in the thin laminae subsequently formed.

     87. The quantity of animal membrane which is left after decalcification

it Iof this shelly tube is extremely small, and no traces of cells can be detected

in Were not able to interpret the appearances presented by sections of

the shell by the aid of the results previously detailed, I should have hesitated
in attributing a cellular origin to the structure I have described ; but those

 who will take the trouble to follow me, step by step, through my previous

Iinquiries, will entertain (I think) little doubt of the correctness of the view

   have now presented. The result is very interesting from the light which it
throws upon the structure of the calcareous sheath of the Belemnite ; the

Iappearances presented by the fracture and by sections of which so closely

 resemble those just described, that can have little doubt that the mode of
 its formation was the same,-- with this difference, that the solid cone was en
larged by additions to its exterior, whilst the hollow cylinder of Septaria was
 thickened by internal deposit. The purpose why the laminae formed subse
quently to the first production of the tube, should be of such extreme thin
ness, is obviously because the tube would soon be blocked up, if its whole
surface were to form a layer at all comparable in thickness to that produced
by its prolonged portion, which is forming shell for the first time.

                                         XV. Gasteropoda.
    8S. There is not by any means the same amount of diversity in the struc
ture of the shell in the different subdivisions of this group, as that which we
have met with among the Conchiferous Acephala. There is a certain typical
108 REPORT-- 1847-

plan of construction that seems common to by far the greater number of
them ; and any considerable departures from this are uncommon. The
small proportion of animal matter contained in most of these shells is a very
marked feature in their character, and it serves to render other features in
distinct; since the residuum left after the removal of the calcareous matter is

usually so imperfect, as to give no clue whatever to the explanation of the
appearances shown by sections, &c. In fact, as Mr. Hatchett observed long
since, the porcellanous shells do not yield any distinct animal residuum
whatever after the action of acids ; and the presence of animal matter in
them is made more evident by the blackening of the substance of the shells
when heated, than by any other method of treatment. Nevertheless the
structure of these shells is by no means homogeneous, but always exhibits
indications, more or less clear, of an original organic arrangement. This
arrangement, however, has been regarded by Mr. Gray (Phil. Trans. 1833)
as the result of crystalline action ; and it was not surprising that it should be
thus regarded, when the real nature of shell was so completely misunderstood,
and it was considered as a mere         exudation of calcareous
of which were held together by                                                 matter, the particles
                                        a sort of animal glue. I               have already shown
that no such explanation is applicable to the shells of Pinna and its allies,
in which the elementary crystalline forms were supposed by Mr. Gray to be
of the prismatic order; since these shells, instead of containing the least pro
portion of animal matter (as stated by Mr. Gray of the shells that present
the appearance of a crystalline fracture), have the most distinct animal basis ;
and it is                                                                      of prismatic crystallization is
entirely   dpueerfetoctltyheombvoiouulds intgh--at stohetoapsppeeaakra--nceof  the calcareous matter within
the long prismatic cells of their shell-membrane. And there appears to me
ample reason for extending a similar explanation to the shells in which the
rhomboidal crystallization seems to present itself; for although no distinct
cellular membrane can be obtained by their decalcification, we have found
I Ithis to be the case in other shells, whose origin is unquestionably cellular ;

and think it will be obvious, from the details into which shall presently
enter, that the structural characters of these shells are decidedly organic,
Iand not dependent upon crystalline action. But may again remark, that
Ialthough do not regard the             forms of the elementary parts of shell as

Univalves, there will be observed on two of the fractured sides of the cubic

pieces, into which they generally break, flat surfaces on the inner and outer
edges, separated from each other by a shelving portion in the centre ; and
on the two intermediate broken sides, shelving and internal edges, connected
by a flat central portion ; these differences of surface being produced by the
different position of the crystals of the different layers. Each of the three
layers thus rendered obvious is composed of very thin laminae, placed side
by side, as high as the thickness of the plate, and perpendicular to its sur
face. When these laminae are minutely examined, they will be found marked
with obscure oblique lines, in the direction of which they separate, when
broken, into long narrow rhombic crystals. The lines of cleavage in the suc
ceeding laminae are placed in contrary directions, so that when two of these
plates united are placed under the microscope, the lines of cleavage appear

to cross each other at right angles, whilst those of the alternate laminae fol
low the same direction. The laminae, of the outer and inner plates are
always directed from the apex of the cone of which the shell is formed
towards its mouth ; in the spiral shells they consequently follow the direction

of the spire. On the contrary, the lamina; of the plate situated between the

other two, form concentric rings around the cone, parallel with its base, and
cross at right angles those of the inner and outer layer. A good illustration
of this structure may be obtained by examining with a pocket-glass the
fractured edge of a Cone, Olive, or other spiral shell, in which the extremities
of the lamina; of the outer and inner plates, and the sides of those of the
central layer, or the converse, will be observed, according to the direction of
the fracture, the extremities of the laminae showing the angles of the cry
stals, while their sides, when closelv examined, will often exhibit the crystal
line flakes." (Phil. Trans. 1833, p. 790.)

description Cypraa mauritiana, which, from the great quantity of colouring
Imatter intermixed with its structures, is the best adapted for examination by

the mode adopted. Upon submitting to examination a surface of this shell
fractured at right angles to the lines of growth, it was found to consist of
three distinct strata, uniform in the nature of their structure, but alternating
in the mode of their disposition. Each stratum is formed of innumerable
plates, composed of elongated, prismatic, cellular structure ; each plate con
sisting of a single series of cells parallel to each other. These plates of cel
lular structure are disposed alternately in contrary directions, so that each
series of cells intersects the one beneath it nearly at right angles, and the
whole of them are so disposed, that the axes of the cells form angles of about
22° with the upper and under surfaces of the shell, and present the appear
ance represented in fig. 47, as seen with a power of 280 linear, the portion
represented being the central layer of the shell. The planes of these plates
of prismatic cellular structure are always as nearly as possible either parallel
or at right angles to the lines of growth, and the mode of arrangement is in
variable in each separate stratum, and always opposed to that of the stratum

either above or below it ; so that if the plates of cells in the central stratum
be parallel to the lines of growth in the shell, those of the outer and inner
strata are at right angles to them. When we view the stratum of plates of

appearance remarkably different fr^im that which we have previously de
scribed. In this case the whole of the stratum appears to be composed of a
series of basaltiform columns, each column having the appearance of being
formed of a series of single cells regularly piled upon each other. This arises
from the line of fracture passing in a direction about equally oblique to the
planes of the whole of the plates of prismatic cells. From this description of
the alternating mode of arrangement of the plates of cells, it will be ob

stratum were parallel to the lines of growth, while those of the central one
were at right angles to them. On the contrary, in Conus, Pyrula, Oliva,
and Voluta, the plates of the outer and inner stratum were at right angles to
the lines of growth, and those of the central stratum parallel to them. And

that disposition so extremely definite and constant as that which shown
in fig. 47 should have any other origin. The splinters into which the laminae

break up, when examined with high magnifying power, are found to have;

sections alone the structure of these shells would probably be never satisfac

ON THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OF SHELLS.                                                              Ill

growth. We here see the three layers, a, b, c, distinctly marked ; and there
is an additional layer, d, which is the duplicature of the external layer that
is formed when the animal has attained its full growth. This section traverses
the middle layer in the same direction with the fractured surface shown in
fig. 47, and we recognize the same disposition of the laminae of which it is
composed, the boundaries of these being indicated by the oblique lines which
are seen crossing each other in this part of the section. But as the laminae
of the other two layers are arranged at right angles to those of the middle
layer, a section which traverses the surfaces of the latter will cut the edges of
the former; and we accordingly see the outer and inner layers presenting an
aspect which very strongly resembles that of the prismatic cellular structure

of Pinna, when seen in vertical section. A section of the same shell, still

perpendicular to its surfaces, but parallel (instead of at right angles) to the
lines of growth, would show this prismatic appearance in the middle layer;
whilst the internal aud external layers would present the oblique crossed
lines previously seen in the middle layer. This is exactly what is shown in
fig. 49, which is a section of the shell of Conus, taken in the same direction
with the preceding, i. e. transversely to the lines of growth : the directions of
the laminae in Conus and Cypreea being, as just now stated, at right angles
to each other.

    92. The idea that the laminae are made up of elongated cells arranged side
by side, and that the parallel lines of division are indications of the original
cell-walls, and not of the mere boundaries of crystals, derives further support

from the circumstance that these lines are frequently very considerably
curved, and sometimes very irregular. The curvature is best seen in sections
of the thickened lip of the full-grown shell, where a single layer is often half
an inch or more in thickness, and is made up of successive growths, marked
by distinct bands of colouring matter, but still in perfect continuity with
each other, just as in the thick shells of the large Pinna. The irregularity
of the boundaries of the laminae is best seen in sections which are taken in a
direction nearly parallel to the surface of the shell. This will still cut the
laminae edgewise, but in a different manner from a vertical section *. In
fig. 50 is shown a section of Conus, which (owing to the curvature of the
shell) traverses both the internal and middle layers in a direction nearly pa
rallel to their surface. The edges of the laminae of both are here seen ; and
the direction of the one set of planes (a) at right angles to the other (6) is
clearly shown. The principal fact, however, which this section displays, is
the want of regularity of the boundaries of the laminae, such as cannot be

* As the conception of this structure is not at once readily acquired by every one, but is
perfectly simple when attained, it may be well to facilitate its comprehension by a simple
illustration. Let each layer of shell be represented by a row of books arranged upon a table
with their backs uppermost. It is obvious that a section which traverses them parallel to
the back and front edges of the books (which form the surfaces of the layer) would present
a series of parallel lines formed by the sides of the books ; and that a section which passes
in a plane at right angles to this, but parallel with the top and bottom edges of the books,
would also present a series of parallel lines formed by its intersection with the covers of the
sides. But, on the other band, a section which passes in the plane of the leaves would show

no such divisions, but would exhibit whatever surface the individual leaves might happen to
present. Now let it be further supposed that a second row of books were superposed upon
the first, with the fronts and backs of the books looking upwards and downwards as before,
but crossing those of the preceding ; then it is obvious that a section which passes through
these in the plane of their leaves will cross the lower series in a direction parallel to their

attributed to crystalline action, but is perfectly accordant with the supposition

of organic structure. A similar want of regularity is shown in the section
of the inner layer of Patella, represented in fig. 51. This has traversed the
laminae not quite across their edges, but somewhat obliquely, so that a dif
ference of disposition is evident in the alternate laminae, which (it will be

remembered) are directed obliquely across one another. This difference is
brought strongly into view when a thin section is examined by polarized
light ; for in certain positions of the prisms every alternate band is darkened,
whilst the intervening bands remain bright ; and when one of the prisms is
turned half round, the bands which were at first bright become dark, and
vice versd. The effect is very beautiful when a plate of selenite is placed
behind the section ; for the complementary colours are then exhibited by the
alternating bands, and the revolution of the prism causes an exchange in

these.

93. Such is the general structure of the shells of the Gasteropod Mollusca,
especially those of the order Pectinibranchiata. The most interesting ex
Iamples of departure from the arrangement now described will be presently
brought under notice.  shall first, however, allude to certain indications of

the changes which the shell undergoes during the progress of its growth,
which are of considerable interest. It was remarked by Mr. Gray in the

paper already referred to, that, so long as the shell is in a growing state,

the outer layer projects beyond the middle one, and the middle layer
beyond the interior one ; but that when the animal has attained its adult

state, the middle and inner layers are brought up to the margin, to form a

cimen of Ampullaria fasciata, found that at the extreme margin, and to
about one-eighth of an inch backward, there was but one stratum of cells,
the plates of which were parallel to the lines of growth. At about one-
eighth of an inch inwards, a new stratum of cells, with plates at right angles
to the lines of growth commenced, and rapidly increased in thickness as it
receded from the lip ; until, at about half a revolution of a whorl backward,
it had attained a thickness equivalent to about one-fifth of the entire sub
stance of that part of the shell ; and at one revolution backwards it was
very nearly equal in thickness to the layer above it." It is obvious that no
addition can be made to the outer stratum after the subjacent layer has been
formed, except by a deposition upon its external surface, as in Cypraa ; nor
can any change be made in the thickness of the middle stratum after the for
mation of the internal layer. But this last-formed internal layer may be
thickened by successive deposits to any extent; and this appears to me to
be the explanation of the fact that the thickness of the internal layer at some
distance backwards from the lip bears a considerably

41. But at one revolution backwards they were -- outer 5, central 5, inner
19; total 29." This fact harmonizes well with the preceding explanation;
for it simply indicates that whilst the thickness of the whole shell undergoes
a considerable increase near the lip, that increase is due to the greater de
velopment of the outer and middle layers, the inner layer being positively
Ithinner than it is at a distance from the lip, where it has been thickened by

successive deposits. can see no reason to attribute the foregoing differences
in the relative thickness of the three layers at different parts of the shell, to

any absorption or removal of the outer layers, as Mr. Bowerbank seems in
clined to do : for it seems impossible to imagine that the external and
middle layers can be thinned by absorption, without the removal of the inner
layer;                                                                      within, being effected

does take place ; but the explanation is not applicable to the facts just cited,
which seem to me to indicate clearly that the formation of the inner layer is

progressive and not completed at one effort. The truth appears to me to be,
that whenever an addition is made to the shell, the outer aud middle layers
are simply joined-on to the edges of the old margin, but that the internal
layer is carried backwards for a certain distance into the interior of the shell,

where the new formation forms a lining to the old, and increases its thick

ness, just as in the Bivalves. I have never been able, however, to trace it
very far back ; and it certainly can seldom or never line the whole shell, as
it does in most Bivalves. But this new layer seems to cover that part of the
internal surface which is in contact with the moving parts of the animal;
and thus serves to prevent that irregularity which could scarcely fail to
exist, where the new internal layer, like the middle and external, simply
joined-on to the edge of the preceding.

   94. In Mr. Gray's paper already referred to, a number of facts are
brought together, -which prove beyond all doubt that absorption of shell-
substance may take place ; but this, like the abrasion of stony matter by the
boring Molluscs, is a surface-action merely ; and the complete absence of
vascular or tubular communication between the mantle and the remoter

layers quite forbids the idea that any such process can be effected without
the removal, in the first instance, of the layer in immediate contact with the
mantle. This removal takes place to a great extent in some of the spiral
univalves ; especially in such as Conns, in which the older portion of the
shell is entirely wrapped round by the newer or outer whorls. In such cases
it is (as remarked by Mr. Bowerbank) on the outer layer of the involved
whorls that the absorbing action is exerted ; this layer being removed, the
middle one is attacked; and even a portion of the inner one is often thus

absorbed, that which remains (in cases where but little strength is required)
being not much thicker than writing-paper, quite translucent, and exhibiting
under the microscope precisely the same appearance as that presented by a

Ivery thin section of this layer, taken parallel to its surface.

   95. shall now pass in review some of the more interesting cases of de
parture from this regular type of conformation, and shall commence with
the Cyclobranchiata. In Patella the inner and outer layers are of the nor
mal structure, though rather less compact than usual ; the laminae of the
inner layer especially being very large and irregular, and by no means firmly
adherent to one another. The middle layer, however, has a very different
character, being composed of tolerably regular polygonal cells, which form
only a thin layer in some parts, whilst in others they are elongated into
prisms. This cellular layer is shown at fig. 51 a, as it is brought into view
bv a section of the wide part of the cone nearly parallel to the surface. The

transmitted light with a power of 1000 linear, we find innumerable transpa
rent filaments, which appear to have a cylindrical form ; but this point can
not be determined with certainty from their extreme minuteness. They vary

in size ; but one of about the average dimensions, which I measured, was the
l-80,000th of an inch in diameter, and many of them were not above half so
large. Among these spicular bodies there were many small fragments of plates,
formed of similar minute fibres, disposed across each other at right angles,
so as very much to resemble a piece of fine linen." No trace of these can be

Idetected in the thinnest and most carefully made sections of the shell ; and

cannot agree with Mr. Bowerbank in the belief that they are the result of

any organic arrangement. They seem to me rather due to the peculiar cry
stalline aggregation of the calcareous particles, which causes them to assume

Ithe prismatic form when disturbed by the shock of the fracture. Such an

occurrence is not uncommon, believe, in mineral bodies. Thus Sir D.
Brewster mentions (Edinb. Journ. of Science, No. I. p. 108) that a crystal of
quartz having been broken across, the faces of the fracture appeared abso
lutely black, like black velvet, owing to their being covered with a fine down
of siliceous fibres, the diameter of which was so minute that they were inca
pable of reflecting light.

   96. In Chiton the same general arrangement prevails as in Patella ; but
the details are somewhat different. The external layer, which is usually im
pregnated with colouring matter, does not exhibit the laminations which are
seen in Patella, but in their stead presents everywhere a delicate fibrous
structure, the fibres being arranged parallel to the surface. The superficial
part of this layer is perforated by large canals which pass down obliquely
into  its substance, without penetrating so far as the middle layer
The   purpose of these canals, which remind us of the perforations                                            (fig. 52).
                                                                                                              of Tere-
bratula, is by no means apparent. In the deeper part of this coloured ex
ternal layer, which is of great toughness, there is a layer of minute cells
(fig. 52, a), which seems to lie between the fibres ; and below this again is a
layer entirely composed of large flat pavement-like cells, as in Patella.
The internal layer seems to have the same nearly-homogeneous texture as the

external.

   97. In Crepidula and Calyptraa, the general arrangement is nearly of the
normal character ; but in the shelly base of the latter is a very curious ar

rangement, which is represented in figs. 53 and 54. The former is a section

of the compact portion of this formation, and shows the assemblage of large
calcigerous shells ofwhich it is composed,which have assumed a polygonal form
from the pressure of their edges against each other. The latter is a section
of the areolar or cancellated portion, in which we see an appearance as of
aggregations of flattened or discoidal cells, of circular outline, partially over
lying one another, very much after the manner of groups of blood-discs in
a drop of blood. This last condition is interesting, as snowing, under a new
aspect, what has been already pointed out as being probably the original form

of the calcigerous cells in general. For these flattened cells, when aggre
gated in regular piles, would give rise by their coalescence to long cylinders
marked by close transverse striae ; and these cylinders would become prisms
when pressed against each other laterally, just as the discoidal cells, which
are round in the loose cancellated structure represented in fig. 54, are poly
gonal when pressed together into a compact mass, as in fig. 53.
                                                                       The

calcified lamina? of this shell alternate with plates of a brown horny sub
stance, much resembling tortoise-shell in its appearance ; and when the cal
careous matter has been dissolved away by dilute acid, these horny plates
may be easily detached from each other, the basement-membrane of the ad

joining calcified lamina remaining adherent to one side of each of them. Of
the peculiar disposition of this basement-membrane, on which the iridescence

Iof the calcified layers depends, have given an account in my former Report
I(§ 25). In the particles of the horny plates themselves, have not been able

to detect any definite arrangement ; they are frequently marked, however,
by impressions from the cells that lie upon them, which might be mistaken
for indications of structure in themselves. In immediate contact with them

is a thin layer of large cells of very peculiar aspect, shown in fig. 55. The
nacreous laminae of Haliotis, when examined with a sufficiently high mag

Inifying power, present indications of a minute cellular structure, such as

have not observed in the nacre of Bivalves. The cells are of along oval form,
and their short diameter is not above 1-5000th of an inch. Their boundaries
in many parts are very indistinct, or even disappear altogether ; so that every
gradation can be traced, from the obviously-cellular arrangement shown in

Ifig. 56, to the homogeneous aspect presented by the nacre of bivalve shells.

Hence should be disposed to draw the same inference with respect to the
nacreous structure, as in regard to other forms of apparently-homogeneous
shell-substance (§ 67), namely, that, like them, it was originally formed upon
a cellular plan, but that the cells subsequently coalesced, their boundaries
disappearing. The appearance shown in fig. 56, a is that which the cells
present when the section passes through them transversely ; at b the section
has traversed them obliquely ; and at c are shown their natural terminations,
where they crop out upon the surface of the shell. The same cellular struc

Iture is apparent in the decalcified membrane, when it is carefully examined

under a high magnifying power; in fact, know no better example of the
distinct existence of cellular structure in a membrane which at first seemed

perfectly homogeneous, and properly entitled to the designation of primary-

ox Aaseiwen^-membrane, than is afforded by the decalcified nacre-membrane

of Haliotis splendens, when submitted to the requisite tests.

distinct and regular cellular arrangement, as shown in fig. 57.

sent as in the more massive shells. The whole thickness of the shell is

commonly so small, however, that it is impossible to recognise them in a sec
tion perpendicular to its surface ; but they arc at once distinguished from
each other, in a section that traverses them all somewhat obliquely, by the
different arrangement of their elongated cells, the long diameters of which
lie in each layer at right angles to those of the next.
101. Notwithstanding the remarkable general conformity in the structure
of the shell throughout the extensive group of PectinibranchiitUi, certain
variations present themselves in particular families or genera. Thus in a small
species of Nalica, I have found the cells of the middle layer more distinct

stinguish in the nacre of these shells the same minutely cellular arrangement
which I have described as presenting itself very distinctly in Haliotis. In
the black middle layer of Turbo pica the cellular arrangement is very di
stinct, and the arrangement of the colouring matter dispersed through the

calcareous contents of the shell is very beautiful, as shown in fig. 59. In

the operculum of a large Turbo, also, a very beautiful cellular structure has
presented itself ; a portion of this (in which the section has traversed the
fusiform cells obliquely) is represented in fig. 60.

102. It will be obvious from the foregoing details, that the microscopic
examination of the shells of Gasteropoda has not been as fertile in regard to
the variety of its results, as a similar examination of Bivalve shells has
proved ; and that we cannot look to it for much assistance, either in helping
to fix the systematic position of shells whose other characters may leave it
in doubt, or in determining the genus or family to which a minute fragment
of shell is to be referred. But the investigation has most unequivocally demon
strated, that the shells of Gasteropoda, like those of Lamellibranchiata, pos

sess a regular organic arrangement ; and that this arrangement is everywhere
conformable to the beautifully-simple plan of cellular development, to which
we now seem justified in attributing the origin of all these structures, even
including those that in their perfect state scarcely contain an appreciable
trace of animal matter.
                         XVI. Cephalopoda.

103. The structure of the shells of the existing testaceous Cephalopods is
on the whole more analogous to that of Bivalves, than to that of the Univalve
shells of the preceding group ; the three layers of perpendicular laminae, so
characteristic of the latter, being here quite indistinguishable.                      The shell of
Nautilus is the only one in which the presence of two layers is obvious from
their difference of texture, the internal layer being nacreous, whilst the ex
ternal one is coloured and destitute of iridescence. A thin section of the
external layer of the shell of Nautilus pompilius, taken parallel to the sur
face, shows that it is made up of an aggregation of cells of various sizes ;
those strata which are nearest the external surface being the largest. The
general arrangement of these cells, and the occasional disappearance of their

boundaries, closely resemble what has been described and figured in the shell
of Mya                   21, 23). The internal or nacreous
cellular,  (§ 78, figs.  being very minute, and bearing a   layer is also distinctly
                                                            strong resemblance to
            the cells
those of the nacreous layer in Haliotis and Turbo. In the thin shell of Ar-
Igonauta the same kind of cellular structure can be easily distinguished, as in

the outer layer of Nautilus ; but have not been able to recognise in it any
internal layer at all comparable to the nacreous structure which makes up a

ception of the calcareous sheath of the Belemnite ; the appearances presented

lO-i. In the calcified layers which alternate with horny membranes to
form the shallow cone or cup of the internal shell (or Sepiostaire) of Sepia,
a distinct cellular arrangement is visible, when the section is made sufficiently
thin. The delicate and fragile transverse plates which are arranged obliquely
upon one another in the hollow of this cup, also show indications of cellular
structure, although these are by no means distinct. The thin chambers be
tween these transverse plates are traversed by an infinity of minute columnar
and sinuous partitions, planted at right angles to the plates, and so disposed
                                               to support each other. Professor

    the surface of one of the parallel plates be examined, it is found to be
traversed by sinuous lines, which frequently return almost completely upon
themselves ; and these lines are evidently the base-lines of the vertical par
titions, which are rather plates than fibres, although very apt to break into
fibres when an attempt is made to obtain a thin section of this curious struc
ture. They often present upon their surface a series of definite lines or
ridges, running parallel to the transverse plates which they serve to connect ;
these lines strongly remind us of the transverse striae upon the prismatic cells
of Pinna, and are probably indicative of the same kind of cellular origin.
105. The shell of Spirula must be considered (as is now universally ad
mitted) to bear a greater  resemblance, as regards its relation to the animal,
to the Sepiostaire, than
                           to the chambered shell of Nautilus, although it so
closely approximates the latter in its own conformation. This being the case,
it is interesting to find that the intimate structure of the shell has a much
greater resemblance to that of the Sepiostaire than would be supposed from
its general aspect. For although the texture of the shell seems uniform, and
its minute parts are composed of an aggregation of calcified cells, yet its
surface is marked by sinuous lines, closely resembling those which are seen
upon the transverse plates of the Sepiostaire ; and these lines or bauds pro
ject in such a degree, that they might be considered as rudiments of the

vertical partitions which connect these plates.

                           XVII. Echinodermata.

106. The structure of the skeleton of this class is entirely different from
that which we have found to be characteristic of the Mollusca, whilst in its

essential features it presents a remarkable uniformity throughout the various
members of the group. The general arrangement of its components is the
same, for example, in the firm plates which make up the testa of the Echinida,
in the joints of the stems and branches of the Crinoidea, and in the
                                                which are met           with  in the integument

these to a much greater degree of thinness than Prof. Valentin seems (from
the descriptions and delineations which he gives) to have succeeded in ob
taining*. My own investigations, too, have been carried into all the leading
groups of the class; and 1 had myself determined, and demonstrated to
others, the structure of their skeleton, before the Monograph of Prof. Va
lentin, published in 1842, had reached this country.
    107. The elementary structure of the skeleton of the Echinodertnata may
be described as a network, composed of calcareous and animal matter inti
mately united; the former, however, being greatly predominant. In this
network, the interspaces or areolae, and the solid structure which surrounds
them, may bear an extremely variable proportion to each other ; so that in
two masses of equal size the one or the other may greatly predominate, and
the texture may have either a remarkable lightness and porosity, or a con
siderable degree of compactness and brittleness. We may perhaps take the
plates making up the testa of the Echinus as presenting to us the most typi-

detail it. The process adopted in this country for making thin sections of bone, fossil wood,

the Echinodermata is being operated on, care must be taken that the drying is so complete as

to dissipate the water which has been absorbed during the polishing into the spaces of its

very porous substance. The best plan is to keep the sections warm near a fire or over a lamp
for some little time. A little Canada balsam, previously hardened by boiling, so as to attain

an almost resinous consistence, is then to be melted upon a slip of glass, and made to form a
thick drop, covering a space somewhat larger than the area of the section ; it may then be
allowed to cool, during which process the bubbles that may have formed in it will burst.

When cold its consistence may be tried; this being a point of great importance in the prepa

boiled a little more ; if too hard, it must be softened by being melted and then mixed with more
fluid balsam. When it is of the right consistence, the section should be laid upon its surface, the
polished side being downwards ; the slip of glass is then to be gradually warmed until the bal

sam is softened, care being taken however to avoid heating it so far as to occasion the formation
of bubbles ; and the section is to be gently pressed down upon the liquefied balsam. When a

 more solid or the more open character which it elsewhere presents. When we
 obtain a very thin slice of one of these plates, taken parallel to its surface, we
 find that it is composed of a lamina apparently in itself destitute of structure,
 which is perforated with considerable regularity by apertures of a circular
 or oval form (fig. 61 ). The diameter of these apertures varies to a certain

I Iextent in different parts of the same shell ; but from numerous measure

 ments which have made, believe that it may be stated as usually between
 1 -450th and 1 -2500th of an inch. These plates lie parallel to each other, but
not in contact ; for they are separated by little pillars, which rise up verti
cally from each plate to support the next, and which thus connect the dif
ferent plates whilst holding them apart from each other. The broken bases
or ends of these minute pillars are very commonly to be seen upon the sur
faces of the perforated plates (fig. 63c) ; and they are generally attached to
points intermediate between three of the apertures. The entire thickness of
the shell is thus made up by the succession of a great number of these per
forated plates, connected by their intermediate rows of minute pillars. The
successive plates are always so disposed, that the centres of the perforations
 of one shall correspond with the intermediate solid structure of the next, as
shown at a a, fig. 61, where small portions of another plate are seen beneath
the principal one. This arrangement is obviously destined to impart in
creased strength to the structure, being analogous to that which we meet
with in the bee's comb, where the centre of the bottom of the cell on one
side is opposite the meeting-point of the walls of three cells on the other.
Thus, in whatever direction we slice the shell of the Echinus, we always

meet with a sort of reticulated structure ; for if our section is parallel to the
surface of any one of the plates, it brings into view one or more of the per
forated lamina just described, whilst, if it be perpendicular to the surface,
it passes vertically through the series of these laminae, which form a succes
sion of bands nearly parallel to each other, and takes the direction of the

pillars that connect them with each other, these pillars dividing the spaces
between the laminae into areolae of a tolerably regular form (fig. 62). The
testa is thus of an extremely porous character, the quantity of solid matter
not being equivalent probably to more than one-third of its bulk, and the
areolae having the freest communication with each other. Hence it happens

that if a portion of a fractured edge, or any other part from which the in
vesting membrane has been removed, be laid upon fluid of almost any de
scription, the fluid will be immediately sucked-up into the substance of the
shell, and will add considerably to its weight. Thus a piece of the testa,

which when dry weighed 10 grains, when thus saturated with water weighed

13 grains.

    108. The substance of which the laminae and pillars are composed is so

extremely transparent, that when we have reduced a section to such a degree

of thinness as to contain a small number of layers of reticulation, it is easy,
     a proper adjustment of the focus of the microscope, to bring either one
    them into distinct view ; the intervention of two or three, between the eye

and the layer which is under examination, not having the effect of impeding
the sight of its structure. In fact, the opacity of a thicker layer, as of the
entire shell, is due, not so much to the inability of its proper substance to
transmit light, as to the dispersion of the light by the numerous irregular re
flexions and refractions which it will undergo when passing through several
laminae of the reticular structure. And we find, accordingly, that when
saturated with a transparent fluid, such as water or (still better) Canada

comes translucent.

109. The skeleton of the Echinodermata contains very little organic mat
ter. When it is submitted to the action of dilute acid, so that the calcareous

matter is removed, the residuum is very small in amount ; indeed, unless the
acid be so weak as only just to dissolve the carbonate of lime, the organic
matter will be also dissolved, and no animal basis will be apparent. If, on
the other hand, the testa or spines of the Echinus be calcined, they will
retain their form, but will be rendered extremely fragile. The following
analysis is given by Prof. Valentin, on the authority of his colleague, Prof.
Brunner, as representing the composition of the recent testa of the Echinus.
The proportion of organic matter, however, would seem, from the experi
ments of Prof. Valentin himself (with which my own concur), to be rather
too high.

110. When a thin slice of the testa of theEchinus is submitted to the action
of very dilute acid, so as to leave the organic basis undissolved, an examination
of the latter shows that it possesses a structure entirely different from the ani
mal basis of the shells of the Mollusca. The reticular structure is preserved ;
the meshes or areola? being bounded by a substance in which a fibrous ap
pearance, intermingled with granules, may be discerned under a sufficiently
high magnifying power. This tissue does not at all correspond either with
the cellular or the membranous basis, which have been described as left after

former appear to represent the cutis vera, of which the fibrous structure has
been calcified. This calcification of areolar or simply-fibrous tissue, by the
deposit of mineral substance, not in the meshes or areolae, but in intimate

union with the organic basis, is a condition of much interest to the physi
ologist; for it presents us with an example, even in this low grade of the ani
mal kingdom, of a process which seems to have an important share in the
formation and growth of bone*.

   * The attention of microscopists has been too much fixed of late upon the process of ossifi-
cation, as it occurs in cartilage, and upon the history of the cartilage-cells, bone-cells, &c.
Prof. Sharpey has lately, however, recalled attention to the well-known fact, that bone may
be developed in fibrous membranes as well as in cartilage; and he states as the result of his
observations (in which the author of this report can most fully confirm him), that bone may
be developed by the calcification of the fibres of fibrous tissues ; the edges of the cranial bones
being thus formed beyond the limits of their cartilaginous basis, and the increase of the long

   111. The entire substance of the testa enclosing the bodies of the Echi-
md<B is made up of the structure now described ; and there is no difference
between the internal and external portions of the shell, except in regard to
the relative size of the areolae. In fig. 62 we see a vertical section of the

shell of Echinus, which exhibits the comparatively coarse texture of its inner
portion, a. On the other hand, the texture is peculiarly close and firm in
the tubercles which rise from the outer surface to support the spines. The
structure of the calcareous framework which encloses the teeth is exactly of
the same nature with that of the shell. In the teeth, however, a different

arrangement is found, since the simple calcareous network would be by no
means adapted to the purposes to which those organs are applied. For a

112. The spines of the Echinus, Cidaris, &c. present a structure essen
tially the same with that of the plates composing the testa ; but they exhibit
some peculiarities which are due to their mode of growth, and others which
seem intended to confer upon them additional strength. When we make a
thin transverse section of almost any spine belonging to the genus Echinus,
we are at once struck with the existence of a series of concentric layers,
arranged in a manner that strongly reminds us of the layers of wood in the

Istem of an exogenous tree*. The number of these layers is extremely va

riable ; and, as shall presently show, it depends not merely upon the age of
the spine, but upon the part of its length from which the section is taken.
The centre of the spine is filled up with the same kind of calcareous network
as that of which the plates of the shell are composed ; but it is usually of a
less solid character, the areola; being larger in proportion to the fibro-calca-
reous structure which surrounds them, so that the network seems made up
by the interlacement of mere threads (fig. 66). This medullary centre is
bounded however by a row, more or less circular, of open spots, in which it
is deficient (fig. 65, a, a) ; these, upon a cursory examination, might be sup
posed from their perfect transparency to be void spaces ; but a closer exami
nation, especially at the outer surface of the spine, makes it evident that they
are the sections of a circular row of solid ribs or pillars, which form the ex
terior of every layer. Their solidity becomes very obvious when we either
examine a section of a spine whose substance is pervaded (as frequently hap
pens) with a deep colour, or when we examine a very thin section of any
spine by polarized light. Around the first circle of these solid pillars we find
another layer of the fibro-calcareous network, which again is bounded by

bona in diameter being effected by the progressive consolidation of the fibrous element of the
periosteum. It is frequently possible to trace out for some distance a fibre which has been

thus consolidated at one end by calcific deposit, and which remains soft at the other. (See
Introduction  to fifth edition of  Dr. Quain's Anatomy, p. cxlviii. et aeq.)

122 REPORT-- 1847.

another circle of solid pillars, whose transverse sections are seen at b, b (fig.
65). The same arrangement may be repeated many times. On looking at
the outer border of the section, we observe that the rounded sides of these
pillars form a series of projections (figs. 65 and 67, c, c) with hollows be
tween them ; and these exactly correspond with the projecting ribs and fur
rows which we may notice running along the natural surface of the spine
when we examine this with a magnifying-glass, or even (in some instances)
with the naked eye. There is considerable difference in the spines of the
various species with regard to the degree of proximity, and to the nature of
the connection, of these solid pillars. In some instances they seem to be de
tached from each other, each being united to the adjoining ones and to the
interior substance merely by the general fibro-calcareous network (as in fig.
65). But in other cases we observe that they obviously send prolongations
inwards, whose arrangement corresponds with that of the medullary rays of
the exogenous stem ; these prolongations are sometimes lost amid the fibro-
calcareous network (figs. 68, 69) ; but in other instances they pass inwards
without altogether losing their solid character, and abut against the exterior
of the row of pillars which bounds the layer within (figs. 70, 72). Even in
this latter case, whilst we can clearly trace inwards the solid plates until they
become continuous with the pillars of the next interior layer, we observe that
they are traversed by threads of the same fibro-calcareous network ; and it
seems rather difficult to reconcile the idea of the solidity of the plates with
the fact, that wherever we cut across this structure we observe the network
thus occupying the whole space from one circle of pillars to the next. We
shall find the explanation of this, however, in the structure which the longi
tudinal section reveals to us. When we examine a thin slice taken in the
latter direction in such a mariner that the plane of the section passes through
any diameter of the transverse section (so as to pass along with the radiating
plates and not across them), we see the centre of the spine occupied, as be
fore, with the fibro-calcareous network, forming a medulla, in which no re
gular pattern is discernible (fig. 73, a). This is bordered on either side by
along solid rib or pillar (1, 1) ; and upon a careful examination of this, it is
found that its inner border passes insensibly, as it were, into the fibro-cal
careous network, the solid part of which springs from it. Passing on to the

next layer on either side, we observe that the network re-appears (as in the
transverse section), but that it gradually assumes a more regular character
as we approach the long pillars (2, 2) that form its exterior, so as to present

bear a

exterior of the layer, where we lose them altogether, and instead of the fibro-
calcareous network find the solid rib or pillar. Upon the exterior of this we
find the areolar structure recommencing, and again passing gradually into
the solid ribs ; and this alternation continues until we reach the external

layer. This transition from the areolar structure into the imperforate plate is

shown on a larger scale in fig. 63. We see then that a transverse section taken
at any point of the length will find the pillars, b b, completely solid, whilst the
plates, a a,wh\c\i pass inwards from them towards the centre, are so perforated,
that when cut across at any point they will always exhibit somewhat of the
reticular structure. The variations just alluded to, as exhibited by the trans
verse sections of different spines, are presented also by the vertical ; for in
some we find the solid structure of the ribs in evert/ layer passing at once
into an irregular reticulation, as in the inner layer of the one here figured
(fig. 73), whilst in others the vertical plates of every layer pass with more

     next within.

        I113. Little doubt can, think, be entertained that the successive layers
     are, as in exogenous trees, the result of successive formations or acts of
     growth; their deposition taking place in the substance of the membrane
     which envelopes the exterior of the spines, in the same manner as the addi
     tions to the edges of the several plates of the shell are made by the calcifi
     cation of a portion of the membrane which dips down between them. At
     what intervals these additions are made, we have at present no means of de
     termining. The manner however in which they modify the form of the spine,
     as shown by sections in both directions, is often very curious. In fig. 73 is
     shown a longitudinal section of part of one of the large club-shaped spines of
     Echinus cUratus passing through about two-thirds of its length, and show
     ing the mode in which the successive growths are disposed. It will be seen
     that the spine, as first developed, terminated at d. The next layer completely
     invested this, but added much more to the length of the spine than to its dia
     meter ; its termination is seen at e. The successive layers, the terminations
     of four of which are seen at f,g, h and i, mark out the succession of sizes which
     the spine possessed after each addition ; the accretion being always so much
     greater in the longitudinal than in the transverse direction, as to preserve
     the original proportions of the spine throughout. The consequence
                                                                              k                             that

     external layers, the number being seldom increased.
                                                          have now and then,

     however, observed one or two additional pillars in the outer layers but the
     plates which should pass inwards from these towards the centre soon become
lost in the general reticulation.

spines of Echinida" he says, "the growth appears to be effected by the
addition of calcareous matter only to the proximal extremity, or fixed ends
of the spines. The lines of growth do not then converge and meet in
longitudinal sections, but diverge and terminate at the sides of the spines.
This structure is seen in the spines of Cidaris pistillaris. The compact
portion of the spine formed within the capsule is seen occupying the middle
of its whole extent; and the successive layers of growth are observed

extending from this central portion to the sides along the whole spine."
This description, however, having been given at a time when nothing was
known of the minute structure of the shell or its appendages, is far from
being accurate, as will appear from the following account of the appear
ances presented when thin sections of the spines of Cidaris are examined
with the microscope. Their principal substance is made up of the same
calcareous areolar structure as that of which the shell is composed ; but
this presents none of the concentric arrangement so beautifully displayed
by transverse sections of the spines of Echini. The central portion usually
has a larger or looser reticulation than the external ; but there is no definite
boundary between the two, the large areolae of the central portion becoming
gradually contracted, until they pass into the average of those which make
up the principal part of the area of the section. As there is nothing 'like a
concentric arrangement of successive layers, so there are but very slight indi
cations of the longitudinal lamellas, whose radiating arrangement is so cha

racteristic in the spines of Echini. A transverse section shows that along

certain lines passing from the centre to the circumference, the calcareous

network seems to have a greater tendency to solidity than in the intervening
spaces, presenting, in fact, very much the appearance of those portions which
are seen in fig. 69 to connect the solid ribs of one layer with those of another.

or in longitudinal sections, the least trace of the interruption of the areolar
structure by lines of growth. But the areolar structure of the spine of
Cidaris is completely encased by a cylindrical covering of a solid apparently
homogeneous substance, chiefly calcareous ; and it is this which is very com
monly raised up in ridges on its exterior. This substance is traversed by
lines, which pass from the interior substance to the external surface of the

spine, their direction however not being exactly at right angles to the axis

of the spine, but being commonly a little oblique. These I presume to be

believes to have been joined on at the base of the spine ; but when they are

that whatever additions these spines may receive in length, they cannot be
augmented in diameter, this being fixed in the first instance by the produc
tion of the solid calcareous cylinder, which forms the exterior of the spine.
    117. The same general plan of structure may be traced in the spiny ap
pendages of other Echinida ; such as the slender almost filamentary spines of
the SpcUangacece, and the innumerable still more minute hair-like processes
attached to the shell of the Clypeasteria. Many of these are extremely
beautiful objects, when examined entire under the microscope without any

preparation.

   118. It is interesting also to remark that the same calcareous reticulation
presents itself in the curious Pedicellaria, which is found upon the surface
of many Echinida, and has been so great a source of perplexity to zoolo
gists. The complete conformity which exists between the structure of their
skeleton and that of the animal to which they are attached, ought in my
Iopinion to remove any remaining doubt that they are truly appendages of it.

In fact, can see no more reason for regarding them as parasites, than we
consider the ambulacral tubes. That they participate  ifnactthaemvointaglitoytheorfs,t--he
body upon which they grow, is shown by this curious
that when the skin of a living Echinus is irritated with the point of a needle
or pin, the small spines, and also the pedicellarue in the neighbourhood, all
bend over towards the irritated spot, their movements being obviously di
rected to the removal of the source of irritation. This statement, first made

by Sars, has been    denied by   Prof. Forbes (British Starfishes, p. 159)  ; but
                      testimony  to the fact, having repeatedly tried the   expe

   The structure exhibited in the shell of the Echinus is repeated in that

of the three genera whicli may be regarded as the types of the principal
subdivisions of this order; namely, Cidaris, Clypeaster, and Spatangus.
There can therefore be no reasonable doubt that it is universal throughout
the group. No such differences present themselves, however, as would serve
to establish generic or even family distinctions ; but the structure is so cha
racteristic of the class, that the minutest fragment of the skeleton of an
Echinoderm might be unhesitatingly recognized as such by the aid of the
microscope. And this structure is perfectly preserved, even after the shell
has been infiltrated with calcareous matter in the act of fossilization, and has

become so completely mineralized, that the disposition to rhomboidal cleavage
makes it difficult to obtain a section in any other direction. The fossil
Echinida of the oolite are much better subjects for microscopical investi
gation than are those of the chalk ; since, beautiful as the latter are exter
nally, the infiltration by which they have been mineralized seems to have
contained so much undissolved carbonate of lime, which has been deposited
in an amorphous state, that it is difficult to obtain transparent sections of

   * In all such cases positive evidence is of course to be preferred to negative. It will be

remembered that Prof. Agassiz had the temerity to deny that the Echinida could use their
ambulacral tubes for progression, because he had never seen them do so ; a statement very
properly refuted by Prof. Forbes (op. cit. p. 144). The large Echinus sphcera, mentioned in
the text, climbed up the sides of a basin by means of these tubes, and kept itself anchored

near the top by the suckers at their extremity.

     them. Characters of much value, however, may probably be drawn from

     Ithe internal structure as well as from the external markings of the spinet;

     and quite agree with Prof. Forbes (British Starfishes, p. 145), that these
     characters are of value in distinguishing species as well as genera among the
     Cidaritcs ; whilst in the families Clypeasterice and Spatangacem (in which the
     spines are almost rudimentary) their differences are less minute, being rather
     characteristic of the                        of their subdivisions.

     their spines, when these are furnished with a calcareous framework, and are
     not mere projections of the hard integument. The spines of the large Go-

     niaster eqttcstris are particularly well developed ; and both they and the mam
     miform tubercles on which they are seated most distinctly display the cal
     careous network already described. They are not united together by a ball-
     and-socket articulation, the adjacent surfaces of the tubercle and spine being
     flattened, and held together by a membrane. There is no interposition of
     solid laminae in the interior of the spine, nor any difference of structure on
     its exterior ; but the substance is of the same character throughout. This

solid carbonate of lime, cleaving into regular rhomboids. The patterns shown
in transverse sections of the stem are so different in distinct species of Penta-

crinite, that they may serve to afford valuable specific characters, or may

enable us to recognise the species from minute fragments. Thus in fig. 73
we see that the spaces included between the diverging rays are of the same
oval form as those of the recent Pentacrinus, but that they interlace with the
surrounding stmcture by set of broad digitate prolongations, which are
altogether wanting in the latter. And in fig. 74, in which these digitate proa

longations are again shown, we find that the spaces included between the
radiating plates of each pair are no longer broad and oval, but narrow and

Ibounded by nearly straight edges. have not been able to obtain specimens
enough of the several species of Pentacrinite to follow out this inquiry as it

deserves ; but I may remark, that, so far as my knowledge extends, the vari
ation of internal structure in different parts of the same stem is very trifling,
--much less,      in fact, than might be          inferred  from the surface-markings  of
the joints, --  as delineated by (Joldfuss         and Dr.  Auckland.

121. Whilst in the Pentacrinus there is an entire absence of any appear
ance of concentric arrangement, we meet with this in the stems of Apiocrinites,
Actinocrinites, and other round-stemmed Encrinites, which do not show, any
trace of the medullary rays of the Pentacrinite. The characters of their ele

mentary structure are precisely conformable to the general type, and do not
present any speciality that can serve for the discrimination of species or
genera. The structure of the plates of the body, in these and other Crinoi-
dea, is exactly the same as that of the pieces of the testa of Echinus.

   122. It only remains for us to notice the orders Holothuriadm and Sipun-
culidce, in which, as is well-known, the calcareous skeleton of the other

Echinodermata is reduced to its most rudimentary condition, never forming
a complete and connected framework, but only showing itself in detached
pieces, the disposition of which is extremely variable. In the Holothuria
discovered a few years since on the Cornish coast by Mr. C.W. Peach, there
are five solid calcareous plates around the mouth, in which the characteristic
reticulation is well seen. Each of the tentacula also has a small calcareous
Idisc at its extremity, which is a sort of rude sketch of that of the ambulacral
suckers of the Echinus.              am not aware that any trace of a calcareous
skeleton has been found in either of the genera of the order Sipunculacete ;
but looking to the extraordinary unity in the plan of organization, which is
Ishown in the elementary structure of the skeleton throughout the entire

class of Echinodermata, cannot doubt that should such rudiments be dis

covered, they would present a similar character.

layers ; internally, a thick calcareous layer, the surface of which is raised up
in little papillary elevations ; upon this lies a layer of pigment-cells, to which
the colour is due ; and externally is a structureless horny epidermis. The
pigment-cells fill up the valleys or intervals between the papillary elevations
of the calcareous layer, but do not cover the latter. The epidermis, which
is quite smooth, lies flat upon the whole, adhering to the tops of the papillae ;
so that, when the shell is closely examined from the outside, it is seen to have

a minutely speckled appearance, the red ground given by the pigment-cells
being studded with the white tops of the papillae which rise up through it.

thin slices, and being perforated by an immense number of minute sinuous
tubuli, which run nearly parallel to one another from one surface of the shell
to the other. This arrangement may be seen by making a thin section of
any part of the shell ; but it may be shown particularly well in the end of the
claw, which is thicker and of denser texture than the rest. A transverse
section of this shows the tubes radiating from
                                                             the central  cavity towards the
external surface, and would, I feel assured,                 be regarded  by the most expe
rienced observer as the section of a tooth, if he were not informed of its real
nature."
   124. Of the horny epidermic membrane it is not requisite to say anything
additional. It is easily detached from the subjacent layers, after the shell has
been immersed for a time in dilute acid ; and I find M. Lavalle in accordance
with me in the statement that it presents no trace of structure. The pigmentary
layer, which it covers-in, presents(when examined with a sufficiently high mag

nifying power)         the clearest possible indications of  cellular arrangement (fig.
                       therefore only attribute to the want  of a sufficiently minute ex

layer often presents a well-marked areolar aspect. The Lupcea dicantha pre
sents a good example of this organization. Here, as in the majority of cases,
the polygons which by their junction form this surface, are nearly regular,
and most commonly present six sides. In some cases there may be remarked
in the middle of nearly all these polygons a little prolongation which appears
to belong to the epidermic layer. Is this appearance due to veritable
lines disposed in a regular network ? Or is it rather produced by little mam
Imilla: pressed against each other, of which we can only distinguish the fur
rows of separation ?         am of this last opinion." The representation given
by M. Lavalle of the pigmentary layer of Lupcea dicantha closely resembles
fig. 78, which is a view of the pigmentary layer in the common Crab (Cancer
pagurus) under a low magnifying power. But when a sufficiently thin sec
tion is examined by transmitted light with a high magnifying power, the
character of the network and of the dark spaces which it encloses becomes
at once apparent (fig. 79). It is then obvious that the nearly colourless
polygonal reticulations are the thickened walls of cells, each of them being
seen to be divided by a distinct line, which marks the junction of the conti-
tiguous boundaries ; whilst the dark spaces or areola; are the cavities of the
cells, filled up with colouring matter or with some other semi-opake sub
stance. This structure is not confined to the coloured parts of the shell ;
the cellular layer being equally found on the white under-surface of the body
and legs. It is noticed by M. Lavalle that the colouring layer seems to con
tain carbonate of lime ; as, in cases where it can be detached from the layers
above and beneath, it effervesces when placed in dilute acid. As it is not

Ithick enough in the Crab and Lobster to be thus separately examined,

cannot speak on this point ; but I should be disposed to think that the calca
reous matter forms the deposit on the walls of the cells which give them such
remarkable thickness. The presence of the pigmentary layer has been de
termined by M. Lavalle in a large number of Decapod Crustacea of different
tribes ; and he states that in some instances it is of very considerable thick
ness, being in the Scyllarus lotus the thickest of the three layers of the shell.

probably because the pigmentary layer in the specimens have examined

                                     they seem to be   analogous                              to those shown
in figs. 80 and 81 in the subjacent  calcified layer.
    125. The internal or dermal layer is that which constitutes by far the
thickest part of the shell of the Crab ; and must be regarded as its funda
mental or essential element, since (according to M. Lavalle) it is never
·wanting in the Decapod Crustacea, whilst the other layers are sometimes de

ficient. It is in this internal layer that the calcareous matter is chiefly de
posited ; but even after this has been removed, a very distinct animal basis
is left, possessing considerable substance, and analogous to that which is left
after the decalcification of dentine. The lines which are seen in a vertical sec
tion of the shell to be running parallel to the surface and to each other

(figs. 80, 81), closely correspond with those which are presented by many
varieties of dentine, and seem to indicate the successive stages of the calci
fication of the testa from without inwards. These lines are stated by M.
Lavalle to present themselves in the shells of all the Crustacea which he has
examined, with the exception of certain Anomoura ; and in these exceptional
cases the dermal layer presents the further peculiarity of distinct iridescent
colours. This coloration, he adds, remains after the removal of the calca

reous matter by dilute acid. In certain other cases, a portion of the dermal
layer exhibits these lines, whilst others are destitute of them. Their number

differs widely in different species, from 8 to 210 or more; and it seems to
vary in the same species according to age ; young Crayfish having from 6 to
10, and large ones from 25 to 30 in corresponding portions of the shell. In
his speculations regarding the nature of these lines and the intimate structure

of the shell-substance, M. Lavalle appears to me to have been altogether led
astray by the insufficiency of his magnifying power, and probably also by
the too great thickness of his sections. He describes the substance of the

Lavalle should have stopped short at this point. The application of a suffi
ciently high power to a very thin vertical section of the shell brings into
distinct view the existence of parallel tubuli (fig. 81) ; and if a section
parallel to the surface be examined with a similar magnifying power, the
orifices of the tubuli are seen, surrounded by a clear space which indicates
the thickness of their walls, precisely as in dentine. This structure is par
ticularly well seen in the black extremities of the claws of the common Crab,
in which the intertubular substance is quite pellucid in a thin section, and

of which the density is as great as that of many varieties of dentine. It
exists likewise in the remainder of the shell; but from some difference in its
molecular constitution, the shell generally is of a much less dense and tena
cious character, and the intertubular substance has an opake chalky aspect,
which renders even a very thin section of it impermeable to light unless it
be saturated with Canada balsam, which then very commonly enters the

tubuli and prevents them from being readily distinguishable.                                  k

   126. My distance from the coast has hitherto deprived me of the oppor
tunity of examining a Crab or Lobster in the act of forming a new shell after

the exuviation of the old one ; and I cannot therefore speak with any certainty

in regard to the mode in which the dermal layer is developed and calcified.
There can be little room for doubt, however, that the process of the formation
of this layer of the testa is precisely analogous to the development of the
dentinal structure ; and that it originates, like the latter, in a cellular pulp,
covering (in this case) the entire surface of the true skin. The parallel
lines brought into view in a vertical section can scarcely be anything else
than indications of successive stages of calcification ; and the objection to
such a view, drawn by M. Lavalle from the fact that there is a perfect
continuity of structure between the successive bauds, ceases to have any
weight, when it is remembered that the same continuity exists in dentine,
which is unquestionably calcified in successive layers from without inwards.

Report by the Rev. W. Whewell, D.D. and Sir James C. Ross
  upon the recommendation of an Expedition for the purpose of com

   pleting our knowledge of the Tides.

The knowledge which we possess of the tides, looking at the connexion of
the phenomena over the whole surface of the ocean, is extremely imperfect
at present, and not at all likely to be completed in any material degree in
any finite time, by the observations which voyages mainly directed to other
objects will supply. The coasts and islands which surround or break the
waters of the Pacific are especially the seats of this ignorance. We know
the time of the tide near Cape Horn ; but cannot trace the progress of the
tide-wave along the western coast of South and North America. We know

the time of tide on the coasts of New Zealand ; but cannot connect this fact

with the rise and fall of the water on the coasts of the smaller islands in the

centre of the ocean. We know the tide hour on the eastern coast of New Hol

land ; but cannot trace    the progress of the tide to the Philippines, or to the
coast of China, -- though  some observations of Admiral Liitke made a few years
ago supply a valuable addition to our knowledge on this subject. The course
of the tide-wave among the islands of the Indian Sea is likewise unknown.

Observations made by voyagers mainly guided by other purposes, appear
little likely to supply this deficiency in our knowledge ; for even when made
with sufficient care and for several weeks at detached places, they are rarely

connected with each other or with neighbouring places. It does not appear
that while we are thus left to depend on chance for our tidal knowledge, we

shall ever be able to know from observation whether the tide-wave in the

Pacific does or does not move from east to west.

But a ship sent out on purpose to observe the tides would very soon ascer
ON AN EXPEDITION FOR TIDE OBSERVATIONS.  135

tain a great body of facts of this kind. The observers would, of course,
observe the facts of the tides in connexion with each other ; and would
arrange their plan of operation so as to extend their lines of connexion from
known points to unknown. By such a mode of proceeding the cotidal lines
for every part of the Pacific and Indian Oceans might probably be drawn
(omitting the minor details in the interior of archipelagos, &c.) in a year, or

at most, in two years.

    The tide observations made at the request of Dr. Whewell in 1834 for a
fortnight by the coast-guard on the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland, prove
how great an accession our tidal knowledge may receive from connected ob
servations; and still more those made in June 1835 for a fortnight along the
coasts of the whole of Europe and the eastern coast of the United States of
North America. By means of these observations the general course of the

Iftides in the seas thus explored has been determined.

       an expedition were sent for the purpose of making tide observations, it
would not be at all necessary to have, as in the instances just mentioned,
simultaneous observations along the whole line of sea observed. It would

suffice to connect a few places by corresponding observations, in some cases
for a fortnight, in others for a few days ; then, to connect one of these places
with others, and thus to proceed through the whole region observed.

   It appears by the experience of the surveys which we have referred to,

that the observations may be made by sailors such as those employed on the
coast-guard, under proper directions. On those occasions the necessary appa

ratus was speedily constructed by the persons employed. It might however
be useful also to employ, in several places, self-registering tide-gauges, such
as are already established in several English ports.

    We conceive that the project contemplated by the Association in its recom
mendation is very desirable ; and might best be attained by sending out a
vessel which should have for the object of its voyage to make tide observa
tions upon such a connected system. For this purpose, the vessel ought to
carry, in addition to a crew sufficient to work her, ten or fifteen men, who by
themselves (in pairs), or under the direction of petty officers, might be trusted
to make tide observations for a week or a fortnight at selected points of coast.
The surveying vessel ought to be provided with a launch, to be employed in
carrying these observers to their station, visiting them while engaged in their
work, or fetching them away when their task at each place is done. From
one region to another of the ocean, standard stations ought to be selected, at
which tide observations should be continued for a longer time, and the ob
servations made in each region should be compared with those at the standard
station. The comparison of the observations with each other, as the survey
proceeded, would point out the direction in which it was desirable to extend
the survey, and the special points to be attended to. We therefore recom
mend that application be made to the Admiralty that they would appropriate

to this service a suitable vessel.

           Colouring Matters. By Dr. Schunck.

At the meeting of the British Association at Southampton I gave a short

account of my experiments on the colouring matters of madder. I have
continued this investigation, and have found the extent of the subject too
                                                          of the colouring mat
great  to  allow me to devote my attention to any other   state the new results
ters.      shall therefore, without any further preface,
       I
which I have arrived at in regard to the chemical constituents of this root.
On treating finely-ground madder roots with boiling water, a brown fluid
is obtained having a taste between bitter and sweet. In order to extract all
the substances capable of solution in water, about sixteen quarts of water are
required for every pound of madder. To this fluid any strong acid, such as
sulphuric or muriatic acid, is added in slight excess. Nitric acid must not
be used for the purpose. Oxalic acid is best adapted for the purpose, as it
can afterwards be completely removed by chalk. The acid produces a dark
brown precipitate, which is separated by filtration and washed with water
until the excess of acid is removed. The percolating fluid is yellow. This
brown precipitate consists of six vegetable substances, viz. two colouring
matters, two kinds of fat, pectic acid and a substance of an intensely bitter

taste, which I am as yet unable to refer to any known class of bodies. The
whole quantity of colouring matter contained in the aqueous extract of mad
der is precipitated by the addition of a strong acid. In proof of this I took
a quantity of the aqueous extract, added sulphuric acid, separated the brown
precipitate by filtration and removed the excess of acid with cold water, and
then boiled it with water, into which a small piece of mordanted cloth was
introduced. The cloth assumed the same colours which it would have done

with madder. To the fluid to which acid bad been added I put chalk until
all the acid was saturated, and I then found after filtering that it communi

cated no colour whatever to mordanted cloth.

  Of the two colouring matters, one is Robiquet's Alizarin, and the other I

shall call Rubiacin. Both are contained in the brown precipitate produced
by acids in the aqueous extract of madder. In order to obtain them, this
brown precipitate is first treated with boiling alcohol until nothing more is
dissolved. A dark brownish-purple, somewhat gelatinous mass is left behind,
consisting principally of pectic acid. The alcoholic fluid, which contains
the two colouring matters together with the fats, has a dark brownish-yellow
colour. After being distilled and then evaporated to dryness, a residue
of a dirty orange colour remains. This residue is placed on a filter and
washed with cold water, until the percolating fluid, which is at first yellow,
becomes colourless. On evaporation this fluid leaves a transparent yellow
substance with a bitter taste, mentioned above. This substance is soluble in

pure water, but insoluble in water containing acids, and hence it is precipi
tated on adding acid to the aqueous extract of madder; but on washing the
precipitate with water, after the acid 1ms been removed it begins to dissolve.
In order to obtain therefore, the brown precipitate must only be washed so
           it

flocks, which consist of alizarin mixed with fat. This process must be re
Ifpeated until the boiling fluid deposits nothing more on cooling.
                                                                                           any

hot water. The whole of the alizarin dissolved in the boiling water is de
posited on eooling, but mingled with fat, which probably accompanies it
through the filter in a state of suspension produced by the heat of the boil
ing fluid. This fat disguises its properties very much, and has been the cause,
in all previous investigations, of alizarin never having been obtained in a state
of purity except through the agency of heat, which has always left it doubt
Iful whether it existed in the plant as such, or was formed by the action of
heat from some other substance.     hope to establish satisfactorily its exist
ence as a constituent of the madder root, and also the fact of its being a pure

colouring matter, a circumstance which has likewise been doubted. In order
to obtain it in a state of purity, the red flocks which are deposited by the boil
ing watery solution are separated by filtration and dissolved in boiling alco
hol. To the boiling solution, which has a brownish-yellow colour, hydrate
of alumina is added, and the boiling is continued for some time. The aliza
rin combines with the alumina, forming a dark-red compound, while the fluid
loses its colour. Fresh alumina is added, until no more colouring matter can

be thereby separated. A great part of the fat remains dissolved in the alco
hol, while a part combines with the alumina. The coloured alumina is sepa

rated by filtration and washed with alcohol for some time. It is then treated
with a weak boiling solution of caustic potash, which dissolves the excess of
alumina and all the fat which may have combined with the alumina, but
leaves the compound of alizarin and alumina undissolved, merely changing
its colour from red to dark purple. This process is repeated several times,
until the alkaline fluid is no longer red, but of a pure purple colour. The
residue is treated with muriatic acid, which dissolves the alumina and leaves

the alizarin behind in crystalline flocks of an orange colour, which are washed
with water to remove the acid and then dissolved in alcohol. The alcoholic
solution on evaporation gives shining, prismatic, orange-coloured crystals of
alizarin, which may, if necessary, be purified by a second crystallization from

alcohol.
   The mass left undissolved by boiling water consists of rubiacin and two

distinct kinds of fat. I have only been able to discover one method of ex
tracting the rubiacin from this mixture. This method is founded on the

solubility of rubiacin in perchloride and pernitrate of iron. It is immaterial

the purpose.  the mixture of rubiacin with the two fats be treated with a
somewhat concentrated boiling solution of perchloride or pernitrate of iron, a

solution of a deep reddish-brown colour is obtained, while a brown residue
remains insoluble in an excess of the iron salt solution, and consisting of one
of the two fats in combination with oxide of iron. The fluid is filtered, and
on the addition to it of muriatic acid, a yellow flocculent precipitate is ob
tained, which is separated by filtration and washed until all the iron salt and

The latter substance does not exist ready-formed in madder, but is produced
by the action of the persalt of iron on rubiacin. This action consists in the
rubiacin taking up a certain number of atoms of oxygen from the persalt
of iron, and the acid which is thus formed combines with peroxide of iron,
producing a compound soluble in water with a reddish-brown colour, and de
composable by any strong acid. Part of the rubiacin however escapes this
action, and is precipitated together with the rubiacic acid and fat on the addi
tion of muriatic acid. The precipitate is treated with boiling alcohol, which

dissolves the rubiacin and the fat, and leaves behind the rubiacic acid in the

shape of a yellow powder. This process is repeated until nothing more is

dissolved by the alcohol. The boiling alcohol, after being filtered, deposits
on cooling rubiacin in small shining yellow crystals, which must be purified
by recrystallization. The fluid has a yellowish-red colour. On evaporation
it gives a quantity of an easily fusible dark reddish-brown fat, which by re
peated fusion in boiling water and agitation with the fluid while in a melted
state, may be separated from the rubiacin which adheres to it. The rubiacic
acid which is left by the boiling alcohol is treated with a weak boiling solu
tion of carbonate of potash, in which it dissolves with a dark brown colour.
The solution after cooling and standing some time deposits a mass of brick-
red needle-shaped crystals of rubiacate of potash, which are easily purified by

recrystallization. By dissolving this salt in boiling water and adding any
strong acid, rubiacic acid in a state of purity is precipitated as a bright lemon-
yellow powder. The dark solution from which the rubiacate of potash has
crystallized contains a quantity of the brown fat dissolved in the potash.

   The brown substance left undissolved by the perchloride or pernitrate of
iron is, as I stated above, a compound of one of the two fats with oxide of
iron. On being treated with muriatic acid the oxide of iron is dissolved,
leaving behind the fat, which, after being washed with water, is dissolved
in boiling alcohol. From this it is deposited on cooling as a light brown

Ipowder.

      mentioned above that the residue which is left on treating the brown

precipitate with boiling alcohol, consists principally of pectic acid. It is

treated with boiling water until nothing more is dissolved. The solution,
which has a light brown colour, and is somewhat mucilaginous, gives a brown,
transparent substance, which easily separates in scales from the sides and
bottom of the vessel. After treating the residue with water until nothing
more is dissolved, there still remains a dark brown substance undissolved,

which I suppose to be a compound of some of the preceding substances with

oxide of iron, as it leaves a considerable quantity of ash, consisting of per
oxide of iron, on being burnt.

   To the aqueous extract of madder, in which the brown precipitate had
been produced by oxalic acid, 1 added chalk until all the excess of acid was
saturated, and after filtration 1 evaporated it. It left a dark brown syrup,
which may be separated by means of alcohol into two substances. That
which is dissolved seems to be grape-sugar, and that which is left behind is
a species of extractive matter, which agrees in its properties with xanthin,
as described by Kuhlrnann. It has a brown colour. During evaporation in
contact with the air it deposits a brown substance or apothegma, like all ex
tractive matters. But it is distinguished from all other extractive matters
which I know, by being converted into a green insoluble substance when its
solution is boiled with dilute sulphuric or muriatic acid. I have not exa
mined it further, but I may mention that it is probably this body which exerts
such a deleterious influence during the process of madder-dyeing, rendering

Ithe red and purple brown and unsightly.

     shall now proceed to give a more detailed account of the properties of
some of the   substances, the methods of obtaining which           I have just described.

tical with his.

Alizarin has the following properties :--When heated on platinum foil it
melts and burns with a bright flame. When heated in a glass tube closed at
one end it melts and gives yellow fumes, which condense on the colder parts
of the glass, forming an oil, which soon congeals to a mass of orange-coloured

crystals possessing a considerable lustre, which are unchanged alizarin. A
carbonaceous residue is usually left in this case, but I have no doubt that by
carefully heating it might be entirely volatilized. Alizarin is slightly soluble
in boiling water. The solution has a yellow colour, but so small is the quan
tity dissolved, that the alkali or earth usually contained in filtering paper is
sufficient to render the solution pink, on being filtered to separate it from the
excess of alizarin. Hence no doubt arises the statement found in books, that

alizarin dissolves in water with a pink colour. The boiling solution deposits

it on cooling in yellow crystalline flocks. It is soluble in boiling alcohol.
The solution has a deep yellow colour and deposits nothing on cooling, but
on evaporation the alizarin is left in long needle-shaped or prismatic orange-
coloured crystals possessing a considerable lustre. The colour of the crystals
very much resembles that of bichromate of potash. Concentrated sulphuric

acid dissolves alizarin in the cold with a blood-red colour. It is precipitated
from this solution by water in flocks of a dull orange colour. Dilute nitric
Ifacid decomposes it on boiling with an evolution of nitrous acid.  it is still

mixed with fat, then the fat remains behind after the alizarin has been de

composed and dissolved by the nitric acid. It is not affected by muriatic or
acetic acid. On passing chlorine into water in which alizarin is suspended,
the colour of the latter is changed to yellow, but it is seemingly not destroyed.

It is decomposed by bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid. A boiling
solution of perchloride or pernitrate of iron decomposes it with a copious evo
lution of gas, a pungent smell resembling that of aldehyde being at the same
time given off. The product of this decomposition I shall describe presently.
Chloride of gold is not reduced by it on boiling, but on the addition of cau
stic potash metallic gold is deposited in shining scales. It is soluble in caustic
and carbonated alkalies with a splendid purple colour, and is reprecipitated
by acids in flocks of a dull orange colour. The solution in ammonia gives
with the chlorides of barium and calcium precipitates of a splendid purple
colour, with sugar of lead a light purple precipitate. The compound with
alumina, produced by introducing hydrate of alumina into an alcoholic solu
tion of alizarin, is not decomposed by a concentrated solution of caustic pot
ash. The alcoholic solution gives with acetate of iron a dark purple preci
pitate, with acetate of copper a light purple precipitate, with protochloride

precipitate is produced.  alizarin and a piece of mordanted cloth be intro

duced into boiling water and the boiling be continued for some time, the cloth

becomes slowly dyed and the mordants assume the tints peculiar to the so-
called madder colours. The alizarin slowly disappears in the same measure
as the cloth becomes dyed, even though less water had been taken than was

sufficient to dissolve the whole quantity. It is evident therefore that in the
process of dyeing, the alizarin, which is dissolved in the first instance by the
boiling water, is taken up by the mordants of the cloth, that then a fresh
quantity is dissolved by the water, which is again absorbed, and so on, until
all the alizarin has combined with the cloth, or until the mordants can take

up no more. Hence the slowness with which madder dyeing is effected. No

doubt can remain then, I think, that alizarin plays a great part in the pro
duction of madder colours. That it does not produce the whole effect in
Idyeing with madder I shall show afterwards.

   Alizaric
              acid.-- At one      period       of my   investigation              imagined that alizarin

and rubiacin might be separated by boiling the mixture with perchloride of
iron, in which case I expected the rubiacin to dissolve in the solution of the
iron salt and the alizarin to remain behind in combination with oxide of iron.

I was not aware at that time that alizarin is decomposed by perchloride of
iron. Before 1 had discovered this, however, 1 had taken about one hundred
weight of madder, treated it with boiling water, added acid to the fluid, sepa
rated the brown precipitate by filtration, and treated the whole quantity of
precipitate with perchloride of iron. The fluid was, after the addition of
acid and filtration, evaporated to a syrup. After allowing the syrup to stand

them in hot caustic alkali, filtered to separate some oxide of iron which re

mained behind, and added sulphuric acid to the fluid while still hot. On the
fluid cooling there separated a quantity of long shining white crystals, which
were separated by filtration and washed. I now found that they contained
no oxalic acid, but that they bore a striking resemblance to benzoic acid.
Indeed some of the reactions are the same as those of benzoic acid, and it
Iwas only after

Its taste is acid. When heated on platinum foil it melts and burns with a

smoky flame, leaving no residue. When heated in a tube it is completely
volatilized, without leaving the least residue. The vapours condense in the
colder parts   of the tube,                                                       This sublimate differs

alizaric acid. When heated in a tube with caustic lime it is decomposed and
a yellow oil distils over, having a smell very nearly resembling that of benzin.
It is soluble in boiling water; the solution has an acid taste and reddens
litmus paper. A concentrated boiling solution crystallizes on cooling. It
is easily soluble in alcohol. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it in the
cold. On boiling the solution no blackening takes place, and the alizaric

acid distils over and crystallizes on the cooler parts of the tube. It is easily
soluble in alkalies. A concentrated alkaline solution gives crystals on the
Ifaddition of a strong acid. The solution in ammonia gives no precipitates
with the chlorides of barium and calcium.                    to the solution in water chalk

be added until all effervescence has ceased, the solution gives a crystallized
lime salt on evaporation. This lime salt is decomposed on being strongly
heated in a tube, becomes black, and gives an oil with an aromatic odour
which on cooling crystallizes. The aqueous solution gives with perchloride
of iron a yellowish-white precipitate, with sugar of lead a white precipitate,
with nitrate of silver alone no precipitate, but on the addition of ammonia a
white curdy precipitate, which after some time becomes crystalline. The re
action with sugar of lead distinguishes it from benzoic acid, which is not
thereby precipitated. Its greater solubility in water and its acid taste are
also distinguishing characteristics ; but in most respects it will be seen that

the resemblance between the two is very striking. It is very probable that
this acid is also formed from alizarin by means of nitric acid, but the small

quantity of pure alizarin hitherto at my disposal has prevented me from

ascertaining whether this is the case.

tical with Robiquet's alizarin, and have therefore given it a new name.
Rubiacin is most easily obtained in a state of purity from rubiacic acid.
Rubiacin and rubiacic acid are mutually convertible, as they only differ from
one another by a certain number of atoms of oxygen. Rubiacin is converted
into rubiacic acid by the action of the persalts of iron, and rubiacic acid may
be reconverted into rubiacin by reducing agents, such as sulphuretted hydro
gen. In order then to obtain pure rubiacin, it is best to take a solution of
pure rubiacate of potash, to which a slight excess of caustic potash has been
added, and to pass sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the solution for some
time. Chloride of barium is then added, which produces a dark purple pre
cipitate, consisting of rubiacin in combination with baryta. This is separated
by filtration, and washed with cold water until the sulphuret of barium and
hyposulphite of baryta are removed, and then decomposed with muriatic
acid, which leaves the rubiacin behind. After being washed with water, it

is dissolved in boiling alcohol, from which it crystallizes on the solution

cooling. It is obtained by these means in beautiful yellow crystalline plates
and needles, having a strong lustre. The colour is a little darker than that

dissolves entirely in caustic potash, forming a purple solution, a characteristic
which distinguishes it from alizarin, the alumina compound of which, as

mentioned above, is insoluble in caustic potash.
    The aqueous and alcoholic solutions of rubiacin communicate a slight tinge
to mordanted cloth, the latter more than the former. It seems to be inca
pable itself of dyeing, but in conjunction with alizarin it assists in the process

    madder-dyeing    in  a   very  essential manner,
    Rubiaeic Acid.          have   before described   the method of obtaining this
                    --I

acid through the instrumentality of the persalts of iron. There is no
reason for supposing that it exists as such in the plant. It is doubtless a
product of the oxidation of rubiacin. To obtain it in a state of purity, pure
crystallized rubiacate of potash is dissolved in water, and muriatic acid or
any strong acid is added, which precipitates the rubiaeic acid in the shape of
a yellow powder. It has a pure lemon-yellow colour. It cannot be obtained
in a crystalline form. It is slightly soluble in boiling water, to which it im
parts a yellow colour. It is also slightly soluble in boiling alcohol with a
yellow colour. The solution deposits nothing on cooling, but water produces
in it an iridescent appearance, caused by the deposition of minute crystals.
When heated on platinum foil it melts and burns with a bright flame, leaving
no residue. When heated in a tube it melts, and gives fumes which condense
on the colder parts of the tube to an oil which solidifies, but does not cry
stallize. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it with a yellow colour, and
water precipitates it again in yellow flocks. On heating the solution in sul
phuric acid it becomes darker, but no gas is given off; some decomposition
seems however to have taken place in consequence of the heating, for water
now produces no precipitate. Concentrated nitric acid dissolves it on boiling,

and slowly decomposes it with an evolution of nitrous acid. It dissolves in a
solution of perchloride of iron with a dark reddish-brown colour, and is re-
precipitated by acids in yellow flocks. It is not affected by bichromate of
potash and sulphuric acid even on boiling.

  The potash salt is the only salt of this acid which I have as yet been able
to examine. It crystallizes from a hot concentrated solution in water in
needles and prisms of a light brick-red colour. On being heated it is instantly
decomposed, giving rise to a slight detonation. The aqueous solution has a
blood-red colour, but is quite transparent. The addition to it of caustic
potash causes it to assume a beautiful dark purple colour, and a concentrated
boiling solution does not crystallize on cooling after the addition of caustic
potash. The watery solution gives with solutions of the earthy and metallic
salts the following reactions. With chloride of calcium it gives an orange-
coloured, crystalline precipitate; with chloride of barium a yellow precipi
tate ; with sulphate of magnesia a yellow precipitate ; with alum an orange-
coloured precipitate ; with protosulphate of iron a greenish-gray precipitate ;
with perchloride of iron a slight reddish-brown precipitate, which is soluble
in the boiling fluid ; with sugar of lead a red precipitate ; with sulphate of
copper a dull red precipitate ; with nitrate of silver a yellow precipitate, which
is not changed by boiling ; with protonitrate of mercury a yellow precipitate;
with perchloride of mercury a crystalline, yellow precipitate ; with prolo

yellow precipitate ; with chloride of gold a yellow precipitate, not changed

      have analysed rubiacin, rubiacic acid, and rubiacate of potash, and have
obtained results which agree very well with one another. These analyses
give for rubiacin the formula C3, H9 0,0,  for rubiacic
for rubiacate of potash C3, Il7 On + KO.                     acid C3, Hg017, and
                                           It therefore      appears that rubiacic

acid contains seven atoms of oxygen more than rubiacin, and the facility with
which they may be converted one into the other is easily conceivable. In
rubiacate of potash two atoms of water existing in rubiacic acid are replaced
by one atom of potash, which is not usually the case with potash salts.

I do not, however, consider these formulae as completely established, since
I was obliged, from want of material, to operate on such extremely small

quantities.  --  This  substance  is obtained, as I mentioned  above, by treating

properties :  --after  having  removed

In thin layers it is perfectly transparent and of a yellow colour. When
dry it is brittle. It is soluble in water; the solution has an extremely bitter
taste. A concentrated boiling solution forms a jelly on cooling. It is pre
cipitated from its aqueous solution by all acids, in yellow flocks. It is de
composed by nitric acid. In the watery solution lime and baryta water
produce red flocculent precipitates, perchloride of iron a dark reddish-brown
colour, but no precipitate, sugar of lead a brown flocculent precipitate, nitrate
of silver a flocculent precipitate, corrosive sublimate no precipitate, tincture

of galls and solution of glue no precipitates. The solution imparts a slight
tinge to mordanted cloth, but so slight that this substance cannot be con
sidered as a colouring matter. The solution deposits nothing during evapo
ration at all resembling apothem, and it therefore is not extractive matter.

It dissolves in alcohol with a yellow colour, and in alkalies with a red colour.
It dissolves in concentrated sulphuric acid with a red colour ; the solution on

being heated becomes black, and gives off sulphurous acid. When heated
on platinum foil it melts, swells up immensely, and burns, leaving some ash.
When heated in a tube it melts and gives yellow fumes, which condense and

form a crystalline sublimate very much resembling rubiacin, so that I am

induced to think that there is some relation subsisting between these two

substances.

limate no precipitate. On evaporating the watery solution, the substance
separates on the surface of the fluid in the shape of a pellicle, and is left at
last as a brownish extract, which may easily be detached from the sides of
the vessel. In solutions of caustic and carbonated alkalies it first swells up,
and on heating the fluid it dissolves with a light red colour, forming slimy
fluids, from which it is precipitated by acids in flocks. Solutions of salts,

even of alkaline salts, produce precipitates in the alkaline solutions. It is

decomposed by boiling concentrated nitric acid. When heated on platinum

foil it burns without melting, leaving a considerable ash. It seems that the
pectic acid from madder retains in combination with it a portion of colouring
matter, from which it cannot be separated. Hence the red colour with which
it dissolves in alkalies.
Concerning the two fats which I mentioned above as constituents of the
brown precipitate, I have little to

rate them. They are both soluble in alcohol, but one more so than the
other. One of them dissolves with rubiacin in perchloride of iron, the other
not. The former is more easily fusible than the latter, but both melt below
the temperature of boiling water.

  I shall conclude this paper with some practical deductions which I have

made from the experiments detailed in the preceding.
    Few subjects connected with the arts have raised so much discussion as
the nature of the process of madder-dyeing. The investigation of Robiquet
on this subject, instead of clearing it up, seemed only to add to its com
plexity. He considered his alizarin as the substance mainly concerned in
the production of madder colours. This has been denied by others, though
1 think on insufficient grounds. A remarkable discovery in regard to madder-
dyeing, was the fact that lime is very essential in this process. It was found
that madder, if not grown on calcareous soil, is incapable of producing fast
colours, but that if in this case chalk be added to the madder during dyeing,
or if calcareous water be employed, the desired effect is produced. This
again has given rise to endless discussions. It was found by Persoz that the
minutest quantity of lime added to alizarin impaired its colouring power
                                   of lime in madder-dyeing
during dyeing, and the     effect  not enter further into the    appeared to him an
inexplicable mystery.                                          disputes on this sub
                           I will
ject, but shall state at once my own views. It seems to me that former in

vestigators have  erred in  Isuhpapvoesipnrgovethdat  madder contained only one colouring
matter, whereas                                       that there are two, perfectly distinct
                  I think
                            rubiacin, which perform distinct
and definite, alizarin and                                              functions during
                            have found, as I stated above,              that of the two
the process of dyeing. I
colouring matters, alizarin and rubiacin, the former is the only one that is
capable of dyeing when in a free state, and further, that the brown precipi
Iftate produced by acids in a watery extract of madder contains the whole of
these two colouring matters in a free state.          then a piece of mordanted
cloth be dyed with this brown precipitate, after being freed from all excess of
acid, the whole effect is produced by the alizarin contained in the brown
precipitate. If, however, a small quantity of lime, chalk, soda, or any alka

line base, either caustic or carbonated, be added to the brown precipitate

Ibefore dyeing, then its power of dyeing is very much increased. In order to

prove this, took six pieces of mordanted cloth, all of the same size. Nos. 1,
2 and 3, were mordanted in the usual way with acetate of alumina, and
Nos. 4, 5 and 6 with acetate of iron. Nos. 1 and 4 were dyed with a certain
quantity of the brown precipitate; Nos. 2 and 5 with the same quantity of
the brown precipitate, to which, however, there had previously been added
a very small quantity of lime water ; Nos. 3 and 6, lastly, with the same quan
tity of brown precipitate, and a large excess of lime water. The dyeing was
Iperformed each time in the same vessel with the same quantity of water, and

for the same length of time. Now found at the conclusion that No. 2
exhibited a far darker, fuller, and more brilliant shade of red than No. 1,

and No. 5 a much more intense purple colour than No. 4, whereas Nos. 3

and 6 showed hardly any colour at all. Now I can offer only one explanation
                   ON THE GROWTH AND VITALITY OF SEEDS.                                                       145

of these differences. When a small quantity of lime is added to the brown
precipitate, it combines exclusively with the rubiacin, or is transferred during
the process of dyeing exclusively to the rubiacin. The first effect of the
dyeing is the combination of the alizarin with the alumina and peroxide of
iron of the mordants. These compounds then attract and combine with the
lime compound of rubiacin contained in the fluid, by which means a greater
Iintensity of colour is produced. I repeated this experiment with the pure
colouring matters.                        took two pieces of mordanted cloth of the same size,
and dyed the one with pure alizarin, and the other with the same quantity of

alizarin to which rubiacin combined with lime was added, and I found that
the latter was much darker than the former. I therefore conclude that
madder colours are always double compounds of alizarin, rubiacin, alumina,
and an alkaline base, or of alizarin, rubiacin, peroxide of iron, and an alka
line base.

  It follows from this that the maximum of tinctorial power in madder is

produced when the alizarin is in a free state, and the rubiacin is in combi
Ifnation with lime or some alkaline base.                        an excess of lime be added then
the alizarin also combines with and thus rendered incapable of attaching

treated  it      capable of again dyeing almost as much mordanted cloth as
             a is
did before, fact long known practice.                                may state in addition, that the
colours produced by the brown precipitate to which small quantity of lime
has been added, resist the action of soap and acids, &c, to which all madder    a

colours must be subjected in order to heighten them, much better than no
                                                                                                            if

lime had been added.                      I  therefore conclude, that though the possibility in

general of dyeing with madder due to alizarin, the solidity and brilliance
of madder colours must be ascribed to rubiacin.

Dr. Barker's mill consists of an upright pipe or tube, with a funnel-shaped
open top, but closed at the lower end; and from the lower end project two

horizontal pipes or arms, also closed at the outer ends and placed opposite

to each other, at right angles with the vertical tube, so as to form a cross.
Near to the end of each horizontal pipe, and on one side of                                                                                   a round

   The water issuing from the holes on opposite sides of the horizontal arms

causes the machine to revolve rapidly on its axis, with velocity nearly
equal to that of the effluent water, and with force proportionate to thea
hydrostatic pressure given by the vertical column, and to the area of thea

This measure of the height may seem odd, because
                                         the weight of column reaching   the orifice were
shut, the pressure on                                                   from the surface.

But when          open the water issues with nearly the velocity acquired by
                                                                                                                                              that of

the water which issues descends in the vertical trunk, and then moving along
the horizontal arms partakes of the circular motion.

that are nearer to the axis ; every section therefore sustains an actual pres
sure proportional to the square of its distance from the axis.

   This increases the velocity of efflux, and this increases the velocity of

revolution ; and this mutual co-operation would seem to terminate in an
infinite velocity of both motions. But, on the other hand, this circular
motion must be given anew to every particle of water as it enters the hori

zontal arm. This can only be done by the motion already in the arm and
at its expense. Thus there must be a velocity which cannot be overpassed
even by an unloaded machine. But it is also plain that, by making the hori
zontal arms very capacious, the motion of the water to the jet may be made
very slow, and much of this diminution of circular motion prevented.

   Dr. Desaguliers, Euler, John Bernoulli and M. Mathon de la Cour, have
treated of this machine, and the latter author proposes to bring down a large
pipe from an elevated reservoir ; to bend the lower part of it upwards, and
to introduce into it a short pipe with two arms, like Dr. Barker's mill re

versed, and revolving on an upright spindle in the same manner; the joint
of the two pipes being so contrived as to admit of a free circular motion
without much loss of water. By this arrangement a fall or column of any

height, however great, may be rendered available. This arrangement was

proposed in 1775.

   Some few years ago Mr. James Whitelaw of Paisley attempted the im
provement of this machine, and took a patent for his improvements, of
                                                           to consist chiefly of

and of the bending of the two horizontal hollow arms into the form of the
capital letter S ; the water being discharged from the ends of the arms in
the direction of the circle traced by their revolution, or in that of a tangent
to it ; the capacity of the arms increasing a3 they approach the centre of
rotation, so as to contain a quantity of water at every section of the arm
inversely proportionate to its velocity at that section, so that little of the
centrifugal force may be lost. The annexed figures show an elevation,
plan and section of Mr. Whitelaw's machine, and the method he proposes
for forming the arms. The curvature is that of an Archimedean spiral, with
the extremity of the arm or jet-piece continued for a short distance in a cir
cular curve, coincident with the circle described by the end of the arm.
The utility of this continuation however seems to be questionable.
   The sections of the arms are everywhere parallelograms of equal depth,

but of breadth increasing from the jet at the extremity of the arm to the
centre of the machine.
A model water-mill of the form shown in these figures, working with a
fall of ten feet, the diameter of the circle described by the arms being fifteen
inches, and the aperture of each jet 2'4 inches in depth by *6 of an inch in
width, the area of each orifice being 1"44 inches; the expenditure of water

was thirty-eight cubic feet, the velocity 387 revolutions per minute, and it
gave an effect equal to 73*6 per cent, of the power employed.

   Mr. Whitelaw states that the machine is most effective when the jets or
ends of the arms revolve with a velocity equal to that acquired by a heavy

body falling through the height of the vertical column.
The model used in this instance was well-made, and the experiments
carefully conducted, but Mr. Whitelaw states that he has obtained nearly

the machine, tending to lift it from its seat ; it has therefore been proposed
by M. Redtenbacher, Professor of Mechanics at Carlsruhe, to obviate this
inconvenience, when high falls are used, by making the axis horizontal, and

fixing upon it two   machines, introducing the water between      them   by  means
of a pipe formed                                                 acting  in  oppo

   The writer of this paper received the first account of the Turbine about
fifteen years ago, when he was favoured with a visit of some days from Pro
fessor Wedding of Berlin, who described a turbine then recently erected
under his own direction, the dimensions and a sketch of which he also gave.
He could not recollect the quantity of water expended, although he stated
the useful effect to be 92 per cent, of the power employed. Mr. Glynn
could not reconcile this part of the Professor's statement, which appears to
have been made on a few imperfect trials, with his own experience in the
use of water-power, for he had erected many water-wheels made entirely
of iron, the performance of which was highly satisfactory, and was well-ac
quainted with many erected by others, consequently he knew that the high
est effect had not exceeded 80 per cent., and that two-thirds of the power
                                                                    The dimen
expended was as much as    could practically be  reckoned  upon.
                            given by Professor   Wedding   were as   follows :--
sions of the machine then
the fall or rather head of water was twenty feet, the diameter of the wheel

three feet eight inches, the speed 115 revolutions per minute, and the power
equal to forty-two. horses, which drives eight pairs of ordinary mill-stones
with all the requisite dressing machinery.

    We want only two facts to make this statement complete, namely, the
quantity of water expended, and the quantity of corn actually ground in a

given time.

   Professor Wedding afterwards sent Mr. Glynn, from Berlin, a treatise
which he had written in conjunction with M. Carliczeck on this subject,

wherein several other similar machines are described, and the useful effect

of the water is given at from 6S to 80 per cent. ; which further experience
on their part corresponds more nearly with our own practice in the use of

water-power.

   It will be seen that the great value of the Turbine consists in its being
applicable to falls of water so high or so low, that an ordinary water-wheel
cannot be used; and also, that in falls of great height, (the velocity of the
ON THE TURBINE OF FRANCE AND GERMANY.  151

 machine being so rapid) when applied to spinning machinery, it needs no
 mill work, or but very little, to bring it to the requisite speed.

    The invention of the Turbine belongs to M. Fourneyron, and in its pre
 sent form it consists of a horizontal water-wheel, in the centre of which the
 water enters : diverging from the centre in every direction, it enters all the
 buckets at once, and escapes at the circumference or external periphery of
 the wheel. The water acts on the buckets of the revolving wheel with a
 pressure in proportion to the vertical column or height of the fall ; and it is
 led or directed into these buckets by stationary guide curves, placed upon
and secured to a fixed platform within the circle of the revolving part of the

 machine.

    The efflux of the water is regulated by a hollow cylindrical sluice, to
which a number of stops, acting simultaneously between the guide curves,
are fixed.

    With this short cylinder or hoop they are all raised or lowered together,
by means of screws communicating with a regulator or governor, so that
the opening of the sluice and stops may be increased or diminished in pro
portion as the velocity of the wheel may require to be accelerated or re
tarded.

    This cylindrical sluice alone might serve to regulate the efflux of the
water, but the stops serve to steady and support the guide curves, and pre
vent tremor.

    Turbines may be considered as divided into two classes, the low pres
sure and the high pressure. The Plates will better explain the con
struction of these machines and the arrangement of their parts, than a longer
verbal description.

   M. Fourneyron began his experiments in 1823, and in 1827 he erected

his first Turbine at Pont sur l'Ognon in France. The result far exceeded
his expectations, but he had much prejudice to contend with ; and it was not
until 1834 that he constructed another, in Franche-Comte, at the iron-works

of M. Caron, to blow a furnace. It was of seven or eight horses' power,'
and worked at tiroes with a fall of only nine inches. Its performance was
so satisfactory, that the same proprietor had afterwards another of fifty

horses' power erected, to replace two water-wheels, which together were
equal to thirty horses' power.

   The fall of water was four feet three inches, and the useful effect varied
with the head and the immersion of the Turbine from 65 to 80 per cent.

   Several others were now erected ; two for falls of seven feet, one at Inval
near Gisors, for a fall of six feet six inches, the power being nearly forty
horses, on the river Epte, expending thirty-five cubic feet of water per
second ; the useful effect being 7 1 per cent, of the force employed.

   One with a fall of sixty-three feet gave 75 per cent. ; and when it had the
full height of column for which it was constructed, namely, seventy-nine
feet, its useful effect is said to have reached 87 per cent, of the power ex

pended.
    Another with 126 feet fall gave 81 per cent., and one with 144 feet fall

gave 80 per cent.

   At the instance of M. Arago, a commission of inquiry was instituted by
the government of France, and examined the Turbine of Inval near Paris,
the total fall of water being six feet six inches, as has been before men
 tioned. By putting a dam in the river, below the Turbine, so as to raise

 the tail-water and diminish the head to three feet nine inches, the effect was

 still equal to 70 per cent. ; with the head diminished to two feet the effect
152 REPORT -- 1847.

was G4 per cent. ; and when the head was reduced to ten inches it gave 58
per cent, of the power expended, notwithstanding the great immersion of

the machine.

   In the year 1837 M. Fourneyron erected a Turbine at St. Blasier (St.
Blaise), in the Black Forest of Baden, for a fall or column of water of

seventy-two feet (twenty-two metres). The wheel is made of cast-iron with
wrought-iron buckets; it is about twenty inches in diameter, and weighs

about 105 pounds; it is said to be equal to fifty-six horses' power, and to
give a useful effect equal to 70 or 75 per cent, of the water-power em

ployed. It drives a spinning-mill belonging to M. d'Eichtal. A second
Turbine at the same establishment is worked by a column of water of 108

metres or 354 feet high, which is brought into the machine by cast-iron
pipes of eighteen inches diameter of the local measure, or about 16§ inches
English. The diameter of the water-wheel is 14^, or about thirteen inches
English, and it is said to expend a cubic foot of water per second ; proba
bly the expenditure may be somewhat more than this. The width of the
water-wheel across the face is "225, or less than a quarter of an inch. It
makes from 2200 to 2300 revolutions per minute ; and on the end of the
spindle or upright shaft of the Turbine is a bevelled pinion of nineteen teeth
working into two wheels on the right and left, each of which has 300 teeth ;
these give motion to the machinery of the factory, and drive 8000 water

spindles, roving frames, carding engines, cleansers, and other accessories.
The useful effect is reported to be from 80 to 85 per cent, of the theoreti

cal water-power. The water is filtered at the reservoir before it enters the
conduit pipes; and it is important to notice this, since the apertures of dis
charge in the water-wheel are so small as to be easily obstructed or choked.
   The water enters the buckets in the direction of the tangent to the last

element of the guide curves, which is a tangent to the first element of the
curved buckets. The water ought to press steadily against the curved
buckets, entering them without shock or impulse, and quitting them with
out velocity, in order to obtain the greatest useful effect, otherwise a portion
of the water's power must be wasted or expended without producing useful
effect on the wheel. The Plates show a section of this Turbine, and a

quadrant of its water-wheel of the natural or full size.
   It is difficult to imagine that a machine so small as this can give motion
to the works of a cotton mill on so large a scale : Professor Ruhlmann says,

that when he saw it actually doing so, he could not for some time credit the
evidence of his senses ; and although he went on purpose to examine       his
                                                                     it,

astonishment prevented him from comprehending, in the first instance, that

the fact was really as appeared.a
   The general application of the steam-engine as the moving power for
                  it
machinery, has to great extent superseded the use of water-power, and
                                 England. There are many places,

the nature of the ground affords facilities for making reservoirs, so as to
aensure constant supply, where the height of the column of water may
compensate for the smallness of its volume. In such situations the High

Pressure Turbine may be applied with advantage for grinding corn, work
ing threshing machines, or for crushing ore and other purposes.
   There are other situations in which great volume of water rolls with

Reciprocating Water Pressure Engine.

   A very powerful machine of this kind was lately made under the direc
tion of the writer, whilst acting as engineer-in-chief to the Butterley Com
pany, by order of our respected treasurer Mr. John Taylor, and erected by
Mr. Darlington at the Alport mines, near Bakewell, Derbyshire.

   A beautiful model of this engine was made by Mr. Jordan, and is depo
sited in the Museum of CEeonomic Geology ; but no description of it has
yet been published, and it is a subject well-worthy the attention of the
British Association.

spindle, with as little play as possible ; the top of the pivot should be but
very slightly convex. The water and mud must be carefully excluded,
and the parts regularly oiled.

On  the present  state  and recent progress of Ethnographical  Philology.

                        Part I.--Africa.

The author has found it necessary to divide his Report upon the present
state and recent progress of Ethnographical Philology into separate parts ;
a process which the nature of the subject renders easy and convenient.

    By the term Latiguages of Africa are meant the languages of continental
Africa and the Canary Islos. The island of Madagascar is excluded ; it
being a well-known fact that the philological affinities of the dialects there
spoken are with the Malay languages of Malacca, the Moluccas, and Polyne
sia : so that for philological purposes Madagascar is a part of Polynesia.

    Furthermore, it should be remarked that no cognizance will be taken of the
different Moorish dialects, spoken in northern and eastern Africa, and be
lieved to have been introduced since the time of Mahomet; it being considered
that these are only African in the way that the English of the Cape, or the
Portuguese of Angola is African, t. e. that they are languages introduced
within the historical period, and not the indigenous tongues of the country.
Hence all forms of the modern Arabic of Arabia, and, a fortiori, all forms of
the Turkish of Turkey are omitted. On the other hand, the Arabic elements
of the languages of Abyssinia, although they will not be investigated in the
present paper, are proper objects of consideration, inasmuch as they are re
ferable to a period anterior to history, and bear upon the theory of the original
population of the continent.

   In a subject like the present, capable of being thrown into as many natural
divisions as there are quarters of the world ; a subject, moreover, whereof the
several portions have been studied with the most different degrees of attention ;
the term recent progress has by no means a uniform signification. It differs
with the group of languages to which it is applied. A year's research in some

   * A few days before the following pages were put into the hands of the printer, I met with
the new and revised edition of Vater's Litteratur der Grammatiken, Stc, by B. Jiilg (Berlin,
1847). The bibliographical notices, which I was thus enabled to add to those previously enu
merated by myself, are each marked Jiilg. To the majority of these I have not had time or

opportunity to refer ; so that it is possible that they may not all contain either first-hand data,
or vocabularies different from some previously mentioned. The general character of Dr. Jiilg's
work is that it is minute and exhaustive. Of the more important materials for African philo
logy he has omitted only two, Crowther's Yarriba Vocabulary, and Dr. Beke's Abyssinian

Vocabularies.

or six years, go back, for another, to one of ten, fifteen, twenty, or five-

and-twenty.

  Perhaps I might have avoided this apparent inconsistency, and have calcu

lated the recent progress in all departments of ethnographical philology from
one fixed period, by taking a work so accurate, so comprehensive, and so
systematic, as Dr. Prichard's Physical History of Mankind, and by making
it the basis of my reckoning. Had my choice been determined by the
merits of the work, this would certainly have been the case. Nevertheless,
my reason against doing so was conclusive -- Dr. Prichard's classification
is founded upon a mixture of the philological and physiological characters of
our race ; and, although ethnographical, is not philologically ethnographical :

at least, not exclusively so.
   The recent progress of African ethnographical philology is best calculated
from the year 1817. In that year was published the fourth volume of the
Mithridates, completing the work, and containing the views of Vater upon
the facts and classifications of Adelung. The volume by Adelung himself,
in which Africa was contained, was given to the world five years previously,
i. e. in 1812.

   When we consider the great amount of geographical knowledge which has
accumulated within the last thirty years, we take a measure of the philological
discoveries as well : since the progress of the two studies, naturally, coincide.
When Adelung and Vater wrote the great inland countries of Bornu and
Howssa were unexplored ; the Ashantee country was known only by name ;
Bruce was almost the only authority for Abyssinia ; Burckhardt's work on
Nubia was unpublished ; whilst the languages of Zanzibar and Mozambique
were known only through a few fragmentary vocabularies. On the other
hand, most of the leading facts, such as the great geographical extent of the
Berber and Caffre languages, the peculiarities of the Caifre grammar, and the
Arabic affinities of the languages of /Ethiopia make part and parcel of the
information contained in the Mithridates. The chief work published between
1812 and 1817 was the Abyssinia of Salt. In most other points Vater's

materials were the same as Adelung's.
   In respect to the principle of his classification, Adelung's views were both
sound and safe. He never aimed at any thing prematurely general. Lan
guages whereof the mutual affinities lay on the surface were placed in the

same groups. Nothing, however, equivalent to the higher divisions denoted
by such names as Indo-European, Semitic, &c. was attempted. This absti
nence from generalization was nothing more than what the scanty character
of our knowledge imperatively demanded.

languages and dialects tabulated in the first are a hundred and twelve in
number. In each, are given (when possible) the numerals and a few other
of what appeared to the author the most fundamental words eligible. The
evidence for the classification appears to be contained within the tables them

selves. Balbi's system is a safe one. Where the affinities lie below the
156 he pout -- 1847.

surface, the language is left unplaced ; where it is evident, the result is the
formation of a correct group. By this means, although allied languages are
separated, distinct ones are not connected. The only important exception to
this is in the class called Famille Shiho-Dankali. From this the Galla and

Somauli are excluded, whilst the Shilluck, Dizzela, Dalla, and Agow languages
are included.

   Balbi's nomenclature is faulty in one respect ; the application of the term
Famille Troglodyte to the Bisharye dialects. This assumes an affiliation from
the Troglodyte of antiquity which ought to have been proved.
   The absence of any reference to his authorities is a serious inconvenience
since in collating his vocabularies with those of other collectors it is difficult
to determine whether they are additions to those previously known, or ex
tracts from them. In some cases the orthography is a guide. In one case,
however, and probably in more, it misleads. The Bisharye, Noub and Kensy
vocabularies are marked German ; which they are not. They were collected
by Burckhardt ; whose name, being German, misled.
   Balbi knew the works of Lyon, Burckhardt, Den ham and Clapperton, pub

lished between 1817 and 1826.
The third systematic work, which, embracing much beside, embraces also
the languages of Africa, is Prichard's. The date of the first edition is 1826,
of the second 1841. His ethnological maps are the proper complement to Dr.
Prichard's writings. These make him the most geographical of the three in
vestigators ; a matter of no small value and importance.
In this department, however, of the subject two difficulties press upon the
pAhfriilcoalo. gistT. hesTeheayre,o--cc1usrt,            less in all             ; but most in those of
                                               more or   of similar   languages
                                                the use               names for  different nations ; and,

2nd, the absence of any geographical notice respecting the districts wherein
a particular language is spoken.
   As instances of the first complication we find names as similar as Somauli,
Tumali, Sowaiel and Sofala applied to different tribes and different localities.
This for the eastern coast of Africa.
   We find a Hamara language in Abyssinia, distinguished from the Amharic;
so that the particular Abyssinian tribe to which the xa/jiapa Xifa of Aga-

tharcides applies is uncertain.

   We find Shankalas in the neighbourhood of the Dankali, and both near the
country of Dongola. Yet all three are distinct.
   We find a Sliilha tribe of Berbers in Morocco, and Shilluck negroes in Sen-

naar ; each unconnected with the other.
   We find Woloffs, Fulahs and Feloops ; similar in name, unconnected in

most other points. And then we find a Fellah population in Egypt.
   These instances might easily be increased. As it is not likely that tribes

in the neighbourhood of each other should call themselves by similar names
to anything like the extent here indicated, the solution lies in the supposition
that the term by which they are known is a foreign one. Something of the

kind, as stated above, occurs in all languages. It occurs, however, to a very
extraordinary extent in Africa. The remedy to the uncertainty which it en
genders is the habit of always stating whether the name by which a tribe is
descended is native or foreign. In Asiatic philology this practice is well ad
hered to in Klaproth's Asia Polyglotta.

  The second complication is easily accounted for. A resident at Cairo,

Algiers or Louisiana, collects specimens of the languages of Africa ; and he
collects them from such Africans as he finds in the neighbourhood of his resi

dence. Now, however well these Africans may supply him with specimens
of their language, they give him no information in the way of geography.

Hence all that is got is the language, and the name of it. The locality must
be obtained by other means. Something of this sort, also, occurs in other
languages ; but in none to the extent that it prevails in the African. Whilst

Africa is little visited, African slaves are spread far and wide. Seetzen's
vocabularies were collected at Cairo, Oldendorp's in the West Indies, and
Mrs. Kilham's at Sierra Leone.
Reverting, however, to the consideration of the principles of classification
which were applied to the African languages in 1812 and 1817, and to those
that have since been adopted, we find that the only important systematic work
which has appeared since the Mithridates and the Atlas is that of Dr. Pri-
                                         as far as concerns the extent of its divi

                                                                                                               a
chard. Herein the classification
sions, in kind the same as Adelung's and fialbi's

taken lest the generalization outstrip the date, and no groups are attempted
equivalent to those recognised in the philology both of Europe and of Asia.
Furthermore, Dr. Prichard's classification            an arrangement of men not of

languages; so that his divisions and subdivisions arc formed, as stated before,
on mixed characters. Nevertheless, his work contains much wider classifi

cation than those above-mentioned new affinities, determined upon even the
principles of the Mithridates and Atlas, having since been discovered
several cases by the author himself. The most important of these are the                                                       ;

In determining upon this classification the writer did his best to define the
158 REPORT -- 1847-

principles upon which his arrangement proceeded. He believed then, as he
believes now, that, making certain allowances for the extension of the induc
tion, either consciously or unconsciously on the part of the author, the prin
ciples upon which the majority of the languages of Europe, as well as those
of a large portion of Asia, are arranged and classified, have been the principles
for the classification of all other languages. The distinct conception which
a philologist entertains of the points of likeness and the points of difference
between those members of that great division of languages which he is in the
habit of calling Indo-European, regulates his views as to the value of the

affinities or discrepancies between other languages ; so that, where he attempts
to classify at all, he asks the following questions : -- Are the languages with

which I am dealing as like as the most unlike languages compared under

the term Indo~ European ? Is the difference between them less or greater than
that between the Portuguese and Icelandic, the Persian and German, the
Greek and Gaelic ? Questions like these give him the rule by which he mea
sures differences, and determines the value of divisions ; and the rule, although
a rough one, is the best which we possess in the present state of our philology.

    As no group higher than the one termed Indo-European exists under any
definite recognized denomination, languages which are not comprised within
the pale of such divisions are in no ascertained degree of relationship to each

other at all.
    Again, just as we regulate our views of the higher classifications by the known

affinities between the different languages of the Indo-European family, so do
we, in respect to the minor groups and subordinate subdivisions, determine
our notions from those classes which we know by the names of Gothic, Celtic,
 Slavonic, &c. ; so that in asking whether two languages belong to the same
division of a given group, we ask whether they are as like each other as (say)
the modern Greek and Portuguese, the Swiss and Icelandic ; in other words,
whether they are as like each other as the two most distant dialects of the
 classical and the gothic stock of languages respectively. This, again, al
 though a convenient rule, is rough and empirical.

     Finally, in respect to the extent to which particular languages stand alone
and beyond the pale of recognized relationship with other tongues, the posi
 tion of the Basque language of Biscay forces itself upon our notice as a mea

 sure of what may be called philological isolation ; or, if not as a measure, at

 least as an illustration.
     Does Africa afford the same philological phaanomenon that is afforded by

 Europe, in the existence of languages belonging to groups so different as the
 Indo-European and Finnic?

    Does Africa afford the same phsenomenon that is afforded by Europe in
 the existence of an absolutely isolated language like the Basque?

     The extent to which the investigations of learned men have answered these
 questions is the chief subject of the forthcoming pages; such questions, and
 the like of them, being the staple subjects of ethnographical philology ; and
 it being to the solution of such that the evidence of languages was first in
 voked.

     In another question of ethnography philology is a more indirect instrument
 The alphabets and literatures of countries are ethnographical facts ; and phi
 lology is requisite for attaining them. In African ethnology, however, it is
 only when we get to the archaeology of Egypt that this application of learn
 ing requires notice, and then but partially.

     Our best geographical starting-place is the locality where there are the
 fewest complications. For this reason Egypt, Barbary and Abyssinia come
 last in the present arrangement. These are the points where Africa comes in

contact with Asia. At such points, over and above the question as to the re
lationship of the African languages with each other, there is the additional
one of their Asiatic affinities. Hence it is most convenient to begin with a
language undoubtedly negro, and spoken in the district where the Arabic of
the northern coast leaves off. This is the coast of the Atlantic and the north
ern bank of the Senegal.

   I. The Woloff Language. -- From the Atlantic Ocean to Podor, along the
southern bank of the Senegambia, from west to east, and from the mouth of

the Senegal to Cape Verde, the language is the Jaloff, Woloff, Guiloff or Ouo-
loff language. In the neighbourhood of Cape Verde it is interrupted by a

language called the Sereres, but only interrupted. It is continued southward

until it becomes conterminous with the Mandingo languages of the Gambia.
The country of Salum, on this last river, is especially stated to belong to the
Woloff kingdom. So also are the states of Walo, Baol, Syn, and Kayor; this

Ilast country being north of the Senegal. South of the Gambia have not

met with evidence to the existence of any Woloff dialect. The inland ex
tension of the Woloff is somewhat indeterminate. The country marked in the
maps as Foota-torro is not Woloff, but Fulah ; neither is the country of Galam
or Kajaaga wholly Woloff ; the Serawoolli being spoken in those parts.
Ethnographically, the limits of the Woloff language are satisfactorily ascer
tained. On the north it is conterminous with the Moorish, Arabic and the
Tuarick dialects of the Berber of the Sahara; on the south and south-east
with various Mandingo dialects ; on the north-east with the Fulah of Foota-
torro and the Serawoolli of Galam or Kajaaga. It probably surrounds and
isolates the Sereres of Cape Verde.

For this see the remarks on that language.
   2. Its relations to other languages. The affinities of the Woloff by no
means lie on the surface ; and it has consequently been dealt with as one of
the most isolated tongues of Africa.

the Howssa, the Fulah, the Fantee, the Yarriba, and the Ibo vocabularies in

  A third table of comparison is formed by Mrs. Kilham's vocabularies ; and

here the Woloff has not only no particular affinities, but fewer miscellaneous

ones than any other language.
   The last remark to be made upon the Woloff language is the fact, that its
grammatical structure exhibits the euphonic or alliteral concord. The mean
ing of this statement, and its philological import, will be explained in the

section on  the Caffre  language.            the greater  part of the course  of

   II. The              Languages. -- Along
the Gambia one language is spoken, and that with but few variations. It is not
certain that this language is always the aboriginal language of the country ;
but still it is the chief and leading language. The Mandingo is the tongue
in question. Between the Gambia and the Senegal, the Mandingo is certainly,
at some point or other, conterminous with the Woloff, and probably with the
Sereres as well. South of the Gambia, and on the sea-coast, the Feloop is
spoken ; probably as far as the River Cacheo. Behind the Feloop country,

however, we find the Mandingoes again ; and, thirdly, we find them far south
ward, at the back of the Grain Coast.
Now the most convenient point from which the distribution of this wide

spread family can be studied, is that tract between the Gambia and the
Senegal which lies   inland to the Woloff and
the eastern portion  of Senegambia. Here --    Sereres    areas ;  in  other  words,

1. The Bambook language is Mandingo; mixed, however, according to
Golbery, with the Woloff and Fulah.
   2. The Medina language is Mandingo, and Mandingo of the standard kind,
or Mandingo of the Lower Gambia.

   3. The Bambarra language is Mandingo. At Sego, the Bambarra dialect
of the Mandingo was spoken and understood by Park ; whilst a little higher
up the Joliba, at Jenne, a different language, that of Timbuctoo, was the

only one intelligible.
   4. The language of Jallonkadoo is Mandingo ; but the language of Timbo,

south of Jallonkadoo, is not Mandingo. It is the Fulah of Foota-torro.
   5. The Sokko or Asokko language is Mandingo. The Sokko language
is said to be spoken on the boundaries of the Ashantee country.

   This extent of the Mandingo area was recognized by the authors of the
Mithridates, their data being most imperfect ; Park's vocabularies forming the
main portion of them.
The extension of the Mandingo dialects to the south of the Gambia is
difficult to determine.          As a general rule it
towards the ocean ; the                                                         seems to  be     inland, rather than
                                 coast being occupied                                     and

    He also coincides with the opinion, that the Bullom and Timmani are
allied to each other.

   He further believes that they are also allied to the Susu, and, consequently,
that the Susu, Bullom and Timmani are, all three, Mandingo languages.

    The statement as to the affinity between these tongues and the Susu was
made in Ehrmann's Geschichte der Reisen, vii. 94, and gratuitously contra
dicted in the Mithridates, iv. 437.

   Again, among the Niger vocabularies we find the numerals of two lan
guages called Mendi and Vei. Now if the Vei be the language of a tract on
the sea-coast, marked in Arrowsmith's London Atlas as lying between the
River Gallinas and Cape Mount, it brings the Mandingo dialects down to the

northern boundary of the settlement of Liberia. Of the Mendi I only know

that its numerals resemble the Vei.

   This is probably the southern limit of the Mandingo languages on the coast ·
languages akin to the Kru and Bassa being spoken to the south of Cape
Mesurado.

   As to the inland extension of the southern division of theMandingo dialects,
we have nothing but fragmentary evidence. The Limba and Kooranka coun
tries, to the west of the Timmanies, are stated to be Mandingo. A district
called Kissi lies south of Sulimana, and west of the Koorankos. Of this
language we have two specimens -- the numerals, as far as ten, and a voca
bulary of Mrs. Kilham's. By reference to the Niger vocabularies it may be
seen that the Kissi is allied to the Bullom.

   Besides the Kissi, the Kossa and Pessa are the names of two of Mrs. Kil

ham's glossaries. They are akin to each other, and akin to the other Man
dingo dialects.

   Lastly, the Garangi, Kong, Callana, Fobee and Garman numerals, collected
by Mr. Bowdich during his residence in Ashantee, and representing lan
guages spoken in the interior (probably at the back of the Pepper Coast, and
to the westward of the Kong Mountains), are Mandingo. The Garman of
Bowdich is the Buntakeo of the Atlas Ethnographique.

   IN. The Feloop
languages, vid. supr. All that was known of either to Adelung was the Feloop
numerals by Park. At present the Senegal vocabularies supply us with a
long vocabulary of each.
The least that can be said of these two languages is that they are much more

alike to each other than to any other pair in the tables ; and this likeness
seems extended to the inflectional portions of their words. Lest this should

seem an insufficient reason for placing them in the same group rather than
for treating them as languages of separate classes, it should be remembered
that in the parts in question not less than five* other languages, unknown to
us by specimens, are spoken ; and that the evidence of these may hereafter

make good the inconclusive part of the present arrangement. It however,

from other quarters that this is a Kru dialect.
    The Bassa and Kru are closely-allied dialects. The Pessa language, over
and above the similitude of the name, has many words in common with the
Bassa. Indeed the line of demarcation here drawn between the Mandingo
and Kru dialects is by no means definite ; it is merely provisional. That the
Kru languages      are akin to those south of them is undoubted.

the names of one and the same language. Nevertheless the Tambi and Tembu

    Now the Tembu vocabulary has some very definite coincidences with one
of Mrs. Kilham's vocabularies, hitherto unplaced, called the Kouri. Probably
the two glossaries represent the same language.

Mithridates under the titles of Yudah, Watye, Atye, Adah, and Wawu repre-
sentall that was known in 1812 of the languages of Dahomey. Our present

data are proportionably scanty.
1. The Popo vocabulary of Mrs. Kilham represents a Dahomey dialect.
2. The Fot vocabulary of Mrs. Kilham represents a Dahomey dialect.
   3. The Kerrapay numerals of Bowdich approach the Popo numerals of
Mrs. Kilham. The Crepee of the Mithridates is the Kerrapay.

                    ON ETHNOGRAPHICAL PHILOLOGY.                           175

A few pages back, in speaking of the country between Cape Palmas and
the River Assinese, and again in               thweeWhaardree"             it was stated
that, in the way of philological  respect to                    country,    unless some
                                   materials,                   nothing ;

vocabulary of which the geographical position is at present unknown belong
to this locality."
    This sentence is a practical commentary upon the fact that a great pro
portion of the African glossaries come to our hands without any notice of
the locality which supplies them. This puts the philologist upon the duty
of determining the position of a language from either his own previous know
ledge or from internal evidence. Neither process is without complications.
Numerous as are the dialects already indicated, the list is not exhausted.
Only those have been mentioned which could be accompanied with the ad
ditional notice of either their geographical or their ethnological relations ;
and that with some precision. There still stand over several other dialects,
represented by different names. This makes it necessary to go again over

the ground from Cape Mesurado to Cape Gonsalvo Lopez, and to notify those
vocabularies, which, whether found in the Mithridates, or published since,
are necessary for completing the materials for the philology of the great Ibo-
Ashantee division.

   That they all belong to this class is nearly certain. They have all miscel
laneous affinities with the other languages belonging to it; and difficult as they
may be to place under particular subdivisions, none present the phenomenon
of isolation.

   The Fetu of the Mithridates, collected by Miiller, seems rather more closely
allied to the Fantee of Bowdich, than to his Affootoo ; although from the
similarity of the names the contrary might have been expected.

             abiessan

   The difference, however, between all three is merely a matter of dialect.
   The prefix of the syllable a- in the Fetu and Fantee assimilates the nume
rals of these dialects to the Akkim and Kanga ; whilst the Kanga glosses are
rather Kru than Fantee. Complications of this sort are the rule rather than
the exception in African philology.
   The Amina of the Mithridates, closely allied to the Akkim and Akripon,
is nearly, but not quite, the Amanahea of Bowdich.

The Asianten of the Mithridates is the Ashantee of Bowdich. It is not,
however, either the Kassenti, or the Issinese of the Mithridates ; as might

possibly be expected from the similarity of names.                 of Bowdich,

has been taken from the two principal languages contained in the Ibo and
                           ;
the Ashantee. The Ibo-Ashantee group may best be studied by taking the
Inta, the Acra, the Akvambu (?), the Dahomey, the Ibo, the Nufi, theI
Yarriba, and the Gaboon languages as the representatives of its leading
                                                                       a

   Of all the languages of Africa this group presents the most complications.
The short and fragmentary character of its vocabularies, the fact of their
being frequently collected from West Indian slaves, and the absence of any
geographical notification of their localities, are more prominent here than in
any other department of African philology. The special knowledge of the

professed geographer has yet to be superadded to the more general researches

of the ethnologist, before the materials already collected can take their proper
degree of order and classification. The Niger vocabularies are, in the Ibo-
Ashantee class, of indispensable value.
The order in which the languages are taken will now no longer follow the
coast of the Atlantic. The affinities of the Ibo-Ashantee languages, as well
as of all the others already enumerated, are with the inland rather than with
the southern parts of Africa although the latter range of affinities exists.
The languages of Soudania may best be studied by taking the great inland

   IX. The Howssa Languages.--The Howssa language, one of the most

widely-spread in Africa, is conterminous with the Bornu on the east, and
with the Yarriba and Nufi (?) on the south. Its extension north and west is
undetermined. In the neighbourhood of Sackatoo it is in contact with the

The Sungai of Hodgson and the Kissour of Caillie coincide.
In the comparison between Lyon's Timbuctoo and Caillie's Kissour was
188 REPORT -- 1847-

inserted a column of Howssa words. This was done because in some

cases Lyon's Tinibuctoo coincided with the Howssa where it differed with
the Kissour. In the paper submitted to the British Association in 1844, the
Kissour and Howssa languages were placed in the same class ; and in the
twelfth number of the Classical Museum, some special affinities between the
Kissour and Howssa were indicated. In the present arrangement, however,

the two groups are separated.
    XI. The Fulah Group of Languages.-- It is necessary to enumerate the
chief localities of the Fulah nation before any notice is taken of the lan
guage. The great extent of the Fulah area, the irregular distribution of
the Fulah tribes, and the apparent isolation of the Fulah language, have drawn

ward to the Woloff country, and extending from Podor to the confines of the
Serawoolli language (Galam), is a country called Foota-torro. The natives
of this country are called Foulahs or Peuls. Their complexion is lighter than
that of either the Woloffs or Serawoollies, from which reason they are some
times named the Red Peules. South and east of Foota-torro, the country of
Bondou, between the Senegal and Gambia, is said to be Fulah. Here the

southward without interruption is uncertain.                                It is certain, however, that at
the sources of the River Grande, and to the north of Sulimana, we meet with
a great Fulah kingdom, of which Timbo is the capital. This is the Fulah
of                or the Fulah of Tembu.

banks of the Joliba, between the two Sungai towns of Jenne and Timbuctoo,
Park met with the Fulahs of Massina. Of the Fulah of Massina we find a
short vocabulary in Mr. Hodgson's Notes on Northern Africa, p. 75. A
second vocabulary of Mr. Hodgson's, given in his Appendix, slightly differs
from this.

dependent labourers.

   Such are the remarkable phenomena of the distribution of the Fulah race,
a distribution which is partially accounted for by their history and traditions ;
inasmuch as, like the Turks of Asia, they have been a conquering people,
and their extension over certain areas is said to have taken place within the

historical period. Ethnographically, it coincides very nearly with the courses
of the Senegal, and of the Upper and Lower Niger. The similarity between

The Fulah is one of those languages which have been separated from the
rest by a, real or supposed, broad line of demarcation.
   The last remark to he made upon the Fulah language is the fact that its
grammatical structure exhibits the euphonic or alliterational concord.

   Here end those languages of Central Africa which it is considered con
venient to place in the arrangement next to those of the Ibo-Ashantee group.
The letters A and B in the Niger vocabularies supply the following resem
blances between the Mandingo, Howssa, and Fulah groups,
each other, and with three Ibo-Ashantee languages :--                                                                as compared   with

   It was known to Adelung that the languages                 of-- 1. Loango,                                                               2. Congo,
and 3. Angola, were closely allied to each other ; i. e. (to use his own illus
trations) in the same way as the English and Danish, the Castilian and Portu
guese, or even the Calabrian and Venetian dialects of the Italian. Hence all
the dialects of the countries in question were classed under the common title
of the Congo languages.
It was also known that the grammatical affinity between these languages
coincided with the glossarial ; in other words, the structure of the Loango,
Congo, and Angola languages was known, and it was known to be the same

d F Atlas Ethnographique. The Molua of Balbi is probably the Mogialoua
of Oouville. Of languages called the Mina and Cassange mention is made,

but no vocabularies are given.
   The distribution of these dialects over the countries of Loango, Congo,
Angola and Benguela, is not accurately determined. For Benguela in parti
cular we require accurate information.
   The country of the so-called Jagas is a geographical blank extending from
the southern limits of Benguela to Waalvisch Bay. The coasts of this last-

named locality are inhabited by the Dammaras. Notwithstanding statements
to the contrary, and notwithstanding the fact of the Dammara having been
frequently placed in the Hottentot class of languages, it is the special state
ment of Mr. Archbell, who has twice visited them, that they speak a dialect
of the Sechuana..
    The Languages     of  Caffraria.  -- The   Cosoa  is the language  of the Amacosa,

Amatembu, Amapondo and Amazulu tribes, and is spoken from the Great
Fish-river to Delagoa Bay. The Sechuana is the language of the Bechuanas,
or Vatwe, in the interior, and, as stated above, of the Dammaras on the coast
of the Atlantic. Now it was not only known to Adelung that the languages --
1 . of the Amakoosa Caffres, U. of the Bechuanas, 3. and of the natives around

Delagoa Bay were allied to each, but it was also surmised that languages
more or less akin to the Caffre were spoken as far northward as Quiloa. The
192 REPORT-- 1847.

peculiar character of the Caffre grammar was also understood ; it having
been exhibited by Lichtenstein. The glossaries of the Mithridates are those
of Lichtenstein, White, Sparrman and Barrow.

   Salt's specimens for the Mozambique coast, of the Sowaiel, Makua, Mon-

jou and Dos Santos languages, were published between 1812 and 1817, so
that Vater saw more distinctly than Adelung the likelihood of the languages
of the Mozambique and Zanzibar coasts being Caffre.
   The Sohili of the Zanzibar coast was compared by Vater with the Makua
and Monjou. Its glossarial affinity with the Caffre languages was shown by
Dr. Prichard.

The glossarial proof of the relationship between the Congo and Caffre lan

guages was Marsden's. The grammatical affinities between the two groups
were first indicated by Dr. Prichard.
   At present, we have a considerable amount of materials for the study of

the Caffre of the Cape, and a fair amount for the Caffre of Mozambique and
Zanzibar. '

far the most unlike of any. The others are closely allied to each other and

non-radical. Adventitious, however, as they are, they occur before almost all
the Caffre substantives, and are, practically speaking, inseparable. Without
them, the noun would appear like a Greek crude root, i. e. such a form as
Xoy- opviB-, a root minus its concomitant inflection. Yet the Caffre prefixes

are not inflections. They are elements of composition. So necessary, how
ever, is the incorporation of this adventitious element, that new words like

Certain prefixes have a singular, others a plural power.

tions between two words in Caffre are expressed in the following remarkable
manner. The word governed clianges its initial letter into either the initial
letter of the word thai governs, or one allied to it. Thus if the English syntax
was the same as the Caffre, we should say instead of

             sun's beam                       bun beam.

             father's daughter                father /aughtcr.

             people's leader                  people Reader.

and so on. In this case, the initial of one word would determine the initial of

another.

   Such is the rule of the Caffre euphonic concord ; with this addition, viz.
that the prefix is part of the word ; so that it is the prefix rather than the
word itself which influences the alliteration.

   1 . The prefixes u and um determine that   the words     in a    certain syntactic
relation to them, shall change their natural  initial into          umUi u%lizwe=a
                                                            w, --

man of the country.
   2. The prefixes i and Hi determine that    the word in a certain
                                                                                   syntactic
relation to them, shall change their natural  initial into /,--ihashe              fenkosi=

horse of the captain.
   3. The prefixes in    and im  determine that words in        --a tcnekrtoasini    syntactic
relation to them, shall  change  their natural initials intoy,                     yabantu=

captain of the people.
   So on throughout. The letter which the prefix of the governing word re
quires to be the initial of the word in construction with   it
nic letter ; so that w is the euphonic letter of « and um,      is  called          its  eupho
                                                            I                      Hi,
                                                                of  i and                y of in

and im, &c.
Now if languages were, like crystals, determined by their external form,
and without any respect to descent or affiliation, the phenomena of the
system of prefixes, and of the euphonic concord, would be characters of great
value in separating any language in which they occurred from any in which

they did not. At present it is sufficient to say that they do not occur in the

Caffre languages only.

   A third point in the Caffre language is suggested by certain forms occur
ring in Ewald's table.     In the Suaheli,  the Wanika, and the Wakamba, the
plural form=»ien is
                         simpler than the   singular ibrm=wjan. --Singular mtu,
mutu, mundu ; plural watu, atu andu. Now, not only is it d priori likely
that, in certain instances, the expression for individualizing particular objects
may be subsequent to the expression for a collection dealt with as unity, but,
in two languages, the Welsh and Arabic, the actual phenomenon of a singular
formed from a plural has been recognised ; just as, in English, the word
wizard derived from witch is a particular instance of a masculine form being
derived from a feminine one.

  XIII. The Hottentot Language. -- The course of the Orange River illus
trates the area over which the Hottentot languages are spoken. On the
south they are conterminous with the Dutch and English of the Cape, by
which their more extreme dialects have been displaced. On the east and
north-east they are bounded by Bechuana and Caffre dialects of the Caffre.
The Namacqua, which is a Hottentot language, is spoken on the shore of the

8. The Jebel Nuba of Holroyd. --Journal of Geographical Society.

The Kenuz, Noub, and Dongolah form the Nubian Proper, or the Nubian
of Nubia. On the west they are conterminous with the Ababdie, Bisharye,

and Beja languages.
   For the northern part of the country between the junction of the Tacazze,

and the confluence of the Bahr el Azrek with the Bahr el Abiad, Bisharye
dialects are spoken. The southern portion is the frontier of Abyssinia. The
Bahr el Abiad leads towards the Shilluck country, and to the parts between
Kordofan and Sennaar.

   1. Of the Shilluck we have (1) a short vocabulary by Seetzen, in the
Mithridates, and (2) a longer one by lliippell.

   The root Shilha seems to be the second element in the name of the Mobba

country (Dar-saley), and possibly in that of the old African tribe Ma-ssyl.
   2. The Denka is a language conterminous, on the north, with the Shilluck,
and allied to it.

   a. Iliippell's Denka vocabulary.

   b. Unpublished materials for the Denka language are in the possession of

him to consider the Takeli and Tumali as allied dialects.

   What follows, on the Tumali languages, are in the words of Dr. L. Tut
sch"ekThheimvseerlbf. seems in the Tumali language, as almost in all languages, to be
the root of many of the other parts of speech ; the ramifications of a verbal
root into the department of nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are, indeed, some

Itimes quite astonishing.   do not yet know whether there exist different con
jugations, and if so, which are their characteristics ; but of this I am sure, that
the number of forms derived from one verbal "root is very great in some cases.
As a specimen for the conjugation of a good many verbs the following may
serve as examples :--<

                                   Negation.

The negation is expressed by prefixing to the root of the verb the letter k,
and at the same time by affixing the auxiliar verb en, to be, throughout all
tenses, numbers and persons ; for instance : --

There is no declension of substantives in cases ; but the cases are expressed
by prepositions or postpositions, or by possessive pronouns.

mark of inclination to the first letter of the substantive.
Adg utru, pi. hadg hutrun ; dgigat, girl, forms its plur. ngingat ; but I do
not believe that this is the only plural form in use.
The plural is often expressed by doubling the substantives. In a speci

   The short Suaken vocabulary of the Bisharye is shown in the Mithridates
to have affinities with the Argubba, a Tigre dialect of Abyssinia, as well as
to contain some Darfoor words.

      The more probable affinities are with the Coptic, as stated by Lepsius, and,
as shown in details, by Bird. -- Journal                                             Branch of the

      Three groups of African languages yet stand over for consideration ; viz.
the groups containing the languages of those parts of Africa where its con
tact with Asia introduces the question of their affinities with the languages
of the world at large. Now, this last question is deferred as part and parcel
of the ethnographical philology of Asia. As to the languages themselves,
they are the Coptic of Egypt, the Berber of Northern Africa, and the dif
ferent languages of Abyssinia. This last division is convenient rather than
scientific. The Abyssinian languages do not form an ethnological class ;
since some of them are, probably, more akin to the languages of Africa in
general, than to those of Abyssinia. Nevertheless, they do form a geogra
phical class, and as suck it is convenient to treat them.
      The first division is Abyssinian in the strictest sense of the term. The
languages that compose it are the languages of both the old and new capi
tals, they are the languages of the greatest part of the country, and they

   The Somauli of Vater is left unplaced. He tabulates it along with the
Hurrur ; but probably for the sake of contrast rather than of comparison.
So also it stand.? in Salt, whose arrangement and nomenclature are apt to
mislead ; the Dalla and Dizzela both being termed Shangalla, and the Shiho
and Arkiko being placed in parallel columns. A very few words, common
to the Somauli and Galla, are noted. The proper position was given to the
Somauli by Dr. Prichard.

  IIn the Galla, the word goeta=good, in the Somauli lug=leg. Two other

cases of really accidental likenesses, thus strong, have not met in any other

Iflanguage.                                              we allow ourselves to believe that

   The Danakil call themselves Afer.
the classical nations took some of their geographical names from Egypt, we
have a probable origin of the term Africa.
Similarly, the word firipfiapoi may be best explained by considering it to

have been adopted into Greece from Egypt ; being taken by the Egyptians
from their neighbours of Nubia, the Barabbra. In this case the statement of
Herodotus, that the Egyptians called other nations fiaipfiapoi, would mean,
not that they used a term equivalent to that of the Greeks with the same
sense, but that they used the particular term Barbar. Of these two hypo
theses each reflects probability on the other. That Nubian and Abyssinian
glosses found their         way in tiie Latin  faonudrthGrieEenke,idis--amgaaignalisah--owNnumbidy iatnhe
illustration afforded       to a word in the
cottages. The Berber of Barbary supplies no gloss explanatory of this term.
In the Danakil, however, magala--lown ; and the word was just as likely
to be taken from the Danakil by the way of Egypt, as from the Berber of

publish any specimen of this class of languages, and who, with the exception
of a single vocabulary, has collected all that is known of the Gonga tongues,
gives the following account of their geographical position: -- "Ludolf de

the south of the river Abai, and speaking a language unconnected with all
those common throughout Abyssinia, to the north of about the 10th parallel

of north latitude ; but the same as that spoken by the people of Enarea.
This statement, however correct as regards former times, requires to be

modified in the present day ; for by the irruption of the Gallas, and their
occupation of the table-land between the rivers Abai and Godjeb, the Gonga
race has been cut through ; and where not extirpated, divided into two
parts, which have been respectively driven into the valleys of these two rivers.
In              throughout the whole table-land northward, as                   far as the valley

But further to the south and south-west, in regions stretching wide into the
Iinterior of Africa, languages cognate with Gonga are still spoken.

told of the countries of Derbabbo, Mocha and Afillo, beyond Kaffa, to the
west, where cognate languages prevail. The Gonga language, as spoken in
the western portion of the valley of the Abai, is the only existing repre
sentative of a once-powerful kingdom, situate in the fork between the two
branches of the Blue River; the one the Dedhesa, coming from Enarea, and
the other the Abai. The affinity of the languages of Kaffa, Woratta and
Wolaitsa, to that of Gonga is manifest.                       --ThPahtil.ofTrtahnesalacntigounas,ge   of

   Here ends the list of Abyssinian languages. Is it exhaustive ? A letter
from Mr. D'Abbadie to Mr. Renouard, in the 911th number of the Athe

naeum, promises the following fresh vocabularies for the following languages,
spoken either in or around Abyssinia.

   A. For the Agow languages --
   1. A Khamtinga vocabulary of 1500 words. This is spoken by the Khamta,

or Agows of the Way or Wag, a country adjoining to, but different from,
Lasta.

2. An Awnga vocabulary of 2000 words, spoken by the Awawa or Agows,
on the borders of Little Damot ; a harsh but copious dialect.
3. A Hwarasa vocabulary of 1300 words, spoken in Hwara or Kwara,
and by the Falocha of                                          the Awawa country; closely-
allied to the Gimant.  "GaSlhlaogrtarv, ocKaabyullaa,rieasnd  (writes Monsieur d'Abbadie)

show that the Agaw languages are closely allied to the Gabi, spoken by the
Bileu ; and to the languages of Atala in Somen."
B. For the Galla--
   1. Afar Proper, or the Danakil of Adaiel, Taltal, Talfen, &c. : 900 words.
   % The Saho of the Hazaorta and Toroua tribes, i. e. the languages of the
Samara, of which the Shiho of Salt is probably the most northern dialect:

1400 words.

3. Galla, Ilmormo, or Ormo : 2300 words.

4. Szomaliool, or Somauli : 600 words.

5. Toufte, or the language of a small nation near the Tambaro : 10 words.
This last is                  dialect of the

E. For several unplaced languages --

1. Gwinza: 400 words.                 4. Yarabo: 30 words.
2. Souro: 19 words.                   5. Gamo : 10 words.

3. Dokko : 29 words.                  6. Barea : 10 words.

Now, of these, almost all are Abyssinian ; so that if the languages be as
different from those enumerated as the names are, we have several addi

tions to the present list. It is, however, Dr. Beke's opinion that the distinct
and separate languages of Abyssinia have all been enumerated. He further

adds that    D'Abbadie's Sidama is his own Kaffa.

Arabic. --   The details of    the Coptic language have
                                                         been  considerably increased

since the publication of the Mithridates. The notice however of these is a
point of historical and scholastic criticism. Our present knowledge of the
Coptic of Egypt for ethnological purposes, in kind, the same as in the year

   The general character and extent of the Coptic literature, subsequent to
the introduction of Christianity into Egypt, and subsequent to the applica
tion of the Greek alphabet to the Coptic languages, was known both to Vater

and Adelung.
    So also were the three Coptic dialects, the Memphitic, the Sahitic, and

the so-called Baslimuric.

   The researches into the Hieroglyphics were not known to Adelung, nor
were they part of his subject, except so far as the older forms of the
Egyptian language might supply roots and forms which were wanting in the

more recent Coptic.
   The languages in contact with the present boundaries of Egypt are the

Berber and Tibboo on the west, the Nubian on the south, the Bisharye on

the south-east, and the Arabic on the north-east. There                                   no reason to

African affinities. Reasons for breaking down the distinction hereby im

On the southern borders of the Sahara the Berber language is contermi

nous with the Woloff, Serawoolli (?), Fulah (?), Sungai, Howssa, and
Bornu (?) languages; its southward extension, on the eastern half of Africa,
being sufficiently wide to embrace the whole area of the Great Desert.

   To the east its extension from north to south is less ; the Tibboo language

being spoken as far west as Fezzan, and as far north as the oases of Augila

and Siwah.

    The remarkable magnitude of the Berber area was known to the authors
of the Mithridates.
The French conquest of Algeria has increased our knowledge of the Ber
ber. The extent of this increase may be measured by the following cata
logues, wherein the data known to the authors of the Mithridates are noted.

4. The Tuarick of Richardson's vocabulary, vid. supr. Mr. Newman
states that Hodgson's Tuarick and Richardson's do not exactly coincide.
    The Berber area is not only remarkably extensive, but it is also one of

great antiquity. From the times of the earliest history the Berber nation
has been spread over the same extent of country as at present ; since the an
cient Numidian and Mauritanian names of Sallust, and other writers, have
a. meaning in the modern Berber. No country, except Arabia, presents a
similar phenomenon. The Turkish, the English, and the languages derived
from the ancient Roman, are spoken over more square miles than are the Ber

ber dialects. Their spread however has been within the historical period.

     1. That the term Berber is an improper name for the languages of Bar-
t>ary, in other words, that Barbary itself is an exceptionable appellation, has

been frequently insisted on. It has also been stated that the so-called Ber
ber languages have just the same relation with the Barabbra that they have
with the other African languages, neither more nor less.

     2. That the Berber, or Amazirgh, has affinities with the Semitic languages,
 is a fact to be exhibited in the criticism of the affinities of the African lan

guages out of Africa. At present the glossarial evidence is very slight.
 The grammatical arguments have been most developed by Mr. Newman in

 his Berber Grammar and in the Philological Transactions, No. 13. The
 Semitic character of their grammar is strongly insisted upon by that writer.

 Mr. Norris's opinion is equally decided.

     3. That there is no reason for disconnecting the Berber from the other
 languages of Africa is shown in the Classical Museum, No. 12.

    4. The preponderance of the letter t, as an inflexional element, both initial
 and final, is a character common to the Berber and the Coptic ; and, in a
 less degree, to the Bisharye ; a fact which suggests more investigation than

has been  applied.    Languages.      --  It  is  more  convenient  to leave the following

Considered, for certain reasons, as the aboriginal language of a larger area,
but displaced by the Woloff*.

Adelung's opinion, founded upon the Sereres vocabulary of Verdun de
la Crenne, was in favour of the language being Woloff. However, from the
same data the present writer considered that it had equal affinities with the

Fulah. It is left unplaced provisionally. The only additional specimen, viz.
the Sereres of the Senegal vocabularies, makes it Woloff and Fulah most, and

Mandingo least. Nevertheless, although so little Mandingo, it has much in
[l.jcommon with the Seracolet. It is by no means isolated.

XXVIII. --The Akvambu The only work* known to me where specimens
of the Akvambu are to be found, is out of reach. This fact, and an indistinct .

notion that its isolation has been insisted upon, are my only reasons for dis

connecting it from the other languages of the Gold Coast. It is conter
minXoXuIsXw. ithThteheTiAbsbhoaon. t--ee.This is the language of the Libyan Desert, bounded
on the north by the Berber of Siwah and Augila, and by the Arabic ; on the
south by the languages of Bornu, Kanem, and Darfour; on the east by the
Arabic of Egypt, and the Nubian of Nubia; and on the west by the Tuarick
of the Sahara. Adelung considered the Tibboo as Berber ; so did Balbi. Their

data were  a few words from Hornemann ; and the opinion has not   been    --adopted.
Prichard   first objected to it. The present Tibboo vocabularies   are,
1. The Tibboo of Lyon. -- Travels in Northern Africa.
2. The Tibboo of Hodgson.
    That the Tibboo, although without any specific affinities, was by no means
an isolated language, is shown in the Classical Museum, No. 12.

  IfIt probably belongs to the Nubian class.

       future researches justify the assumption of the letter- change, the Tibboos
retain the name as well as the locality of the ancient Libyans or Libyes.
    Such are our materials, and such the provisional classification. Inde
pendent of the question of the affinities between the groups, the geogra
phical distribution of them exhibits more than one point of ethnological

importance.
1 . The restriction of ancient cultivation to the tract of the Nile, and the
limitations of its extension westward.
2. The contrast between the character of Asiatic influences at the two
ends of the Red Sea. For Egypt and the parts connected with Asia by the
Isthmus of Suez, the permanent influence of Arabia began at a late period,
i. e. under the successors of Mahomet. For Abyssinia, and the parts about
the Straits of Babelmandel, the permanent influence of Arabia began at a
period anterior to history, as manifested by the constitution of the old
/Ethiopic language
   3. The character    and its   derivatives.  --  The  simple                       being

extended over so vast a range of country as the whole of the Sahara and
Northern Africa is not, in itself, very remarkable. The Turk dialects cover .
a greater portion than this in Asia and Europe. The English language in
North America covers a greater area still. This however is from extension

ported language, and has supplanted languages akin to the Hottentot. Iso
lated portions of these may still exist to the north of those parts where the
Caffre languages are spoken continuously. The northern limits of the Caffre

languages, as at present known, both cast and west, coincide almost exactly

with the equator. Compare with the distribution of the languages of South
ern Africa the distribution of the languages of Hindostan.

statement that the language of Madagascar really one, although credited,
requires further investigation.
Another question presepts itself. What do the languages enumerated
offer in the way of measure of the intellectual strength on the part of the

<^fhe structure of the African languages exhibits as little in the way of
intellectual development as does the African literature?"^ Regularity and
multifariousness in grammatical structure have been put at their proper
value, since the so-called poly-synthetic character of languages, like the
Eskimo and American, has been investigated. (Tnnay be stated generally
that the African languages are in the second stage of development. None

are monosyllabic, in the degree that Chinese is monosyllabic ; and none are
inflectional in the degree that Greek and Latin are inflectiona£T->
   Do the philological and the physiological tests agree ? in other words, do

the arrangements according to physical conformation, and the arrangements
according to language coincide? Pretty closely. Whatever may be the
inference drawn from the fact, it is undoubtedly true that, in those tribes
where differences of figure and complexion have been most noted, a differ

ence of language has also been recognized. The Copts, Berbers, and Caf-
fres and Hottentots verify this. In Abyssinia the coincidence is somewhat
less. In Abyssinia, however, much has yet to be done in philology. More
over, particular tribes have shades of colour. Some of the Tuaricks are thick-

lipped and woolly- haired ; the Nufis are fairer than their neighbours; the
Caffres of Congo are more truly negro, than those of Caffraria; the light or
red complexion of the Fulahs has long been noticed. In all this there are
no differences of any remarkable importance.

remark is sufficient. No scholar who admits the Celtic languages, with
their peculiar system of initial changes, into the list of Indo-European lan
guages, can, on the mere strength of the euphonic concord, isolate the

Caffre tongues.

   What has just been written as to the value of these two important cha
racters of the Caffre languages, the Euphonic Concord and the System of
Prefixes, has dealt with the question, as a general question of philological

criticism. It has assumed them to be found in the Caffre languages exclu

   In the Berber language the inflexional elements generally come after the
root ; in other words they are q/Bxes.

   This value of a distinction of this kind, between the methods of inflexional
formation in different languages, is certainly of no great importance.

    Several well-known languages illustrate this, by cases similar, though not

parallel.
   1. The Syriac postfixes the article which the Hebrew prefixes.
   2. The Scandinavian languages postfix the article which the Germanic

languages prefix.
   3. The  GSecarmndainnaicvialanngulaanggeusagpersefiaxf--fix   the reflective               to the verb,

   That any general statement in this department of philological criticism
requires to be received with caution is shown by the following exceptions
that may be taken to a position of Dr. C. Tutschek's, whose Galla grammar,
like the Berber grammar of Mr. Newman, is the work of a sound general
philologist. After the statement that, in the Galla language, the inflexions
are always formed by means of affixes, we find that the frequentative and
intensive forms are denoted by what approaches to a prefix, viz. a redupli
cation ; e. g. tnra = to wait ; tu-lura = to imit a long time. We also rind
a true prefix, in-, recognized by Mr. Tutschek.

   It is also stated that composition is rare in the G.-illii ; and the words
gaddebia = to condescend, from gadi = downwards, and debia = to turn
back, is quoted as a single instance ; the i being dropped in the connexion.
This would, probably, not be the case if the verb did not begin with the

same consonant with which gadi ends.

   In gadi lakiza = to let loose, the two words stand separate, and gadi is
unaltered in form. All this is a question of euphony rather than of com
position : the truth being that the amalgamation which distinguishes a com
pound word from two words                      generally speaking, imperfect in the Galla.

one compound, and two separate words,
more so than in our own. Nevertheless, the principle of composition may
be part and parcel of such language, and some dialect, other than the
particular one under consideration, may appear in an unequivocal form.

to the same principle.                                                                       elements have little or

no likeness. The so-called signs of the tenses, moods, &c. differ. Precisely
the same occur in the American languages, where the general grammatical

criticism should not mislead us. Languages which separate from the com

are more alike in their grammars than in their vocabularies whilst lan

guages that separate from the common mother-tongue -before the evolution

of an inflectional system are more alike in their vocabularies than in their

Ifnon-coincidence proves difference.

         ventured to account for this inconstancy in the ethnological value of
the numerals, the hypotheses would be based on the following distinction.
   There are two sorts of numerals, the former of which probably grew out
of the latter.
Exclusive numerals; like two, three, twenty, &c.

2. Secondary numerals like couple, brace, leash, score, &c.
                                    separated from the common

no room for any variety of expression.

When languages have separated from the common stock before the evolu
222 REPORT 1847-

tion of a system of exclusive numerals, tbere is change, and there is room
for some variety of expression. We can choose between the words pair,
couple, brace, leash; and hence four different languages, closely allied in

other respects, may each adopt a difference in the numerals.
   This, and much similar preliminary criticism, should be borne in mind as

often as the African languages are studied for the purposes of ethnography ;
since the difference of opinion amongst competent judges is not so much in
respect to the facts, as in respect to the appreciation of them. Without due
caution, the lines of separation are likely to be drawn too broadly.
   Now it is not the object of the present paper to establish any general

assertion by full and irrefragable evidence. Such an undertaking would re
quire both more space and more opportunities than the writer can allow
himself. All that he undertakes is to         the way for future researches.
This he attempts in two ways: --       clear

1. By arranging the bibliographical part of the subject, and by classifying,
in a rough and provisional manner, a mass of numerous and fragmentary

materials.

   2. By submitting to the learned world a certain amount of primd facie
evidence in favour of the fundamental unity of the African languages in
general. For this theorem he professes only to prepare the proof ; not to
supply it in full.
   The languages upon the isolation whereof the most has been said, are
the Fulah, the Berber, the Coptic, and the Caffre. That of the Hottentot

has, perhaps, been tacitly assumed, rather than insisted on.
1. The Fulah has to be studied carefully. Its supposed isolation has been

as little supported by argument as its connexion with any other language has
been proved. It has undoubted miscellaneous affinities.

   2. Miscellaneous African affinities for the Berber have already been re
ferred to, vid. sup. Besides which, the researches of Mr. Newman and the
French scholars are likely to throw much new light upon this language.
   3. The Coptic is also under study. Nevertheless, its miscellaneous Afri

can affinities that have already been discovered are sufficient to show that it
cannot properly be isolated. For every step that can be taken to prove the
extra African relations of the Coptic, it is believed that a similar one may
be taken in the opposite direction, leading towards its position amongst the
Negro languages. The following short table is the result of a very limited

and unsystematic investigation.

The Abyssinian languages are a part of Semitic philology ; and the Ber
ber, Coptic, and even the Oalla languages, are becoming more and more so
        year. This                                  of many points which may pos
every  be expected    defers   the consideration  the direction of modern researches
sibly                in the
                              present paper. If

have a tendency to place more than one African language in the same group
with the truly Semitic tongues of Arabia and Syria, it must be remembered

that it by no means follows that a language by becoming Semitic ceases to
be African. This is an opinion which is naturally (I had almost said neces
sarily) derived from the sequence of affinity between the Tigre, the Agow
and the Gonga languages of Abyssinia on the one side, and the languages
of Africa in general on the other.

                     Semitic on one side,  African on  the other.

4% The apparent isolation of the Caffre group of languages has already
been noticed. The following table, the result of a limited and unsystematic

investigation, affords perhaps something more than mere prima facie evidence
of its fundamental affinity with the other tongues of the Continent.

' Transactions of the British Association,' there was one" memoir on the con

tributions afforded by physical and philological researches to ethnology and

favourite pursuit some ground for hope, that this would for the future be
among the recognised branches of knowledge, for the cultivation of which
provision would be made at the meetings of the Association. It is almost

needless to say that this hope was disappointed, and that no arrangements
having been adopted for the discussion of ethnological questions, some very
elaborate memoirs sent to the meetings of the Association, by distinguished

scholars, were returned without having obtained a hearing*. It was not until

after several annual meetings had taken place, that it was determined to
afford an opportunity for the pursuit of ethnological inquiries by making for
that purpose a subdivision of one of the sections devoted to natural history

or physiology.

There seemed to be an obvious propriety of systematic arrangement in
contemplating the natural history and physiology of man as forming but a
part of the study of living nature in general. Physiology, in the sense which

modern writers attach to that term, has a comprehensive meaning, though a
more restricted one than its original acceptation. The physiologia of the
ancients comprised the knowledge of nature in all its departments. Modern

by these sciences differ from each other in the manner of their existence. Per

manence and identity of being is the attribute of one class ; the characteristic
of the other is successive generation and decay. Perpetuity of existence, so
far as our experience of time extends, simplicity of structure, and preserva
tion of the same form and state, unless changed by external agency, belong
alike to the smallest molecules of the unorganized world and to those great
masses, which, age after age, revolving in the heavens, have offered them
selves to the view of countless generations. Natural philosophy claims this
division of created things and leaves to physiology those beings which have
a less permanent duration, which exist in successive generations destined, one
after another, to rise, flourish, and decay, which, beginning from ova or seeds,
grow to a definite extent by accretion of particles from without, assume a
particular form, subsist in perfection for a definite space of time, and then,

after giving origin to new germs or rudiments, prepared according to certain
fixed laws to secure the continued existence of each tribe, fall at length a
prey to the dissolving powers of the external elements. These are the com
mon properties of all organized beings. The theory of these pfoceSSeTTon-
stitutes the physiology of modern times, and it is obvious that the physical
relations and the natural history of man come within these limits. If, there
fore, the real scope of ethnology were merely an inquiry into the physical

constitution of human tribes in comparison with each other, as it appears to
have been supposed, there would be an obvious propriety in making this
study a subdivision of physiology or the science of organic nature.
    But those who have devoted their attention to that pursuit are well-aware
that the objects of ethnology are very distinct from the study of organic
nature or physiology. Ethnologya

than to natural science. Ethnology professes to give an account, not of what
nature produces in the present day, tut of what she has produced in times long
since past.        an attempt to trace the history of tribes and races of men

from the most remote periods which are within the reach of investigation, to
discover their mutual relations, and to arrive at conclusions, either certain
or probable, as to their affinity or diversity of origin. All this belongs rather
to archaeology than to the science of nature. It                                          true that many of the
                            means of which we collect data for ethnological
subordinate investigations
inductions are within the province of physiological science. The facts and ana
logies which natural history and physiology present, furnish in many instances
the data or the arguments on which the conclusions of the ethnologist are
founded. These contributions of natural history and natural science are, how
ever, but part of the resources of which the student of ethnology avails
himself, and we shall find that he borrows fully as much from other depart
ments of knowledge, quite separate from the study of nature and her pro
ductions. The results, moreover, at which he arrives do not fall within any

department of natural science. They are archaeological or historical. It may,

therefore, be contended that in strict propriety they scarcely find their place
in the great system of scientific inquiries which are the objects of the British

Association.
But ethnology has at least one claim to be admitted in the list of such in

quiries, since stands, in these respects, precisely on the same ground as
aone of the most popular of the studies which are cultivated by the British
      aAssociation, and would be impossible to deny place to one of these pur

the history of nations and of mankind from many other quarters. It derives
information from the works of ancient historians, and still more from the
study of languages and their affiliations. ("fhe"history of languages, indeed,
greatly extended as it has been in late times, has furnished unexpected re
sources for the improvement of ethnology, which could hardly have advanced
a few steps without such aid. As geology would have been a barren and
uninteresting study, and uncertain in most of its results without the aids
which the study of organic remains has unexpectedly afforded, serving to
identify geological formations and to connect particular series of rocks with

periods in the world's history ; so it has been through discoveries in the re
lations of languages that the ethnologist is enabled to trace alliances between
nations scattered over distant regions of the earth, of whose connections with
each other he would have had no idea without such evidence?}

Iwho are already conversant with the history and progress of this science,

since it will be impossible for me to accomplish the task which have under

taken without saying much that must to such persons be already well known
Iand familiar.
                              shall advert to the aids which the study of living
   In the first place,
nature, or of the organized world, has furnished in aid of these inquiries.
The assistance of anatomy is obviously indispensable in the promotion of
ethnological inquiries. Many writers, indeed, seem to have regarded eth
nology as consisting principally of the comparative anatomy of different
races of men, and they have devoted their attention almost exclusively to

diversities in anatomical structures supposed to distinguish particular tribes.
The first attempt to point out such distinctive characters on any scientific
method was that of the celebrated anatomist Camper. Every one knows

that the distinguishing character pointed out by this writer was founded on
the shape of the skull and the measurement of the facial angle. The facial
angle of Camper is included between two lines, one of which is drawn from
the passage of the ear to the basis of the nose, and the other is a line slanting

off from the forehead to the mouth, or rather to the most advanced point of

the upper jaw-bone. This angle was thought to afford a measure of the capa
city of the anterior part of the skull, and of the size of the corresponding
portion of the brain. Camper, who had within his reach very few skulls for
examination, thought that he found this angle of different extent in different
classes of human heads. He found that skulls of Europeans, when thus
measured, gave an angle of 80°, the skull of a Kalmuk one of 75°, and the
skull of a Negro one of only 70°. He observed that there are forms of the
head in which the angle appeared to be greater than it is in the European,
and others in which it is less than in the Negro. Those which have it greater
than it is in the European, and in which it amounts to 90°, are the ideal
heads of Grecian gods, forms not existing in nature ; and the first among the
skulls in which this angle is less than in the Negro are those of apes. In

these last the angle was estimated by Camper at 64°, 63°, or 60°. Camper

accordingly thought that he had found in the skulls of Negroes a type inter
mediate between the cranium of the European man and that of the Orang.

But in this he was mistaken. The supposed gradation exists only when skulls
are compared which have the infantile form, or before dentition is complete.
After the period of dentition, when the jaws have obtained their full deve

lopement, the difference in the facial angle in the heads of apes and in those
human skulls in which it has the smallest measurement, becomes enormous.

In the Troglodyte the angle is 35°, and in the Orang or Satyr it is only 30°,

as we learn from the measurements of Professor Owen.

   The venerable Blumenbacb, whose name will never be forgotten so long
as ethnology shall be a subject of study, was really the father of this science.
He was the first who possessed, or rather with immense labour and assiduity
collected, the materials requisite for instituting an accurate inquiry into the
physical differences of the various races of men. Blumenbach divided the
forms of the human head into five varieties. He designated them, not as it

would perhaps have been better to have done in the first instance, by descrip
tive epithets, but by the names of the races of people to which they belonged,
or of the regions of the world whence these races were supposed to have
originated. The Caucasian form was so termed from Mount Caucasus, to
which Blumenbach observed that ancient traditions refer the origin of many

celebrated cations. He supposed this to be the primitive type of the human
skull, and regarded the other forms as degenerations from it. These were
the Mongolian, the American, the Ethiopian, and the Malayan. The five
forms were supposed to prevail through five divisions of mankind, compri

sing between them the whole human family. This distribution was com
plete so far as the ethnographical knowledge of the time allowed it to be ;

but it would be necessary in the present day to enumerate many additional
varieties in the shape of the skull, and to constitute additional human races,

if we would follow the same method and adapt it to the present state of our

athciqs uraeinmtaarnkceI  with   distant regions  of the earth                    and their inhabitants. On

                                                                                  I shall have, in the sequel,

to advert to many of the facts which bear upon it. Blumenbach's delinea
tions of skulls were admirable, and his descriptions of the forms supposed to
                                                                           a is,

view of the shape of the head which he seems to have overlooked. In com
paring the heads of human races with those of apes, the form of the basis of
the skull should be examined, since this displays, in the most striking man

ner, the immense difference between the structure of the human head and

that of the inferior tribes. This was first pointed out                           Professor Owen.

branch of knowledge and the pursuits of the ethnologist. One series of

be explained by reference to external agencies, or imply original difference,
and form, therefore, specific characters. Another inquiry connected with
physiology whether variations of form, colour, &c. can be explained by
reference to any known principle, and how far, and under what conditions,

they are transmitted to posterity, and may therefore assist us in explaining
the origination of particular breeds or tribes, marked              by

personal characters.

   Natural history, and especially zoology, opens the ground of several in
quiries very important in the study of ethnology.

   We must take account, for example, of the variations of form and or

ganization to which the different species of animals are subject, in order to
solve the question, whether the differences observed in human races, when
compared with each other, are analogous to the natural varieties which spring
up in tribes of animals, or are such as indicate an entire distinction from the
era of creation, and therefore prove the species to be separate

So many exceptions however had been asserted to exist to the supposed law,
that many physiologists of the age of Blumenbach abandoned this doctrine
of hybridity as criterion for the discrimination of species. Perhaps they
                   a

were somewhat hasty in giving up principle which was not ^intenable,
and only required some modification in order to be still an argument of
great value in the inquiry respecting species. Whatever exceptions may

Griqua Hottentots near the Cape of Good Hope, facts which are now well
established, are calculated to remove all doubts that can arise on this head,

as far as human races are concerned.

Physical geography is another study connected with natural science,

which has important relations with ethnology. Physical geography com
prehends the localization of those agencies of climate which are supposed
to modify the organization of living tribes, or which oppose limits to the
sphere of their existence. With respect to human beings who are cosmo

polites, it is the modifying effect of these agencies that we have to observe.
One series of facts connected with physical geography comprises the effects
produced upon climates by elevation of the surface of the earth. It is well
known that in the ascent of mountains changes of climate and vegetation

are perceived, analogous to those observed in passing from a lower to a
higher latitude. Plants of the frigid zone reappear in equatorial countries
near the summits of Alpine mountains. An inquiry is suggested how far
this may tend to account for the phaenomenon that the xanthous or very fair
complexion, with red hair and blue eyes, is often seen in the inhabitants of

Alpine regions. For example, if we begin from the eastern parts of the
world, we find xanthous people on the Himalaya, in the Hindu families
who reside near the sources of the sacred rivers at Jumnotrl and Gangotri.

Even the Rajpoots in Rajast'han are known to be much fairer than the
people of the lower plains in Bengal and elsewhere. Passing the Indus, we
find the Yusuftsyi of the high tracts of Affghanistan a fair xanthous people,
while the Ghilji of the lower country are dark and the Jauts of the plain
of the Indus nearly  tbhelacHk.indTuh-eKnh,u,a--gaiIn,    we find  a xanthous tribe on

Siah-Posh, who speak a dialect allied to the Sanskrit, and are supposed by
Bopp and Ritter and other learned men, to be descendants of the ancient
Arian race who conquered India some thousand years ago, and probably
left these people behind them in Central Asia. Far westward, in Arabia,

according to Bruce, a similar phaenomenon is displayed among the inha
bitants of the cold mountains of Ruddhua ; and in Africa among the Kabyles,
the natives of Mount Aurasius, behind Tunis and Algiers, are so fair and

red-haired, that they have been conjectured, without a shadow of proof, to

be descendants of the ancient Vandals, as if it were possible for Vandals

to have made their way to the tops of all the mountains in the world. Even
in America, among the tribes inhabiting the Rocky Mountains, similar facts

have been observed. The rationale of this phaenomenon is plainly connected

with the physical conditions of so many mountainous regions. It admits of
a comparison with the changes of complexion discovered, as we proceed
from the country of black races under the equator to that of the fair people
of Northern Europe.
   Another observation to which I shall briefly advert will serve to indicate

the bearing which researches in physical geography may have on ethnology.
The pheenomena of vegetation doubtless indicate conditions of climate which
are inappreciable by means of thermometers, hygrometers and all our in

struments ; and when we consider the fact, pointed out by the great botanist,
Mr. Robert Brown, that the distribution of the great families of plants in

various countries in the southern hemisphere approaches to that which pre
vails under the equator much more nearly than in the northern vegetation
of corresponding latitudes, we are at liberty to infer that the sum total of
those agencies of climate which affect organized beings is much more
similar to that of equatorial countries to the southward than to the north

ward of the line. This conclusion may be considered in relation to the
236 REPORT 1847.

well-known fact, that the varieties of the human species existing in the great

southern continents are much more similar in physical characters to the native
races of the torrid zone than any of the aboriginal people inhabiting the

Inorthern regions of the world.

     have briefly touched upon the principal branches of the science of nature
which afford resources for the cultivation of ethnology, and it now remains

for me to take some notice of the aids which history and archaeology con

tribute in promotion of the same inquiries.

Those historical investigations which are alone fitted to promote the re
searches of the ethnologist must compass a wide field, and go far beyond
the information that can be collected alone from the writings of ancient and
modern annalists. Much indeed is to be found in the works of such writers
as Herodotus, Aristotle, Diodorus, Caesar, Pliny, Strabo and Tacitus, that is
useful in investigating the history of those nations in Europe and Asia which
were within the sphere of the knowledge of the Greeks and Romans ; but
all such information would be not only confined, but fragmentary and dis
jointed, without some more comprehensive means of illustration that may
serve to bring the various notices scattered through ancient writers into
some distinct relation with tribes of people actually known to us. We must
collect all the different lights that can be brought to bear on the history of

from sepulchral relics discovered in many countries, consisting of tombs con
taining embalmed bodies, or more often the mere skulls and skeletons of the
ancient inhabitants, which furnish the most authentic testimony that can
be procured as to the physical characters of various races of people. Besides

Iall these, there is another source of information more extensively available

than any of them, -- allude to the history of languages and their affinities.
   The history of mankind is not destined, like the fundamental facts of

geology, to be dug out of the bowels of the earth, though some of the
ancients thought otherwise, if we may judge from the abundance of sculp
tures and inscriptions with which they covered the sides of caverns. Curious
documents have however been discovered in various countries beneath the

Isoil, which have brought evidence of historical facts otherwise unknown.

may allude for an example to the great collections of silver money of the
coinage of the early caliphs of Bagdad, which have been dug up in various
places in the neighbourhood of the Baltic, marking out the path of an ex
tensive traffic between the east and the north, at a time when the northern

people of Europe are generally supposed to have been in a state of extreme
barbarism. But the discoveries most interesting in relation to ethnology,
are those of sepulchral remains, which in various regions of the world have

to the insular Guanches, the ancient inhabitants of the Fortunate Islands,
who now, falsifying this name, exist, only in the caverns of Teneriife or in
European museums, to which they have been transported as curiosities.
Over vast wildernesses in the northern regions of Asia, along the banks of

the Irtish and beyond the remote Jenise'i, innumerable tumuli are scattered,
containing the remains of ancient art and long-extinct races of men ; and it

is a remarkable fact, that in this wintry region, where organic nature seems
to struggle against the elements for a precarious existence, even the arts
of decoration were studied in those times of yore which witnessed the
erection of these tombs. Implements of silver, gold and copper, girdles
of the precious metals, bracelets decked with pearls, and fragments of por

celain, have surprised the travellers who have seen a few of these tumuli

excavated. Similar tumuli spread over the north of Europe contain the
remains either of the same people or of races more barbarous than the

Asiatics. Hundreds of these have been rifled by treasure-hunters, or by

mere antiquaries little more enlightened, who have sought to make collec
tions of curiosities without any view to promote science or history. Of late
years, Eschricht, Nilsson and Retzius have attempted in Denmark and
Sweden to identify in these relics the remains of different races supposed to
have inhabited successively the north of Europe in early times. Their

learned Swedes who have devoted their attention to this subject, the sepul
chral remains of Northern Europe may be referred to three successive aeras.
They display different physical types and different stages of advancement in
civilization. The oldest are the relics of a people with round heads, having
the transverse diameter of the cranium large in proportion to the longitu
dinal. The implements and ornaments which are found in the tombs of

this race indicate the greatest rudeness. They consist of tools and the heads
of arrows and lances made of stone and bone, but nothing indicating a know

ledge of the use of metals. Whether these oldest tombs were the sepulchres

of a Celtic race, is a question not yet decided. It seems to be the opinion
of Retzius and that of Nilsson who has written a learned work on the anti
quities of Scandinavia*, that they were the burial-places of a people much
older than the Celts. Similar remains more recently discovered in France,
have been supposed by MM. Robert and Serres to be referrible in like
manner to different eras, but to what successive races they respectively
belonged is as yet only matter of conjecture. It seems however to have
been observed in many parts of Europe, that the skulls, which from their
situation, and from the ruder character of the implements and ornaments

buried with them, may be supposed to have belonged to the most ancient
class, are of a rounder and broader form than the crania discovered in
tombs of a later date ; and this observation tends to support the notion en
tertained by many persons, that the west of Europe had inhabitants pre
viously to the arrival of Celtic colonies, and that these earliest people
belonged to a family of different physical characters from those of the Indo-

European race, and were more nearly allied to the nations of Northern Asia.

The information afforded by inscriptions is much more definite, and this

source of knowledge has been greatly augmented of late years by the un
paralleled success of modern investigators, who have deciphered the written

memorials of many ancient nations, engraven on rocks and various monu
ments, though the sense had remained unknown for thousands of years and
even the languages in which they were written had been lost. Numerous
inscriptions scattered over all India, on rocks and the sides of caves, in Kabul
and through the ancient empires of Iran and Assyria, through Hadramaut
and Oman, the remotest districts of Arabia, and through the north of

Africa, to say nothing of the more celebrated remains of Egypt, prove that
literature was cultivated in those countries at a time when Europe was in
habited by painted or tattooed barbarians. In all those countries inscrip-

tions which have been gazed at with stupid wonder by the descendants of
the people who engraved them, and ascribed to the workmanship of imps

and genies, have been at length read within a few years and explained for
the first time after thirty centuries. The discovery began, as every one
knows, with the deciphering of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. The efforts of
Dr. Young and Champollion gained the clue, unravelling mysteries in a
field where it has been reserved for a distinguished scholar of the present

day (the Chevalier Bunsen) to erect the edifice of the most ancient history
of the world, a monument of the intelligence of modern Europe more exalted
than the royal pomp of the Pyramids, whose real builders now for the first
time come forth to our view, after having been concealed in the rubbish of
four thousand years. In the next place we must advert to the achievement
of our illustrious countryman, Mr. James Prinsep, in the East, who has read

and interpreted the inscriptions spread over India and Afghanistan. Many
curious facts in history have been made known by these inscriptions, and
among others, the extension of a Macedonian empire over a great part of
India, and the conquest of the island of Ceylon by a Buddhistical emperor
of Hindustan three centuries before the Christian era. Not less interesting
are the inscriptions in cuneiform letters spread through the empire of the

great Cyrus, which are likely to throw an important light on sacred as well
as profane history. The clue to the discovery of the sense of these Persian
records was obtained by Grotefend, Lassen and Burnouf ; and partly aided
by though much more by his own ingenuity, our countryman, Major

Rawlinson, has succeeded in reading the history of the Achaemenidae, en

graven on their own monuments in language which was doubtless spoken

at the courts of Susa and Persepolis, but which has been lost since the

overthrow of the last Darius. The older Assyrian inscriptions are now
partly understood, and the names of the ancient kings of Babylon have been
found on the walls of their palaces. This most ancient variety of the cunei
form system of writing was probably an invention of the northern or
eastern branch of the Shemite or Syro-Arabian race and two other forms
of writing, perhaps the most ancient in the world, belong to two other sub
divisions of the same family. The Himyaritic inscriptions lately found in
various parts of Arabia are strikingly similar to the letters of the Gh^z or
Ethiopic. They seem to belong to the same alphabetic system prevalent
among the southern, perhaps the Cushite branch of the Syro-Arabian nations.
Far more celebrated was the third kind of writing, that of the Phoenicians,

the prototype of all the alphabets of ancient and modern Europe, and pro
bably representing the form of letters in which the sacred Scriptures were
originally written. Many historical facts have been already elicited from
these inscriptions, which are highly important in relation to ethnology.
But there perhaps no country, with the exception of ancient Egypt, on
a isthe history, or rather on the ethnology of which greater light has been
thrown by the examination of inscriptions than Italy, where by this resource

races of its inhabitants before the ascendency of Rome.                                                   seems that these

old Italic nations, the Latins, the Umbrians, the Opici or Oscans or Auso-
nians, the Samnites and Sabinps, the Siculians or CEnotrians -- all the old
Italic nations except the Tuscans -- were not, as Freret and even as Niebuhr

supposed, mixture of Celtic or other barbarous tribes with Greeks or at

least Pelasgi, but were all derived from distinct and peculiar branch of the
                  a

Indo-European stock, and spoke dialects of one language, of which Latin

was one variety.

expression. This may be considered almost as a new department of know

ledge, since although long ago sketched out and pursued to a certain
extent, it has been wonderfully augmented in recent times, and it is only
through its later developement that it comes to have any extensive relations
with ethnology. Leibnitz is generally considered to have been its originator.
The Adelungs, Vater, Klaproth, Frederick Schlegel, Bopp and Jacob Grimm

have been among its most successful cultivators ; and lastly, to William von
Humboldt it owes its greatest extension, and the character of a profound

philosophical investigation. But it is not in this light that we have now to

consider the results of philological researches. It is as an auxiliary to

history and as serving in many instances to extend, combine and confirm

historical evidence respecting the origin and affinities of particular nations,
Ifthat the comparison of languages contributes to the advancement of eth
nology.  ever we venture to rely on the testimony of such relationship
between languages as giving proof of ancient kindred between nations, it

must be when historical considerations render the conclusion in itself pro

bable, or indicate that it affords the most natural explanation of the pheno
mena observed. Great caution is requisite in drawing inferences of this

kind, since we cannot always conclude that nations belong to the same race

from resemblance or identity in their speech. We know that conquests fol
lowed by permanent subjugation have caused the people of some countries
to lose their own languages and adopt those of their conquerors. The
intercourse of traffic between different countries, the introduction of a new
religion and new habits of life, especially when rude and barbarous tribes
have been brought into near connexion with civilized ones, have given rise
to great modifications in many languages. It is only when we have good
reason to believe that the resemblances between the idioms of any particular

nations have arisen from no similar causes, that we are justified in founding
on such phaenomena an argument of their affinity in descent. The reasons
which may determine us to entertain this opinion may be of two kinds ; they
may either arise from a consideration of the local position and previous
history of the tribes of people who are the subjects of our inquiry, or they
may turn on the particular sort of resemblance or analogy discovered in
their languages.

   In the first place, if we learn from history that any two nations have been

remotely separated from each other from a very distant age, and have never
been brought into intercourse, we may hence argue that the marks of re
semblance discovered in their languages can bear no other explanation than
that of unity of descent. On this ground we infer without doubt the com
mon origin of the Polynesian Islanders and that of the Greeks and Germans
and the Arian race of Hindustan.

Secondly, phenomena are discoverable in languages themselves which
enable us to determine whether traits of resemblance detected in their com

parison were produced by intercourse between nations, or arose in the gradual
developement of their languages and thus prove a common origin in the tribes
of people to which these languages belong. Analogies from which this last
inference may be fairly drawn have in many instances been detected between
languages which have acquired in the lapse of time such differences, that
one dialect was unintelligible to people who spoke another idiom of the
240 REPORT-- 1847-

same stock. The following observations will perhaps explain as briefly as
possible the principles which have either been expressed or followed tacitly
by philologists who have entered upon such inquiries.

   It is the prevalent opinion of philologists that the most extensive relations
between languages and those which are the least liable to be effaced by time
and foreign intercourse, are the fundamental laws of construction both in

words and sentences. Grammatical construction, or the rules which govern
the relation of words in sentences, appears to be very enduring and constant,
since a similar construction prevails through whole classes of languages
which have few words in common, though they appear originally to have
had more. But beyond this there is a cognate character in words them
selves, which sometimes pervades the entire vocabulary of a whole family of
languages, the words being formed in the same manner and according to
the same artificial rule. This may be exemplified in the monosyllabic
structure of the Chinese                and Indo-Chinese languages,
of the vocalic harmony                  pervading the languages of        and by the   principle

                                                                          High-Asia,   which I
shall presently describe, and perhaps by the dissyllabic structure of roots in
the Syro- Arabian languages. Of grammatical analogy or similarity in the
laws of construction of words in sentences, including the rules of inflection,
we have examples in the languages of the aboriginal American nations, but
perhaps the most remarkable specimen is to be found in the grammatical
system of the Indo-European languages.

   It has been doubted, and the question is difficult to decide, whether
                                                                                       of origin be

                                        mean     when it is unsupported     by verbal  resemblances.

Languages descended from the same stock must, as it would seem, have

some words in common, or at all events some similar words. Such words

Ifmay be few in number, as we know that they are in idioms certainly be
longing to one family.                           we compare the Welsh and the Russian, both

Indo-European languages, we shall find few similar words. On the other
hand, the existence of a considerable number of similar words in any two
languages does not prove those languages to be of cognate origin. How

many words has the Welsh borrowed from the English and the English
from the French ! These idioms are indeed descendants of one original

stock, but their relation is distant and has no connection with the acquisi
tions which they have respectively made, one from the vocabulary of the

other, in recent times. The evidence to be deduced from verbal analogies
depends much on the classes of words in which such analogy is to be traced,

and on this point the following observations have been made*.
   The particular classes of words which resemble each other in languages

of a common origin and derived from one primitive stock, are generally dif

ferent in kind from those which one nation borrows from its neighbours.

Even when one people has derived from another a considerable proportion
Iof its entire stock of words, there generally remains an indigenous or abori

ginal vocabulary, or if may be allowed the expression, a home-bred speech,
consisting of such words as children learn in early infancy, and in the first de-
velopement of their faculties. This domestic vocabulary consists of words of the
first necessity, such as those denoting family relations, 'father,' 'mother,'
· child,' ' brother,' ' sister ;' seeondly, words denoting various parts of the body ;
thirdly, names of material and visible objects and the elements of nature,
the heavenly bodies, &c. ; fourthly, names of domestic animals ; fifthly, verbs
                      of universal bodily acts, such as '                  ' drink,'  ' sleep,' ' walk,'
e'txaplkre,'ssi&vec;   sixthly, personal pronouns, which   eat,'          found to     be among the
                                                           are

most durable parts of language ; seventhly, numerals, especially the first ten,
or at least the first five, for many nations appear to have borrowed the second
five in the decade. As no human family was ever without its stock of such
words, and as they are never changed within the narrow domestic circle for
other and strange words, they are almost indestructible possessions, and it is
almost only among tribes who have been entirely broken up and enslaved, so

that the family relations have been destroyed, that this domestic language can
have been wholly lost. Tribes and families separated from each other have
been known to have preserved such similar words for thousands of years in
a degree of purity that admitted of an easy recognition of this sign of a com

mon origin.

   A second class of words, which are common to nations who had attained
some degree of refinement before the era of their separation, consists of terms
                                                                                                                       of
connected with          simple arts,  such     as people acquire early in  the progress                                of
civilization, as                       " to    weave," "to sew;" names
                        "to plough,"                                       of weapons,
metals, tools, articles of dress. It has been observed that words of this class

are often common to nations whose domestic vocabularies are different ; and

on the other hand, different when the domestic vocabulary is nearly the
same. It is evident that an investigation of these relations of languages may

research     of languages           pursued on the principles above
relations                                                            laid down. I shall

not however exclude any portion of evidence that can be derived from other
considerations, such as the former proximity of nations or striking resem

blances in their physical characters.

    The principal part at least of the population of the old continent or great

continent of the world, if we exclude a few tribes chiefly confined to remote
districts, the relations of whose languages have not been fully elucidated, and
likewise the woolly-haired nations of Africa, who inhabit countries within a
few degrees of the equator, and beyond that line, may be referred to four

Igreat families distinguished from each other by their languages. The four

them, Ugro- Tartarian languages, or the languages of High-Asia and other
regions to be pointed out. 3. The Chinese and Indo-Chinese, or the mono

syllabic and uninflected languages. 4. The Syro-Arabian, often termed Se
mitic, languages. The three first of these dynasties of languages are con
fined to Europe and Asia, the fourth is common to Africa and those parts of
Asia which are near to Africa.
   1. The Indo-European languages. -- These languages are the national

idioms of all those races who, at the time of the great Cyrus, became and
have ever since continued to be the dominant nations of the world. We have

               only to except from this remark those instances in which certain Syro-Ara-
b bian or Ugro-Tartarian nations, under some extraordinary impulse, as the

             outbreak of the Mohammedan fanaticism, have assumed or recovered a
             partial sway over some of the weaker divisions of the Indo-European race.

                   The Indo-European languages and nations may be divided into many
               different groupes. They might be distributed in the order of their affinities,

   * M. Riihs,   for example, has    made use of  "thFiislmcloannsdideurnadtiosneineinBehwisohinnveers, tigvaotinonM.  of the

242 REPORT-- 1847.

but the most obvious division will be a geographical one. First, then, we
may distinguish the eastern groupe. This by many writers has been termed
exclusively the Arian family. It includes all the idioms of the ancient Medes
and Persians, who named themselves Arii, and their country Eeriene or
Iran, and likewise the Sanskrit with all the Prakrits, properly so termed, and
the Pali of India. Among the former was that ancient Persian language in
which one particular set of the cuneiform inscriptions was written. This

dialect was so near the Sanskrit that the inscriptions have been interpreted

through the medium of that language. The Zend lays claim to a still higher
antiquity, since the Zend is said by Burnouf, Professor Wilson and others,
who have studied it most successfully, to be more nearly allied to the very
ancient dialect of the Vedas, which preceded the classical Sanskrit, than it is

to this last more cultivated speech. How this claim is to be reconciled with

the comparatively recent date of all extant compositions in the Zendish lan

guage, remains to be explained.

   That the high-castes or twice-born classes of the Indian race were of the
same stock as the ancient Persians, may be considered as a fact established

by the affinity of their languages. The twice-born classes, as they term them
selves, are the Brahmans, the Xat iyas, and the Vaisyas, or the three higher
of the four classes of Hindoos. 'I hey also have the name of Aryas, which
means noble or dignified, and this is doubtless the origin of the epithet
" Apwi, which, as we learn from Herodotus, the ancient Medes assumed. The

Arian Hindoos must have crossed the Indus and have driven the aboriginal
Indians across the Vindhya mountains and the Nerbudda into the Dekhan,

where they still exist and speak their native languages, though mixed more
or less with the Sanskrit of their Arian conquerors, for we know that the

Arian Hindoos conquered the Dekhan and Ceylon at an early period.
   Some other Asiatic nations of inferior note speak dialects more remotely

connected with the same groupe of the Indo-European lauguages. Among
these are the Pushtaneh or Affghans, the Armenians and the Ossetes, and
some other nations of the chain of Mount Caucasus*.

  I should fill a volume Iif were to trace the relations of the remaining groupes

of languages which belong to the Indo-European stock. I shall confine
myself to a brief enumeration of the principal branches. They are, -- 1. The
Greek language and its dialects. It is probable that the Lydian and other
languages of Lesser Asia, and perhaps also the Thracian and Macedonian,
were allied to the Hellenic or Pelasgic Greek. 2. The old Epirotic and
Illyrian : this language is still well known. It is the Skippetarian, or Alba
nian, or Arnaut It is a distinct Indo-European idiom. 3. The old Italic
languages comprehending the Latin, Umbrian, Oscan, Siculian, and excluding

the Itasenic or Etruscan. 4. Probably the Etruscan was an Indo-European
dialect, though distinct from the Italic. But we know very little as yet about
the Etruscan language. 5. The old Prussian, including the Lettish and
Lithuanian, said to resemble the Sanskrit more nearly than any other

European language. 6. The great Germanic family of languages, most im
portant as comprehending the idioms of that people, who, since they over
threw the Roman empire, have divided with the Latin nations the domiuion
of the world, which from the decided superiority of these races in their in

tellectual and moral qualities they seem destined jointly to maintain. 7. The

Slavonian or Sarmatian dialects are a seventh section : they comprehend the
languages of the eastern parts of Europe, the Russian, Polish and Bohemian,

and the dialects of a great part of the countries in Europe subject to the
                                                   and " ttber das Mingrelische, Suanische

Turkish empire. 8. An eighth groupe of languages are the Celtic, formerly
spread over a great part of Europe, but now confined to some limited di
stricts in France and the British Islands. The Celtic languages were at one
time supposed to be entirely distinct from the Indo-European stock, their
affinity to which is now generally admitted, though some are of opinion that
their descent is not genuine, and that the remains of an aboriginal language
are combined with a peculiar Indo-European dialect in the formation of the

Celtic.

    Such is the extension of the Indo-European family of languages, reaching
in one continued line from the mouth of the Ganges to the British Isles, and
the coast of Scandinavia and of Iceland, without taking notice of the later

colonizations of this race in various parts of the world, where they seem des

Itined to supplant the aboriginal inhabitants. Before proceeding further,

shall now stop to inquire what inferences, strictly ethnological, can safely be
derived from the phaenomena connected with this extensive dispersion of the

Indo-European languages.

   It is well known from history that the nations which have been men
tioned have been spread from a remote age over the regions which they
now inhabit- The Teutonic and Scandinavian tribes of the German race
were known to Pytheas, who sailed on the Baltic in the time of Aristotle ;
and the Brahmans probably spoke Sanskrit at the court of Palibothra,
when they were visited by Megasthenes in the age of the first Se-
leucus. All ancient Germany, Scandinavia, Sarmatia, Gaul, and Britain,
Italy, Greece, Persia, and a great part of India, were then inhabited by

nations separate and independent of each other, speaking different languages,

but languages analogous and palpably derived from t'ae same original. The

question which now occurs to be solved is, whether the nations themselves
were kindred tribes of some primitive stock and derived the analogies of

their speech from some common language which had gradually deviated
from original identity by variations, at first merely dialectic, but gradually

increased, or whether the facts admit any other explanation. The only alter
native is the hypothesis that some single nation, to which the Indo-European
language originally belonged, conquered the indigenous races of Europe
and imposed upon them all its own language. But it is hard to conceive
                                                  to the facts under  consideration.
how such an    hypothesis   can be applicable      speaking any one   idiom belong
                an Asiatic   tribe, for example,
If we suppose

ing to this dynasty of languages, to have made conquests ever so extensive in
Europe and Asia, without leaving traces in history, which is almost incredible,
we shall still be far from a solution of the problem. How could one nation in

troduce German languages among the German nations ; Celtic dialects,

various as they are, among the Celts ; the Slavonic language among the

widely-spread nations of Sarmatia ; Greek among the Greeks ; the old Italic

dialects among the nations of Italy ? The supposition is absurd. Moreover,

there is internal evidence in the Indo-European languages themselves suffi

cient to prove that they grew by gradual dialectic developement out of one
common matrix. Any person who considers, with competent knowledge of
these languages, the nature of their relations to each other, the fact that their
original roots are for the most part common, and that in the great system of
grammatical inflection pervading all these languages there is nothing else than

the varied developement of common principles, must be convinced that the
differences between them are but the result of the gradual deviation of one com
mon language into a multitude of diverging dialects; and the ultimate con
clusion that is forced upon us  is,
                                                                                  2

   2. have termed the second great family of European and Asiatic nations
Ugro-Tartarian, for reasons which are explained in a note*. The races of

people to be comprised under this epithet were in early times spread over the

most remote regions of the great continent, where they are known in many

parts to have preceded the Indo-European nations, so that they appear, in
comparison with the latter, in the light of aborigines, or native inhabitants,
vanquished and often driven into mountainous and inaccessible tracts by
more powerful invading tribes. They inhabit chiefly extreme parts to the
westward, northward, and eastward of the Indo-European nations. The
ethnology of these races is involved in great obscurity ; the sources of in
formation respecting it are difficult of access, and have been imperfectly
explored. An attentive research has, however, detected traces of connexion
between tribes included in this department who must have been from imme
morial times separated from each other by great distances of space, and
these traces are in some instances so definite as to leave no doubt that they
owe their existence to original affinity. Phenomena which render this con
clusion more or less probable have been recognised among most of the
tribes, who are scattered, beyond the Indo-European population, from the
north and perhaps from the west of Europe to the north-eastern parts of
Siberia. The languages of many of these nations have been as yet very
imperfectly studied, and some are only known by the comparison of voca
bularies ; but in other instances their grammatical structure has been fully
elucidated. Rudiger, Dobrowsky and Rask, were the writers who com
menced this undertaking with an ethnological view. They have been pre
mature in some of their generalizations, but many of their conjectures have
been confirmed.

* The name which I have adopted as a general epithet for this family of nations, Ugro-
Tartarian, is compounded from the proper designations of the two principal branches of the
stem, viz. the Ugrian and the Tartarian. It is formed
the term which I have given to the improperly-named    on the same principle as Syro-Arabian,
                                                        Semitic nations -- improperly, because
a great portion of them were descendants of Ham. The name of Ugrian is one of the most
anoient names of the race, to which belong the Finns, Lapps, Hungarians and many Siberian
nations, and it has been sanctioned as a general appellation of the stock by F.H.Muller, one of
the most learned writers on their history. (See Midler's 'Ugrische Volkstamm.') The name
of Tartar, as applied to the nations of High Asia, after having been repudiated by many writers
of the last age, has been fully authorized by the example of the two greatest philologists who
have treated on these languages, I mean M. Abel Remusat and Professor Schott.
M. Kellgren, in his late excellent essay on the languages which I have designated Ugro-
Tartarian, names them the Ural-Altaish family. He apparently considers the Uralian chain
as the birthplace of one division and the Altai of the other. In this he follows Klaproth,

though with a more correct knowledge of the relations of these races to each other. I have
not adopted his terminology, because I cannot conceive what is meant by representing high
mountain chains as the cradles or birthplaces of nations. Klaproth connected this idea with
a fanciful notion that various nations had escaped the Noachic deluge on the heights of
mountains. Most persons will admit that nations must have been formed, (in the only sense
in which nations ever were formed, viz. by the aggregation of individuals or the multiplica
tion of families,) rather in fertile valleys or on plains abounding with the means of human

subsistence, than on inaccessible mountain-tops.       The Ugrian and Tartarian families of
languages are besides so akin to each other (as nobody has shown so fully as M. Kellgren),
that the races by which they were originally developed must be, supposed to have lived in
tIhteisfirdsitfficauglets                  with each other, or rather to have  been at first one stock of people.

On the whole I prefer the term Ugro-Tartarian, corresponding with Indo-European, and

Syro-Arabian, Indo-Chinese, and other analogous names.

1. Nouns are nearly or wholly incapable of inflexion. They admit no
variations of case, number, or sex, which can only be expressed by append
ing an additional word, as a noun of multitude or of gender.

   2. All auxiliaries to composition, such as are prepositions and other par
ticles, and the possessive and even relative pronouns of other languages, are
in these idioms uniformly suffixed or placed after the words of which they

modify the meaning.
3. In many of these languages the principle of vocalic harmony prevails

through the entire vocabulary, and extends to the grammatical system, such
as it is. This euphonic principle was first pointed out by Viguier in his
Turkish Grammar, and was termed by him the quadruple harmony of vowels.

First, then, we have the Ugrian tribes, whose name occurs in the chro

writers of late times, who have investigated the history of these nations. In
the sagas of the Northmen, who were their enemies and conquerors, they are
termed Iotuns and Jotnar, and by the Russians Tschudi and Tschudaki.

the Danish Islands to the North Cape of Asia. Almost everywhere they

on the Uralian Mountains, and the Ostiaks of the river Oby, are more remote
branches of this stock.
ire 2. A second groupe of nations belonging to the same great family includes
the various hordes who have been known under the names of Tartars, Turks,
Mongoles, Mandshurians, and Tungusians. All these nations appear, from
the result of late researches, to be allied in descent, though long supposed
to be quite separate. In the vast wilderness extending from the chain of
Altai to that of the Himalaya are the pasture-lands, where during imme
morial ages the nomadic tribes of High Asia fed their flocks and multi

plied those hordes which from time to time descended in immense swarms
on the fertile regions of Asia and of Europe. Perhaps the earliest of these
invasions of the civilized world was that of the Hiong-nu, expelled from the

borders of China by the powerful dynasty of the Han. These were the

people who, after their inroad on the Gothic empire of Hermanrich, made
their way, under Etzel or Attila, into the heart of France. Hordes from
these same regions under Togrul-Beg, and Seljuk, and Mahmud of Ghizni,
and Tschinggis, and Timiir, and Othman, overwhelmed the caliphat and the
empires of China, of Byzantium, and of Hindustan, and lineal descendants
of the shepherds of High Asia still sit on the throne of Cyrus, and ou that
of the Great Constantine.
246 REPORT 1847-

    The exploration of the affinity between the languages of these nations and
the proof of their connection with the idioms of the Ugrian tribes before
mentioned, has been the work of several successive writers, who have advanced
by degrees in the different parts of this research. Among them the names
of Gyarniathi, Vater, Abel Remusat, Ritter von Xylander, Professor Schott,
and, lastly, M. Kellgren are the most distinguished.

     The remaining groupes, referred to the same family, are connected with it
as yet by much feebler indications, and their affinities to it are rather matter
of conjecture than of certain proof. There are, however, in most instances
some arguments founded on the structure of languages which favour this
 opinion.

    3. The Euskarian or the Old Iberian language, spread in ancient times
through a great part of Spain and the south of Gaul, and, perhaps, also
through Italy, has been thought to belong to this family ; this was the opinion

of Professor Kask. It has never been established by any extensive compari
son. A work, however, has lately been written by Professor Keyser of
Christiania, in which the author endeavours to prove the wide extension of

the Iberian people through western Europe in remote times, and connects

Ithem with the Lapponic aborigines of Scandinavia.

       must here observe that many modern writers seem disposed to believe
that the Celtic nations, at least the original people of the British Isles whose
descendants are the Welsh and Irish, were in part of Finnish or Lappish de
scent, and sprang from a mixture of this race with a tribe of Indo-European
origin. There are phenomena both in languages and of other kinds which
tend to favour this conjecture; and it has a distinguished advocate in Dr.
Meyer, whose very successful studies of the Celtic languages will enable him
to throw new light on the literature of these nations.

    4 and 5. The languages of the Samoiedes, on the shores of the Frozen
Ocean, have been traced in the neighbourhood of the Altaic Mountains.
These, as well as several of the idioms of the Caucasian tribes, have been
supposed to belong to the same family of languages. The proof as yet
afforded in regard to the Caucasian idioms amounts only to some resem

blances in vocabularies.

   6. Insular nations to the eastward of Asia and near the coast of the Pacific
Ocean.

   It seems like a wild conjecture to join these nations to the races above

described. Some facts, however, may be collected, which, in a certain
degree, afford evidence of connexion between them.

   The idiom of the Islands comprised in the empire of Nippon, as well as that
of the independent Liukiu Archipelago, bears some signs of affinity to those
of the Ugro-Tartarian nations. I am assured by Mr. Norris, who has studied
the Japanese, and whose very extensive knowledge of languages renders him
a great authority in such questions, that the principle of vocalic harmony
and other phaenomena of the Tartar languages prevail in the idiom of the
Japanese and Liukiu islands.

    We have obtained, through the publication of Admiral Lutke's Voyage,
some knowledge of the language spoken in the Kuriiian Islands, and parti
cularly in the island of Unalashka. By a grammatical analysis of this lan
guage, composed by a missionary of the Russian church, we find that the
peculiar laws of construction, first pointed out by Dobrowsky as character
istic of the Ugrian and Tartar languages, prevails in the Kuriiian speech.

   7. The aboriginal inhabitants of India, who were expelled from Hindustan
by the Brahmans and the Arian people who accompanied them across the
Indus, retired, as it is supposed on apparently sufficient proof, into the Dekhan.
                ON ETHNOLOGY.                                       247

They still occupy the greater part of that peninsula, and a portion, at least, of
the island of Ceylon. Their idioms -- the Tamul or Malabar, the Telugu or
Telinga, and the Karnataka or Canara of the Mysore, -- are sister dialects of
one speech. It is likely that the languages of the mountain tribes of India,
the Bhils, the Gonds, the Tudas and others, belong to the same stock.

     Professor Rask conjectured that these nations are also of the Tartar stock.

Their language has some of the peculiarities of structure which have been

Ipointed out.

    8. Another suggestion, with which shall close what I have to say on the

languages of this great family, will appear to be still more conjectural.
     There are certainly some curious analogies between the Tamulian and

other dialects of the Dekhan and the languages of Australia, with which we
have obtained some acquaintance through the labours of Mr. Threlkeld and

several other missionaries, and from the able researches of Captain Gray.
Similar laws of structure have been found in both these groupes of languages ;
and some of their personal pronouns, words which appear to have remained
often less changed than almost any other vocables, have some very striking

resemblances*.

   IIn passing from this part of my subject, I must not omit to remark that
am far from regarding the supposition, that all the nations and languages
Inow enumerated really belong to one stock, as established on satisfactory
grounds.     have briefly touched upon the principal parts of this hypothesis,
and on some of the prominent arguments which occur in its support ; my
object being to point out the most advanced steps which have been made,

even though sometimes on grounds not perfectly secure, in the progress of eth

nology. It must be observed that many of the nations thus brought within

one department differ widely from each other in physical characters.
    3. The third family of languages belonging to the Great Continent are the

Chinese and Indo-Chinese idioms. · They are associated by the resemblance

of their structure, consisting of monosyllabic words, and not by any con
siderable number of common vocables. Other languages have monosyllabic

roots, as the Sanskrit, but the words of the Sanskrit become polysyllabic in

construction ; not so the Chinese, which are incapable of inflection, and do not

admit the use of particles as a supplement to this defect, the position of

words and sentences being the principal means of determining their relation

to each other and the meaning intended to be conveyed. Baron William
von Humboldt has observed, that conversation in these languages therefore

requires a greater intellectual effort than is necessary to comprehend the
meaning of sentences spoken in the inflected languages.

   All the nations who speak these languages bear a considerable resemblance

to each other in their mental character and disposition, and still more ob

viously in their physical characters, in which, however, some varieties are

observable.

Strongly marked as the peculiarity of the monosyllabic languages undoubt
       is,

earliest times by the various nations who inhabited that part of Asia lying to the
westward of the Tigris. They seem also to have had more ancient footiDg

in Africa, and to have been much more extensively spread in that quarter of
the world than they were formerly supposed to have been. The Syro-Ara-
      idioms of Asia have been divided
bian                                       by Gesenius and other        learned  writers
into  three groupes, -- 1, the Northern,  Aramaean orCbaldaean;          2, the  dialects

of Palestine, the Hebrew, Samaritan and Phoenician, including the language
of the Sacred Scriptures and that of the Phoenician inscriptions and the
Punic or Carthaginian* ; 3, the Arabic of the Koran and of the Kufic inscrip
tions, and likewise the modern dialects of the Iledjaz and Yemen, the Mog-
grebyn or Western idiom of the Arabs in Africa being a peculiar dialect of

this language. 4. Late writers have supposed that they have discovered a
fourth branch ; this is the Ekhkili of M. Fresnel, preserved, as he says, by that
noble race who inhabit the mountains of Hbazik, Mirbat and Zhafar, near the
southern coast of Arabia. This is supposed to be the idiom of the Himyaritic
inscriptions. 5. Akin to this last is the Ghyz or Old Ethiopia, as well as the

modern Tiigrayan and Amharic. The Abyssinian languages may be reckoned

a fifth division of the Syro-Arabian groupe. 6. A sixth, the various dialects of
the Old Libyan language, viz. the Berber, Shillah, Showiah and Tuaryk, and
one of the idioms of the Canary Islands. Professor Newman has investi
gated the history of these languages, and has shown by proofs, derived from
the intimate structure of words and the analogy of their grammatical forms,

that they belong to the Syro-Arabian family, and are nearly allied to the
oldest members of that stock. 7. The same writer has shown that the
Haiissa language, which is one'of the idioms of the black nations of Sudan,
has likewise a grammatical affinity to the Syro-Arabian dialects. 8. The
Galla languages (which, since the publication of several works by the mission
aries, the learned Mr. Krapf and others, and M. Tutschek's valuable gram
mar and dictionary, are beginning to be known) display some grammatical
analogies to the same stock. The extent of this relation has not yet been

explored.
More important in an historical point of view than any of these doubtful

matters is the question, what relations   exist between the         ancient     Egyptian
language and the Syro-Arabian. This       difficult problem                   leave to be

    The four great families of  languages, of which
principal ramifications, divide, as 1 have before said, between them nearly
the whole extent of the Great Continent, with the exception of those parts of
Africa which lie between the Tropic and the Equator and to the southward
of that line. The vast and unexplored region of Central Africa or Negro-

land stretches, like a broad' belt, from east to west across the whole continent
in the region of its greatest breadth. This region is supposed to be occupied
by immense chains of mountains, among which the Jebel Kumra or Moun
tains of the Moon have been famous in all times. To the westward of these,

the mountains which support the table-land of Senegambia and the chain of
the Kong mountains, running parallel to the coast of Guinea, are great eth

nological lines of demarcation. But the greatest boundary between the nations
of Africa is produced by a line running across the whole continent from the
mouth of the river Juba to the inmost corner of the Bight of Benin. This
cuts off the comparatively narrow portion of Africa from the broader region.
The great families of nations who inhabit Africa are separated by this line :

those to the northward are distinct from the southern races. Between these

languages of Africa has been prepared by Dr. Latham.
It appears probable from the present state of our knowledge that only two
races of people and two languages exist in the vast regions of Southern
Africa. These are the Hottentot tribes in the most southern parts and the
great nation allied to the Kafirs of the eastern coast, who occupy, as it appears,
the whole space from the coast of the Atlantic to that of the Indian Ocean.
The Hottentots were in former times more extensively spread : the Kafirs
have encroached upon them. The Hottentots and the Bushmen, who call
themselves Quaequae and Saabs, are one race. It has been supposed that
                   originally from Western Africa, where there is still a tribe
"thQeyuaqcauma.e"     And the description of the Kumri, the aboriginal people                                 named
                                                                                                              of the

country on the Joliba, who have long ago been driven into mountainous
parts by the more civilized people of the plains, is calculated to remind us of

the Hottentots ; but this is merely a conjecture that may afford a suggestion
for inquiry ; for the other great South African race we very much want a
name. The Kafirs are but a small section of them, and the other tribes differ

so much from the typical character of the Kafirs, that it seems incongruous
Ito give them the same appellation. Many of them are Negro races, very
strongly marked as such.               shdaislclotveerrmed,the"mthperoHviyspioontraollpyi,caalndraucnetiloaf  proper

haps to an equal extent on both sides of that line. To this family belong, --
1. The Kafirs near the Cape, or the Amakosah, the Amazulah, Bechuanas,
and all the warlike nomadic tribes who have lately made inroads on the co

lonized country in the south-east. 2. All the tribes termed Mozambique
Negroes. 3. The Suaheli, a people of the sea-coast as far northward as
Mombas and Ajan, who are perfectly black and woolly-haired, but not so

decidedly of the Negro type. 4. All the nations of Kongo, Angola, and
Loango, long ago described by Portuguese writers.
The identity of these nations, or the fact that they belong to one family, has
now been fully established. We have sufficient information respecting their
languages to be enabled to affirm that they are all dialects of one speech in
a strict sense of the term, and this fact                                     of no other

table-land of Senegambia and its declivities, have spread their colonies far
and near; the former through all the maritime region adjacent to the great
rivers, the latter far into the interior of Africa, where they have founded the
Felatah States. These nations are almost as superior to the other tribes of
Intertropical Africa, as were the Aztecas and the Peruvians to the various
races of the New World. From the information received from various tra
vellers, I am strongly inclined to believe that these two nations are much
more nearly allied than they are generally supposed to be. That they are
genuine African nations I have no doubt ; they form an intermediate class of
people between the degraded races of Guinea and tribes of an Asiatic type,
and the varieties of their physical character fill up all the gradations from one
form and character to the other. The comparison of these languages is a
subject of great interest, and it is much to be regretted that we yet want ma
terials that may enable us to become acquainted with the Fulah language.
The people, who are Moslirns, are more difficult of access than the Pagan

tribes.

   The languages of the great inland region of Sfidan were divided by Leo
Africanus into two or three great families. Later information has confirmed
the veracity of that early traveller, whose statements would lead us to suppose
that the races of people speaking languages entirely different from each other
are much less numerous iu the interior of Africa than has been commonly

supposed.

   It now remains for me to take a rapid survey of the progress of ethnology,
as founded on an examination of languages, in Oceanica and America.
   The publication of the great work of Baron William von Humboldt on the

Kavi speech, forms an era in the history of the languages of the Oceanic
nations. Besides much other valuable information, it has afforded the im

portant result that the resemblances known to exist between the nations of
the islands in the Pacific Ocean termed Polynesian, and the tribes of the In

dian Archipelago, Malacca and Madagascar, are not, as some persons have
thought, the effect of casual intercourse, but are essential affinities, deeply
rooted in the construction of these languages. For the profffs of this asser
tion, and of the ultimate fact in ethnology which rests upon
                                       I                                      viz. that the

races of people are themselves of one origin, must refer to M. de Humboldt's
Work. The Papua languages, or those spoken by the black and woolly-
haired nations, are for the most part as yet unexplored. One observation to
be made respecting them is, that the dialects of Papuan races often partake
more or less of the Polynesian. WThether this arises from the adoption by the
Papuas of the Polynesian vocabulary has not been determined, though most
                                                              however now well known that
persons incline to this last opinion.

islanders, for example, properly a dialect of the Polynesian language.
The languages of America present wide field of philological inquiry,
which has been explored of late years with great success by several excellent
writers of the United States, and the names of Du Ponceau, Pickering, and
Gallatin, will ever be reckoned among those of the greatest contributors to

ethnological science.  must be observed however that Baron Alexander

von Humboldt and Professor Vater of Kbnigsberg first led the way. The
posthumous work of William von Humboldt on the languages of America,
which M. Buschmanu has been many years preparing for publication, has

not yet made its appearance. We have reason to expect from                it    great ad

    Two great facts may be considered as ascertained in the history of the
American idioms ; the first is that they all belong to one system of lan
guages with reference to organic construction. This analogy is by no means
accounted for by the explanation proposed, that it is merely a result of a
particular stage of mental culture prevalent among all the nations of America.
Many nations in the Old World have passed through the same stage of
social developement, indeed through all its stages ; but there are no languages in
the Old Continent, as far as we know, which have the same laws of construc
tion as the American languages. Nor is it true as matter of fact that the
nations of America were in the same stage of mental culture : there was a
great difference between the Mexicans, for example, and the Esquimaux ;
yet the idioms of both these races belong to what has been termed the Poly-

synthetic class of languages. The analogy indeed between these numerous
languages is too particular, and depending on what may be termed arbitrary
arrangements, to be explained by referring it to any circumstances in the

moral condition of the people. It must be the effect of communication, or

rather of origination from a common source ; and perhaps we may hence be
justified in concluding that all the tribes of America, from the Arctic Sea to
the Magellanic Islands, are the offspring of one stock, or the subdivisions of

oneAosreigcoinnadl   nation.                          that in America, as elsewhere, we find few great

bordering on the coast of the Pacific, there are many nations speaking lan
guages which in the present state of our knowledge must be considered as
distinct from each other. There are some families of nations or stems

branching out into many ramifications, with whom we have obtained ac
quaintance through the medium of the Russian colony, and partly by the
information collected by Professor Scouler at Nootka Sound and on the Co
lumbia River. Some of the languages spoken by these nations display ana
logies both to the idiom of the Esquimaux and to that of the Aztecs in Mexico.
The resemblance is scarcely such as to justify our joining them to either of

these stems, though it is greater than we can satisfactorily explain by reference
to accidental intercourse.

ginal idiom, and to the Aztec, which was of later introduction. The Aztec,
as it is universally known, was the idiom of that race which first entered
Anahuac under the name of Toltecas about 1200 years ago. The history of
the Toltecs and their conquests is the beginning of the archaeology of Ame
rica, and it has been in some measure confirmed by the discovery of the
fact, that the aboriginal Mayan idiom is spoken still in different districts
both to the northward of Mexico and far to the southward, as in Guatemala

and Yucatan. The Mayan race is partially civilized, and perhaps not in
ferior to the Aztecan. It is supposed that they were the builders of those
splendid temples and great cities which have astonished travellers of recent

times.

   The languages of South America are very multitudinous, and they are not
yet sufficiently known to furnish the groundwork of an extensive classification
of all the idioms and nations of the continent. The following attempt at a
distribution of the principal races is founded partly on physical and geogra

phical relations.                                                               This class Com

celebrated race to which the Quichua language and the royal caste of Incas

belonged, several distinct nations, as the Aymaras, who were formerly very

powerful. A second branch are the Antisian nations, or the white races of
the Eastern Andes. After these are the nations of the Chilian Cordillera, who
form a great family, including the warlike Araucanos, and allied, as it ap
pears from the notices we collect of their languages, to the native tribes of

Tierra del Fuego. It seems to have been the opinion of Molina, who was
well-acquainted with the races of people in these countries, that the Puelche,

or the people of the eastern coast, including the Patagonians, belong to the

same stock, and that the southern plains, or Pampas, and the whole region
beyond the Rio de la Plata, was peopled by tribes who descended from the

Chilian Andes.

extensively spread and are associated by their languages. The race of the
Tupi, who are the chief inhabitants of Brazil, is allied to the Guarani, spread
extensively in Paraguay and to the Oraagua and many kindred nations on

the higher parts of the river of Amazons. On the northern coast, the great

languages are known to be common to several tribes. They are distinguished
by their physical characters from the races comprised in the other divisions,
as are the latter from each other. The herculean tribes of the great plain of
Chaco, and the equestrian Abipones, are of much greater stature than the
diminutive Guarani, and they have not the retreating forehead and the ob

liquely-placed eyes which give to the Eastern tribes a certain resemblance to
the Kalmuks and the Chinese. The complexion of many of the Midland

races is a dark bronze colour, while that of the Guarani and the Caribbees

and other eastern tribes is a light copper colour, approaching in some in

stances to white.
   Of the languages of the Midland tribes we have little information. Those
of the Eastern nations of South America have been carefully enumerated
and exemplified by vocabularies by Gilii and Hervas.

         1847, by

I have begun to lay before the public in the first two volumes of my

·Egypt' the facts which the discovery of hieroglyphics has enabled us to
establish as to the language, writing and mythology of the primitive Egyp
tians. 1 have attempted to explain them as the three documents or forma
tions of those periods which precede the historical age, or the beginning of
the chronological history of Egypt under Menes.

   In the first volume I have endeavoured in particular to show, how it is

possible and necessary to treat the forms and roots of a language as an his
torical monument, exhibiting a series of mental developments, which, al
though it cannot be measured accurately as to time, constitutes a certain
succession of facts, and thus marks the epochs of the primeval life of a

people. In carrying out this plan, I have attempted to represent, in a way

intelligible to every general scholar, all the facts of Egyptian grammar, viz.
all the forms, formative words and inflexions of the language in their natural
order and connexion ; and secondly, to collect the Egyptian roots which can
be proved to have formed the heir-loom of that nation, as they occur in
monuments not more recent than the time of Moses, and in great part ante

rior to hiin by a thousand years and more. It is impossible to look on those
forms and on these roots with even a superficial knowledge of the Semitic

and Indo-Germanic languages, and not to perceive that the Egyptian lan
guage is no more a Hebrew than a Sanscrit dialect, but that it possesses an
affinity with each of them, such as compels us to ask the question, whether
it is a more ancient formation than either or no?

This question becomes the more interesting and important, when it must

be considered as demonstrated, that such an affinity cannot be explained by
mere internal analogy ; that, on the contrary, it is historical in the strictest

sense of the word, viz. physical or original. I mean that the affinity alluded
to cannot rationally be explained by a real or supposed general analogy of lan
guages, as the expressions of human thought and feeling, nor by the later in
fluence of other nations and tongues. Now the Egyptian name of Egypt is
Chemi, the land of Cham, which in Egyptian means black. Can we then have
really found in Egypt the scientific and historical meaning of Chain as one
of the tripartite divisions of post-diluvian humanity ? The Egyptian lan
guage attests an unity of blood with the great Aramaic tribes of Asia, whose
languages have been comprised by scholars under the general expression of                           '
Semitic, or the languages of the family of Shem. It is equally connected by
identity of origin with those still more numerous and illustrious tribes which
Ioccupy now the greatest part of Europe, and may perhaps, alone or with other
families, have a right to be called the family of Japhet.                   mean that great

family to which the Germanic nations belong, as well as the Greeks and Ro
mans, the Indians and Persians, the Slavonic and the Celtic tribes, and which
are now generally called by some the Indo-Germanic, by others the Indo-
European nations. The most ancient traditions of Europe certainly speak
of Japhet ; for Japetos  is,  according to the Greeks, the father of that great

Titan or benevolent man-god who brought the celestial fire to his suffering
brethren on earth, and was doomed for such daring to linger on the heights
of Caucasus until another divine hero should set him free, and reconcile him
to the younger gods, who govern the world of mankind.

from them : I mean, the assertion that the affinity of the Egyptian forms and
roots with those of the Semitic and Indo-Germanic languages is one which
can no more be explained by the general similarity, existing or supposed to
exist, between different languages, than that between German and Scandina
vian, between Greek and Roman, between Gothic and Sanscrit, which is dis

glory in belonging to a school which rejects altogether those etymological
dreams and conjectures, those loose comparisons of single words without
principle or analogy, and generally without any sufficient or critical know
ledge of the idioms, in short, that unscientific comparison of languages, or
rather of words caught at random, which made the etymologies of the seven

teenth century the laughing-stock of the eighteenth. By its very principle
the critical school admits of no claim to historical affinity between different

languages, unless this affinity be shown to rest upon definite laws, upon sub
stantial analogy, established by a complete examination of the materials.

That school demands the strictest proof that those affinities are neither acci
dental nor merely ideal, but essential ; that they are not the work of extra

neous intrusion, but indigenous, as running through the whole original tex
ture of the languages compared, according to a traceable general rule of ana
logy. The very method of this critical school excludes the possibility of
accidental or mere ideal analogies being taken for proofs of a common

historical descent of different tribes and nations. It is on account of this
method, employed by Grimm, Bopp, Humboldt and other acknowledged

masters of that school, that I claim in this scientific assembly a place, and a

distinguished one, for linguistic ethnology as constituting a principal branch

allude, viz. that the Egyptian language betrays a strictly historical connexion
with Asia, or, to speak more precisely, with the Semitic and Iranian tribes,
is among those who have studied them according to the principles of the
critical school of comparative philology, no longer an object of controversy,
although the origin and primeval source of that connexion may be explained
ultimately in very different ways, according to the different systems of the

philosophy of the history of mankind. I hope I have contributed something
towards making it easy for a general scholar to judge of those primeval facts
of Egyptian history, and to contemplate         as monuments of the primitive
art and science of mankind. Nor shall    them

tend to treat the great fact alluded to, as a part of the Origines of mankind.
Indeed it is for this object that I undertook the work. In the mean time,

having been called upon to lay before the British Association for the Advance
ment of Science a succinct statement of the general results of my Egyptian
researches as to the origin and history of language, with a particular refer

ence to Asiatic and African ethnology, I shall endeavour to indicate the ele
mentary parts of my system, and submit to your candid and scientific exami
nation some of the results which I believe we are enabled to deduce already
from the facts of Egyptology.

There offer at the very outset two entirely divergent systems for explain

ing the general fact alluded to. Either the Egyptian language is a primi
tive one, from which those Asiatic and European languages derive their
256 REPORT -- 1847-

origin ; or we must look in Asia for the origin of the people and language of
Egypt. But in that case we must ask again, to what branch of those Asiatic
languages does Egypt point? To the essentially fixed Semitic, or to the

Japhetic ? Was it the Hebrew or the Sanscrit from which the Egyptian lan

guage can be said to be derived, or was it their common germ ? and in that

case, how can such a state of language be scientifically characterized and
explained ? Egypt forms as it were the bridge between Africa and Asia.

There must be a certain relation, collateral or parental, between the Egyptian
language and some at least of the languages of Africa, analogous to that
physiological affinity which evidently places the skull and the whole physical
formation of the Egyptian man between the Caucasian and the thoroughly
African race. Therefore our immediate problem will necessarily resolve
itself, physiologically and historically, into the following great question : --

J* the Asiatic and European man a more favourably developed and per
fected Egyptian and African ? or is the Egyptian (and perhaps the African
man in general) a scion of the Asiatic stock, which gradually degenerated into

on my own attempts and speculations. I shall, on the contrary, endeavour to

prove, by way of introduction to the exposition of my particular method, that
ethnological science has arrived in the course of this century at results, if less
known in some parts of the world, certainly not less important, than those of
which any branch of science represented in this illustrious body can boast ;

of the creation, it seems right on the one side, that a historical inquiry into
his origin and development should never be allowed to sever itself from the
general body of natural science, and iu particular from physiology. But on

the other hand, if man is the apex of the creation, if he is the end to which
all organic formations tend from the very beginning ; if man is at once the
mystery and the key of natural science ; if that is the only view of natural
science worthy of our age, then ethnologic philology, once established on
principles as clear as the physiological are, is the highest branch of that sci

ence for the advancement of which this Association is instituted. It is not

an appendix to physiology or to anything else ; but its object is, on the con
trary, capable of becoming the end and goal of the labours and transactions
of a scientific association.

   A rapid sketch of the history of the philosophy of language, and of its
application to comparative ethnology, showing its scientific method and the
astonishing results at which it has already arrived, is sufficient to bear out this
assertion and to justify this claim.

  IWith such a rapid sketch think it right to open the course of the
Iinquiry to which wish to invite you. I believe that no philosophical
or historical problem ought to be approached by any one who does not know
what has been done before him for that purpose, and what are the problems
solved, or brought nearer to their solution. And here it seems to me to

make no difference, whether such researches have been instituted and such

results obtained in our own country or elsewhere ; for science knows no
difference of nations and countries, and acknowledges no pretence of pa
triotism as a cloak for ignorance or partiality. Its glory is in its universality
and independence ; and its only object ought to be truth.
    The lucid survey of the general ethnological results of comparative phi

lology which we have been favoured with this day by Dr. Prichard, will
justify me in restricting my historical sketch to the two points of immediate
importance for the object of this lecture. These leading points are the phi
losophical principles of language, and the results obtained by their application
to the great problem before us, which is no less than the classification of the
principal families of nations according to their languages, as the safest and
most ancient evidence of their origin, and as the groundwork for a real history
of the intellectual  development and civilization of
                      therefore this historical sketch  mankind.                                     researches

with a short indication of the conclusions which they allow us, in my opinion,
to draw from the philological results already obtained, for the general history
of the human mind, and for the connexion and relative place of the leading
families of mankind in the different epochs of their development.

Leading points in the History of the Philosophy of Language, and of its
                           results for General Ethnology.

    Plato in his 'Cratylus,' and Aristotle in his 'Organon,' have laid the founda
tions of the philosophy of language. The speculations of the first bear, when
well understood, upon the highest problems of the philosophy of language;
the categories and definitions of the second give the log" ical foundations of
                                                                                                     s

our grammatical system, and establish by themselves the great principle, that
language is the immediate produce and expression, as it were the mirror
of logic and thought. In the speculations of both we see the entire want of
an abstract knowledge of the etymological rules of their own language,
and still more of a system, or even a tendency, to compare the Greek tongue
with those of the barbarians. Nor did the later philosophers and philolo-
gers of Greece and Home follow such a course. The Stoics gave, indeed,
the first theory of the Greek verb ; and Apollonius Dyscolus and other acute
and learned members of the Alexandrian Academy erected that fabric of
grammatical definitions and terms, which, brought nearer to us by Varro

and the later Latin grammarians (of whom Priscian and Donatus are
known by name to our schoolboys), has formed down to the present century
exclusively, and forms to a certain degree even now, the basis of our gram
matical system. The deficiency of the lexicographic inquiries and specula

tions of the ancients is proverbial, and constitutes an important fact in the
history of the human mind. Their absurd etymologies are the most striking
proof of the impossibility of man to become conscious of his peculiarities,
except by contrast and comparison with those of others. They prove more
over the incapacity of any nation to understand itself, without having realized,
understood and appreciated the idea of humanity, and the feeling of brother

Ifhood towards all mankind.

great men like Caesar speculated upon

languages.

   The genial and free philology of the fifteenth century, which on the one
hand prepared the way for the great Reformation of the sixteenth, gained, on
the other, by this most memorable event of modern history, an unrestrained
liberty of inquiry and the feeling of the sacredness of national tongues.

     thus opened the way to wider researches, at the same time that the

discoveries of the Spaniards and Portuguese laid new world open before
the awakening European mind. Antonio Pigfafetta, an Italian, collected
lists of words out of the tongues of the tribes aud nations through which he

had travelled.

But the only effective progress in linguistic philosophy and knowledge

which the sixteenth century made, was due to classical philology combined
with the study of Hebrew. The necessity of explaining the Old Testament
from its original language led to the study and comparison of Arabic,
                         only necessary to know the two great lumi
Syriac, and Aramaic and
naries of France, Joseph Scaliger and Bochart, to form an idea of the ex

tent and importance of the progress made in this field of science.
   On this foundation the seventeenth century attempted to build, as far as

its struggles for religious and civil liberty would allow. But owing to the

overwhelming power of the political and ecclesiastical reaction in the greater
part of that century, all achieved in this field was cumbrous, uncritical

superstructure of lexicography. There was no philosophical principle in the
speculation of that century, nor any great historical problem to guide its

philology, which could have led either towards physiological or philological

discoveries concerning the tribes and languages of mankind.
The mighty genius of Bacon was indeed aware of the importance and
mysterious nature of language. The first chapter of the sixth book ' De
Augmentis Scientiarum,' contains ample proofs of both. He there enume
rates among the desiderata, as a portion of the doctrine De Organo Ser-
monis, a treatise, ' De Notis Rerum,' by which he means a philosophical
                              (ca/lisaoracalerepshilorseoaplehsi)cacl orgrreasmpomnadrin(gGrwaimthmathtiecamnumPbhei-r
catalogue    of real  signs
              words,
of radical            -- and

losophantem). There is enough for centuries in both these problems.
There is also much of wisdom implied in his general invaluable principles
of induction and analogy ; and it is to be regretted that these germs have
not hitherto been fully developed. But Bacon himself did nothing towards
that object with respect to language. He neither developed the principles
of grammar nor of the formation of words ; still less did he attempt a classi
fication of languages, or try to establish a method of inquiry into their nature

and origin.
Leibnitz is both the author of the comparative philosophy of language,
and the first successful classifier of the languages then known. His principal

object in the foundation of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin was, as his
memoir of 1710 proves, to ensure the progress of this philosophy and classi
fication of languages, and hereby to trace the genealogy of mankind. His
' Brevis designatio meditationum de originibus gentium, ductis potissimum
ex indicio linguarum*,' and his letter to Tenzelf, form an epoch in the
history of our science. We may call the speculations, divinations and dis
coveries of Leibnitz in this respect prophetic, as one of the most illustrious

astronomers of Europe, now amongst us J, in his last scientific report, has
called Kant's speculations and suggestions published about the middle of the

last century (1755), as to the system of the celestial bodies, with reference
to the astronomical discoveries which adorn our age.
The great philosopher of Konigsberg himself, in laying the foundations
of his speculative philosophy of the mind, entered also into the nature of
language and the definition of a race, and occupied himself with the method
and importance of a comparative analysis of languages, partly in his philoso
phical works, partly in his preface to a Lithuanian grammar. About the

same time, Albrecht Haller at Giittingeu founded modern physiology, with
that special application to the races of mankind subsequently developed by
Blumenbach. John Harris (1751), in his ' Hermes,' a book full of ingenious
reasoning and of learning, laid the foundation of grammatical philosophy.
Soon afterwards (1786) Home Tooke, his acute opponent, developed, amongst
doubtful speculative theories, some very pregnant views respecting the origin
of inflexions, suffixes, and formative words : a most important point for the
comparative analysis of languages. Home Tooke's researches in this re
spect are perhaps equalled for ingenuity only by those of Bilderdyk, the
Dutch poet and essayist, on the origin of the three grammatical genders.
But none of these three writers entered into the general subject of the clas
sification and comparison of languages. Nor does the elementary treatise of
the great Sylvestre de Sacy on universal grammar approach this problem.
It was only    in the first   years of
               ' (completed   by Vater  the   nineteenth century, that  Adelung's
' Mithridates                            in  1817) began to lay before  the world

   on a general plan as complete a review of all the languages of the globe as
   his materials allowed him to form. This careful compilation far surpasses
   all previous collections, like those of Hervaz (1785), and of William Mars-
   den (1796), not only by its completeness, but also by its method. Strange
   to say, Adelung seems not to have known Leibnitz's researches. But he
   follows out Leibnitz's plan. He not only gives for every language the tra
   ditional specimen of the Lord's Prayer, and more or less complete lists of

   words, with the most characteristic grammatical forms, wherever any exist

   and are known ; but he presents the languages themselves for the first time
   in a systematic order, and classifies them, to a certain degree, according to
   their affinities. In this classification he proceeds from the fundamental

   distinction of monosyllabic and polysyllabic languages, and acknowledges
   the claim of the first to a higher antiquity. Without adopting a theory, or
   establishing one of his own, respecting races and their origin, he attempts,
   and often successfully, to group together a vast number of cognate lan

   guages. These qualities, and a sober, rather bald, style of writing and

   composition, have procured Adelung's work a great authority in Europe. It
   comprises, moreover, in one of the later volumes, one of the most accurate
   specimens of linguistic analysis which we possess, in Wilhelm von Hum
   boldt's Essay on the Iberian or Basque language. Finally, it ought not to
   be forgotten, in this essay, and in this place, that the study and review of the
   ' Mithridates,' gave Dr. Young, as he himself said, the first idea of inquiring

   into the hieroglyphic system ; inquiries which have led to discoveries with
   out which our problem could not even be proposed, nor the question mooted,

   which we hope to answer.
      But judging the work by its bearings upon the definitive problem of lin
   guistic science, we must confess that Adelung was merely a linguist, and
   neither an accurate philologer nor a deep philosopher; and that Vater in
   the continuation has not shown himself much of either.           The results of

   their researches are therefore only elementary and provisional. Even as a
   compilation, the 'Mithridates' is already superannuated.
                                                                    Not only are its
   materials, in consequence of the copiousness of later discoveries and inqui
   ries, lamentably defective ; but the method of arranging and sifting those

   materials is entirely below the demands and necessities of the present state
   of science.

       Adelung's work was completed by Vater in 1817. But already two years
   after the publication of the first volume of the ' Mithridates,' which took

   place in 1806, a work appeared, small in extent, and on the whole only a
   Iswkoertckh, ,--bumt epaonsseFsrsieindgricahll
                                                   those properties which constitute an epoch-making
                                                   Schlegel's * Essay on the Language and Philosophy
   of the Hindoos (1808).' He fully established in it the decisive importance
   and precedence which grammatical forms ought to have over single words
   in proving the affinities of languages. He based this claim on the primeval
   and indestructible nature, and the unmistakeable evidence, of the grammatical
   system as to the original formative principles of language. By an applica
   tion of this method he triumphantly showed the intimate historical connexion
   between the Sanscrit, the Persian, the Greek, the Roman, and the Ger

   manic languages. Such a connexion had indeed been already observed by
   the active and elegant mind of Sir William Jones, but, unfortunately, with

   so little philological accuracy and philosophical clearness, that his remarks

   did not lead him or his friends and followers to any historical classification

   of languages. It is to the impulse given by Schlegel's work, that we are in
   debted in a high degree for the ideas on which the new linguistic school of
   Germany has proceeded. The value of its details has now quite ceased, since

of Indo-Germanic languages, as they were called, was gradually extended
to the Lithuanian, the Slavonic, and finally, by the combined and inde
pendent researches of Dr. Prichard, Bopp, and Dr. Meyer, to all the lan
guages of Celtic origin. Classical philology was not the last to benefit
by this great discovery : the grammatical forms and roots of Greek and
Latin began to be considered under this new light by eminent Greek and
Latin scholars. Such a combination of linguistic researches with true and
deep philology is of the highest importance for the success of ethnologic
researches. It is the only safeguard against unscientific intrusions into ethno
logy. Linguists, if only occupied with classifying languages, are easily led to
a very superficial comparison of incomplete and crude materials. The phi
lological treatment of such languages as have a literature and literary docu

ments of different periods, is best adapted to keep mere linguists in the path
of rational criticism, whenever they may be tempted to decide too rashly on
idioms of savages and unexplored tongues, known only by incomplete and un
digested vocabularies, or even only by accidental lists of some hundred words.
In the same manner, such a philological exercise of linguistic criticism is of the
greatest importance to the traveller who intends to communicate knowledge
respecting the languages of savage and illiterate tribes. George Rosen, the
worthy brother of the late lamented Professor of the London University Col
lege, and Richard Lepsius, were able to ask the natives of Caucasus and of

the Upper Nile many more questions than ordinary travellers, when learning
from the lips of the natives the Ossetic, the Nubian, and Meroitic languages.
Lepsius' analysis of these two collateral languages of the Egyptian will, it is
to be hoped, soon appear. Rosen's lately published grammar of the Ossetic
language may be cited as an excellent specimen of the result of such philo

logical inquiries on the spot.
This consideration will lead us to appreciate the immense importance of
the critical, philological, and historical treatment of one whole branch of the

Indo-Germanic languages, and that the branch most amply developed and
most richly stored with literary documents, as well as best known to our

selves-- I mean Jacob Grimm's Teutonic Grammar. In that astonishing
work a whole family of languages has for the first time found an expositor,
and as it were a historiographer, placed on the summit of the comparative lin
guistic analysis of our age. Grimm's researches and discoveries have there
fore exercised, and will long continue to exercise, a decisive influence on
all not merely superficial and elementary inquiries into the organic laws of
any given language. Grimm's Teutonic Grammar, comprehending the
Scandinavian as well as the German languages in all their ramifications, re
duces each of them to its most ancient forms, and follows it down from that
point through the whole course of its developments. It founds itself princi
pally on an almost uninterrupted series of documents through fifteen hundred
years of German literature, from Ulfilas to Goethe. By its method and its
results this colossal work forms not only an epoch in the history of Germanic
philology, but of ethnologic philology in general. For we have now a
standard, according to which every other research must be tested, and all
linguistic information measured, in order to judge of its approximation to
accuracy and completeness. Grimm has adopted many of the elements of
the grammatical theory which we owe to the scientific knowledge of the

Sanscrit language ; and he has shown throughout his work that precision and
critical accuracy which is the great pride of classical scholarship. But he
has also, in the analysis of that richest, best understood, and thriving family of
languages, employed terms and established principles which are more or less
applicable to all the languages of the Japhetic, Semitic, and Chaniitic tribes,

    Thus the desiderata of Bacon, and the general plan and fundamental views
of Leibnitz had been carried out, in the course of our century, to a con
siderable degree. By a rare combination of philosophical thought, of phi
lological accuracy, and of linguistic research, a method had been established
for analysing a given language and detecting its affinities with another of the
same family. By this process, in the Semitic, and still more so in the

Japhetic languages, the general observations of preceding philosophers on
the characteristics and the relative advantages or imperfections of the lan
guages of mankind had become entirely obsolete, being partly incomplete,

few irregularities occur, such as Sanskrit nakha (nail) and Lithuanian nagat, and not
nakas, as ought to be, according to the general law.
The Zend also ranges with the Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, only that according to its
euphonic laws tenues arc sometimes changed into aspirates by following letter, in which
cases coincides apparently with the Gothic.
In the languages above compared there occur irregularities as to the displacement of
sounds only in the middle and at the end of words. Thus the Latin pater, ought to be
Gothic fathrein (parents), and the Old High German vadar, instead of fadrein and valar.
Thus the Gothic fidvor, instead of fithvor (quatuor) Latin sopio, Gothic slepa. Old High
German tldfu, etc. Nor do the grammatical inflexions always submit to these laws. For
instance, the Latin habet, and Gothic habeith, in Old High German hapft, and not haped.

Human Language, and its Influence on the Intellectual Development of
Mankind.' Beginning with the simplest elements of speech, the illustrious

author gradually proceeds to the construction of sentence, as the expres

sion of intellect and thought. He then shows that the Chinese                                                         perfect
form in its kind. In examining, explaining, and comparing the different
                       different nations to render single words susceptible of
means used

signs, destined to mark their position in a sentence, he shows that all accom
plish this, more or less imperfectly, with the exception of the Sauscritic
family, in which he gives the prize to the language of the Hellenes. Thus

he brought at last irresistibly to the result, that the Chinese language
and the Sauscritic family represent the two extremes of all known formations
of speech. With respect to the Semitic languages, he considers them as
standing on the same line with the Sanscritic, in consequence of their de
cided tendency towards the system of inflexional forms other formations

of his work, he expresses his doubts whether there may not be radical con

markable instances even of grammatical affinities. Now such radical

affinity should be established,     clear that an immense step would have been
made towards proving that the languages of the great majority of mankind
have common origin. Humboldt therefore was far from denying such a
possibility. Under these circumstances we think safest to express the final

sound, and thoroughly digested materials, constitutes, in my opinion, the lasting
value of a work, which besides claims an eminent rank as the concentration

of the thoughts and researches of a man of excellent judgement and profound
learning, who had dedicated a great part of his active life partly to specula
tions on language in general, partly to a critical and detailed analysis of a
variety of tongues. As to its bearing upon the great historical problem before
us, although, as we have already observed, the author purposely refrains from
entering into the general question of the original unity or diversity of races
and languages, his work will nevertheless be found to point out the most

valuable landmarks for all who are bold enough to sail on this wide and dan
gerous ocean. Its researches belong to the Calculus sublimis of linguistic

theory. It places Wilhelm von Humboldt's name in universal comparative
ethnologic philology by the side of that of Leibnitz.

this rapid sketch without a particular mention of the two works which have
lately treated the question of races and languages in general, and which both
combine admirably the physiological with the ethnologic and historical ele

ments, I mean Dr. Prichard's ' Researches into the Physical History of Man
kind,' now complete before the world in five volumes (and already reproduced
in more than one translation), and the great work of our age, Alexander von

Humboldt's ' Kosmos.' It must be gratifying and encouraging to see how
an impartial appreciation of the physiological inquiries carried on from the
time of Camper and Blumenbach down to Cuvier and Johannes Muller, in

their combination with ethnologic philology and history, has led these two
eminent authors to conclusions, which, for the                      of
may be comprehended under the two following              purpose   --   our  investigation,
                                                          heads :
First, that although physiological inquiry by itself can never lead to any
conclusive result, still it decidedly inclines, on the whole, towards the theory
of the unity of the human race :
Secondly, that philological inquiry, as far as it has hitherto been conducted

in a scientific manner, rejecting therefore, on the one side, loose comparisons
of single words, and, on the other, hasty conclusions drawn from a few isolated

startling facts, tends more and more to the same result.
But philological inquiry has not been able to justify such a conclusion
scientifically. The last great philological work on the subject appears,
on the contrary, as we have just seen, rather as a warning against the problem
                                                         of our inquiry.

which I believe we are already enabled to draw from the radical affinities of

Egyptian researches upon comparative ethnologic philology in general.

Champollion established satisfactorily, and demonstrated by monuments
            Berlin
what the             Coptic  school of the last century had made more than highly
probable,   --the   general  identity of the old and modern Egyptian languages.

He proved the language of ancient Egypt to be a genuine organic structure,
and not a confused corruption and mixture, as some theologians had shown
a great tendency to assume. In exhibiting the system of ancient Egyptian
declensions and conjugations, and even of the syntax, he was not entirely un
2frf REPORT 1847-

aware of a certain difference between the old Egyptian and the Coptic forms.
Still his grammatical views and remarks on this latter point are very defective
and erroneous. Not being a master in that comparative philology in which
his illustrious countryman, Eugene Burnouf, has taken so eminent a part, by

the side of the first Iranian philologcrs of Germany, he was unable to observe,

still more to account for most of those differences. It was Lepsius, who, in his

I4 Letter to Rossellini (1837), pointed out the principle in which they originate.

       have since endeavoured to give a complete survey of the grammatical
    forms and roots of the ancient Egyptian, in the grammatical and lexical expo
    sition of the first book of my ' Egypt,' and to establish that those differences
are organic, and analogous to the gradual development of the system of
hieroglyphic writing. It was also Lepsius, who, in his most acute Essay 'On
the Egyptian Numerals,' first showed the deeply-rooted radical analogy which
the ancient roots of the language of Egypt bear on the one side to the Indo-
Germanic family, on the other to the Semitic. Dr. Meyer carried this
out more fully, by showing the undoubted affinity between Egyptian roots
and those of the Indo-Germanic family, including the Celtic; an affinity of
which Schwartze also had given occasional examples in his great work. This
author has also insisted upon the affinity with the Semitic, which in the
grammatical, and especially the pronominal part, is decidedly prevalent : a
point which has been more particularly developed by Benfey.
   The particular purpose of my studies in this field was to bring the results

of these discoveries to bear on the universal history of mankind, and on the
connexion of this history with the physiological affinity of the nations, which
have hitherto taken the lead in the civilization of the world. The con
clusions to which I
after I shall have   arrived in  pursuing this course will be better  understood,
                     presented                                        under three
                                 to you, as I now proceed to do,
heads, the historical facts established by the critical schools of the Indo-
Germanists, the Semitics, and lastly, by the Egyptologists.
   I. Eight, more or less extensive, historical families, or single nations have
been ascertained to constitute one great Asiatic-European stock, of which

even the remotest members speak original languages, more intimately con
nected with each other than with any third tongue, or family of tongues,
in the world. We shall call this stock here, for the present, the Japhetic, ac

cording to a terminology which we shall in the sequel find reason to enlarge

considerably.
   The Jirst great family of this stock are the Celts, once spread over

Asia Minor (Galatia), Spain, France, Belgium, Helvetia, a great part of
Germany, and throughout the British Isles : it is still in the Kymric (*>f
which the Bas Breton is a corrupted form), the language of Wales, and
in two cognate forms, the Gaelic and the Erse, the native tongue of the
Highlands of Scotland, and of the whole of Ireland. This family we con
sider as representing the most ancient formation of the whole stock.

   The second family is the Thracian or Ittyrian, once spread on the
Dnieper, the Hellespont, and in Asia Minor, in which countries it was fol
lowed, and partly supplanted, by the Pelasgian, or ante-historical formation
of the Hellenic. The languages of the Epirots and Macedonians belong to
this family : it is now represented by the Skipetarian, or the language of the

Albanians or Arnauts.

    The third is the Armenian, the language spoken during the historical age,
in the country which, according to the most ancient traditions of the Semites,
was the cradle of mankind, and again the primeval seat of man after the

deluge of Noah.
   The fourth formation we venture to call the Asiatic Iranian, or the
ON ETHNOLOGY.  267

Iranian stock as presented in Asia. Here we must establish two great sub
divisions. The one comprises the nations of Iran proper, or the Arian stock,
the languages of Media and Persia. Its most primitive representative is the
Zend. We designate by this name both the language of the most ancient
cuneiform inscriptions (or Persian inscriptions in Assyrian characters) of the
sixth and fifth century, and that of the ancient parts of the Zend-Avesta, or
the sacred books of the Parsis, as explained by Burnouf and Lassen. We take
the one as the latest specimen of the western dialect of the ancient Persian and
Median (for the two nations had one tongue), in its evanescent state, as a dead
language ; the other as an ancient specimen of its eastern dialect, preserved
for ages by tradition, and therefore not quite pure in its vocalism, but most
complete in its system of forms. The younger representatives of the Persian
languages are the Pehlevi (the language of the Sassanians), and the Pazend,
the mother of the present, or modern Persian tongue, which is represented
in its purity by Ferdusi, about the year 1000. The Pushtu, or language of
the Afgans, belongs to the same branch. The second subdivision embraces
the Iranian languages of India, represented by the Sanscrit and its daughters.
Which of the languages of Hindustan belong to the Arian stock, and which
to the Indian family of languages prevalent before the Iranian immigration,
is a disputed point, which we hope will be brought nearer to a settlement
by Dr. Miiller's lecture this day.

    The fifth family is the Helknico-Italic, or the Greek and Roman, and all
the Italic languages, with the doubtful exception of the Etruscan, which at

all events was a mixed language, having a Pelasgic groundwork, with a great
barbarian admixture. Under Italic tongues we understand the languages of
Italy proper, south of the Apennines, and of the Italic isles.

    The sixth family is that of the Slavonic nations in their two great
branches ; the eastern, comprising the Old Slavonic of the Bible and of
Nestor, the Russian, Servian, Croatic, and Wendic ; and the western, the
languages of the Tschechs (Bohemians), Slovaks, Poles, and Serbians,
once prevalent in the north of Germany, and now spoken from the Adriatic
to the Dnieper. In the ancient world, this great, powerful and much-divided
family is represented by the Sauromatce of the Greeks, or the Sarmatm of the
Romans, a nation living on the Don and near the Caspian Sea. For the state
ment of Herodotus that they spoke a faulty Scythian, may as well be under
stood in the sense in which the English may be said to speak a bad French,
as in that in which one might say, the French speak an incorrect Franconian
German. The first interpretation is, according to the testimonies of other
ancient writers respecting the physiognomy of the Sarmatae, the only admis
sible one. Those tribes which Herodotus knew, spoke their language mixed
with that of the Scythians, which does not prove that the rest did.

    The seventh, nearly allied to this and the next family, that of the Lithuanian
tribes, among which the ancient Prussian represents the most perfect form,
is in some points nearer to the Sanscrit than any other existing tongue.

    Finally, last not least, the Teutonic nations in their two branches, the
Scandinavian and the German. The first has preserved its most ancient
form in the Icelandic ; the Swedish and Danish are the modern daughters of
the Old Norse language of Scandinavia. The second is the German, now
the language of the whole of Germany, and almost the whole of Switzerland.
Its northern or Saxon form has received a peculiar individuality in the
Flemish and Dutch tongues, and, by the emigrations of the fifth century of
our era, has become, mixed with French words since the Norman Conquest,
the prevalent and leading language of the British Isles, and is becoming
now, by the still continuing emigrations since the seventeenth century, that of
268 REPORT -- 184/.

the northern continent of America. The southern German tribes have suc
cessively formed, with a greater or less infusion of words into the Latin
groundwork, the Italian, French and Spanish languages.

  II. The following nations form another compact mass, and represent

one physiologically and historically connected family ; the Hebrews, with
the other tribes of Canaan or Palestine, inclusive of the Phoenicians, who
spread their language, through their colonization, as that of the Carthagi
nians; the Aramaic tribes, or the historical nations of Aram, Syria, Mesopo

tamia and Babylonia, speaking Syrian in the west, and the so-called Chaldaic
in the east ; finally, the Arabians, whose language is connected (through the
Himyaritic) with the JEthiopic, the ancient (now the sacred) language of
Abyssinia. We shall call this second family, by the name now generally
                                   Hebrew scholars, the
adoIpIIt.ed    among German        the ancient Egyptians  Semitic.               organic  struc
             The language of                              has an equally

ture, but much less developed than those two families, and is connected in

its roots and grammatical forms both with the Japhetic and the Semitic stock.
This phenomenon cannot be explained, except by the supposition that those
two great families were originally connected with each other. Is then, we

ask, the method employed to establish the affinity between the different

branches of each family sufficient to solve this ulterior problem? Or, if
not, which are the scientific elements of a new and higher method of solu

tion ? Before entering further into these questions, allow me to present to

you some ideas respecting the importance which these linguistic results seem
to me to have as illustrating and explaining the general course of the civili
zation of mankind.
   It is only necessary to reflect on the names of the nations constituting

the two great Asiatic families, in order to be convinced that these three

linguistic facts are not merely    interesting and                  important    in  the ordinary
view of etymological research      and antiquarian                   erudition.       have stated
                                                                                  I
them in the preface to my ' Egypt' somewhat in the following way. Uni
versal history, as far as it is the history of the human mind and of civilization
in what we call the historical age, is nothing but the history of those two
great families, the Japhetic and the Semitic, with an occasional influence
of Egypt and the Egyptians. But the Egyptian language, allied to both
families, not only represents the primeval history of Egypt, but is moreover
the only known historical monument of an earlier period of the human race,
and therefore (unless we would derive the Asiatic man from the valley of the
ONiflet)hitsheperreiocodr,dthoufs  the language   and civilization  of primitive Central Asia.
                                    recorded, we   shall here say   nothing more. Nor shall

we here develope the idea that Egypt's ancient history itself represents the

middle ages of the most ancient world. But if we look into the later, or so-
called historical age, into what may be termed, from a large point of view, the
modern history of mankind, the principal parts of the great drama of human

advancement are, in the three great acts which are before us, distributed in
tne following manner ethnologically. In the first, we meet on the one side
with the Bactrians and Medians, the Indians and Persians ; on the other hand,

with the Babylonians, and probably the Assyrians, the Jews and Phoenicians.
For on the very border of the ante-historical age, we find, according to
Genesis and Berosus, on the one side in the East, the Bactrian, the oldest

Iranian state, on the other, the first great western empire of Asia (and in
deed of the world) of which we have any historical tradition, namely,
the Babylonian, or the kingdom of Babel (Babiru) on the Euphrates. The
primitive masters of the Babylonian empire in the primeval period at a later
epoch spoke most probably the language of the undivided stock, preserved
                        ON ETHNOLOGY.                                                                            269

to us by the Egyptian, and the most ancient form of the already indi
vidualized Semitic. But even the language of the primitive empire of
Babylon must have inclined to the Semitic idiom. As to that of Bactria, if

Iits list of kings, preserved by the Armenian Eusebius, deserves, as believe

it does, serious consideration, all its traditions were in decidedly Iranian
tongues. As the one may therefore be called the mother of Hebrew, the
other must have been either the mother of Zend and its colonial scion, Sans
krit, or the most ancient form of that very language.

    The neighbouring metropolis of Assyria, Nineveh, belongs, as its name
proves, to the historical age ; for admitting that Ninus, according to all credible
accounts of the historians, cannot be placed higher than the thirteenth century
before our era, the restored chronology and the history of Egypt afford us
a new proof of this fact. Geographically it must appear highly probable
that the Assyrians, the men of Old Kurdistan, having Nineveh as their later
southern metropolis, spoke a Semitic language : even the apparent affinity of
the names of Assyria and Syria seems to lead to this assumption. But it must
be candidly confessed, that hitherto we have no positive proof of it. Assyria,
as regards its most essential and primitive region, is represented by modern
Kurdistan ; and the Kurds speak an Iranian language. So do the Armenians,
their northern neighbours, whose historical traditions reach very far back.
Indeed there is no proof of a Semitic language on the left bank of the
Tigris. But on the other side, the cuneiform alphabet, the characters of
which are called by the ancients Assyrian, is undoubtedly not constructed for
an Iranian language. Moreover, Assur is in the Mosaic table of Semitic
origin, posterior to the Babylonian empire ; and Assur seems to point to
Assyria.
   In the second act of the modern history of mankind, we find, on the

Japhetic side, the principal parts of civilization entrusted to the Hellenic
and Italic nations ; the Jews again, with the Carthaginians, representing the
Semitic on the other. Finally, in the third act, now still on the scene of
the world, we have as the leaders, the Scandinavian, the Germanic, and the

Slavonic nations : but here also a powerful admixture of the Semitic ele

nations. Of the two first known empires of the world, the more powerful and

influential seems to have been that which,  if     did not speak the most ancient

the course of ages migrated west and south from the primitive common seat
of the civilizing stock in Central Asia, with an unceasing tendency towards
Egypt. In the historical age of the world the power passes rapidly and
irresistibly to Japhet. The great continuous stream of human civilization
runs, since that time, clearly in a Japhetic bed ; whereas Sheni takes the
most prominent part in the religious development of mankind. The three
cognate religions which govern the world are Semitic, based upon Semitic

records, and founded and propagated by Semites. But conscious specula

dawns among the Iranians, and bursts the fetters of Islamism in the Sufism
of Persia. It is to the sons of Japhet that the beautiful was revealed.
Before the Hellens received that revelation in its fulness, before the forms of
the images of the gods were beheld by the reproducing artist, architecture,
sculpture and painting had their temples in Iranian Asia. Sesostris of the
old empire must have borrowed from Japhetic inventors, as Solomon and
Hiram did. In poetry, the Semite excels in the lyric : his feeling of na
tionality, weakened by the prevalence of tribe-feelings, is not sufficiently

wide and vivid to produce epic poems, or narrative poetical representations
of national destinies. Finally, the drama, or the combination of the lyric
and epic elements, and the complete representation of the eternal laws of

human destiny in political society, is entirely unknown to the Semite. It
is exclusively the creation of the Hellenic mind, feebly imitated by the
Roman, reproduced with originality by the genius of the Germanic race.
Nor is Iranian India entirely wanting in this last of the three species of
poetical composition. The 'Song of Solomon' shows how mar the He
brew mind was in its zenith to the dramatic form, without being able to

go beyond the lyric. Thus everywhere the Semitic and the Japhetic mind

assist and complete each other ; but the Japhetic formation is nationally

always the higher. Individually the power of a great individuality is higher

among the Semites than among the Japhetites. Throughout history the
Semitic nations act, as it were, the great episodes in universal history by
temporary reconquests of the land of the Japhetites, and by opposing pro
found thought and religion, inspiration as well as cunning, to the more com
prehensive genius, in science, politics and war, of the sons of Japhet. But
what they do is prominently the embodied thought and continued impulse of
one great hero. The only great empire which the Semites founded in the
historical age (omitting the Assyrian as not yet explored), that of the Arabs,
was solely formed by the impulse of Mohammed, and under the influence of
religious fanaticism. It fell to pieces when that impulse and that excitement
faded away. Christianity is of Semitic origin ; but it was stamped as the
general religion of the world, and as the organ of civilization, by uniting
in its cradle the Semitic and Japhetic element. First preached by Jews, it
was carried over the world by the sons of Greece and Rome. Language and
civilization, physiology and philology, go hand in hand to illustrate the fact,
that Shem and Japhet can no more coalesce into one without splitting, than

be kept asunder without exercising upon each other a strong and animating

influence.

   The distinction between the Semitic and Japhetic tribes is deeply marked
no doubt in their language and in their general history. Still, it requires
but a glance over the American idioms, not to speak of the Chinese, to
become aware of the fact, that the internal affinity of the languages of

Shem and Japhet is not founded upon any general similarity in the con
struction of human speech. Physiology supplies no distinctions between the

two, which are not found between the different families of either stock ; and

Wilhelm von Humboldt, in his universal view of languages, considers both
families as by character one. According to him, the Semitic tends to what
the Japhetic accomplishes. Even before him, many inquiring minds, some

recent Egyptian discoveries. But without being aware of the importance of
these Egyptian researches, men of scientific character in our time, unwilling
to bow under the yoke of the two critical schools of the isolating system,
the Sanscrit and the Hebrew, tried to establish the radical affinity between
the two great families. And, indeed, if the Japhetic and Semitic nations
are of the same stock, and if it cannot be denied that there exists an affinity
between many of the roots of their languages, why should we not try to
find out a method for ascertaining whether, in spite of the difference of
the grammatical system, they are not united radically ? It is true that such
an affinity had been rather assumed than proved ; and it must not be for

gotten that the proof had been attempted by entirely discredited and un
scientific methods. But ought the reaction against such assumptions and
proceedings to prevent us from instituting more scientific researches ?
The ruling critical school, reducing everything to, and deducing every
thing from, Sanscrit, turned a deaf ear to such questions, even after the old
Egyptian language had become accessible to every scholar. The heads of
the critical Hebrew school, Gesenius and Ewald, had thrown out a hint that,

by the reduction of the triliteral Hebrew roots to biliteral ones (proposed

already in the seventeenth century), we may find much reason to suspect a ra
dical affinity between Hebrew and Sanscrit. Klaproth had pronounced, without
reserve, that it was so, and attempted a proof in the rarest of all linguistic
books (1828)*. Ewald, without controverting the assertion, observed, with
his usual acuteness, that such etymologies must go beyond the historical
age of Semitic forms ; au observation in which Humboldt entirely concurs-)-,

but which evidently does not settle the question. It was only in 1 838 and
1840 that two masters of the Hebrew tongue (themselves native Jews),
Fiirst in Leipzig, and in particular Delitzsch in Halle, endeavoured to break
entirely down the wall of partition. Delitzsch acknowledges fully the rules
laid down, and the method observed, by the Indo-Germanic scholars : he
rejects as strongly as they the former irregular and unscientific method of
etymological comparisons ; but he maintains and exemplifies the constant
and undeniable analogy between the Indo-Germanic and Semitic roots,
and thus establishes fully the claims to a further investigation upon a more

extended plan.

   Rodiger, the successor of Gesenius at Halle, was led by his own researches
concerning the most ancient Arabic forms to similar conclusions. Perhaps
he or Delitzsch would even have been led to the establishment of a new and
higher principle of investigation, if the great facts which Egyptian phi

lology at that period had already revealed, by Champollion's grammar, to
those who were willing to learn, had not been so strangely overlooked by all
German scholars. Egypt is the connecting link between both ; and the
method of investigation, which the peculiar nature of the Egyptian lan
guage demands in order to be understood, cannot but be intimately
connected with that which seems requisite to establish the historical con

nexion between the Semitic and Japhetic languages, by a new and more

profound investigation of their differences as well as of their similarity. The

rigid Indo-Germanic school has assumed, but never even attempted to prove,
that we must reject all proofs of historical affinity not resting upon the iden
tity of inflexions                                    agree with    that   school  in
maintaining, that   and formative words. Now we        of language                 so
                    analogies in the musical element                  (if  I may
call whatever belongs to the peculiarities of intonation, and the greater or
less prevalence of one or the other class of sounds) are in themselves as incon
clusive reasons for establishing a connexion in kind, as the varieties of colour,

the form of leaves, smell, and similar properties are for constituting different
species among plants, or as analogies in the colour of hair or of feathers for
denying the identity of species among animals. Hut I can see no ground for
the assumption that, where identity or affinity fails in the grammatical forms
and their expression, there can be no radical affinity of languages. For it is

on this narrow principle that those isolating systems are designedly or un
consciously founded. Now we ask (anticipating what we hope soon fully to

establish), what are (according to their own assumption or admission) the
syllables or words of inflexions but remnants of some of the substantial roots
or words (nouns and verbs), once taken out of the then common stock of in
tegral words, and by a conventional act stamped to be pronouns, prepositions
or other particles, which gradually dwindled into inflexional forms? We
ask further, this being the case, is it not on the contrary probable, that, as

some families are allied both by decayed and living roots, others may be
allied by living ones only, the contemporaries of those roots which after
wards became forms and consequently decayed ? Should not an agreement in
the roots of nouns and verbs be as good evidence of a more remote, but still

original connexion and consanguinity , as the agreement in inflexions is allowed
to be for the nearest relation between them? Languages related by iden
tity of forms (viz. by roots, once consecrated for grammatical purposes and
then decayed) cannot exist at all without an identity or analogy of living

roots. Persons related by a common father must have a common grand
father. There can be no identity of grammaticized and therefore defunct
roots, without an historical connexion of the same languages in verbs and

nouns and their derivatives. But a general affinity in the roots proves a

common origin and a common history anterior to that point in the develop
ment of a language at which the grammatical forms took their origin ; there

fore a more remote one. We lay it down as a demonstrated and incon
testable fact, that a near affinity between languages is impossible without
an identity of structure in the inflexions and the formative words or sylla
bles in general. We have, by a combination of research and philosophical
study, established a method to investigate this nearest affinity of families.
But why should we despair of finding also a strictly scientific method for
investigating a more remote affinity by a comparison of the roots of their
substantial words? You have hitherto studied the natural history of the
most grammatical (and therefore, I believe, youngest) languages : you have
thus found    a method     for understanding the latest          in the   formation,
representing   therefore,                                  part   in the  history of
                           I suppose, the most recent    period
human speech. Of course this method will not carry you further; and that

is the reason why you have always signally failed, whenever you have at
tempted to investigate languages beyond that narrow family-connexion, and
when you have attempted to establish an affinity between the Iranian stock,
and a formation anterior to that individual system of forms, as for instance

the Basque language. Still we cannot proceed further in comparative phi
lology, and therefore in ethnology, without investigating that problem. We

must therefore ask two questions: why should there not be an affinity in

remote) affinity traceable in languages beyond the inflexions, what, may
be asked, the method for such an investigation
                  is

      To this no answer  is    supplied by the Indo-Germanic school, any more

than by the Semitic disciples of the schools of Gesenius and Ewald. The

last-mentioned eminent scholar has enunciated profound principle, alreadya
adverted to, in asserting that the investigation of the undeniable affinity of
Sanscritic and Hebrew roots cannot be prosecuted without going beyond
these two languages. But he has not further pursued his own investigations*.
Some facts have been elicited by Delitzsch, but these establish no method of
investigation. And, as we have already indicated, the method, so successfully
applied by Bopp in the narrow family circle of the Indo-Germanic nations,

cannot be applied to any further research. The inflexions and formative
words in the other two families are exactly not the same as the Sanscritic
those of most or all of the remaining families of mankind still less. Now

not a logical error in itself, to attempt to prove the remote affinity of languages
by the same method as that of the nearest in kin Few of the philologers
of the critical school will deny, that inflexions and formative particles are the
remains of roots therefore time existed when those inflexions did not exist.
      That time, and the relation of languages before that epoch, cannot in con

sequence be investigated without methodical inquiry into the living roots
and their formation. The further we proceed, the more even the vestiges
of the Sanscritic inflexions will disappear.

   It seems to me to result from this preliminary view of the nature of lan
guages, that we must leave the strictly grammatical comparisons entirely out
of the question, as soon as we extend our researches beyond the nearest de
gree of affinity otherwise we must necessarily fail, and contradict ourselves.

in words as in forms. Lepsius has proved this in his Treatise on the Numerals,
and Dr. Meyer has clearly indicated the elements of the investigation of roots.
For myself, I have endeavoured during the last thirty years to establish and
carry out certain canons or general rules for conducting this and all further
linguistic investigations, and am persuaded that, by a continued combination of

inquiry and general reasoning, I have arrived at formulas, which are at least

extremely simple, and which every progress in my researches has confirmed.
They seem to me to flow from a general principle of successive and necessary
evolution, and to be illustrated by incontrovertible facts. I must reserve for
my Egyptian work the complete development of this system. In the present
treatise I shall confine myself to giving a sketch of the leading elementary
phenomena and principles, as far as it seems required for the solution of the

problem before us. If under the necessity of advancing more general asser
tions or assumptions, I shall endeavour to reduce them to their simplest form,

and to elucidate them by facts known or accessible to every general reader.

    Permit me therefore first to call your attention to some leading phenomena

in the development of language. I shall then, in the second place, endeavour to
establish philosophically the principle of development in language generally,
and the necessary stages of this development.  In the third place, I shall at

tempt to apply these phenomena and principles first to the question imme
diately connected with the Chamitic, Semitic and Japhetic researches, and
finally, to the general problem of classifying the great families of languages,
and of determining how far we are at present enabled to place all known
families in a line of successive development, and how far that series represents
members of a common

                                                     and decay.

   The origin of language is enveloped in deep mystery. It is only by a

patient investigation of facts, and by generalizing those facts as far as we
safely can, that we may hope to establish a fair test for a speculative view of
the general principles of its formation.

   For the investigation of facts concerning the gradual formation of a lan
guage, the extent of alterations it can undergo without losing the unity of
its existence, its individuality as it were, and the changes to which it can be
subjected in consequence of a violent crisis, the most natural method seems
to be to examine the origin and gradual formation of those languages where
the necessary facts are generally known, or at least most easily ascertainable.
These are the Romanic or Latinic, and the modern German and Scandinavian
languages. The former were formed out of decayed and decaying Latin. With
the exception of the Vlachic, or the language formed with an admixture of
Slavonic words, they are the tongues of the South of modern Europe. They
were formed out of the Latin in consequence of the settlement of one or
other of the advancing German tribes in romanized countries, inhabited, as
to the numerical majority of the inhabitants, by a Celtic population, which in
former ages had in some of them succeeded to an Iberian. This is the origin
of the Italian, the Provencal, the French, the Spanish and the Portuguese
languages ; the two latter have received since, through the ascendency of the
Moors, an admixture of Arabic.

    We have here clearly two great elements. The German tribes, who
destroyed the Iloman empire, were the instigating causes of the utter decay
                              ON ETHNOLOGY.            275

of the declining Roman language, the native tongue of Italy for ages, and
introduced into the other countries by military colonization. This language
had been adopted by the Celtic population imperfectly, but to such an extent
that they gradually forgot their own language, not being gifted with sufficient
formative capacity to master and incorporate the intruding element. The ener
getic and conquering German tribes did possess this capacity, and gradually
made the mixed Germano-Latin language the badge of their young nationality.

   The remodeling cause of the formation of those languages was therefore
Germanic. The element upon which it worked was the Latin tongue, re
presented by a decaying Roman nationality, which (with the exception of
Italy proper) had been engrafted in the South upon a Celtic, and in Vala-
chia upon a Slavonic population. The active movement of the Germanic
mind, operating upon the subject Roman population, dissolved, and as it
were burst the compact structure of the Latin tongue. Thus Germanic
words were first substituted for Latin, but only in respect to the nouns and
verbs. As for the particles and the degenerate inflexional forms, the old
ones were superseded by the substitution of periphrastic forms, derived how

ever from the Latin and not from the Germanic stem. Thus the words cis
and ultra (originally tils) disappeared. The Italian says, al di qua, al di la ;
the  French, au (en)  deld,   au (par) deld,   which gives, as the original form,
the  Latin words, ad          de qua (parte),  and de illo or per Mud de ilia. In
                      ill ml

the same way dorenavant replaces abhinc. To understand the origin of this
phrase we must reduce it to the barbaric periphrasis, de hora in ab ante.

The most palpable proof that conjunctions represent a whole sentence is the
Italian conciossiecosache instead of quamquam, literally, cum hoc sit causa
quod. The gradual decay and disappearance of the neuter gender in the
substantives may be traced in the popular dialect from the third century to
the year 1000 of our era, when the utmost confusion prevailed among the
ruins of the magnificent language of ancient Rome, and nowhere more than
in Rome itself and its neighbourhood.          The cases of the noun gave way to

declensions formed by two prepositions, ad and de, taken from the Latin stock,
and coalescing with the wreck of the pronoun ille, which became the article
of the Romanic languages, the first part in Italian, the second in French.
In the same way the Latin conjugation disappeared more or less under the
influence of a periphrastic formation, by the help of esse and habere ; thus
here also the elements were taken from the Latin stem, And it is worthy
of remark, that the Germanic nations had themselves as complete inflexional
declensions as the Latin ; they also possessed the article like the Greek ;
but their conjugation of the past and future tenses was decidedly defective,
and wa3 therefore necessarily supplied by the periphrastic use of the verbs
to be and to have. In both cases we see how the remodeling element in
fluenced the new formations from the Latin. Still the change which took
place was only indirectly effected by the Germans ; directly it was the work of
the Latin nations, mixed with those Germans who had destroyed the old world
of Greece and Rome, upon a language, the decay of which had followed the
decline and fall of the Empire. Thus the languages of southern Europe have
all Latin grammatical forms and particles, with a strong admixture of Ger
man words (besides the Celtic, and in Spain moreover the Arabic), nouns
and verbs introduced by the conquering race, which adopted the established

language, strengthened by literature and the liturgy.
We find absolutely the same phenomenon in the formation of the modern

Persian and the Turkish. Both formations were influenced by the language
and civilization of the leading Mahommedan nation, the Arabs. The gram
t2matical forms with the pronouns and other particles are from the original
276 REPORT 1847.

stock, Persian in the one, Turkish in the other. But the modern Persian has
one-half of Arabic words, and the elegant Turkish still more foreign elements,
Persian or Arabic.

    The mixture in the Romanic languages is between two tongues of the
same Iranian family ; that in the Persian is between an Iranian and a Semitic;
finally, that of the Turkish has besides the admixture of a third family, widely-
different from either.

    In all of them we find that the new tongue was created through what we
may call a secondary formation, having as substratum a decaying old lan
guage, which we may consider as the primary one. The secondary forma
tion discarded the ancient grammatical forms, and most of the particles ; but
it kept the radical part of the nouns and verbs, introducing from the new in
truding elements only substantial words. That portion of the words which
had no longer any definite or substantial, but only a formal or ideal significa
tion, disappeared almost entirely. The want was supplied by a new creative
act, which, operating upon a highly organized language, produced a great
decomposition of ancient forms.

    This was more especially the case with the Romanic languages. It was
quite otherwise with the Teutonic languages in Germany. The Germans
found there partly the Celtic, partly the Slavonic elements. But such was
the vitality of the formative process of the rising Germanic race upon the
sporadic old elements, that only single words entered from those languages ;
even from the Latin, the language of civilization and of Christianity, they took
only a few single nouns and still fewer verbs. A comparison of the Germanic
languages with the old Scandinavian and the Gothic, combined with a more
profound study of the Slavonic, and particularly of the Celtic, seems to be
the safest method of detecting their Slavonic and Celtic roots ; for the Scan
dinavian and Gothic are either entirely or in a great degree free from them.

    But all these roots have been prolific, having admitted all the German in
flexions, and lent themselves to derivations and compositions like the original
Teutonic roots. These foreign elements have not therefore exercised a dis
organising influence upon the German language. How then has the language
of Goethe grown out of that of Ulphila.*, by a development uninterrupted
since the year 600, and still so different from the old form, that no German
can, without a study like that of the classical languages, understand one line
of Ulphilas' translation of the Bible in 380, nor even is able without a certain
effort to comprehend (although that is a comparatively easy task) the national
epic, the Nibelungen, in its most modern text of 1200? Charlemagne could
not have understood one word ef the speech which his fiftieth successor on
the throne of the German empire made a thousand years after his corona
tion, that is to say, after the native tongue had passed through thirty-four
mothers. Many words of the ancient idiom are lost in the modern, and
the grammatical forms have been undergoing a continual process of reduc
tion. Instead of our present periphrastic conjugation of the passive, we
had in the Gothic, as in the Icelandic, an organic form. In like manner,
in the ancient idiom of the Francs, instead of our periphrastic mode of ex
pressing after the verbs of perception and thought, the compound object
(substantive and verb) by the particle that, we find the direct construction of
the accusative with the infinitive, or the still more intuitive Greek construc
tion through the participle. On the whole, the abstractions increase in the
process of the language In the same way, the roots and words (particularly
the verbs) receive more and more a less material, therefore freer, more in
tellectual or metaphorical sense ; and the original material signification dis
appears.

    The Hebrew began to become unintelligible to the Jews after the Babylo
nian Captivity, the Latin to the Italians after the settlement of the Germanic
tribes ; the Gothic itself became extinct by the destruction of their empires
and their mixture with other tribes and nations ; and the old Frank language
cannot be considered as its direct continuation : but the language of Otfried,
a thousand years ago, alphabetically fixed and possessing a literature like our
own, has become unintelligible for the last five centuries to the direct descend
ants of the Carlovingian race, without any intervening great catastrophe of the
nation,   or any violent and lasting intrusion of foreign elements.

The present German language has been fixed, after a very unsettled state,
by Luther's translation of the Bible, by the uninterrupted series of German
hymns since the Reformation, by the course of regular preaching, reading
and instructing in that same dialect, and finally by the modern literature of

Germany.
We seem therefore to be authorized to draw from the phenomena, observed

clusions  i:n--the  Romanic  as      the Germanic  languages,  the following con

    1 . Language changes by the very action of the national mind upon it ;
involving a process of filing down of roots, forms and inflexions, and producing
new derivative or compound words. There takes place through this same
agency an unceasing advance of words and expressions from substantiality
(or materialism) to formalism, or from the natural to the metaphorical, from

the physical to the intellectual, from the concrete to the abstract.
   2. An alphabet and literature fix a tongue as it were by a process of instan

taneous crystallization of the floating elements of the national consciousness
of language ; but they do not prevent the change of the spoken dialect. Lan

guages, artificially preserved in a fixed state (e.g. by religious institutions),
become obsolete and dead : so the Hebrew, the Zend, the Sanscrit, the old
Egyptian and Abyssinian. A new popular language is created gradually
by an under current, and national events make it a written and national

language.
   3. The formation of a new language always presupposes the decay of
another. Such new formations must be both hastened and greatly influenced
by the violent intrusion of a foreign element. This element cannot substi
tute a new grammar, unless it abolishes the language (as the Anglo-Saxon
did the Kymric); but it can produce &mixed language, the grammar of which
is of the native, the words, for the most part, of the foreign stem. The change
in the natural course is an organic development, the broken and mixed idiom
shows a less organic structure. The natural feeling and understanding of
words, as significative, becomes as it were dimmer, because the roots often

disappear, whereas derivations remain, and foreign words are introduced,

having none but a conventional signification. On the other hand, whenever
the organic movement of the language has been interrupted by an extraneous

element and great national catastrophes, the native elements in the mixed
language will often keep the ancient form, whereas the native stock, left to

its own natural development, will use up and loose it.

   Of this phenomenon the Germanic languages offer a most remarkable in
stance in the origin and development of the English tongue. By the Con
quest, the language of the Anglo-Saxon people was driven from the palace,

the legislation and the tribunals: gradually however the conquering Norman

minority adopted the language of the country : the Normans could not over
throw the Saxon foundation of England's idiom, as the Saxons had done that
of the Celto-British. Out of the struggle of the two idioms arose a mixed
278 REPORT -- 1847.

language like the modern Persian. But there is in the English a more or
ganic intermixture of the two elements than in the Persian, because the two
constituent parts were not so different from each other in origin and forma
tion as Arabic and Persian, or Semitic and Iranian. The Persian forms a
new verb by placing herden (to do), or a similar Persian verb, after an
Arabic word. In English we have purely hybrid words by the blending
of English roots and Romanic formative syllables, such as unspeaka&fe,
starvation, and the obsolete English word, still found in the seventeenth cen
tury, and preserved by the Americans, to happify. But such formations
constitute the very extreme limit of formative power, and they even appear

on the whole as anomalies. The inverse formation of English words out of
Latin roots and Germanic affirmatives is much more extensive, such as

common-er, common-est ; and this is a consequence of the principle, that the
formative grammatical element works itself into a new, although not quite
congenial matter, not the intruding lexicographic element into the gramma
tical. The old Saxon form is thus much more easily adapted to French and
Latin verbs or nouns, than a formative syllable of the French or Latin idiom
combined with the Saxon root. New prepositions and conjunctions have

been formed ; none of which are Latin, all are German (as, by way of) or
hybrid (as, "on account of"). As in the Romanic, they are compounded in

order to replace forms which have either become obsolete, or are no longer
sufficiently expressive or intelligible, owing to the primary principle or spirit
of the formation having become weakened and obscured. But the power of
composition inherent in all Teutonic languages is almost entirely paralysed,
and the organic forms of inflexion remain only in isolated fragments.

   It follows from the same principle that colonization also may produce such
a crisis, as is necessary for the formation of a new language. But here a
more accurate distinction must be drawn. A part of the nation, settling in

a more or less organized state, with more or less intellectual means and re
sources, in a foreign country, isolated from the mother-country, will neces

sarily in process of time differ in language from the native stock. It is evi
dent that the formation of the colonial language has a new fixed point in the

emigration and immigration, and may therefore follow a very different
course from that of the mother-country. Peaceable and intelligent colo
nists, settled in a new country under prosperous circumstances, will preserve
the ancient idiom with great pertinacity. The separation acts as an artifi
cial interruption of the flow of language, while the inhabitants of the mother-
country become subject perhaps to violent changes, introduced by foreign
elements, or move on in the natural course of development, as the Frank
language did in Germany, from Otfried to Goethe.

   Of this class we have a most instructive instance, within the domain of

the German language, in the Icelandic, which is the old Norse tongue trans
planted into that northern island by the emigration of many noble families
unable longer to endure the tyranny of King Harald Harfagr (Fairhair).
That event took place in the year 875. Since that period therefore, during
the lapse of almost a thousand years, the intellectuality of the Teutonic stock,
and the energy of the Norman race, have maintained in the midst of snow
and ice the sacred fire of the Muses. The most ancient document of Ice

landic literature is still heathenish, -- I mean the poetical Edda, or the songs
of Odin, and Helge and Sigurd, and of all the gods and heroes of our com
mon forefathers. The clearest proof that the language of these songs repre
sents simply the old Norse is, that the law book of 1123 exhibits already a
decidedly impoverished system of inflexions, whereas in the Edda we find that
richness and completeness of forms, which places the old Icelandic on the

same level with the Gothic of the fourth century. Again, if we compare that
work with the remarkable historical compositions of the historian Snorro
Sturleson, of the thirteenth century, and with the writings of the last cen
turies, we find in rapid progress the gradual extinction above referred to of

the grammatical forms of the language. Still, if from the Icelandic of this
day we look back to its native country, we find among the descendants of
the same stock two modern idioms formed out of the old Norse, the Swedish

and Danish, neither intelligible to the other without some practice, and each
                                                                            a

as unintelligible to the Icelander, as his tongue, and still more his Edda,

and has been for the last four hundred years at least, to the Dane and
Swede whereas the Icelander of 18t0 can understand with little practice
the Norse of more than thousand years ago. Thus their evulsion from

formations of new abstract words; all other differences consist simply in
the loss of ancient forms. As to the old Icelandic, comparison with the
Gothic and some isolated formations of very primitive nature show that
                       which the Scandinavian branch obtained distinct
the new formation
character, was equally marked as well by loss of forms as by the prominent
working out of elements which in the old united stock were less developed,
but stood there by the side of collateral forms dropped in the Scandinavian.
The old Norse article hinn, hinna, hit, has been supplanted by the new
Scandinavian article, and has transformed itself into a suffix

German dialect, individualized and fixed by the national separation and in
dependence, has changed less than that dialect has done in the mother-
country. Finally, the same case occurs in the Anglo-Saxon. The idiom of
the Anglo-Saxon remains of the ninth century decidedly impoverished in
forms and inflexions, compared with the anterior state of the language, re

presented by the Gothic of Ulphilas, which must be considered as collateral
with that which the Saxons, Hengist and Horsa, brought with them from
Germany. But           no less decidedly nearer to that preceding period than
the documents of the Saxon dialect in German allow us to suppose this to

have been at the same period. Finally, according to good authorities, the;
English of the sixteenth century has become fixed in some English colonies
of that time, e. g. as to pronunciation and in the same manner the French in

Canada seems the language of Louis XIV. Before three centuries elapse
new instance will be supplied by the difference between the English of Ame
rica and that of Europe. To the critical observer this difference already

plantation of a language may put a stop to the continuous flow of its develop
ment, and preserve the ancient form of speech more fully than in the mother
country. But all the cases which we can quote of this description, are taken
from the same family of languages, one which, in its most ancient form, pre
sents itself in a state of complete development* as compared with others.

   Besides, all those secondary formations were the work of rising nations.
In those processes a considerable decomposition of the old element necessarily

                           different effect        of course  be produced upon the language
of a colony, if the emigrant or expelled population sinks from a relatively
superior and growing intellectual and physical station to a lower. The new
society may then gradually fall into a very different state of existence, either
through the inclemency of the climate, extreme cold or extreme heat, or from

other, perhaps concomitant, unfavourable circumstances, such as the perse

cution and enmity of more powerful tribes. Now every lasting contraction
of the mind must produce a corresponding reduction of the means of expres
sion. Thus the present Laplanders, a Finnic population, having been driven
by the Swedes in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries out of their native

land, and pressed more and more towards the polar regions, have a language
much impoverished and disorganized, as compared with their Finnic brethren
in Finland. There seems to have been no positive secondary formation
among the Laplanders : they have lost many forms and words ; but on the
other side, they have also preserved with colonial tenacity, and as it were
pious anxiety, many ancient forms (such as the dual of the pronouns),
which has been lost by the Finlanders. Swedish words have been introduced

by Christianity, evidently because the native expressions had become obso
lete ; for the Finns express the same ideas by native words. When we

consider what would have become of the Laplanders, if Christianity had
not upheld them, and if the translation of the Bible had not fixed and

preserved their language, we shall not be very much surprised by the fact,
that the idiom of the degraded Bushmen (whom Linnaeus identified with the
Orang-utang), cruelly hunted by Hottentots and Kafres, can be traced to be
a corrupt Hottentot language, and that the Hottentot language itself is only
a degraded dialect of the noble language of Sechuana and other branches of
the Kafre tribes, the oppressors of the Hottentots.
   We must therefore distinguish the phenomena of rising and sinking lan

guages. Finally, we must acknowledge the possibility of a new formation,
as the consequence of emigration. A language in a state of incipient deve
lopment, if transplanted by that great cause of the formation of nations and
languages, perhaps of races, emigration into a totally new stage of existence,
may shoot out into a luxuriant new formation, which in process of time may
almost entirely overgrow the primary one, and destroy all vestiges of the an
cient roots. It will then require a very complete knowledge of the new idioms,
and of the history of their development, to discover the primitive roots of

the ancient stock. Perhaps a new method may be found to supply this want
by the evidence of analogy of structure. But in our present stage of inquiry
we can only establish such a possibility, not define the condition and nature
of such formations, and the method of analysis which they require.

   The Egyptian language however brings us some steps nearer to this im
portant point. Egypt must be a solony from the undivided Asiatic stock ;
for its language is much less developed than the Semitic and Sanscritic, and
yet admits the principle of those inflexions and radical formations, which we
find developed, sometimes in one, sometimes in the other of those great families.
As both the Asiatic tongues in their individualized form are much more ad

vanced than the Egyptian, this language points necessarily to a more ancient
Asiatic formation, since extinct in its native country, just as the Icelandic
points to the old Norse of Scandinavia.
    The Egyptian language is also interesting, as illustrative generally of an

Iother phenomenon, which we traced through more modern formations ;
mean the nature of the secondary Egyptian formation exhibited by the
Coptic. In order to obtain a clear view of this formation, we must first
deduct all the words taken from the Greek. As to this admixture, we meet

with an entirely new phenomenon : the Coptic has not only adopted single
nouns and verbs, living roots, but also particles, especially conjunctions in
the proper sense, such as the Greek dXXa, but. This forms no exception to
the rule above deduced from that striking phenomenon in the Romanic and
Germanic languages, that foreign particles are as little apt to expel native
ones as in general foreign grammatical forms to supplant the native ; for the
Egyptian language never had discriminating particles. In translations there
fore from the Greek, the Copts were obliged to adopt the Greek conjunc
tions, for the same reason for which they took the word Aads, nation ; for,
owing to provincialism, Pharaohs, and priests, the idea of a nation had never

been developed even into a word among the Egyptian race.
The other secondary formations are also in entire conformity with those by
which the modern tongues of Southern Europe, as well as of Germany and
Scandinavia, were produced. We have marked some of these phenomena
already in the first volume of ' Egypt ;' such as the change of the appended
feminine sign of the old Egyptian t, (the remnant of to, the original pronoun
of the second person, preserved in an-ta, thou,) into a female article t or ti,
e. g. t-mu, the mother, instead of mu-t. To this class belong also the forma
tions of the definite and indefinite articles in Coptic. The first (pi or joe,
masc. ; ti or It; fern. ; ni, n, nen, pi.) is an evident remnant of the pronominal
formations, exactly as the Greek article and the masculine and feminine ter
mination in the two first declensions are. The indefinite
singular is, like the German and Romanic, an abbreviation  oafrttihcelen(uwm)erianl  the

The plural of a noun substantive has a termination only by exception ; but
instead of the u of the ancient language we find different decompositions of
this long vowel, together with other forms, not at all discernible in the ancient
language. One of them is the prolongation of the vowel of the root ; an in
ward formation, so frequent in the Semitic, and analogous to the German
Umlaut in Vtiter, the plural of Voter. Thus uhor means a dog ; uh&r, dogs ;

verbs, for supplying an evident defect by new formations. These auxiliary
verbs unite with the personal pronouns, and thus form a very periphrastic
mode of distinguishing moods and tenses. The negative particles do the

same; and the Coptic has a complete periphrastic negative conjugation,
of which there is not the slightest trace in the old Egyptian. The old

predicate contained in each adjective verb, and even of the Sanscritic conju

capable, according to time and mode of existence. Now the development
of those germs in the Coptic is not organic, as we find it in Hebrew and in
Sanscrit, but on the contrary effected by a purely mechanical process. The
change is no real development. Thus the verb tre or tkre, uniting itself
with the pronominal affixes, makes a verb causative, as the Hebrew Hiphil

does.

   The ancient Egyptian had incontestably the germs of the composition of
words to express, by the union of two, a third, more abstract or ideal notion,
for which the language had no simple expression. Such an union originally
took place by juxtaposition, later by means of the preposition ri. Coptic for

the heart, viz. repent, are analogous to the ancient language, but much more
frequent. In many cases the original simple expressions may have become
obsolete by having become unintelligible. Besides, there must have been in
progress of time an increased consciousness of intellectual modes of existence ;
and this consciousness called forth necessarily new formations in the Coptic

such an attraction. The Egyptian root is not the unalterable particle, or
rather sentence-word, of the Chinese, and, in composition, of the modern
Coptic. Hut, Horus, becomes in composition hr, her. Here a decided sen

    Those who understand the principle of the formation of words in the Semitic
and Indo-Germanic languages, will immediately perceive that the first have

some, and the latter an inexhaustible abundance of terminations, variously
affecting the root, and indicating all the shades of the different modes of ex

istence and action, which the Coptic expresses very incompletely and clumsily

the formation of the new Romanic words, especially the particles, prevails
throughout in the Coptic. But it acted differently, because the Latin was

a developed, perfect, inflexional language ; the ancient Egyptian was a form
of speech only just emerging from the monosyllabic state and the absolute
isolation of words.
The intrusion of foreign elements, from the time of Alexander, helped to
destroy what there was of organic power in the Egyptian language ; but
it was not the original cause of that destruction. It was the effect of the

slowness of the Egyptian mind, which had long been mummified, acting upon
a material repugnant to development, and stereotyped by colonization, by the

hieroglyphic system of writing, and by a complete system of priestcraft, re
ligious tradition, and Pharaonic despotism. This slow action upon an almost
impenetrable material produced, for the uses of common life, a secondary

formation, the country-tongue, written in the less idiographic, demotic or
enchorial character. This secondary formation is of the same kind as the

secondary formation of later languages ; in degree it differs less : there is
also less of the destruction of forms, because only a germ of forms existed

altogether in the Egyptian language.

   It follows from the same circumstance, that there can be, in the ordinary
sense of the word, no secondary formation in the modern Chinese, or the
modern and familiar style, as compared with the old style. The modern

style indulges in the use of words which correspond to the expletive particles
and conjunctions of our languages : but it must not be overlooked, that, even
in modem Chinese, these sounds still represent nouns or verbs, or full roots,
according to the expressive terminology of the Chinese grammarians. Strictly
speaking, there are no exclusively grammatical words or forms in the modern
Chinese any more than in the old ; the roots may in most cases lose their

meaning, when indicating what our particles and connections express, but not
their formation. The root remains what it incapable of change

for what the ancient language did not express at all. Not step made
towards the use of affixes or suffixes, much less towards inflexions.

The Chinese language, with some similiar structures in Eastern Asia, forms,

as Wilhelm von Humboldt has been the first to establish in all its extent,                                                a

contrast to all other languages, not so much by any defect, or from the external
fact of its being monosyllabic, as by its totally opposite view of the means of
attaining the end of all language. This end the construction of sentence,
                                       by                             a

   All other languages not only express more or less perfectly, the component
parts of a sentence, but have also words deputed solely for that purpose

(particles), or inflexions, destined to bring audibly before the hearer the mu
tual relations of nouns and verbs to each other. Besides, all other languages
have more or less distinct forms for those different component parts of sen
;

284 REPORT -- 1847-

nobody will ever understand its nature and do justice to its incomparable per

fection, if lie applies to it the forms and categories of the grammars of the
rest of the world. As Humboldt says, the other languages have an etymolo

gical and a syntactic part, but the Chinese has only a syntactic one ; and this
Chiuese syntax may be comprehended under two rules : that the determinative
precedes the word determined, and that the object follows the word on which
it depends. All other syntactic rules, even those which appear as exceptions,
can be explained from these two simple principles. Thus position alone points

out the verb in a sentence : what precedes it next is either its own determina

tive (adverb), or the subject, which may equally be preceded by its deter
minative, the relation of genitive in particular. Finally, every one of these
words is like the other : not only are all monosyllables, that is to say, have
an accent of their own, which separates them from the preceding or following
syllable or particle ; but, moreover, every one of these monosyllabic words

help to find out in what sense it is to be taken in a given position.                                                                                                                                                                                    a

word changes from its original verbal sense into a nominal, or vice versa,

it changes its accent*. Thus, what other languages effect by affixes or
inflexions, the Chinese indicates by two means, quite distinct from the forma
tion of the word ; by the architectonical arrangement of words, and by a mu
sical change in the pronunciation. Add to this, that the Chinese language has
only 450 syllable-words, which by the variation of the accent become 1203,
and you will agree with me, that, if the Chinese is considered as a structure

like ours, and all other languages, it would be the most imperfect. So indeed
it is, as speech, for practical purposes ; for in spite of accents, position, and

traditional tact, no Chinese would understand the spoken language, still less

the old one, which very seldom uses grammatical particles, without the help
of repetitions, expletives, pauses, and finally of gestures, which all are neces

sary to supply, to a certain degree, what in writing is effected by innumerable
ideographic, now wholly conventional, signs, which constitute a sort of general
or pasigraphic system of writing, destined, not to express the sound, but to
help to guess the meaning of the word. It can be proved that this system
of writing was originally figurative, as the ideographic part of the Egyptian
is : and indeed, if we understand the nature of the oldest form of language,
it must have been so. But we venture to say, that not only is the present
system of Chinese writing the wreck of a still more peculiar and primitive

form, but the spoken language also.

The Chinese formation is in its principle, as this is visibly enough preserved

in the old style, among languages, what the inorganic formations are in the
kingdoms of nature. Its component parts are not organically articulated
words as parts of speech, but crystals of thought, employed architectonically
in building up a sentence, which is made more intelligible by musical enun

ciation. Accent and position give each crystal a more or less prominent part
in this symmetric arrangement; but each is in itself a complete, though not
an explicit, sentence, whether appearing more as a noun or as a verb. Thus
every word has in itself a fullness of life and value, of which it can only be
deprived, by making the substance, quality, existence or action, all which lie
                 merely the sign or symbol of determination or of relation to
enshrined in  it,
                      is
another word, that to say, to another substance, quality, existence or action,

or to the whole sentence. According to the Chinese formation, every word

              *  Humboldt, Lettrc, 24, and Rcmusat's note (4) to it.p.
ON ETHNOLOGY.  285

(or syllable) is an undeveloped sentence; or, if we follow out the analogy

with nature (which to us is by no means a mere metaphor), we may say,
every word spoken in a sentence is a magnetized mineral, forming itself with
out any outward change into polarity (the nominal and the verbal pole),
and thus having for its centre, as the indifferential point between the two,
the adjective-participle quality. Position, assisted by accent, elicits the pola
rity required, or reduces the word to its indifferential point. Suppose the
creative human mind absorbed in this first formative process of speech, and
you will allow that it must shrink, during the power of that process over
the mind, from the notion of having its produce treated as an imperfect plant
or a maimed animal formation. Only by decay does such a language ac
quire a superficial and deceptive likeness to the formations of our languages.

It is intrinsically the very opposite of them. It has a life of its own, capable
of manifold development and endless variety ; and it cannot receive an essen

tially different one without ceasing to exist, just as a plant may grow on
soil formed by the calcined mineral, but the mineral can never develop itself
into a plant.

    Now, if we consider that almost half of mankind speak in tongues of this

nature, you will agree with me that it is worth while to consider well its
original and peculiar character, before we pronounce for or against the

Igenealogical unity of the human race.

        believe you will also agree with me, that, in order to see whether a
method can be proposed for finding out the probability, and gradually the
certainty, of the one or the other solution of our great problem, we must
enter into a philosophical consideration of language itself in general.

Philosophical considerations on the origin of Languages, and the principle of
                                        development in them.

    The theories about the origin of language have followed those about the
origin of thought, and have shared their fate. The materialists have never
been able to show the possibility of the first step. They attempt to veil
their inability by the easy, but fruitless assumption of an infinite space of
time, destined to explain the gradual development of animals into men ; as
if millions of years could supply the want of the agent necessary for the first
movement, for the first step in the line of progress I No numbers can effect a
logical impossibility. How indeed could reason spring out of a state which
is destitute of reason ? How can speech, the expression of thought, develop
itself, in a year or in millions of years, out of unarticulated sounds, which
express feelings of pleasure, pain, and appetite ? Animal sounds are the
echoes of blind instincts within, or of the phenomena of the outward world,
uttered by suffering or satisfied animal nature, and in all cases resulting from
mere passiveness. The common sense of mankind will therefore always shrink
from such theories. So did the mind of Frederic the Great, in his memorable
answer to d'Alembert and his school. He protested against what he calls the
salto mortale, which that school wanted him to make, from a monkey to
man, from reasonlessness to reason. In our times nobody has expressed
himself more strongly against such a materialist explanation of language
than the greatest and most acute anatomizer of almost all human tongues,
Wilhelm von Humboldt, in his admirable Letter to Abel Remusat on the
nature of grammatical forms in general, and on the genius of the Chinese
language in particular*, a letter which contains all the germs of his posthu

mous German work, and therefore is an almost indispensable introduction to
the study and understanding of that gigantic concentration of learning and
reflection. As to the general speculative grounds for such a view, in opposi
tion to the materialist theories of French and English philosophers of the
earlier part of the eighteenth century, they have been established most ac
curately by Kant, and developed by his illustrious successors. To reproduce
IMonboddo's theory in our days, after Kant and his followers, is a sorry ana

chronism ; and therefore regret that so low a view should have been taken
of the subject lately, in                                work of
reflection and research      an English                  natural  much correct and    comprehensive

so much thought should have been carried away by a narrow philosophical
theory, and perhaps besides by a violent reaction against dead dogmatism
and formalism. But its counterpart, the spiritualist system of philosophy,
has not been able either to give a totally satisfactory explanation of the
phenomena, and in particular of the origin of language, and therefore has not
been able to drive the other theory from the field ; for as the one cannot take
the step from matter to thought, so the other cannot take that from thought
to matter. Absolute spiritualism contradicts nature, as materialism contra
dicts mind : it has reality and history against it as much as its opposite. Ac
cording to its one-sided notions all development in language descends from
the height of consciousness to a state of decline. It justly disclaims the
savage as the prototype of natural, original man ; for linguistic inquiry shows
that the languages of savages are degraded, decaying fragments of nobler
formations. The language of the Bushman, as we have observed before, is a
degraded Hottentot language, and this language is likely to be only a de
pravation of the noble Kafre tongue. But, on the other side, when that
school pretends, as Frederic Schlegel does, that in the noblest languages,
those of organic structure, as he calls them, the spiritual and abstract signifi
cation of roots is the original, such an assumption is contradicted by the
history of every language of the world. Nay, his whole distinction between
organic and atomistic languages is decidedly unhistorical. The African
languages in particular protest against such an unholy divorce in the human
race. As to ourselves, we believe with Kant, that the formation of ideas or
notions, embodied in words, presupposes the action of the senses, and the

on which his opinion had differed or still differed with the views developed by Humboldt.

We shall quote here two                             55.   Speaking     of the origin  of the most perfect lan

pénétré de la conviction, qu'il ne faut pas méconnaître cette force vraiment divine que recèlent
les facultés humaines, ce génie créateur des nations, surtout dans l'état primitif où tontes les

idées et même les facultés de l'âme empruntent une force plus vive de la nouveauté des im

pressions, où l'homme peut pressentir des combinaisons auxquelles il ne serait jamais arrivé

par la marche lente et progressive de l'expérience. Ce génie créateur peut franchir les

limites qui semblent prescrites au reste des mortels, et s'il est impossible de retracer sa marche,

sa présence vivifiante n'est pas moins manifeste.        Plutôt que de renoncer, dans l'explication

de l'origine des langues, à l'influence de celte cause puissante et première, et de leur assigner

à toutes une marche uniforme et mécanique qui les traînerait pas-à-pas depuis le commence

ment le plus grossier jusqu'à leur perfectionnement, j'embrasserais l'opinion de ceux qui

rapportent l'origine des langues à une révélation immédiate de la Divinité. Ils reconnoissent
au moins l'étincelle divine qui luit à travers tous les idiomes, même les plus imparfaits et les

moins cultivés."

   In p. 71, when   refuting the notion that the         Chinese language represents the   babbling of
children, he has   these remarkable words :-- "          Ues nations peuvent se trouver à   différentes

époques des progrès de leurs langues par rapport à cet accroissement, mais jamais par rapport

au développement primitif. Une nation ne peut jamais, pas même pendant l'âge d'une seule

génération, conserver ce qu'on nomme le parler enfantin. Or ce qu'on veut appliquer à la
langue chinoise tient précisément a ce parler, et au premier développement du langage."

impression made by outward objects on the mind, as much as the formative
power of the reacting mind. It is the mind which creates and forms ; but
this power of the mind is one reacting only upon impressions received from

athgeainwsot rlLdocwkietho: u"t.     We    believe Leibnitz perfectly right in his  great saying
                                  Nihil  est in intellectu quod non ante fuerit in    sensu, nisi

ipse intellectus." We are moreover convinced that the power of the mind                                                         i

which enables us to see the genus in the individual, the whole in the many,

and to form a word by connecting a subject with a predicate, is the same
which leads man to find God in the universe, and the universe in God. Lan
guage and religion are the two poles of our consciousness, mutually presup
posing each other. The one is directed to the changing phenomena of the
world, in the conviction of their unity, the other to the unchangeable,

absolute One, with the subsumption of all that is changeable and relative
under him. But we are not now to enter into these higher spheres of spe
culation ; we have here to deal with the origin and the principle of the pro
gress of speech, and to show that the primeval facts of language, and all those

phenomena which we have examined in the preceding section, are not only

explained by our assumption, but proved to flow of necessity from a simple
and constant law.

Now we found, that the further we go in the examination of the most

ancient formations, the more we perceive that every sound had originally
a meaning, and every unity of sounds (every syllable) answered to a unity
of object in the outward world for the world of the mind. We found this to
be the character of the Chinese language. We again found, beginning with
the latest formations, that inflexions, apparently mere modifications of the
sound of a word, were in most cases reducible to prepositions or postposi
tions, and these again and all particles to full roots, or nouns and verbs. We

found that every word had first a substantial object in the outward world,
and received only in process of time an application to the inward.
  In order to arrive at the law which we are endeavouring to find, let us

first assume, as Geology does, that the same principles which we see
working in the development, were also at work at the very beginning,
modified in degree and in form, but essentially the same in kind. We leave
it here quite undecided,            whether
were many beginnings              of speech,  there was   one  beginning, or whether there

we adopt this latter supposition, we shall find ourselves obliged to assume
that the starting-point of all has been essentially the same, only that the
materials employed have been quite distinct from the beginning. Different
families of languages will then, according to this system, represent at the
utmost only different stages in lines of parallel development According to
the first supposition, on the contrary, they all, with the exception of one,

must have found something of speech, and materials, more or less, already
stamped and fixed, which they had to work upon, when entering into the
critical process of their nascent nationality.
My second general assumption
                                              this. The supreme law of progress in
all language shows itself to be the progress from the substantial isolated
word, as an undeveloped expression of a whole sentence, towards such

construction of language as makes every single word subservient to the
general idea of a sentence, and shapes, modifies and dissolves accordingly.

been significative of something. The unity     of sound (the syllable,
consonautized) must therefore originally have  corresponded to a unity  pure or

scious plastic thought; and every thought must have had a real or substantial
object of perception. The mind cannot conceive existence except in things
existing ; and on the other hand, every distinct notion of a thing presuppose*
its existence. Thus every object of perception appears necessarily to the
mind as a thing placed under the category of qualitative existence, existence
being the necessary attribute of everything contemplated by the mind.
Now the noun is the expression of a thing existing. The substantive noun
is the existing thing, denominated according to that quality of the object
which strikes the mind, when reacting upon the impression received from it

through the senses. The noun-adjective in general is the quality of an
existing thing, considered as separate from it. Or, we may say, what was
suggested to us by the nature of Chinese words, the substantive and the

verb represent the two opposite poles of the originally undivided notion ;

the adjective is the indifferential point between the two poles, presenting

itself towards the nominal pole as an adjective, towards the verbal as a par
ticiple. But the original substantial word must represent the unity of these
differences, by being a substantive, or verb, or adjective, according to its use,

indicated by its tone and position in the sentence. No substantive-noun can
originate without the working of that which is expressed by the adjective,
the specific quality or property of the thing contemplated. Quality there
fore is only a term for a mode of existence, that is to say, for a mode of that,
of which the verb is the abstract expression. Every act of word-forming
presupposes therefore the unity of these three fundamental parts of speech.

That is to say, every single word implies necessarily a complete proposition,
consisting of subject, predicate and copula. Such indeed we found to be

Ifthe case in Chinese.

       thus the very beginning of speech is impossible without the creative
power of the mind reacting upon the impression of the senses, the original
expression of thought is entirely substantial. Nothing but a substance is

expressed, although no substance can ever be expressed without the ideal
power of the mind which stamps it. The action of the contemplating mind
itself, the copula, as it is called in logic, the affirmation or negation which

connects a subject and predicate, a noun and a verb, substantive and ad

jective, will least of all have originally an abstract expression. Indeed, the
negation of a sentence (which sentence may be one word) is most naturally
expressed by a gesture, added to the expression of some existence or move

ment. Gestures and accents are the natural commentary upon the sentence-
forming word. The same is the case with the relations of nouns and verbs
to space and time, or to any quality or degree. The prepositions and post
positions, the affixes and suffixes, the declensions and conjugations of our
languages, are, in primeval speech, expressed like the copula, by position,

by accent, declamation, pauses, gestures, finally by the accompanying image
of the object. For language, in its primitive substantial state, wants for its
completion and illustration the writing of the image of things, as much as
later languages find a useful commentary in the orthography of words, and a
necessary one in the context of speech. How, for instance, distinguish in
English might and mile, right, wright, write and rite, or u, you, yew, ewe,
or to, too, two, unless an unmistakeable synonym be added, or the context
         it directly? But before as  after the invention of image-writing, the

only be done by words originally coined for things substantial. This the
origin of personal pronouns (the consciousness of self and its antithesis, which

       great abstraction), of other pronouns, of prepositions, lastly, of con
junctions, or words expressing the relation of whole sentences to each other,
as prepositions do the relation of nouns with nouns or with verbs. The
words thus divested of their substantial meaning, lose their substantiality, in
the proper sense of the term.
   This step coincides necessarily with the division between                      syllables and

words, and precedes the origin of affixes and inflexions.

   Every really primitive language (if there are more than one) must there

really did begin. Perhaps we may also find the necessary steps of deve

  it. Syllables, beginning and ending with a vowel, and having besides a conso
   nant between them, are already to be suspected of contraction, unless the con
   sonant be a servile one, as the liquids and the sibilating sounds generally are.
  Indeed this difference between the degree of substantiality of the consonants
   is a powerful element for the development of words into an organic structure.
   Monosyllables with two substantial consonants are the furthest extreme to
   which monosyllabic languages can arrive. This whole reason proceeds upon
   the fundamental assumption, that in languages of this nature (having only
   full roots, or sentence-forming words) there is a rational correspondence
  between the unity of perception and of sounds. Two equally strong con
  sonants again of the same organ of speech (as two labials, two Unguals, and
  so on), may come under the head of a simple increase and light modification of
   the one impression. But syllables with two mute consonants of two different
   organic classes presuppose a union of two, which requires originally two

   syllables.
      Other varieties can exist within this dark and almost unexplored sphere,

  by different systems of position and accent ; but the line of progress will
  always lie in the approach to the breaking up of the character of substantial
   fulness and isolation of the single words. The only preparation which, after
  a literature of four thousand years, the Chinese presents for such a change,
  is the use of some of its unchangeable roots as signs of grammatical relations.
  A nation which formed itself into existence from such a state of the language,
  could as easily make that great step, which leads to affixes and then to
  inflexions, as the mummified Chinese is incapable and unwilling to do it. It
  is the feeling of the absolute independence and isolating substantiality of each
  word in a sentence, which makes him contemplate such a change as a decided
  decay and barbarism. He expresses daylight by two words signifying ex
  actly in the same order day light : but he cannot condescend to subordinate
  the second to the first, by saying (with one accent) day'-light.

      The tendency to compound syllables is also in itself a tendency to such a
  change. The distinction between words and syllables, by the formation of po
  lysyllabic words, is the declaration of the entrance into the second great
  stage, the organic one of the words. Every composition produces or prepares
  decomposition : it presupposes a third thing, uniting two distinct units of per

  ception and thought. One of the things thus united will be in process of
  time subordinated to the other, as the determinative or accessory. A word
  of more than one syllable is the expression of a compound notion : it consti
  tutes the expression of a higher unit by the subordination of one simple
  notion under another simple one. The former loses the accent ; for without

  unity of accent there is no unity of the word in speech. The Chinese has
  no real compound words; for in apparent compositions, like day-light,
  horse-man, each component word, as we have already observed, preserves

 Ifits own accent, and there is a pause between them.

         we fix our regard on the second great class of languages, there can be
  no mistake as to which is the last formation, the goal of the whole process: it
  is evidently that of perfect inflexions. We say advisedly, the last forma
 tion, not merely the most perfect. No language can have inflexions, which
 had not formative particles (affixes and suffixes) before : and these affixes
 themselves must once have been independent particles ; finally, there can
 be no particle, which was not originally a substantial word, and primitively
 a substantial syllable.

    This is the result both of our examination of the phenomena of languages,
and of our speculative reasoning. The first showed us, that such was the
case in the languages, the history and formation of which we know. The
                      ON ETHNOLOGY.                           291

 second proved, that this phenomenon results from a general law ; and in
 order to arrive at this law, we allowed ourselves no assumption, as far as we
 are aware, except that everything expressed in language, which is the ex
pression of reason, must originally have been reasonable, and therefore a
truth and reality. The question, can a language be supposed to begin
with inflexions r appears to us to imply an absurdity. But so does the
first of all questions: why every word must be originally a true and
adequate expression of the mind ? And the examination of the facts
shows us how that law operates. First, inflexions, as we have seen, resolve
themselves, whenever, we have the means of observing their formation, into
worn-out prepositions or postpositions : but these again we found, in the
instances we examined, to have been in an earlier stage substantial words,
nouns or verbs. We further found, that, when flexions are worn-out, and
some event brings on a new secondary formation, worn-out flexions call
forth the formation of a new affix or suffix from the class of particles.

    Thus the line of progress runs in the direction of an increase in the
number of words formal, that is to say, of words serving for the formative
purposes of the mind. This coincides with the necessary purpose of all or
ganic language, to constitute and mark all the component parts of a sentence.
Now it is clear that no word, which has once ceased to be full or substantial,

can ever become so again : it has lost its substantial, independent life, and its

distinct substantial signification. It becomes an algebraic sign, and more or

less unintelligible in itself. The more substantial and independent state is,
therefore, necessarily the more ancient in any line of development.

    Thus much we can establish by following out the logical process we have
undertaken to explain. But this method alone cannot bring us further. Logi
cally, it is impossible to define the different classes of this second great family
of languages, otherwise than by establishing that the more the single
words in a sentence are regarded as unchangeable, and their position in the
sentence as the sign of the part they represent in the nearer such lan
guage must be to the first class. But whether, for instance, the system of
agglutination or incorporation of the American and the Basque languages
a proof of backwardness in the stage of development, compared with the

use of affixes, must depend upon concomitant circumstances. It certainly
will be so, whenever the affix-languages are freer from the symmetric con

struction of sentence, and the isolation of the single words from each other.
    The great fact upon which we insist here, this every primitive language

must be composed of words which are absolutely inorganic, because in this
way alone the origin and the progress of word- forming, and the origin and

aa We shall recapitulate briefly the results of the two preceding investigations.
                   aWe have first examined some striking phenomena in the formation and the
component parts of language, and we have then endeavoured to explain
them by general philosophical induction.;

    By the first we believe we have established the constancy of the following
phenomena. The first is, that every language has in itself an element of
progress, which in crisis may become the element of death to the old, and
of life in new one. The constant action of the mind upon the articulate
expression of substantiality prevails gradually, but necessarily, over the
positiveness of this substantiality, and makes single words subservient to
the expression of all that belongs to the mind of relation, outwardly of time

other categories of existence ; finally, of the copula, or that act of the mind

another. This forms the basis upon which the new formative power works,
or, as were, the substratum or httmus for the new formation. The birth of
   new language pre-supposes the death of an old one. No language dies
without great crisis in the tribe or nation which speaks it. This crisis may
be a great physical revolution, or voluntary change of country by emi

the dissolution of an ancient nationality. A new nationality certainly may
rise out of an old one without the creation of new language, although
                                                                               a

aliving roots of that older

                                              language, -- and finally, the deposit, or that which
was the primary formation of the same older language.
   Generalizing this fact, we may arrive at an algebraic formula. Calling
the older language A, all anterior formations x, the new language B, and
distinguishing in every one of these three formations the two necessary
                                      and a finally,  designating the number of
component parts as                  by n  we arrive   at the following expression                                           successive

                                              ;
                                                                                                                           :

Therefore,                          B=b+a+x

                                    B=b. (a+b).

   Fourthly. We found that the principle of secondary formation may be the

stronger, the less development there in the basis and must be the weaker
                                                is
the more that basis was developed.                       is

                                                                                           it
                                                                                                     is
   Fifthly. That the secondary formation the weakest where                                                                      stopped
by a continual influx of an extraneous element.
   Sixthly. The extraneous element will never intrude into the grammar, but

only into the lexicographic part.

   Seventhly. All secondary formations are the less organic, the more violent
the transition has been from one stage to another.
   Eighthly. Colonization may often preserve the ancient form of the language

of the mother-country.

   Ninthly. The Chinese language presents formation entirely contrasting
with all others hitherto examined and its peculiarity does not so much con
                                                ;
                                                                    a

sist in its monosyllabic character, as in the circumstance that each word re

presents an implicit sentence, not divided in its component logical parts, and

serves therefore, according to its position and accent, sometimes as a sub

stantive or adjective, and sometimes as a verb.
   As to the second, thp philosophical inquiry, we found that those pheno
                                                           of
mena are explained                  as the manifestations  :--             general law.                      According to
this, we established                the following axioms             a
                          ON ETHNOLOGY.                                                                                                       293

First. The original or primitive language must consist of inorganic
words, each word presenting a whole undivided sentence, incapable of suf
fering any connexion with or modification by the preceding or following

word.

    Secondly. The principle by which a language is produced, the reac
tion of the mind upon the impressions of the outward world, is also the prin
ciple of its development: consequently every language must either remain
quite fixed in its inorganic state, or arrive at a more or less perfect organic

state.

Thirdly. This organic formation has as its aim and goal the languages
with inflexions, the system we find harmoniously developed in Sanscrit and
Greek, and the cognate languages.
   Fourthly. The intermediate phenomena must be arranged in a series,
as steps of the general development from the inorganic to the organic.
Fifthly. Inflexions can only be explained as worn-out affixes, or as inde
pendent particles, and these as decayed full (nominal or verbal) roots.

systems  respecting the historical     origin  odfilelamnmguaag:--es,Eittohewr htichherewehaasllubdeeedn
above.   We are reduced to the      following
an infinite number of such beginnings, out of which different tribes have

sprung, and with them different languages, each doing originally the same
work, and continuing and advancing it more or less according to its particu
lar task, its natural powers and its historical destinies ; or the beginning of
speech was made only once, in the beginning of human time, in the dawn of
the mental day, by   one favoured race            it was originally                                                                           formed) in a
                     earth, the garden  (however                                                                                               we have in
genial place of the                     of Asia.  Of such centres
the primeval facts of ethnology three ; the western one, having Mount
Ararat as a southern, and Mount Caucasus as the northern centre ; the
eastern one, or the mountainous table-land of Tibet, with its eastern and

southern slope ; finally, the middle one, the Hindukush, with the Iranians
and Turanians around it.
Within the circumference of this district the human race first developed
and spread itself, either equally from all three points, as the one assumption
would lead us to suppose, or from one first, according to the other of the two
possible scientific assumptions.
   On one supposition or on the other, the development of language must

have been connected with different crises, such as must modify social exist
ence, and therefore speech. The rising of new nationalities must produce
new languages. In consequence of such inward or outward, natural or
political, and religious catastrophes, colonies went out, and swarms of men
issued forth to distant countries, bearing with them the heirloom of their first
fatherland in their speech, and carrying it on from that starting-point with
their own individual strength, under more or less favourable circumstances.
On this supposition there will be in some races a more continuous and
organic development, retaining more of uninterrupted consciousness of the

past ; whereas others tend rapidly to a premature or conventional develop
ment ; others again preserve this old state with unbending tenacity. One
race will distinguish itself thus above all others by a full development from
the inorganic to the organic formation. Although it becomes thus in the
course of ages the most perfect organic language, the race will, by virtue
of the harmonic development of all its parts towards one, and that the
highest end, preserve more of the ancient heirloom than others less perfect,

another stock closely united, and that both these families are originally con
nected with each other. These nations, who probably may be reduced to
two families, one centring in the Altai and the pasture land towards the

Himalaya, and the other having its centre in the Ural mountains, have acted
in the history of civilisation a most powerful episode by conquest and de

struction. They appeared in the fifth century as the Huns, a scourge to

mRoemd aInI.s;  and Germans ;    they  produced Djenghiskan, Tamerlau and Moham
                 they destroyed   the  Persian empire, subdued Hindustan, and they

still sit upon the throne of Byzantium and upon that of China. They seem
destined to partake only by conquest in the higher civilisation of the sur

rounding nations, older or younger ones, the Chinese presenting the one ex
treme, the Iranians the other. Little disposed to learn from them as neigh
bours or subjects, they become more or less civilized by being their masters.
They cannot resist the inward force of the civilisation of their subjects,
a                            as an outward power.

These tribes appear also as the once subdued substratum of Iranian civi
              alisation. So in the north of Europe, where the Finnic race preceded the
                        it,
Scandinavians.

    But the same great family appears also in Asia as the subdued or primary

element. It seems probable, that the aboriginal languages of India, which

attained their full development in the Dekhan dialects, belong to this stock,
not only by general analogy of structure, but also by an original and

traceable connexion.

   In similar position we find another member of that family in western
Europe. It there preceded the Celts, in the Iberians or Cantabrians, whose

language preserved in the Basque (Biscayan). Those tribes were once
prevalent in France and Spain, probably also in ancient Italy. Their lan

guage has the same structure and certainly some signs or vestiges of ma
terial connexion in roots with the Altai-Ural idioms.                                  a
   Our historical formula respecting this formation will therefore be this.                    a
All the nations, who in the history of Asia and Europe occupy the second

rank as to the civilising power they have hitherto displayed, are probably as
much of one Asiatic origin as the Iranian nations are. They centre on the
northern borders of the Himalaya, and everywhere in central Asia are the
hostile, savage neighbours of the agricultural Iranian people, whom they have
disturbed and dispossessed in different ages of history, having probably them

selves been primitively driven by them, as nomades           byagriculturists, from
                                                                      a
more genial common home.
We have now only to indicate, as summarily as we can, the relation of thisif
great family, with the three great families, into which the leading nations of
civilisation, as children of one stock, appeared to be divided. We found that
the names of Cham, Shem and Japhet (the latter name being adopted only
provisionally as equivalent with Indo-Germanic) represented to us scientifi
cally three steps of development of one and the same stock. In applying the
principles above established to that question, we ask, Is that great Altai-Ural
family originally connected with those leading nations? and so, to which
of those three great divisions (Chamism, Semitism, Japhetism) do these se

condary families more particularly approach We cannot hesitate for mo

therefore propose to call this whole family the Turanian, and the Indo-Ger-
manic or Indo-European, the Iranian, following the antithesis of Iran and

Turan, established by Heeren and Carl Hitter. And indeed the more we go
back to the most ancient historical traditions of the Japhetic family, particu
larly in India and Persia, the more we see how the two branches, the Iranian
and the Turanian, though always in opposition to each other, are to be con
sidered as but diverging lines from one common centre*.

ciples, highly probable, that the native languages of the northern continent
of America, comprising tribes and nations of very different degrees of civili
sation, from the Esquimaux of the polar regions to the Aztecs of Mexico,
are scion of the Turanian tribe. The similarity in the conformation of the
skull, always made such an affinity highly probable the wonderful analogy
in the grammatical structure of those languages, between themselves and with
the Turanian tongues of Asia, denied               nobody and we believe that the
curious aud, at the first appearance, startling problem, of the apparent entire
diversity of the lexicographic part of those American languages, by the side
of that grammatical affinity, will receive satisfactory solution by more pro
found knowledge of the roots, and by the application of our principle of se
condary formation, overgrowing sometimes luxuriantly the ancient stock of

roots.

   We likewise believe that Wilhelm von Humboldt has established the con
nexion between the Polynesian languages and the Malay, or the language of
Malacca, Java and Sumatra, and that this Malay language itself bears the
character of the not-Iranian branch of the Japhetic family.

   Whether the Papua languages, spoken in Australia and New Guinea, and
by the aborigines of Borneo, of the peninsula of Malacca and of some small

Polynesian         islands, be primitive typea of the same stock as the Malay which
afterwards,        in many parts, superseded     -- this point must remain uncertain
                                               it

till we receive from the hands of the missionaries a Papua grammar. Thus
                             an anterior and very primitive formation, and most
much we know, that  it
                       a is
likely will prove to be degenerated one, to the analysis of which, as such,
we shall have to apply the method above discussed.
   We see thus, that Asia (with the exception of China and Tibet), the whole
of Europe and probably of America and the Polynesian lands (at least in their
secondary stock), belong to one great original family, divided into the Ira-

'
                '

Druhyus, Anus and Purus, were closely connected by the ties of nationality, and had their
gods in common. In the succeeding age, that of the epic poetry of the Mahabharata, these
five nations are represented as the sons of Yayati, one of the old fathers of mankind. Yayati
curses four of his sons, and the curse of Turvasa is, to live without laws and attached to
beastly vices in the land of barbarians in the North. In this name of 7ur-vasa, as well as

afterwards in the name given to the Indo-Scythian kings in the history of Kashmir, TAr-
ushka, we find the same root as in the Zend Tura, the name of the nations in the North.
But tura itself means quick, from A/tvar, to run, to fly, and thus the very name of these tribes
gives the same characteristic of these nomadic equestrian tribes, which afterwards
                                                                                                                     is  ascribed

to them by Firdusi, and which makes them always appear in India, as well as on the Sassa-
nian inscriptions of Persia, as the An-iriin, or not-Arian people, that is, as the enemies of the

agricultural and civilising nations."

nian and Turanian branches. We beg to call this definitively the Japhetic
race. In many parts we know that the Turanian race has preceded the Ira
nian : its language certainly represents an anterior step or preceding degree
of development. In some parts we found that the Turanian race succeeded
to a still older native element.

   We now return to the precursor of Iranism in western Asia and in Egypt.
Semitism appeared to us as a one-sided progress of Chamism. Canaan (the
ante-judaic inhabitants of Palestine and Phoenicia) is not literally a child of
Cham, that is to say, a scion of the Egyptian stock : perhaps geographically,
but not genealogically. But Canaan is called in Genesis the son of Cham,
because the Canaanites, in the Abrahamitic period, as again in the Mosaic
time, left lower Egypt and occupied Palestine and Tyre. Canaan came out
of Cham ; certainly the Semitic idiom is in itself a child of Cham, by being a
development of that primitive (Asiatic) Chamism, which became fixed in the
Egyptian. For the Egyptian language is as certainly the primitive forma
tion of the Euphrates and Tigris territory, fixed in Africa and preserved by
the Egyptians, as the Icelandic is the old-Norse fixed in that island. All this
follows out of the facts furnished by Egyptology, if the principles above esta

blished are applied to them.
    The Semitic formation itself occupied Abyssinia; and the Berber language

belongs evidently to the same stock. But what can we say of the rest of
Africa ?

   Here late researches have opened a new and great field of the most inter
esting character. We allude in particular to the labours of Tutschek, and the
analytical inquiries of Von Gablenz and Ewald ; but above all to the gigan
tic and truly admirable labours of that indefatigable German Messenger of
the Church-Missionary Society of England, the Rev. John Lewis Krapf, whose
compared manuscript grammar and dictionary of the Sawahili language and
the cognate dialects of the Wanicka and Wakamba tribes, with introductions

and numerous translations, have been entrusted to me by the enlightened
secretary of that Society, the Rev. Henry Venn. These, and similar works
about the south-eastern languages of Africa, have entirely destroyed those
unfounded notions of an infinite number of rude and poor tongues. We now
know, that dialects of the Galla language, which in the North joins the
Abyssinian, a very fine specimen of grammatical structure and euphonic
formation, are spoken, at least as far as the fifth degree south of the equator ;
that it penetrates deeply into the continent along the eastern coast of Africa ;
that it is joined by the noble Caff re idioms, which also enter far into the in

terior ; and that the Congo idioms on the western coast, if not cognate, are

at least very analogous in structure, as the Galla and C afire languages arc

decidedly among themselves*.
    They besides all bear on them vestiges of primitive affinity, according to

our principles, with the great tripartite stock. But if we are asked, do these

languages belong to Chamism, or do they stand on the degree represented by
 Semitism ? we are obliged to answer, neither the one nor the other. On the

contrary, applying to them the principles we have endeavoured to establish
as the general principles of development, we must confess that they stand on
Japhetic ground. The primitive state of Chamism, exhibiting the germ both
of Semitism and of Japhetism, is evidently left behind in those advanced

formations. There is a further development, but that development does not

run in the Semitic line. In the Semitic formations,_the copula is constantly
expressed by the pronominal form (lie), whereas the Iranian, as well as the
Turanian, therefore all Japhetic languages, have already the more abstract
                                              (to be). In    this decisive cha
and therefore more advanced verbal      form  the Japhetic.    And so they do
racteristic those African tongues side  with

in the whole system of conjugation in opposition to the Semitic conjugation,
as explained above. As the American and, in a certain manner, all Turanian
languages are distinguished by their system of incorporation, and in parti
cular of agglutination of words, together with that of postposition ; thus
these African idioms bear the type of prefixes and indicate the congruence
of the parts of speech by changes in the initials of the words. Lepsius' pre
liminary observations respecting the two languages of the Upper Nile, dis

covered and analysed by him, lead to the supposition, that they too represent

a decidedly greater advancement than the Egyptian.
   The ulterior question then will be, have those languages (in form and in

matter) passed through the Chamistic formation ? And if so, is their primary
formation reducible directly to Asiatic Chamism, or have they passed through

the Egyptian ?
   We feel unable to answer these questions. The combined progress of the

study of the language of Egypt and of those of central and southern Africa,
will, perhaps in a few years, enable us to see clearly on this point.

   Nor do we undertake to answer the question whether that wreck of the
primitive language, that great monument of inorganic structure, the Chinese,

can be linked by any scientific method to the other families of human speech,

and thus, directly or indirectly, connected with the great tripartite civilizing
family of mankind. But we add, there is no scientific proof that it cannot.
Chinese philology, from a general point of view, is in its infancy. Morrison's

merit consists in having given us a tonic dictionary, that is to say, a dictionary
which does indeed deserve that name, an alphabetic collection of sounds, not
a system of signs. But the execution of this laudable plan is very defective.
The object of real philology must be to classify, with the necessary regard for
the accent, the numberless significations of a full root or syllable, in such a
manner, that the primitive significations may be discovered ; for, as is the
case still in the Egyptian, one sound comprises generally many roots now
apparently identical, but originally different. The ancient style ought to be
J),consulted for this purpose, if not exclusively, at least most particularly.
Treating in this manner for instance, the roots ngh (the pronoun  and

the roots for father and mother (foo and moo), the original substantial
meauing of the two last words will be easily ascertained, and the signification
of recite, speak, speaking for ngu, lead to the natural origin of the prono
minal signification. Nor is it less important to discover the original pro

nunciation and the phonetic rules of that language. Endlicher has been the

first, in his Chinese grammar, to consult the language on this point. Finally,
we cannot help thinking, that a system of transcriptions in Latin characters

ought to be introduced in the tonic dictionary as well as in the grammar,
and the ancient texts published in the same manner. The philological as

well as the historical treasury of Chinese literature would thus become ac
cessible to the philosophical and comparative study of that most interesting

language. It is only by being taken up by general scholars in this way,
that we may hope to gain a basis for the comparison of roots ; although we
are far from denying that the historical study of the signs by the professional
Chinese scholar will also contribute much to the real understanding of that
peculiar formation. The study of the Tibetan or Bhotiya language, and

that of the Burmese, would probably offer the nearest link between theis       ; it,
Chinese and the more recent formations ; but even the comparison withis
Sanscrit roots will not be without results.        a

   It would be presumptuous to anticipate the issue of such well-prepared

and sifted comparisons ; but we have no hesitation in saying, that we incline
to believe it will be in favour of the existence of a primitive connexion.
There is a gap between that formation and all others ; and that gap corre
sponds probably to that caused in the general development of the human race
by great destructive floods, which separate the history of our race from its
primordial origines. In this sense the Chinese may be called the monument
of antediluvian speech. Indeed the first emigration from the cradle of man
kind is said in Genesis to have gone eastward.

   But whatever be the result, there is only one method of arriving at and
that a combination of accurate philological observation and analysis with
philosophical principles, and with the collateral researches of history and of
physiology. It only by such combination of researches that we can hope
to fix definitively the place of the Chinese language in the general history of
human speech, and to pronounce with historical certainty on the great ques
tions connected with that problem. The difficulties are immense but
greater ones have been overcome in the last thirty years, and we believe that
our method of distinguishing between primary and secondary formation,
and of determining the succession of the phenomena of development, and
thus of languages, will not be found entirely useless in the pursuit of those
ulterior researches. At all events, we flatter ourselves that we have made

good our assertion, that the Egyptologic discoveries are most intimately
connected with the great question of the primeval language and civilisation
of mankind, both in Asia and Africa, and that they give a considerable sup
port to the opinion of the high, but not indefinite antiquity of human history,
and to the hypothesis of the original unity of mankind and of common
origin of all languages of the globe.

On the Importance of the Study of           ethxetanCte.ltiBc yLaDnrg.uaCghe aarsleesxhMibieteyderb.y
   the Modern Celtic Dialects still

IThe subject on which have ventured to address this meeting, is one which

appears to me particularly well- adapted for the purposes of the British
Association, as it deserves attention in a national as well as a general point of
view, being connected not less with the special history of this country, both
political and intellectual, than with the universal history of human civilization

and intellect I shall endeavour to point out the high importance, both histo

rical and philological, of the study of the Celtic language, as exhibited by the
modern Celtic dialects still extant, and shall lay before my hearers some of

Ithe new facts and views pertaining partly to general history, partly to the

history of human language in particular, which, believe, I have, in the
course of my study of the Celtic language and literature, succeeded in dis

covering.                   two great dialects or languages,                                   each composed '
   Modern Europe possesses
Iof three separate idioms, which exhibit what we may call the modern Celtic.

The word Celtic use as a generic name for all the different idioms and

dialects, evidently united amongst themselves by a systematic family-likeness
of grammatical features, once spoken by the different nations and tribes,
which in the Greek and Latin records of ancient history are usually desig
nated under the general name of KeXreu (KeXroi) and Celta? *, and still spoken
by their descendants. The two great dialects of modern Celtic may be seen,
each with its three                 only one of which is actually
                     subdivisions,                                                             extinct,       on the
following table :--

1. The Gallic or British, comprehending --

   a. The Fenic or Irish.

      b. The Highland Scottish (Gaelic).
      c. The Manx f.

  It appears from this table, that five of the modern Celtic dialects, and

four of those still extant, belong to this country, while the sixth, the Armo
rican or the dialect of Brittany, belongs to a district which, although situated
in a foreign country, yet is British by its population, since it was in the
fourth and fifth century of our era entirely colonized by British settlers,
and named by them after their motherland, the latter becoming henceforth

   This table is on the whole the same as that given by Dr. Prichard in his ' Eattern
Origin of the Celtic Nation.' I have only added the names Gallic and Fenic, both of
which are of too frequent occurrence, and of too significative import in the ancient national
records (particularly the Irish), not to find a place in a pedigree of the Celtic. As for the

inclined to consider as another more mutilated form of the same word, a contraction
namely of Gwadhal or Gaodhal. (cf. the name of S. Vodoahu.)

 distinguished from its colony by the name of Great Britain *. Thus this
 country, which was once, as Caesar tells us, the acknowledged classical seat
 of Druidical discipline, and, as we may hence infer, of Druidical or old Celtic
 language and literature, is also the principal seat of the modern Celtic, which
 exclusively originated there.

    Some of those who honour me with their attention, may perhaps be asto
 nished to observe that in proposing the use of the expression Ancient and
 Modern Celtic, and in explaining its meaning, I have been tacitly assuming
a fact which, of all facts left to the investigation of comparative Celtic
philology, evidently ought to be proved first, namely the real general identity
of the two languages, or, more accurately, the two ages of language which
we have called the Ancient and Modern Celtic. But every one, however
slightly acquainted with modern Celtological literature, must know that this
identity has already been made the subject of so many exteusive investiga
tions, and received so many clear demonstrations, as not now to require any
additional proof. The fact that all the words, significative names and phrases,
occasionally quoted by the Greek and Latin authors from the language of
the several Celtic tribes, occur, with nearly the same specified form and
meaning, and moreover, with their full etymological explanations, in the
dialects which we are for this very reason justified in calling the modern
Celtic, this important fact, which, involves the grammatical identity of the
two languages in question, has for several centuries engaged the attention
of the learned. Having first been rendered evident by Du Fresne, and
afterwards more strongly insisted on by the school of the so-called Ce/to-
manians, in whose voluminous researches it is indeed the only fact which
they have contributed to elucidate, it has since been laid before the public
in a more compendious and judicious form in several modern books, among
which I need only mention Dr. Prichard's 'Ethnography of the Celtic Race,'
and Diefenbach's ' Celtica.'

    When we consider the full import of this identity with reference to our
knowledge of ancient geography and ethnography, we see at once that it is
of itself sufficient to render the study of the modern Celtic of the highest
importance to the historian. The Celtic nation, whose language still lives in
the mouth of the modern Celtic tribes just enumerated, was, owing to its
migratory instincts and habits, one of the most widely-spread of all the nations
of ancient and modern history, having at various periods covered with its
settlements, and perhaps even simultaneously possessed, a space of country

    * This colonization of Brittany, which in the historic records of the Cymry (Trioedd,
Vaughan, 7) is attributed to Cynan Meiriadawc, contemporary of Macsen Wledic (Emperor
Maximus), has conferred upon this hero, in very early legends preserved both in the Welsh
and Gaelic literature, the renown of a descent into hell and victory over the infernal spirits,
a fiction which doubtless originated in the supposed identity between the realms of death
and lands beyond the sea. V. Gododin, v. 196 (Myvyrian, i. p. 4.) :

                                            Ni dyvu o Vrython

148, 154. The character, at once hold and good-humoured, under which the Gaelic tradition
represents Cvnan or Conan, enables us to recognise in him the type of several other legen
dary heroes of a similar stamp, whose history is a copious and amusing theme for the

       beg leave here to submit to this meeting in few words my opinion on
the different lines of migration by which conceive the Celtic race have pro
ceeded from Asia to Europe, and finally to this country, and on the intimate

connection which seems to exist between the difference of those lines and

the great division of the whole race into two separate branches, correspond

Gaelic branch. Although does not lie within the plan of my discourse to give

strating the importance which we attribute to the study of the Celtic lan

        seems to me, then, that the Celtic nation transported

and more particularly from Asiatic Scythia, to Europe and to this country
by two principal routes, which resumed at different epochs, and thus formed
two great streams of migration flowing as were periodically. The one, in
a south-western direction, proceeding through Syria and Egypt and thence
along the northern coast of Africa, reached Europe at the Pillars of Hercules,

tribe, on whom they always bestowed

and after him called this island Alw-ion (AXoviuc, Albion), L e. the island
of Alw*.

   2nd. The Aedui, who took their name from their god Aed (the Aedd Mawr
of the triads), and after him called this island Aeddon or Eiddyn ( Edin), a
name preserved in that of the town of Edinburgh (Welsh Caer or Dinar
Eiddyn, Gaelic Din Eidinf). The name under which the Aedui of Great
Britain and Ireland are most frequently quoted, and which, contrasted with
the other, may be called their secular name, is that of the Brigantes (identical
with the Welsh family name Brychan, and the Irish Breoghan), and to be
derived from the Welsh word brych, Gaelic breag,fuscus.

   3rd. The Britons (Brython), who took their name from their god Bryt or
Pryd (the Prydyn ap Aedd Mawr of the Triads), and after him called this

island Brytain, Prydain (Ynys Prydain), Great Britain J.

    The respective order in which these three names were bestowed upon the
island is also evident from the situation of those parts to which they became

finally retired, together with the tribe from which it originated, to the most
northern part of the country, which, under the form Albain or Alban, it still
serves to designate : and the name Prydain itself, which since has resumed
its general signification, in the poems of the old Welsh bards generally de
signates the western parts of the Scotch lowlands, whither the Britons had
retired after the arrival of the Belgians *.
As the nations and tribes of this western migration are those to which the
name of Celts and Gauls more particularly refers, so to them belong most
of those characteristics and institutions of the Celtic race -- including the
important one of Druidism -- with which we are made acquainted by Caesar
and Strabo. The language of the western Celts is in its most distinctive
features represented by the British or Gallic branch of the modern Celtic.

   Of the nations and tribes of the eastern migration, the most celebrated are the
so-called Picti and Scoti, who, from the close of the third century of our era,
have for a long period held a leading place in the history of this island. The
names Scoti and Picti both correspond with analogous words of mo
dern Gaelic, the one with the Irish scuite nomades (coll. W. ysgwyd, E. to
scout), the other with the Gaelic pie-t-a, peic-t-a (Welsh, peith), fighting
man, from the Gaelic pic (beic, beuc), Welsh, peith, to scream, to fight (cf.
Anc.-G. viht-an ; Lat. pugn-a). Much more characteristical however than

the part of those chroniclers of the true meaning of an epithet by which Fion

namely, the epithet lMiledh warrior' As far however as regards the Irish
tradition of the Fena having arrived from Spain and Africa, to deny it all
Ifoundation in history would be inconsistent with what we ourselves have said
of the route of the western Celts.  do not hesitate to detect in this tradi

have led, likewise by the African coast, to Spain as well as to this country,
a nation of Scytho-Celtic (Finno- Celtic) race, including the ancient Iberi
and the still extant Basque nation*.
The time when the stream of this eastern migration first reached this island
seems to have been the sixth century a.c, at which epoch, as we learn from
Herodotus (iv. 13), a general commotion took place amongst the different
tribes and nations of Asiatic Scythia, similar to that which 4O0 years later
became the primary cause of the great migration of the Teutonic tribes in
the fourth and fifth century. This great commotion, described by Herodotus,

precipitating the eastern on the western tribes, and extending itself through
the Cimmerii, who then inhabited the shores of the Caspian, to European

Scythia, finally brought the eastern Celts, in the central parts of Europe, into
contact with the western, one of the results of which event was the incursion

of the Galli into Italy.

The Cimmerii just mentioned have been identified by several historians with
Ithe modern Cymry both as regards their name and origin, of which opinion

   readily admit the correctness, inasmuch as this tribe, although now the
principal representative of the Brito-Celtic language and civilization, which

they after their arrival in Great Britain adopted, yet appears to me, by their

name as well as by a portion of their own records, to have originally belonged

Ito the eastern migration. Nor do I, with reference to this admitted identity

of the Cimmerii and Cymry, fear to be taxed with excessive boldness when
propose my opinion on the similar identity of an old Asiatic and of an Irish
tribe, both of which deserve in the                                               of the histo

the warlike greatness of this tribe than by reminding them of the beautiful
poem of Oighidh Llainne Uisnech (the Death of the Sons of Uasin),
which contains, in a mythological and symbolical form, the story of the final
destruction of this tribe in the northern part of Ireland in consequence of a
                           against the Picti or Cruithne? And what stronger

it only in the two derived words Talaeth and Talais, has for its simple form and meaning
substituted the word Teulu, which is still derived from the same root. The contact between

   In tracing this rapid sketch of the earliest Celtic migrations and settle
ments, and in endeavouring to unravel some of its most interesting and atis
the same time most intricate portions by an etymological explanation ofa
names of places and persons through means of the modern Celtic, may
perhaps hope have succeeded in impressing on the minds of my hearers
conviction of the validity of my first argument in favour of the study of this

language, inasmuch, namely, as serves to elucidate ancient and modern

ethnology. And would also hope, that in reminding my hearers, while
tracing this sketch, of the multitude of nations with whom the different Celtic
tribes were brought in contact during that primitive part of their history,

  shall have prepared them for entering the more readily with me on the
second argument in favour of that study, which am now about to develope.
The knowledge of the modern Celtic indispensable, to discern and appre
ciate in many of the European languages, both ancient and modern, that
portion of heterogeneous elements which they have received from their more
or less intimate and lasting contact with the ancient Celtic.

   It not only in the different Teutonic languages that such introduction
of Celtic elements observable we find them for instance in the Latin also,
into which they came through the contact of the Romans with the Umbrians

and the Galli, and we find them to considerable extent in the Spanish and
French, both of which partly acquired them through the Latin, partly re
tained them from the conquerors of the Iberians and Aquitanians. But
true that in the Teutonic languages the extent and influence of these Celtic
elements much more considerable than in any of the three just mentioned,
which we may easily account for, by the fact that the Teutonic tribes found
a Celtic population already established in nearly all the countries which
they conquered, and in consequence of their intermixture with could not
but adopt a great number of terms, and even general modes of speaking,
connected with civilization, which, particularly through the influence of
the Druidical discipline, was then superior to their own.

    In undertaking, however, to discriminate those Celtic introductions from
the great genuine mass of any other language, we must take care not to
claim as Celtic that portion of words and grammatical observances which
both languages possess in common, either in consequence of their being
both branches of the great Japhetic stock, or of the primitive unity of human

speech in general. One of two characteristics is always required to enable
us to pronounce an element apparently Celtic, which we detect in another
language, to be really so; either an internal one, which consists in the in
congruity or imperfect connexion of that element with the mass of the
language ; or an external one, consisting in the traceable history of its intro
duction.

With reference to the first of these two characteristics, the most unques

tioned mark by which a great number of Celtic words in English and German

betray their origin, is their exhibiting, by the mode in which the strength (or
quantity) and form of the one or several consonants (mutes) which they
contain   are combined, the scale of articulation which                                Ibelongs to   the Celtic
and not   to the Teutonic. My hearers will understand                                               alluding to

the interesting fact, discovered by James Grimm, that the Teutonic lan

of   thaeppSealnlastciorinticoflanGgruiamgmes's--laawde--viahtaiovne   best known in this country under

the

their own, which in one portion of the Teutonic dialects, the High German,
has undergone a second regular alteration. As we shall have still to refer

on several occasions to this fact, I think it necessary to correct previously
one great error, not less in matter than in name, by which the demonstration
of the law referring to it has hitherto been obscured *. This error consists
in the undefined and confused signification given to the terms tenuis,
media, aspirata, which, instead of denoting, as they do, not only according
to the nature of the matter, but also to the definition given to them by the
Greek and Latin grammarians, the three different degrees of strength
(Zbvauii) or quantity of air with which every letter may be uttered, are used
by the modern grammarians, the first and second (tenuis and media) as de
noting the difference of the surd and vocal form of the consonant, and the
third (aspirata) its alliance with a guttural sound, merely because in the
Greek and Latin, according to the scale of articulation adopted by these
two languages, the tenuis, i. e. the feeble or short consonant,                        d,
                                                                                           is,when mute,

generally affected by guttural articulation^ But every discerning ear
will at once perceive that the English th in thou, and German in du, are

as well tenues, e. feeble, as the French in tu and in like manner, that in
                                                                      t
                                                                                    ;

aspirata, e. strong, as well as in the word two, French deux, German zwei,

     If, now, we apply Grimm's law, thus corrected, to the Celtic languages, we
find that they have preserved on the whole the scale of articulation pertain
ing to the classical languages, more particularly that of the Sanscrit, with
which they correspond in attaching the long quantity, not as the Greek and
Latin do, to the surd form of the mute, but to the vocal.                              shall illustrate
                                                                                       aI

This effect, however, produced upon the Teutonic languages by their
contact with the Celtic is not limited to the introduction of a certain
number of words ; but it extends also over a portion of general grammatical
Iobservances in the etymological and syntactical, as well as in the phonic
department.     shall not exhaust the patience of this meeting by entering
Ion a full examination of all the Celtic influences of such a general kind
which think 1 have detected both in English and German : I shall confine
myself to the consideration of one of them belonging to the phonic depart
ment, which                                                          of articulation of which we

               in which I see                          of an

peculiarity of the Celtic, which, owing to the primitive, innate difference in
the character of the two nations and languages, could not be adopted with
out producing a complete systematic revolution in the phonic department of
the Teutonic. The peculiarity of the Celtic, just mentioned, is that curious
law of transmutation of the initial consonants by which this language is di
stinguished from all others. As a correct explanation of this law has not yet

and at the same time grammatically connected with, another word which ter
minates, or anciently did terminate, with a vowel or the semi-vowel n, the
initial consonant of the word, thus preceded and connected, must accommo
date itself, by a systematic change, either in/on» or shape, of its own articu
lation, to that of the vowel or semi-vowel which preceded it : to such an

effect, namely, that after a vowel, the mute becomes either, under the influ
ence of the guttural flatus inherent in all vowels, aspirate (in the common
English sense of the wordf ), or, under the influence of their vocal power,
vocal when it is surd, and a semi- vowel when already vocal ; and, in a similar

manner, after the semi-vowel n, the mute, either influenced by its nasal arti
culation, assumes a nasal sound, or, influenced
                                                         by its vocal power, turns from

under the influence of the preceding vowel is the kind of change regularly
adopted in Irish, whereas in Welsh the vocalization of the mute is now the
general rule. It is unquestionable, however, from the gradual and even now
only partial adoption of this rule in Welsh, that the Irish usage is the more
ancient of the two, as is still further proved by its striking analogy with that of
the Dagesh lene in Hebrew, which may serve to corroborate the view, founded
in the physiology of sounds, that all mutes were primitively allied with gut
tural aspirations, and consequently, when they return to that alliance, only
recover their full original power. With regard to the two kinds of change
admissible after », that resulting from the nasal power of the semi-vowel has
been adopted in all cases by the Welsh ; by the Irish only when the initial is
a vocal mute ; whereas, when it is a surd in Irish, it becomes affected by the
vocal power of ». The following table will exhibit a comparative view of
the different changes of the initial both in Welsh and Irish :--

    The whole of the changes of initials effected by n, is in the Irish gram
mars known by the name of eclipsis, which refers more particularly to the way
in which the transmutation is written in that language, namely, by placing
the sign of the altered articulation before that of the radical one, which thus
seems eclipsed by the former : for instance, na gcailleach, bpearsan, bfear.

   The eclipsis is especially interesting, on account of the leading place
which it takes in the system of Irish declension, its primitive cause there
being the old Celtic preposition n, denoting the genitive, and in Irish more
particularly the genitive plural, which case, together with the nominative
singular of the feminine gender, marked by the influence of the (suppressed)
feminine eliding a or t, is made, by an ingenious method of combined
expression for the differences at once of gender, number, and case, to deter
mine the entire system (vide examples mentioned above). The suppression
of the feminine vowel and the genitive n in the Irish declension, as well as
the general suppression, both in Welsh and Irish, of the vowels and the semi
vowel n, nearly in all cases of syntax where the transmutation of the initial
consonant takes place, I consider, so far from being a defect in the whole
system, rather one of its particular beauties, inasmuch as, by distinctly show
ing the cause in the effect, it tends to husband the resources of the language,
while it adds to its energy, and to carry the whole system of transmutation,
the principle of which consists in a harmonious accordance of phonic and
etymological distinctions, to the highest degree of perfection. The only
phenomenon in universal grammar, known to me, to which this system, in all
its magical expressiveness can be compared, is the similar one of change of
vowels in the so-called strong conjugation in the Teutonic languages, the prin
ciple of which is to be found likewise in the suppression of a termination which

a too intimate coalescence of the phonic and logical powers of speech, may
be more likely than any method of syntactical expression to obscure in the
mind of the nation the consciousness of those grammatical distinctions to
which owes its origin. That such has been the case evident from all

misapplication given to this system by the Teutonic tribes                      The manner in

which think such misapplication on their part gave rise to their altered
scale of articulation this.

Those combinations of power, quantity, and form in the mute deviating from
the radical scale, which in Celtic are but of syntactical import, and of occa

as the basis of newscale of articulation, radically different from the Sanscritic,
which they had till then retained. This explanation accounts also, as will be
easily seen, for the second alteration which the new scale underwent in High
German, the latter taking for a basis the vocal tenuis, whereas the Gothic
had taken the aspirate, which, as we have observed, must be considered the
more ancient of the two forms of alteration. The Gothic, having adopted the

comparison of the sister dialects.

   It will be known to most of my hearers, that the Japhetic family of lan
guages, on which the labours of modern philology have been chiefly employed,
and of which Bopp, in his Comparative Grammar, may be said to have given
the first etymological analysis, comprises, as exhibited in his work, the
seven following dialects -- the Sanscrit, Old Persian, Greek, Latin, Lithua
nian, Sclavonic and Teutonic. It will be known perhaps also, that in conse
quence of the works of Dr. Prichard and M. Pictet*, the Celtic has, since the

appearance of Bopp's Comparative Grammar, been acknowledged as the
eighth of these sister languages, the entire circle of which, and thereby the
comparative understanding of each of them, seems thus completed. Traces
of the new light, which has been thrown upon this family by the acknow
ledgement of the Celtic as one of the Indo-Teutonic dialects, may already

be perceived in several works of modern philology, particularly in the last
edition of Bopp's Dictionary. One great prejudice however seems still to be
clinging to the school to which we owe the scientific demonstration of the
affinity of the Celtic with the Sanscrit -- intimately connected perhaps with
                                                                     of investigation for which

yielding all the immense advantages which science had reason to expect

in one of its sister dialects. In examining the Celtic, Pictet and Bopp easily
discovered that this language, while in one portion of its grammatical usages
    exhibits systematic affinity with the Sanscrit, in another exhibits an
evident estrangement from it. But Pictet, instead of beginning his analysis

with comparison of these two portions, which he would thus have found to

form one inseparable living whole, limited himself to the analysis of the San-
scritic portion, putting aside the other as mere secondary admixture, the
result as he supposed of accidental contact with one of the non-Japhetic

stinctness requires some farther explanation, for which
attention of my hearers.

When we compare our modern European languages, the English and

French for instance, with the ancient, especially the Latin and Greek, we

are struck by one marked difference in their grammatical characters, namely,
the different manner in which they express relative or incidental notions or
ideas. By the term relative or incidental we designate and distinguish
from the other great class of notions, which we call substantive, all those

notions or ideas which, at the same time that they exclusively represent phe
nomena of a certain general and categorical meaning, moreover represent

each of them, not with reference to itself, but only to two or several other
phenomena which of course always belong to the class of substantive notions.

the proposition is composed, are expressed by the words horse, struck, spear,

whereas the four particles the, is, by, a, express the relative or incidental
notions of the sentence, which evidently does not receive from them the
addition of any new independent element, but merely the connexion and de
Itermination of the three above-mentioned.                     And the equivalent Latin sen
tence which have mentioned will at once have directed the attention of

my hearers to the nature of the difference which we have stated to exist be

tween ancient and modern languages, in expressing relative or incidental
notions. The notions in the above sentence belonging to that class are in

English rendered by four separate and auxiliary words placed beside the prin
cipal, whereas in Latin they are rendered through the inflexion, as it is gene
rally called, of the  latter. But what is inflexion ? It is a system                                    of etymolo
gical combinations,                                                                                     of imitative

which for this reason we may call substantive roots, becomes, in connected
speech, regularly allied with one or several of another class of roots which

differ from the former, both in form and meaning, the one being generally
slighter than that of substantive roots, and consisting not, as most of those,

in a double, but in a simple articulation, the other (the meaning) being always
that of an incidental or relative idea. The place occupied by the incidental

root may be either before or after the substantive root : in the former case

it is  chaallveidngprtehufisx,doannndedinthtehetelramtteirn, flewxhioicnh--iswbhyichfarin  the more general,    suffix.
And                                                                                         a more appropriate   sense

refers particularly to the mode of interchange which takes place between

several incidental roots  as becoming alternately attached to one substantive
root -- we may say that   the great difference alluded to, between ancient and

modern languages, consists in the former expressing incidental notions by
auxiliary words, and the latter by auxiliary roots : for instance, in the ex

ample above given, the notions expressed in English by the words the,                                            is,
by, a, are expressed in Latin respectively by the three suffixes (one of them
double) us, it-ur, o.

   The comparative advantages and disadvantages of these two methods may

be easily understood. The one, uniting the incidental with the substantive

notion under the same emission and intonation of voice, and blending both,

for the mind as well as the ear and the eye, into one organized whole, com
posed, as it were, both of an etymological and a phonic arsis and thesis, is
more fit to exercise the synthetic and artistic capabilities of the human intel
lect, of which moreover it favours the development, by perfecting what may
be called the objective beauty of language, inasmuch as, through the varying
union of a series of suffixes with one unchanging root, it endues the process
of inflexion with the appearance of vital activity. The other method, which

gives distinct breath and accent to each incidental notion, and so both to
the corporeal and intellectual eye is constantly renewing that difficult pro
cess of the understanding, through which the primitive root, which always
involved a full sentence, has decomposed itself into its logical elements,
is better calculated for the exercise of the analytical and discriminating
 powers of the intellect, and as it prevents the meaning even of the slightest
imitative sound from being obscured, serves to quicken the consciousness of
each minute member of the sentence, and thus to augment the subjective
force of the language.

    And now which of these two methods is the more ancient? In the Teu
tonic languages it is certain that the analytical tendency which now predomi

nates in their etymological department is not the primitive one, inasmuch as
it is not found in their most ancient dialect, the Gothic, which has nearly all
the synthetic habits of the Sanscrit and the Latin : and hence, in every lan
guage in which the analytical method of declension and conjugation has been
observed, it has been suspected by modern philology to be the effect of de
composition. But the case is different with the Celtic, which by its entire

structure, as well as by its history, lays claim to a much higher antiquity
than the Teutonic, and reaches back to an epoch in the history of human

speech anterior, as we may infer from philosophical considerations, to that
of the synthetic principle represented by the Sanscrit, and during which the
analytical principle must have prevailed. This conclusion is fully borne out,
and confirmed as a fact, by one of the greatest discoveries of modern philo
            of the Old Egyptian.     This                                  time that it

tongue, only kind of return to their original state. And have no doubt
that this return has been effected not more by their instinctive tendency to
recover the lost perception of the meaning of most of the incidental roots
than by the influence of the Celtic, which in all its non-Sanscritic features

most strikingly corresponds with the Old Egyptian.
   This correspondence refers first, to considerable number of specified roots
and words, which, as far as am aware, belong exclusively to those two lan

guages; e.g.                                Ir. la, day.        clean,  sew-yd, stars.

Secondly, to several incidental roots of great import in the etymological

department : e. g.

3 pers. masc. Eg. ef, o ; W. ev, o.
3 pers. suffix. Eg. f (ai-f, he goes) ; W. f (ai-ff).
2 pers. masc. singular and plural Eg. k (ai-k, thou goest) ; W. ch (&e-ch,you

       were going) ; el-och, thou didst go.
   Indefinite auxiliary verb. Eg. ar, au (ar ai-f) ; W. yr, a (yr ai-ff).
   Thirdly, to the system of combining, in the form of suffixes, the personal
pronouns with the prepositions, a usage similar to that which prevails in the
Hebrew, where personal pronouns are suffixed to substantive nouns, but
which is more remarkable in a linguistical point of view, inasmuch as it im
plies the consciousness of the primitive meaning of prepositions, which was
always that of substantive nouns ; e. g.

Eg. (a)r-of, ar-o, toward him.                  W. ar-n-o (the n is genitive                           pre

--    (a)r-ok, towards thee.                    --    position), upon him.
--    (a)n-ok, about thee.                      --   er-och, towards you.
--    hra-k, before thy face, before thee.      --   am-dan-och, about you.
                                                     rhag-och, before you.

    Fourthly and principally, it refers to the expressing incidental notions by
roots, in the character of separate and independent words, which are used in
                                                                                                       in a
Sanscrit to express      the same notions, but       as suffixes and prefixes,                   and    the
much more limited                                     the conjugation of the                    verb,
                         signification. -- Thus, in

three persons, which the Sanscrit regularly expresses by the personal pro
nouns combined, under the form of suffixes, with the verbal root, are ex

pressed in Celtic sometimes in the same way, but in other cases by the same
pronominal roots under the form of separate auxiliary words, which may be
placed indifferently either before or after the verbal root: a flexibility of

expression to which the Egyptian supplies a parallel, the use of the pronoun,
as suffix, belonging to the sacred, and as prefix to the demotic (popular) dia
lect of this language ; e. g.

    E--g.  sacred dialect, ai-f, ai-k, ai-a (it,  is is,eo).
           demotic dialect, ef-ai, ek-ai, ei-ai.
    W.     can-a-vi (Godod. 612) or can-a-v (canam).
           cen-i-t(i) (canes), can-o (cecinerit).
    --I.
    --
    --                      ti,

                                             ;
           can-er vi,                         evo (canor, caneris, canitur).  can-wyv  (carw).
                                              (canere sum) alternating with
           canu yr wyv
           can-aim (cano) can-t-ar me (canor).
Thus the Welsh indefinite auxiliary verb a, to go, to be, which, even as the
corresponding Egyptian au (Coptic o),
                                                          placed before substantive verbs
(verba concreta) to mark the indefinite mood, appears in Sanscrit and Greek
as the well-known augment: e. g. Welsh, a ddysg-odd, he did teach; Sansc.
a-diks,-a-ta k-liha^e*.
             ;

* The author of this paper was the first, as far as he knows, to indicate this origin
of the augment, in an article on two ancient Italian inscriptions (inserted in the Miincfmer
Gelehrie Anzeigen, April, 1843) and afterwards in the TVipner JahrMicher.
318 REPORT-- 1847.

    And thus also, to mention an instance which I have already alluded to,
the word n, which, alternating with m (and undoubtedly identical with the
word m, ma, place), serves in Egyptian as a preposition to denote all cases,
though particularly the genitive, serves in Celtic (where it is generally con
tained, as we have seen, in the transmutation of the initial) to denote exclu
sively the genitive, and more particularly the genitive plural, to which in
Sanscrit, Greek and Latin, it has been regularly limited: e-g. Egypt, nef n

   Now, weighing all these affinities of the Celtic with the Egyptian on the
one side, and the Sanscrit on the other, I believe we may be justified in say
ing that it occupies a place in history between both, and marks an interme
diate stage in the development of human language, and more especially of
the Japhetic, between the analytical fluidity of its genial infancy and that
beautiful synthetic consistence, so to speak, of its vigorous maturity, as we
find it represented in the Sanscrit.
   The intermediate position which we have assigned to the Celtic, with re
spect to the different epochs of the Japhetic languages, it still holds, as re
gards the relation of this family with the Semitic and Finish, both of which

participate in many of its non-Sanscritic features. It appears to be also by
this internal relationship, much more than by external contact, that we must
explain the resemblance of many Celtic elements with those of two languages,

both of which seem to belong to a Celto-Finish branch, I mean the Basque
and Etruscan*.

   And if at present, once more passing our eye successively over the fields
of ethnology, history of language and philosophy of grammar, we take one
full view of all the light which falls on them from the study of the Celtic, we
may perhaps find it excusable, that the Ccltomanians were so much dazzled
by it as to fancy that in that language they had discovered the mother-tongue
of mankind as well as the key of all worldly and divine science ; though all
that they have achieved in carrying out their fancies has certainly been only
to obscure, and for a long time to discredit, that very study to which they

attached such supreme importance.
  IAs afourth argument in
                               favour     of that  study, and perhaps the most  weighty
of all, might add, the         access     which                                 modern
                                                    it opens to the study of
Celtic literature, a literature as interesting in an artistical as an historical point
of view, and which, by a long series of poetical and historic works, some as
ancient perhaps as the fifth century of our era, and all abounding in the

genuine features of native art and inspiration, exhibits the Celtic origin of
two of the principal elements of modern European literature, rhyme and
allegorical romance. But the very copiousness of this subject forbids me
             upon it on
to  enter                this  occasion.                      hope, in which I sincerely
              conclude   this  discourse
    I shall                               with  the  fervent

trust my hearers participate, that the two dialects of this highly important
and beautiful language, still extant in the island of Pryd, may never cease to
subsist, but may be maintained, both by their own vital energy and by the
enlightened care of the' government, as constituting one of the most pre
cious, as well as most ancient gems in the Imperial Crown.

the Etruscan, vide the article last quoted in the MiincAner Gelehrte Anzeigen.

      the Relation of the Bengali to  the Arian and Aboriginal  Lan
               guages of India. By
                                      Dr. Max Muller.

The interest which the Bengali language presents to oriental scholars, and
which induces them to devote their time to the study of this Indian dialect,
may be viewed under three different heads, as practical, literary, and lin-
guistical.

    On the Jirst point, it is hardly necessary to enter into any details. The
English people, who have been called to rule the destinies of more than a
hundred millions of souls in the East, one-tenth of whom make use of the
Bengali as their vernacular dialect, have well understood the duties of those
who have been appointed to govern this great oriental empire. Great exer
tions have been made to give sufficient training to those who are destined to
execute the various duties connected with the internal government of India ;
and it has not been thought enough that they should receive such an education
as would entitle them to employments in their own country, but it has been
felt that it was peculiarly incumbent upon them to study the languages of the
people over whom they were to be placed, not as the sons of a foreign and

 conquering nation, to raise taxes, to punish disobedience, and to suppress
 every trace of national feeling, but as men devoted to the higher object of
 inspiring confidence, of winning affection, and of promoting for the benefit
 of the native population the benign influence of European civilization.
 With this view of the mission which the English people have been desirous
 of fulfilling in India, it could not be considered enough for an officer to
 understand just so much or so little of Persian and Hindustani, as to deci

 pher representations and complaints, or to convey official decrees to a sub

ject people. For though these two languages may have some claim to be
 regarded as the official languages of India, particularly among the higher
 classes of the natives, yet they are, like the French in Europe, unknown to
 the great mass of the population, and of little use therefore for the ordinary
 purposes of daily life. Although, then, a prejudice may have prevailed
 for some time against the study of the vernacular dialects spoken in the
 large and densely peopled districts of India, it was soon acknowledged, that
 for local communication and for an immediate and effective intercourse with
 the people, a knowledge of provincial languages like the Bengali, Marathi,
 Telugu, Tamil, Carnatika and Cingalese, was of no less importance and
 necessity than that of the more fashionable Persian and Hindustani.

     But, as Professor Wilson, the distinguished president of our Section, whose
 name is as much cherished by the natives of India as it is esteemed by the
 learned men of Europe, well remarks, it is not enough to understand the
 language of a people ; the people themselves must be understood with all their

 popular prejudices, their daily observances, their occupations, their amuse

  ments, their domestic and social relations, their local legends, their national
  traditions, their mythological fables, their metaphysical abstractions, and their

 religious worship. The best means of acquiring such a knowledge is gene
 rally to be found in the literature of the people. It is however necessary to
 confess that upon this point, namely, the literary interest of the language,
  the Bengali is poor, and inferior in this respect to most of the other ver
  nacular languages. There existed, indeed, scarcely anything worthy to
  be called literature in Bengali before the settlement of the missionaries in
  Bengal, and it is due to their unwearied exertions that the Bengali has be
  come in any sense a literary language, and has arrived at a certain degree
 of grammatical regularity. Nor need we be surprised at this, when we
320                                  REPORT -- 1847-

remember that in Bengal, the Sanscrit, though no longer a living and

spoken language, continued to be employed as the learned language by every

literary man, just as in Europe for many centuries we meet with scarcely
any literary composition in the language of the people, while voluminous
works were composed and circulated in Latin, then in a great measure a

dead language.
    But though it has been customary for a long time to appreciate the value

of a language by either its merely practical use, or by the interest which its
literature was capable of exciting, yet the study of languages has, parti
cularly in latter days, taken a new turn, and instead of considering alan

guage only as a useful instrument for social conversation or literary amuse

ment and instruction, men begin at length to understand that language has
of itself an intrinsic value, which recommends its study to all those who
think it a worthy occupation to investigate the nature of the human mind

in its first and primitive manifestation by language, and in the historical
progress and individual developments of
                                                it,preserved to us in the num
                                                          in
berless branches of human speech. This study, usually called Comparative
Philology, has taken for its base the analytical comparison of the gram
matical and etymological structure of language
                                                              different countries and

ages, and has succeeded,      in by  pointing out striking affinities as well as cha-

racteristical discrepancies,         arranging the languages of the most prominent
nations of the world into great families, which have spread from the south

to the north in many and diverse forms, though at the same time united
unextinguishable marks of former unity and affiliation. With this dis
                             in                                                it

would be difficult to characterise this language better than                "  the   words

The great advantage however which Sanscrit offers to the study of Com
parative Philology, consists not only in the perspicuous originality of its
                                              the rich variety of its etymological deriva
grammatical structure, and     in

a
            in
of language through all the stages of its development, from the early
period of its Vedic Inspiration, through that of its Epic poetry; its didactic

moral and legal compositions its philosophical speculations, dramatic repre
sentations and lyrical effusions, down to that which may be called its Alexa
andrine period, and the age of the final extinction of all its vital principles;;

development of what we generally call the Romance languages. For, as the
old language of Rome and Italy, after losing its vital strength and expressive
power, and after entering into a state of entire stagnation and putrefaction,
formed thereby a kind of mould, or as Chevalier Bunsen has called it yes
terday, a kind of humus, from which again a variety of other languages
sprung up, full of new life, and fit to serve the intellectual wants of a new
age, so we see iu India different modern dialects arising from the tomb of
the Sanscrit language.

Among these new languages the Bengali has the highest claims on our
attention, because it has preserved a closer affinity to the Sanscrit than any
one of the other derived languages.

   All the languages now spoken in India, with the exception of the dia
lects of some savage Vindhya tribes, may be divided into two great
classes, viz. those of the north and those of the south, of which the northern

have strong claims to an Indo-Germanic origin, while the southern seem to
be more closely connected with the language of the aboriginal and non-
brahminical inhabitants of India, modified to a greater or less degree, par
ticularly in their literary employment, by the influence of the dominant
Sanscrit. But even in the north of India, and among a people who, immi
grating into this country, brought with them their own language, religion
and civilization, there existed many dialectic differences which are not to

be considered as mere corruptions from the Sanscrit, but as independent
contemporaneous idioms. These are generally called the Pracrit dialects ;
and some of them have their own peculiar name, derived from the countries
wherein they were spoken, as for instance, the SaurasSni, the language of
Surasena, the Sdrasvala, spoken on the banks of the Sarasvati, the Ma-
gadhi or Pali, the language of Magadha, and probably the dialect spoken
in this country at the time when the Buddhistical religion took its historical
origin, and therefore employed by the founders of that system, who, ad

dressing themselves to the people, were obliged to use the native language,
instead of the then already obscure idiom of the sacred books of the Brah
mins. It may be observed that in the Vedic hymns also, which belonged
to different Arian families and congregations who settled in India, some dia

lectic differences and many grammatical discrepancies occur, which some

times bear a slight resemblance to Pracrit forms ; a fact, of which my learned
friend Dr. Weber, who has promised an edition of the Yajurveda, intends to
afford ample proofs from the hymns and Brahmanas of this Veda. As far
however as our knowledge goes at present, we must consider the Sanscrit
of the Vedas, together with the whole classical literature of the Hindus, as
a language dialectically differing from the Pracrit, though both branches de
rive their origin from the same source. They stand to each other in a rela
tion similar to that in which the High German stands to the Low German,
that is to say, they proceed with a sort of parallelism, sometimes approach

ing each other very nearly, sometimes diverging considerably, so that a
                                would   find great difficulty in understanding the
person speaking the one         in the  same place, with frequent communications

other at first, yet, if living
with the people who were speaking the other, he would find much greater
facilities in acquiring a knowledge of this dialect than of any really foreign

language.                               x

This must, indeed, have been the fact in India. First, we see at the time
of Buddhism, people in daily intercourse speaking these two languages ;
then we are told that the author of the most famous Pracrit grammar, Katyd-
yana, was the same who wrote additional notes to the great work on Sans-

crit grammar by Panini, his contemporary or immediate predecessor ; and,
finally, we find in one branch of Sanscrit literature, which was more than
any other destined for the higher as well as for the lower classes, viz. in
the dramatic compositions, a constant mixture of Sanscrit and Pracrit dia
lects, which unfold there an unexpected wealth of melodious poetry.
Strange as such a combination of different dialects may seem, we find a
similar fact in Italy, where each of the masked persons in the Comedie deW
arte was originally intended as a kind of characteristic representation of
some particular Italian district or town. Thus Pantaleonc was a Venetian

merchant, Dottore a Bolognese physician, Spaviento a Neapolitan bragga-
doccio, Puliicincllo a wag of Apulia, and Arlechino a blundering servant of
Bergamo. Each of these personages was clad in a peculiar dress ; each
had his peculiar mask, and each spoke the dialect of the place which he
represented. Besides these and a few other such personages, of which at
least four were introduced into e^ich play, there were the Amorosos and
Inamoratas, that is, some men and women who acted various parts with Sme-
raldina, Colombina, Spiletta and other females, who played the parts of ser-
vetlas or waiting-maids.     All these spoke Tuscan or Roman, and wore no

masks.
All the Indian dialects, which under their ancient form are hardly sur
passed by the Sanscrit itself in the copiousness and originality of their
grammatical forms, had, as the language of a great portion of the people,
an ever-increasing influence upon the modern languages of India, and
entered largely into the formation of almost all the spoken dialects in the
north, while in Bengali, except some analogous corruptions by contraction
and assimilation, which every language undergoes in the mouth of a people,
there are very few traces of the Pracrit dialects. I consider therefore the

Bengali, as the modern Sanscrit standing to its parent, the old and classical
Sanscrit, almost in the same relation as the modern High German to the old
High German, as the modern Italian to the language of Rome.
   The differences which I have tried to point out in the course of my gram

matical analysis of the Bengali language, are chiefly these : the great variety
of suffixes and internal changes of words, which served to express the different
local and causal relations which one object may have with another, that is,
the whole system of the ancient declensions is almost entirely lost, because
the people corrupting the form and forgetting the proper meaning of those
formative syllables could no longer express by them what they wished ;
they substituted therefore for them new and expressive suffixes, employed

prepositions, and had recourse to compounds, in order to express an idea
which the older language was able to express by the simple changes of a
vowel. The same thing took place in the system of conjugations, where

the old and simple forms were, with few exceptions, superseded by peri-

phrastical formations. Besides, the meanings of the words were themselves
subject to the same influence ; they became emaciated and debilitated, and
after losing soul and body, were degraded into a kind of conventional money,
like paper currency, well adapted for a modern  age. In
as we hardly feel what we are expressing, for   instance,  the  tshaemwe omrdasnn"er,I

weighed and duly considered, they would afford us another sort of logic
and critic, than what we have hitherto been acquainted with."
   The question about the origin of the dialects now spoken in India has

occupied the attention of many of the most distinguished Orientalists.
Colebrooke, in his article on the Sanscrit and Prakrit languages, does not
give his opinion quite clearly about the distinction which is to be drawn be
tween the northern and southern dialects, a distinction which was afterwards
established by the ingenious Essays of Ellis. Afterwards, whenever a ques
tion arose about the languages now current in India, the constant answer has
been, without contradiction, that the languages spoken in the north are of
an Indo-Germanic descent, while those in the south belong to a different
stock. The best proof of the Sanscrit origin of these northern Indian dia
lects was considered to lie in the great number of words adopted from the
Sanscrit, which amount in Hindi and Bengali to nine-tenths, and even in
Marathi to four-fifths of the words contained in the dictionaries of these
languages. Although such a computation of the lexicographic means of

languages would seem to have settled the question definitely, yet we must
confess that the method of proving the common origin of languages by a
mere computation of similar words is not quite in accordance with the prin
ciples laid down by the modern school of linguistic philosophy.

   The great progress in the study of languages, accomplished in our
century, has been, to find the distinctive character of a language, not so
much in the copia verborum, as in the grammatical structure of the
language itself. It is the discovery of this principle which has led the
founders of comparative philology to those triumphant conclusions, by
which they have brought idioms distant in time and space back to one
source and to one general principle. Comparisons which in the last century

·were considered as undeniable, as mors, ftopos, mord, are now looked upon
as untenable, not so much beeause these words do not point to the same
origin, but because the way in which they have been derived grammatically,
and developed logically, can now be proved to have been quite a different
one in the different languages.

prevailed for centuries, as that of deriving the mythology of Greece from
that of Egypt. For as far as the language of these two countries is different
in all that constitutes their respective peculiarity and character, so far the
mythology of Greece is different from that of Egypt. In that country, where
etymology has found the roots and the most primitive and transparent form
of the grammatical system of the Greek and Latin languages, mythology
will find the first formations and the very genesis of their religious system.-.
In order to succeed, however, such an inquiry must be based upon sound

and historical principles. It can lead to no satisfactory conclusion, to com
pare a secondary formation of Indian mythology like the system of the
Purauas with the mythology of Homer, which although on many points more
ancient than the Puranic mythology, is nevertheless not to be considered as
a primitive one. But if we go back to the oldest form of Indian mythology
        we find in the Vedas, if even then

of all  that is accidental or secondary in       more than the Greek or Latin

          -- but at all events

logical ideas took their first beginning, following afterwards in their develop
ment the individual and national development of the different branches of
the Arian stock.

   In the same way as comparative philology has formed this new basis for a
true appreciation of mythology, it has also given quite a new feature to
ethnology and archaeology. It has become possible to arrange the most
prominent nations of the world into great families, on the ground of the

connection between the languages spoken by them, and particularly according

to the grammatical genius of these languages. And if we look at those im
portant discoveries, which partly have been made, partly are still preparing,
in reference to the old history and archaeology of the empires of Baby
lon, Assyria, Media and Persia, how could these grand results have been
Ifachieved without the aid of a thorough knowledge of general and compara
tive grammar?     we compare the manner in which, at the beginning of this
century, a man of the name of Lichtenstein tried to decipher the inscriptions
of Babylon, merely by the similarity in the shape of letters and the supposed
similarity in the sound of words with a Semitic idiom, with the system upon
which similar studies are now conducted by men like Burnouf, Lassen, Itawlin-
son, Hincks and Benfey, we must admit that linguistic science has created quite
a new field for these archaeological inquiries. For when once we know to
which family of languages the idiom of these old inscriptions belongs, the 

grammatical forms themselves, as they may be determined by approximative
conjectures, become an instrument for deciphering the alphabet, and particu

larly the vocalism of the old language. It is true that till at present this has
been achieved with the Iranian inscriptions only, when all the latest discove
ries concerning the peculiar character of many letters and the whole system
of inherent vowels have only been arrived at by means of a thorough know
ledge of the Iranian grammar. But the light begins to dawn also upon the

rocks of Van and the ruins of Babylon ; and if we may judge by faint
glimpses, the language of the one will be an Indo-Gernianic one, while that of
the other points more to a Semitic origin.
         ON ETHNOLOGY.                      325

If then it is true that the grammatical system constitutes the character of

a language, and assigns to every idiom its proper place in relation to other
languages, we must admit that for the modern Indian dialects little has yet
been done to prove their Indo-Germanic origin. The consequence of this has
been, that the hostile spirit of a party, which has been working for the last
years, particularly in India and in this country, to attack all the theories of
Sanscrit antiquarians, has chosen the modern languages of India as a weak

point, in order to prove that, as they have no connexion by their grammatical
system with the pretended old language of India, the Sanscrit, this sacred

language itself has never exercised any real influence upon the people, just
as they have tried to prove that the literature, the religion, morals and philo
sophy of the Brahmins have never historically existed but in the hands of

some foreign immigrating priests.
   This has been a natural reaction against another system, which in its

enthusiasm for Brahminism was as unscientific as the other, and which saw

Brahmins, Brahminical wisdom, mysteries and religion, not only in every part
of India from the remotest time, but which found Brahmins as the founders
of civilization over the whole world, connected not only with the religious
systems of Egypt and Greece, but even at the bottom of the Christian doc
trine. Instead of this ubiquity, which was formerly ascribed to the Brahmins,
we find it difficult at present, if adopting the views of this anti-Brahminical

school, to assign even the smallest place in India to them ; so that at last, if

they do not submit to become antediluvian Buddhists, they will be exiled into
the plains of Tartary, from where we are taught now that the grammatical

Isystem of the spoken Indian dialects took its origin.
   But, as have said before, I consider this negative tendency as a natural

reaction against many too positive assertions, which have been current with

out sufficient proof. I think even that, as in every other branch of science,

this sceptic and negative spirit, which has called into doubt the most im
portant and fundamental points of Indian antiquities, has caused a great deal

Iof good, by calling forward new inquiries and deeper researches. Nor do

deny that the principle upon which the intentions of this negative school are

professedly based may be a wise and philanthropic one, in so far as they be

lieve that, by proving Brahminism to be neither unfathomable in its antiqutiy
nor unchangeable in its character, it may be allowed to infer that by proper

means, applied in a cautious, kindly and forbearing spirit, such farther changes
may be effected as will raise the intellectual standard of the Hindus, improve

their moral and social condition, and assist to promote their eternal welfare.
But, after all, an independent, historical and philosophical inquiry into the
origin, antiquity, and the development of Indian civilization has nothing to

do with political and moral considerations ; and if English Christian mission
aries want to find precedents for the changeableness of the Brahminical reli
gion, they will have a much better case by proving historically the influence
which the Buddhist belief has produced on the anterior system of Brah

minism, than by asserting that Brahminism has never existed as the religion
of the people before the rise of Buddhism.
In the scarcity of historical documents for deciding such questions, it has
always appeared to me that the language of India itself, in the different forms
under which it appears to us during its historical development, woidd be the
Ifbest, and sometimes the only means of giving to such questions a definite
answer.  after a lapse of two thousand years any one should attempt to

prove that the Christian religion has always existed from the earliest time in

Europe, that documents written in Italian were to be considered as the real
documents of the Christian doctrine, and that other documents, if written in
326 report-- 1847.

Latin, were only to be considered as written in a language which had been
derived and put together (sanskrita) artificially by learned priests, but that
this language itself had never been the language of a people living on the
same soil with a different religion before the rise of Christianity, it would
still be questionable whether, even in the supposed absence of all historical

of an artificial development, just as the Latin of the fourth and fifth century
shows that it is no more the language spoken by the great mass of the people,
but only employed as a learned and sacred language. Now, admitting even
for argument sake, that all other internal proofs were wanting of the Christian
doctrine having been addressed to people who had been living for centuries
Ion the soil of Italy, having their own heathenish religion and their own old

language, think that the very fact that some of our religious books are
written in an evidently learned language, while other3 are written in a spoken
language, the whole grammar of which gets organically intelligible only by a
reference to that learned language, would go far enough to prove that this
learned idiom was at the time of early Christianity a dead or dying language,
and must therefore have been a living one many centuries before. And if
       good fortune should                                                   books written in Latin,

astic Latin as the language of Plautus from the Latin of schoolboys ; if this

of language would not hesitate for a moment to admit the precedence of an
old Latin as well as of the Sancrit, merely on the ground of evidence lying
Iin the language itself.
                                            admit that some questions may still be to be
   Although, therefore,
Ianswered and some doubts to be removed concerning the relation of Buddh

ism to Brahminism and of Pali to Sanscrit, yet think that by the latest
researches of Indian scholars like Wilson, Burnouf and Lassen, it has been

established that the Brahminical people have brought at an early period the
light of civilization into the plains of India ; that their language was the lan
guage of the nation, though varying in different popular dialects ; that their
religion constituted the groundwork of the Indian worship, though modified
by local traditions; that their laws and manners formed the social ties of
the Indian world, though often in struggle with heterogeneous elements.
   But nevertheless new efforts have been made to prove, on the very
ground of language, that the present nations of India are to be considered

as altogether free and emancipated from Brahminical influence. For if
language constitutes the spirit of a nation, and if the spirit of a language
lies in its grammatical system, it would certainly be a startling fact, if it
could be proved, that the whole grammatical system of the modern lan
guages of India has nothing to do with Sanscrit grammar. And this they
have tried to prove, taking for their base the opinions of comparative philo
logists, who have admitted that the whole system of declension and conjuga
tion in Bengali and the other Indian dialects is unexplainable by the rules

of Sanscrit grammar.   Schleiermacher  for instance, in his  '  Essay on the  In
                       the Language,'                           une question
fluence of Writing on                   says : --" Or c'est                    de

savoir si jamais le peuple du Bengale, descendu probablement de ces habi-
tans primitifs, s'appropriat entiureinent le Sanscrit, ou bien s'il ne se format
pas des le commencement de son assujettissment a des etrangers plus civilises
que lui, une langue plus semblable a son idiome actuel qu'au Sanscrit, en

supprimant les formes grammatical es trop difficiles de celui-ci et n'adoptant

que les mots. On ne peut pas prutendre qu'il est invraisemblable, qu'un
peuple tout entier ait accept^ l'idiome de quelques pretres et guerriers ; car
nous avons vu cela s'effectuer au royaume d' Assam, qui dans les temps
anciens doit avoir fait partie des pays Hindous. Cependant plus tard on y a
eu jusqu'au commencement du dix-septieme siecle une langue, des livres et
des institutions semblables a celles des pays au-dela du Gange ; mais alors
les Brahmans s'introduisirent dans ce pays, y repandirent leurs doctrines,
convertirent le roi, et bientot un dialecte Bengale remplaca l'ancien idiome,
de sorte que celui-ci appartient maintenant presque entitlement aux langues
mortes."

   Now one must admit, that if such a fact could be proved, that the gram
matical elements of the Bengali are not originally Sanscritic, but belong to
another system of languages, this would change entirely the view which we
have taken of the ethnographic and linguistic relations of the inhabitants
of India, and bring on the same confusion as if it could be proved that the
grammatical system of the modern Persian was not of an Iranian character,
or that the English language was not of a Teutonic origin. For why do we
call the English language a Teutonic one, if not because the Saxons, settling
in Britain, did not change the grammatical character of their language, al
though they adopted many words from the Celtic nation which they sub
dued ? And why do we not say, that after the Norman conquest the

language of England became a Norman language, if not because, though
overgrown with Norman words, it preserved its own grammatical system ?
Why are the Romance called Romance, and the Teutonic, Teutonic lan
guages? Because the Teutonic race, when brought into contact with
Roman civilization and language, found in its strongly developed nationality

sufficient strength to appropriate and incorporate into its language a great
number of Latin words, without giving up the essentially Teutonic form of
its grammar, while the Celtic nations yielded to the overpowering influence of
the Roman civilization, and adopted not only the substantial but also the
formative element of the Latin language, thus giving rise to new languages,
which cannot be considered as Celtic idioms, but as branches of the Latin

language, modified and developed by Celtic elements.
Looking then from this point of view at the question about the origin of
the grammatical forms in the modern Indian languages, I thought it neces
                                                       I was convinced that it
sary to take this subject into serious consideration.

would be possible, either to account for the heterogeneous influence which
has been acting upon the languages of the Indian nations, or to find a con
necting link between the grammar of the old and modern Indian dialects.

The results of my inquiry I have laid down in a Comparative Grammar of
the Bengali Language, and I shall quote thence a few points in answer to
a theory which has been proposed in regard to the grammatical structure of
the Bengali language by the Rev. Dr. Stevenson, whose extensive knowledge
of dialects spoken in India, which he had the opportunity of studying on the
Ispot, entitles his views to great attention and careful examination.

     quite agree with Dr. Stevenson in the manner in which he tries to

prove that there existed in India an aboriginal language different from the
328 report-- 1847-

Sanscrit and its dialects, by showing that there are many words in common
use, especially in the languages of Southern India, that cannot, after making
every allowance for corruption, be derived from the Brahminical tongue.
He alleges that there are a great many of the words derived from the Sans
crit which are used only by Brahmins, while others of the same meaning,
but of a different origin, are constantly substituted by the common people.
He further observes that there are several Sanscrit letters which are never
introduced into the spoken languages of India, or which, if introduced,
none but Brahmins can pronounce. Innumerable combinations of letters
are uniformly deprived of one of their members, or have a vowel interposed
between the two consonants ; and in the south of India several letters are

used that are not found in Sanscrit. Starting from these observations, Dr.

Stevenson further proves that these elements, which enter so largely into
the spoken languages of India, cannot be considered as used at random in

Ifevery particular province, but that they are the same, or nearly so, in all
the different spoken languages in India.  we can trace, he says, a lan

guage wholly different from the Sanscrit in all the modern dialects, the

northern as well as the southern, after separating also the easily recognised
importations by the Mahomedan conquerors of India, it will seem to follow
that the whole region previous to the arrival of the Brahmins was peopled
by the members of one great family of a different origin. That family may
have been divided into different branches; one of these may have preceded
the other in their migrations, yet oneness of language would seem to point
to oneness of origin, especially since both history and tradition are silent as

to any wide-spread influence exercised in ancient times by any foreign tribe,
except the Brahminical. Dr. Stevenson calls the Brahmins a foreign tribe,
in accordance with indications derivable from the cast of their features and
the colour of their skin, as well as from their possessing a language which
none of the natives of India but themselves can even so much as pronounce ;
and the constant current of their own traditions, making them foreign to
the whole of India, except perhaps a small district to the north-west of the
Ganges. Even in the time of Manu, the whole country to the south of the
Vindhya mountains and Nerbudda river was inhabited by men who did not
submit themselves to the Brahminical institutions, and among whom he ad

vises that no Brahmin should go to reside.
   So far as these premises go, I quite agree with Dr. Stevenson ; and it

is even commonly admitted that the Brahminical religion and civilization
were brought into India from without. Professor Wilson has ingeniously
treated this question in his translation of the Vishnupurana, where he
comes to the conclusion, that the earliest seat of the Hindus within the
confines of Hindusthan was undoubtedly the eastern confines of the Panjab*,
and that the holy land of Manu and the Purans lies between the Drishadvali
and SurasvaU rivers, the Caggar and Sursooty of our barbarous maps.

Various adventures of the first princes and the most famous sages occur
in this vicinity ; and the Asramds, or religious domiciles of several of the
latter, are placed on the banks of the Sarasvatl. According to some autho
rities, it was the abode of Vyasa, the compiler of the Vedas and Puranas.
     But in the Veda itself there are many facts which, according to my
 opinion, put it beyond all doubt that the Brahminical people was of an
 Arian origin, who, from Iran, the birth-place of their language, religion

 and civilization, immigrated into India. I hope that this point, .is well

 as many others in the ancient history of the Brahminical people, will

Jtttv|ivee a new light by the publication of the Veda. That a knowledge

of the sacred writings of the Hindus is indispensable for a true appre

ciation of the whole intellectual development of this people, everybody
admits, for the Veda bears the same relation to Indian antiquities as the
Old Testament to the Jewish, the New Testament to the Christian, and

the Koran to the Mahoniedan history. The religion, worship and man
ners, poetry and philosophy of the Hindus, derive their source in common
from the Veda, the monument of a religion, which, by its origin, belongs to
the most ancient, and by its effects to the most important of all the Religions
with which Divine Providence decreed to begin the great work of the edu
cation of the human race. It has often been regretted, that while so many
editions of dramatic works like Sakonlala, of codes of law like Manu,
of philosophical systems like the Veddnta, have been published, almost
nothing has yet been done for the Veda. Colebrooke's excellent article on
the Vedas, or the sacred writings of the Hindus, remained for a long time
our only source of information upon this subject, and it is possible that the
opinions of this learned orientalist, while they excited a great degree of
interest, discouraged at the same time further inquiries. Colebrooke, who
             first authority                literature,                      of his essay,
"is    the  ancient dialect    on Indian    Vedas are    says at the   end
     The                      in which the                composed,   and   especially that

of the three first Vedas, is extremely difficult and obscure ; and though
curious, as the parent of a more polished and refined language (the classical
Sanscrit), its difficulties must long continue to prevent such an examination
of the whole Vedas as would be requisite for extracting all that is remark
able and important in those voluminous works."
     But Dr. Rosen, convinced of the necessity of arriving at a complete know
ledge and perfect understanding of the Vedas, undertook to prepare an edi
tion of the whole Rigveda, and thus withdraw those manuscripts from that ob
scurity to which they might otherwise have been consigned for a much longer
time in the libraries of England. The Rigveda is doubtless the most import
ant of the Vedas, because it presents to us the old poems in their original form,
and as they were conceived by the old inspired Ristris ; while the other two,
the Soma and Yajurveda, contain only isolated fragments of similar poems,
digested and amplified in accordance to the requirements of the Indian cere
monial. As to the fourth, the Atharvaveda, it belongs to a posterior period,
and contains also for a great part hymns of the Rigveda. It cannot be
sufficiently regretted that the premature death of Dr. Rosen interrupted
this meritorious undertaking, when scarcely the first of the ten books of the
Rigveda was printed. Afterwards it was more the result of circumstances
than the fault of Sanscrit scholars, that an edition of this work has re
mained till now uncontinued.  I am happy however to announce on this

public occasion, that all the material difficulties of such an undertaking have
now been removed by the liberality of the Hon. Court of Directors of the
East India Company, who have but recently, upon the recommendation of

our distinguished president, granted a considerable sum for the publication

of this work, and have enabled me to realize a plan for which I had col

lected during several years all the materials which are to be found in the public
and private libraries of Germany, France and England, without seeing any
chance of printing so voluminous a work. This very day the first sheet of
the text and commentary of the Rigveda has issued from the University
press of Oxford, and I have the pleasure of laying before the committee the
first copies of it.

   In the hymns of the Rigveda, as I just mentioned, we see the Brahmini-
cal tribes advancing step by step along the rivers of the Punjab into the
330 REPORT-- 1847.

plains of the Holy Land (Brahma-varta) ; we see them at war with mighty
kings, and often engaged in hostilities with each other, each immigrating
tribe pushing their predecessors successively more and more down to the
south. Afterwards we see in the descriptions given in the Rdmayana,
Manu and the Mahdbhdrata, how the frontiers of Brahmatarta grow succes
sively wider and wider. The two great royal dynasties of ancient India, the
Solar and the Lunar race, the heroes of which are celebrated in the two
epic poems the Ramuyana and Mahabharata, were settled in Ayodhya and
Pratishthana, that is in the country tributary to the holy river Ganges,
which is mentioned but occasionally in the Veda ; and finally, Brahma-
varta is bounded on the west and the east, not by the rivers Drishadvati

and Sarasvati, but by the ocean ; and on the north and south by the mountains

of the Himalaya and Vindhya.
    The Arian tribes however remained united by their common origin, by

the ties of religion and of their sacred language. It is a curious fact that

the ancient name given to this language by the Brahmins themselves is
chlianilas, which means rhythmical language, chhandas being derived from the
root chhand, to praise, which corresponds to the Latin scandere, as Sanscrit
chhid, to cut, to the Latin scindere. The primitive form of this Indo-Germanic
root is in Sanscrit also skand, meaning to go, to stride, so that chhandas
would originally signify either poetry accompanied by dance, taken in the

ancient Pindaric sense, or any poetical effusion, as if striding along in grave

and majestic measures.

   It is very likely that the name of the sacred language of the old Medians
and Persians, the Zend, for which no satisfactory etymology has yet been
found, has the same origin and meaning, a fact which would be in accord
ance not only with many peculiarities of the Vedic language, which, de
viating from the classical Sanscrit, are frequently to be traced in Zend, but
also with the general features of the religion of these two people, which
clearly point to a common source.

    But although the Arian conquerors seem to have crushed and extin
guished the great mass of the aboriginal inhabitants in the north of India,
yet some of these Autochthones, or early inhabitants of India, who were
considered by the Brahmins as impure and unworthy to partake of their
religious sacrifices, found a refuge in the thick forests of the mountainous
districts, and in the countries south of the Vindhya range, while it is not
unlikely that some of them were tolerated by the Brahmins, so as to remain
in a state of slavery, constituting the class of Sudras, to whom, though they
were not considered as twice-born, like the three other classes, some few
civil rights were conceded, and to whom in latter days even a Brahminical
origin was attributed.

   Now, I think it is very easy to understand how it came to pass, that in
Sanscrit as well as in the modern dialects spoken in the north of India, we
find a great many words, especially those expressive of the common rela
tions of life, and denoting objects with which men in an imperfect state of
civilization are acquainted, which cannot be derived from Sanscrit roots,
and which are the same in the languages of the north, in the languages of
some forest tribes living in the mountainous boundary districts, and in the
languages of the people in the south of India. In the same way we find no
difficulty in accounting for the presence of many Sanscrit words in the lan
guages of the south, for it is quite clear that it is owing to the literary in
fluence which the Sanscrit exercised in the north as well as in the south,
that words expressing ideas, connected with a higher state of civilization,
ON ETHNOLOGY.                          331

Ihave been adopted by those dialects.  shall abstain at present from enter
ing into any discussion upon the origin of those words which do not belong
to the Indo-Germanic family, and of which Dr. Stevenson has given some

comparative lists, tracing analogies in the Mongolian, Celtic and Hebrew
tongues. I do not think that the affinity of different languages in any
country can be proved by a mere comparison of similar words, and it seems
to me that by producing analogies from languages so different as Hebrew,
Celtic and Mongolian, one proves nothing by proving too much.

  We must have studied the individuality of different languages, we must have
acquired an intimate knowledge of the particular distinguishing character of
each of them, we must have entered into the spirit of every idiom, and have
acquired a kind of feeling so as to be able to identify ourselves with the lan
guages of other people, before we can venture to decide upon analogies
which may exist between them. Afterwards it makes no difference whether
these analogies consist in words or in terminations of words, whether they

be etymological or grammatical analogies, provided that the one and the other
be based, not upon the mere sound, but upon the organization of the words.

It is on that account that I must declare myself decidedly, as far as the

Bengali is concerned, against Dr. Stevenson's theory. Dr. Stevenson says
that there exists a great resemblance in the grammatical structure of the
chief modern languages in the north and in the south of India, proofs of
which he produces from the Hindi, Bengali, Gujerathi, Marathi on the one
side, and from Telugu, Carnatica, Tamil and Singhalese on the other.
Supposing that for none of these characteristic points they are indebted to
the Sanscrit, he thinks it impossible to account for such a similarity of

grammatical structure in languages, spoken by people having so little inter
course with one another, as, according to his opinion, the Hindu inhabitants

of the north and south of India have had, unless we suppose it to arise from
their all being originally of one family, and possessing one primitive lan
guage, the grammatical system of which may be in some measure gathered
from these their points of agreement. Dr. Stevenson admits however that

Brahminical influence has modified the grammatical structure, and intro

duced into the northern languages some affixes for those in former use,
especially in the inflexion of nouns, but he says that the general structure

of all has remained unaffected, and that upon the whole there is more agree
ment in the construction with the Turkish than with the Sanscrit, so that

he thinks it likely that the original language of India may be the connect
ing link between what the Germans have called the Indo-Germanic family
and the Turkish family of languages.

   Now the whole question, as far as I can see, rests upon these two points :
Is it likely or not that the northern languages of India, which are so
much connected with the Sanscrit, that while the Bengali and Hindi,
which probably contain the most, have nine-tenths of their vocables of
Sanscrit origin, and while even the Marathi, which, according to Dr.
Stevenson's estimation, contains the fewest, has at least four-fifths of its

words derived from the same source, the same languages should have

derived their inflexional suffixes from an aboriginal language, which ex
ercised so little influence upon those modern dialects, that proofs of its

very existence can only be gathered from some few words, which, denoting

things connected with the daily occupations of the working classes, were
likely to remain in the mouth of the people, and to get by this way intro
duced into the language of the higher classes? Dr. Stevenson himself

admits that the Brahminical influence has modified the grammatical struc
332 report-- 1847.

ture, and lias introduced, as he says, into the northern languages some
affixes for those in former use. In admitting this, however, he admits more
than he seems aware of. For we very seldom, or rather never find that a
people, though receiving a great number of foreign words into the dictionary
of its language, have adopted at the same time a foreign grammatical
system, so that the mere fact, that one part of the grammar of the northern
languages is evidently of Sanscrit origin, would seem to speak by itself very
much in favour of admitting the same for the other part.

    But then the chief point is to consider, whether the instances brought for
ward as unexplainable by the rules of Sanscrit grammar and by the principles
of the general structure of the Indo-Germanic languages, may not be found
to be formed by grammatical elements which have been similarly used by the

Arian languages, particularly by their modern representatives. And this I
think I am abie to do for every grammatical form which Dr. Stevenson has

pointed out as non-Sanscritical or Turkish, because he found it not exactly

the same as in the old and classical Sanscrit, while a comparison of the

modern development, which other Indo-Germanic languages have taken,
will clearly show the analogies existing between the changes which the Indian
language has experienced in the course of two thousand years and those
known in other branches of the Indo-Germanic family.

   It may be remembered that at present 1 meditate only a vindication of
the Bengali language, which, if successful, will perhaps throw some light
also upon the other northern dialects. As far as the southern languages are
concerned, I abstain from giving any decided opinion, and shall content myself
with noticing some coincidences between them and the dialects of the north.

   Beginning with the declensions, Dr. Stevenson remarks, that these eight
languages (viz. Bengali, Hindi, Gujerathi, Marathi, Telugu, Carnatica, Tamil
and Singhalese) are all deficient in the number of cases required to mark
the different relations of nouns, and supply the deficiency by particles placed
after the root or some of the cases.

   This is a fact, which, far from being surprising, would have been antici
pated by every one acquainted with the relation in which modern languages
stand to their parent tongues. The original and expressive forms by which
the old language of India formed its admirable system of declension, have
in the course of centuries, and particularly during the lapse of an illiterate
middle age, lost their pure form and their distinctive power. But the Indian
language found in itself the principle and elements of a new life, and we find
it again at the period of its regeneration in the possession of richer and more
powerful means than many of the modern languages of Europe can boast
of. It is true that the dual of the Sanscrit language has entirely disap
peared in Bengali, and that the nominative is the only case of the plural
which has preserved an original form; but ail the elements which have been
substituted in order to form the number and cases of words are undoubtedly
of Sanscrit origin; and we find sometimes the first traces of their gramma
tical employment in ancient works, and much more in the modern books,
and especially in those of the Buddhistic collection.

   The same is to be said of the gender of substantives and adjectives.
The substantives, adjectives, pronouns and verbs have no different forms in
Bengali for the masculine, feminine and neuter; and we meet only with some

feminine terminations in certain cases, where it was necessary to distinguish the
two genders, as vdgh, a tiger ; vaghi, a tigress ; Ichudd, uncle ; khudi, aunt.

The changes of the final letter which take place in these words are entirely
founded on the rules of Sanscrit grammar, only that they have been sub
                                ON ETHNOLOGY.                                  333

jected to the influence of the historical progress of the Indian language.
Sometimes the feminine is also expressed by composition, just as we say,
a she-goat, a French-woman, while in French and German the feminine
is expressed by the mere change of the final letter.           Thus the Ben

gali say, sasarti, a hare ; slrisasaru, a female hare ; inrej, an Englishman ;
inrejer tneye, an English woman ; miye being the Sanscrit word mdyd, which
means illusion, deception, or according to the notions of India, woman, and
in a philosophical sense the female magic power, or the whole apparent
world, which exists as long as the eternal soul looks upon it as existent, but
vanishes as soon as the great Self returns to itself and gets free from the
passion of worldly existence.

    As to the single cases of declension, Dr. Stevenson further remarks, that
there are several striking analogies running through most of these languages
in the letters that characterise the principal cases. Thus the letter n is a

very general characteristic of the genitive singular. It enters into the Guje-

rathi common genitive no, ni, num ; the ancient Marathi genitive cheni, now
usually contracted into chi and into the Tamil in; in all of which it runs

through all the declensions. It is found also in the ni of the first of the
three declensions in Telugu, and in the ana and ina of the first and fourth
of the four Canarese declensions. It is singular, Dr. Stevenson remarks,
that in the Turkish the termination of the genitive ung should afford so near
a parallel to the above, and that we should have the remains of such a geni

tive in mine and thine, and the Germans in mein, dein, sein.

    Although   upon this point  the Bengali is left quite unmentioned, because
its genitive
               in r is of too   clear a Sanscrit origin, yet I must say a few
words upon the n, as the sign of the genitive case in the languages quoted
by Dr. Stevenson. Gothic forms like meina, theina, seina, are certainly
puzzling at first sight, not however so much as for it to be necessary to

assign a Turkish origin to them. It can easily be seen that the genitive
                                              "ocftohntecheernddeadail,yy,"thw"eotfrhuken,"cttiroibn"etshoefofamntohuaendtjeamcintooivuuens,
has often, as far    as   t"hethesenwseorkis

so that phrases     like
tains," may be
                    expressed by
tribes." It is also generally admitted that some genitive formations in

the Indo-Germanic languages have preserved a close affinity to the forma
tions of adjectives, with the only difference that the latter have differ
ent terminations for gender, number and cases, and could therefore be
declined again like substantives. In some Indian dialects, as for instance
the Hindi, we find even genitives with different terminations for the
                          I do not say however that either the adjective has
different genders.
Ibeen derived from the genitive, or the genitive from the adjective, but
only maintain that the principle of their formation has been the same. Now
it is known that the suffix na is of very frequent occurrence for the deriva

tion of adjectives, and I have therefore little doubt that forms like the
Gothic meina (bearing some analogy to the Zend mana) ought to be consi
dered as adjectival formations ; just as in Greek and Latin, e/iot, aos for efiov,
aov, mens and tuus for mei and tui. We may observe in Sanscrit also how

the nasal sound n extends its influence in forming new bases to which the
regular terminations of the cases are added, a fact which, particularly in
               verbal formations, has                          illustrated by  Professor
reference  to  feel therefore inclined        been profoundly  nasal sound     in all the

instances quoted by Dr. Stevenson as an augment of the inflectional base,
while the final vowel in some of his quotations may have the power of the

genitive termination.
334 report -- 1847.

   For the termination ke, used for the dative and accusative in Bengali, Dr.
Stevenson brings forward the following analogies : ko in Hindi, ku in Telugu,
gai in Singhalese, and gya or ge in Tibetan. He supposes this termination
to take its origin from the Maratlii dative, lugi, derived from the verb
Idgane, to come in contact with, by changing the vowel, sharpening the
consonant, and omitting the first syllable Id, which syllable serves again as
the sign of the dative in other Indian languages. Even if we admitted this
derivation to be true, the word Idgane is a well-known Sanscrit root, which
Dr. Stevenson is very well aware of. Hut how fond he is of the auto-
chthonical origin of these forms, we may see from the following remark of
his : that this word lugi itself, he says, may be derived from the Sanscrit
is no objection whatever ; for it may have been derived from a root com
mon to many languages, and be just as independent of the Brahminical
tongue as our own word lug.
There are two methods of accounting for grammatical elements which
occur in modern languages. The one may be called the linguistical, the
other the historical.                                                       between
the form and meaning     The former consists in pointing out    analogies
                         of inflectional elements in different   languages    of the

same family. This method has generally been adopted and carried out suc
cessfully by Prof. Bopp and his school. It is indeed the only possible me
thod in comparing the grammatical forms of languages which historically
and geographically stand so far the one from the other, as for instance, the
German from the Sanscrit. In comparative researches of this kind it is only
required to trace analogies in the form and character of the elements, which
constitute the grammar of a language, and to show etymologically the origin
and the development of these grammatical forms. Whether the one language
be anterior in its formation, and whether there existed a historical connection

between them, is a question which originally has nothing to do with these

linguistical inquiries.
   The case however becomes different when we compare languages, the
historical progress of which we can follow through certain periods. Here
it becomes necessary to give to comparative inquiries as much as possible
a historical character, by trying to explain modern grammatical forms by

elements, which were used,      though  in a different way,  by the same    language
in its anterior state, and to           possible the period                 from the
                               show if                       of transition

one to the other. Thus in a comparative analysis of the modern Persian
grammar it would be necessary first of all to have recourse to the previous
forms under which the Persian language appears to us at certain historical
periods, and only in the case that neither the grammar of the Pazend and
the Pehlevi, nor that of the Achaemenidian or Zend language furnishes the
key for the grammatical forms of the modern Persian, it would be of interest
to look for analogies in other kindred languages. For it is certainly true,
though difficult to account for, that in several cases, where a historical

connection exists between two languages, it is notwithstanding impossible
to explain the grammatical forms of the one by those of the other, while

languages, distant in time and place, afford the most unmistakeable analogies.

Although then we prefer, when an opportunity is given, the historical method,
yet we must admit even for languages, which have a historical growth, like

the Bengali, the New Persian, the New German, &c, the right of the merely
linguistical method, and I choose the present case, the question about the
origin of the syllable lie, as sign of the accusative, as an opportunity for con
trasting the relative merit of these two methods.

   Ej(en, ffrrom a linguistic point of view it is difficult to find an analogy be-

tvveen the formation of the accusative in the Indo-Germanic languages and
in Bengali. An accusative formed by means of a syllable like ke, seems to
be quite foreign to the genius of these languages. The resemblance which
is found in the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon declension, in which there is a k for
the accusative termination of personal pronouns, is not admissible, because
the origin of this termination is founded on linguistical rules, so essentially
Germanic, that it is not possible to apply the same rules to an Indian dialect.
There is however some utility to be drawn from this comparison, for we see
 that Gothic accusatives (mi-k=me, Ihu-k--te, si-k--se) are derived from
 their pronominal roots by means of the same particle as the datives (mi-s=
 iuilti, thu-s= tibi) ; and we find in the syllable sma, from which the k of the
 accusative and the s of the dative are both derived, a termination not re
 stricted, like other terminations, to the accusative only, but serving, by means
 of its general and extended signification, to express, like the rd in Pehlevi
 and New Persian, at the same time both the accusative and the dative. We

 believe therefore that the Bengali ke is not to be considered as implying the
 relation usually represented by the accusative or dative, but as a particle of
 purely demonstrative power. As to analogy in other languages, Latin forms,

 as hi-c, hui-c, hun-c, tun-c, &c, may be quoted where the final c is the same
 as that we see repeated in forms like hi-c-ce, hun-c-ce, &c, serving to enhance
 the demonstrative signification. According to the theory of Prof. Bopp

  (Comparat. Grammar, § 305), this ce must be considered as an indefinite par
  ticle, or rather as a particle, which, compounded with an interrogative pro
  noun, takes away its interrogative power and changes the interrogative into
  an indefinite pronoun. The same savant traces this particle through different
  languages, such as Sanscr. ci-t {kaccit, some one), ca-na (kaccana, any one),

      But it seems necessary that a distinction should be made between two par
  ticles, which under a similar form have played very different parts in the pro
  gress of languages. The one, almost the same as the copulative particle (ca,
  re, que), serves, in generalizing, and to form from the root of the interrogative,

   an indefinite pronoun, when the other gives a determinate form. We re
  cognise the former in words like kaccit, kaccana, iroica, irore, quisque, quis
  quam (always in negative phrases like Sanscrit kaccana), quispiam, hvazuh,

  (Modern German wasauch). Adopting the system, which as far as I know
  has first been introduced by the ingenious G. Curtius of Berlin, this change
  of letters in Sanscrit, Greek and Latin may be represented in the following

   equation : panca, irevre, (\u\nque=ca, re, que. Sanscrit cit and Latin quam
  are enlargements of the same particle, as quispiam, which corresponds to
   Sanscrit kasapi, regularly changed into ko'pi. But we cannot believe with
   Prof. Bopp that the same particle, which by its peculiar power gives to in
   terrogative pronouns an indefinite signification, has given rise to the demon
   strative pronoun hie, by being compounded witli the Sanscrit interrogative
   pronoun ka and ki. Besides, as Professor Bopp acknowledges that in hic-ce,
   hunc-ce, &c. the latter ce is the repetition of the same element, we find
   already combined with the pronoun (hi-c), and as the genius of the Latin lan
   guage does not permit a doubt on the purely demonstrative meaning of this
   particle, we do not think that it is altogether contrary to the system of this
    learned grammarian, to consider ce as a determinative particle, different from
   the other and identical with the Greek ye and the Bengali ke.

      But though from a linguistical point of view we might admit the Bengali
   termination ke to have its origin in this demonstrative particle, it is still the

                                                                                      *

question whether a comparison of languages, historically connected with the
Bengali, might not furnish a more satisfactory solution. In the first case, we
must remember that in Bengali itself ke is very often omitted, and that the ac
cusative is represented by the same form as the nominative, when the whole
structure of the sentence shows that the substantive, dependent upon a verb,
is to be taken as its object and therefore as an accusative. Besides, ke is
not so much to be considered as the termination of an accusative, but rather

as that of an objective case, because it is frequently used to represent the
dative also, as Hari bahudhan Hariddske dilcn (Hari gave much money to
Haridas). Nor is like the other terminations r, te, ra, added to the se
condary form of a substantive (manushye-r, manusltyc-te, manushye-rd), but
               a
                        in it,
to the absolute form (nianushya-ke, purush-ke). Now we go back to San

but generally the meaning of the word remains the same, only assuming
more concrete, objective or neuter character. Thus lohita means read, lohi-is
taka, ruby, vac speech, vdcikam, delivered speech or discourse. There
      aa
exists close relation, logically as well as grammatically, between the neuter
    its nominative and accusative and the accusative of the masculine. Thein

accusative represents the substantive, which active and independent, if ex

pressed the nominative, as passive object, and we may account thereby
      in
           in
why   many cases the same grammatical element, which serves to express
Ifthe neuter gender, has been employed for expressing the objective case of
the masculine, as am in Sanscrit, urn Latin, ov Greek.                        then the affix

ka has already    in  Sanscrit the signification which we have just explained,                     it

might seem well-adapted for words which by their relation to other words
convey the meaning of passive objectivity. Although therefore this particle
may not have become, neither in Sanscrit nor in Pracrit, the mere conventional
sign of the accusative case, yet its analogous use gets so extensive Pracrit,
                                    is

Sanscrit origin. In Bengali te      at the same time the termination of the

ablative and the locative. Besides, there still another more Sanscritic ter

mination in e, for the locative of words ending in consonant or the vowel a.
The same form is, by a false analogy, employed also for words which end in
                                    (at night), instead of ratrlte or rdirikdle. The
other vowels, such as rdtre         as the sign of the dative, corresponds to the San

termination te, if employed
scrit termination Ira. The change of Ira into te justified by the aversion
                                                 is

transition of into s. The same suppression of the takes place in Bengali,

                           if

when we remember that the Pali and Pracrit lansruaees suppress equally the

final s. Instead of changing the a into o, as the case of these dialects andin

in some cases of the Sanscrit itself! the Bengali has preferred as usual the
final e, approaching thereby very nearly to the Latin, which has preserved

the same suffix in words like inde, wide, Sec.
   In the nominative singular, a form in e occurs instead of the regular ter
minations ; as Vede kohen (the Veda says); mdnike=mdnik (ruby); gopdle=
gopdl (cow-herd). The same e is added also to words ending in d, but then
it must be changed to y ; as rdjdy=-rdjd (king); pitdy--pitd (father).

   Although these forms of the nominative may imply sometimes a contemp
tuous idea, yet they had not originally this power, but must be considered

as having retained the primitive form, corresponding with the termination o

in Pracrit and Pali. It is of importance to remark that the Bengali, having
suppressed the final * of the ancient Sanscrit termination, has not lost, at the
same time, the short a, and that instead of changing it into o, like the Pracrit
and Pali, it shows a decided predilection for a final e, bearing thereby a close
resemblance to the old (^akkari dialect. As to the forms pitdy, rdjdy, &c,

where the final y replaces an e, it is true that this is in no way founded on
either Sanscrit or Pracrit, but in comparing modern languages with the an

cient idioms whence they have arisen, we may often see that by a false ana

logy, certain common forms are adopted even for words, to which, owing to
their different origin, they would seem irreconcilable. What speaks the
most clearly in favour of our regarding this e, as a relic of the Sanscrit a, in

the nominative as well as in the genitive, ablative and locative, is, that the

adjectives of pure Bengali origin do not admit this e either in the nominative
or in the other cases. Sometimes c is used also instead of era in the nom.

plur., as sakale se kathd kahila (all said this word); aneke tdhd jane (many
know that). In this case tool rather incline to consider e as the remnant of
the ancient plural termination than to take it for the sign of the locative case,
as Dr. Yates suggests, particularly .is he observes that in good Bengali it is

only used in adjectives which indicate a number, when the noun is merely
understood; as sakale, aneke, Sec, where we find e as the termination of the

plural already in Sanscrit.
The termination of the nominative plural is a, as in Pali and Pracrit, but
as this case always occurs under the form of rd or era (guru-rd, manushye-rd),
one might suppose that there is in it a repetition of the Sanscrit termination,
as in the Vedical forms stomdsas. It seems nevertheless more probable that
the Bengalis, perceiving all the forms of the plural derived from a root in er,
i. e. of the genitive singular, compounded with the word dig, have taken this
genitive for the base of the plural, and have added to it the primitive sign of

the nominative plural, d.
The most singular and at first sight barbarous feature of the Bengali de
clension, is its formation of the plural of masculine nouns by means of the
syllable dik, to which the terminations of the cases in the singular are added.
Though I                                    the origin of this grammatical

ment, yet                          theory,   which perhaps may not prove    quite
           I venture to propose a

unsatisfactory.

Dig signifies, in Sanscrit, a climate, and in the plural it is taken for the
whole world. In this sense we find digoijayi, he who has conquered the
four regions, or all the countries which lie between the N. S. E. W., i. e. all

the world and all mankind. It is true that the vrord dicah had not yet been
used in Sanscrit in the sense of all the world, or mankind in general, but we
find, nevertheless, an analogy in the word loka, the first signification of which
is the world, and synonymous with dig ; as, for instance, loka-pdla=dik-pdla,
the master of the world. The same word by metaphor comes to mean men.

                                                                      of  i<

the numeral pronouns ; (d added to the names of living beings indicate
difference or contempt: ekafd kukur or kukur(d, a dog; cka(d manuthya 01
nus/iyatd, a mannikin, the mob. The same suffix added to the nam
things gives an idea of magnitude, ckafd gliar or gharfd, a great house,
suffix (i expresses in similar cases afiection or pity in the case of living
ings, and contempt in that of things : <kali bdlak or bdlakfi, a little chi

darling ; ek<I(i tokd, tokdfi, a very small sum, a stiver, a mite.   of t

   It would be difficult to give an explanation of the true meaning

Now the cerebrals are pronounced in Bengali as the dentals are in Sam
It is therefore probable that (d and (i are the same suffixes by meai
which collective and abstract nouns are formed in Sanscrit. At the |

time it is to be remarked, that in many modern languages the suff
destined to form abstract and collective names, give sometimes to I

words an additional meaning, just in the same manner as the sufKx

and ti ; as, in English, woman and womankind, governors and goi

ment ; and still more in French words, like loger, logis, logc-ment

bourgeois, la bourgeoisie, le peuple, la populace. We must also rei
that in Bengali these different shades of meaning almost always depen
the character of the whole phrase, and that, generally, for instance, t
baldk means only a child, ekafd ghar, a house ; while, on the other h
balaktd, gharfd, have the more definite meaning of ' the child,' ' the hoi
   The most important point, however, of the Bengali is what we maj
its secondary or periphrastic declension, which by the clearness of its o
allows us an interesting insight into the secret working of language, and i

us a key for many modern formations in kindred languages, where the
ginal elements of these new formations are often obliterated and unexp

able. Although we have seen that in the singular there are some ren
of the ancient forms in the locative, ablative and genitive, yet the lang
has lost the conscience of their true meaning, and they are made use of

in the most simple and distinct cases. In the modern language these sui

have no longer sufficient power to perform the functions which they ful

in Sanscrit, and they have consequently been replaced by more expre

and more intelligible words. We must not, however, look upon these
formations in the light of arbitrary compositions, for, having become c<

crated (nitya), these forms are regarded by the Bengalis as having the
value which the cases of the Sanscrit were considered to have by the an
people who spoke it. As it may be of interest for the comparative stui
cmasoedser:n--languages, we give a list of the most usual forms of these secor

   1. Kartrik (expressing agency), hetuk (expressing cause) form the in
mental, ablative and dative. Thus, irvarkartrik jagad srishfa hay
world is created by God, t. e. having God for the agent in its creation

scrit, ifvarena or icvardt) ; dhanheluk yatna karilck, he exerts himse
                              ON ETHNOLOGY.        339

money, i. e. having money as the cause of his exertions. In Sanscrit the
dative may be used, or a similar composition with the word nimitta, which
occurs also in Bengali.
    2. Pdrvak (expressing precedent) forms in like manner the instrumental.
Thus vinay pdrvak ulcta hay, it is spoken politely, i. e. having before it

politeness (Sanscrit, vinayena).
   3. Diyd (having taken), kariyd (having done), form the instrumental ;

thus, churi diyd tdhdke mdrilek, he struck him with a knife, or, having taken
the knife; churi diyd lekhani prastut karilen, he prepared the pen with the

penknife.

    4. Sahit, sange, sdte (accompanied, near), as punish sahit, with men ;

dugher sahit jal micrit kariydche, he has mixed water with milk ; tomdr sange,
or tomdr sdte ydiva, I shall go with you. In Sanscrit, particularly in its

most ancient form, the termination of the instrumental is sufficient to express
this meaning ; as, purushaih, with men ; haribhih, with horses ; afterwards
saha or sahita is used with the instrumental to make the meaning more
distinct, as purushaih saha.

    5. Hake (from) is the most common sign for the ablative ; as, ghar haite
nihsrit, gone out of the house (Sanscrit, grihdn nihsritah) ; kumbhakdr
haite ghat sakal nirmit hay, the pots are made by the potter ; pitd putra haite

balavdn hay, the father is stronger than the son.

   Notwithstanding the apparent difference of meaning, I think that haite is
but a modern form of sahita (joined, with). The change of its signification
(with, from) is analogous to  that which  similar  owriogridnsallyhavneearund(aesrgo"ncelosien
other languages. Thus the     English by  means

by"), but it has lost this meaning almost entirely, and serves at present to
form the ablative case. The same may be observed in French (par, avec)
and German (mit) ; rdjdr haite nihsrit hay, would therefore signify, he comes
from with the king (d'avec le roi) ; kumbhakdr haite ghat nirmit hay, the pot
has been made by the potter. What speaks most in favour of this etymo

logy is, that also in other modern Indian dialects the ablative is formed on

the same principle.
   6. Nikaf and nikate (near, in the neighbourhood). This word also serves,

in accordance with its primitive meaning, to express several different rela
tions at the same time. For instance, they say rdjdr nikaf pdiyd, having

received from the king, and rdjdr nikaf gdiyd, having gone to the king, t. e.

near him.

   Nikafa occurs in Sanscrit also in the sense of near, and as the cerebral f
indicates often that the form in which it occurs is a contraction of another
form, containing an r, I suppose nikafa to be derived from nikarsha or
nikrishfa, as vikafa, great, from vikarsha or vikrishfa. Thus lata for tarsha or
trtshfa (dry ground) is derived from trish, to be dry or thirsty ; pala, a gar
ment, from paridhd ; vain, a circle, from vr'ita ; bkaftd for bhartd, &c.

    7. Samipe (in the neighbourhood) is used in the same manner as nikate.
   8. Madhye or majhe (Pali madjhe), in the midst, forms the locative ; as,
hriday madhye, in the heart. Sansc. hrtdaye.
   9. Kache and kachete (in the neighbourhood), just as nikaf.
   10. Sthdne or sthdy (at the place), forms the locative ; as, gharthdy, in the
house, or near the house.

11. Dvdrd (by the door), by means of, forms the instrumental ; as, jndna
dvdrd, by knowledge. Sansc. jiidnena . haster dvdrd tini mdrilek, he struck
him with the hand.

1 2. Rdp is sometimes used to express the genitive in figurativze2language ;
340 REPORT-- 1847.

as, mrityurtlj) rajju, the cords of death, i. e. having the form of death ;
p)kardp agni, the fire of distress.

   The use of these compounds is not so extensive in Sanscrit, but we never
theless find already there the first traces of them even in ancient works, as
for instance in Manu and even in the Veda; as, atishthantindm aniveranandm
Jcdshthdndm madhye nihitam pariram vritrasya, the body of Vrltra (the cloud)
thrown into the flowing and restless waters. In modern books, and especially
in the Buddhistical works, this usage is very general, and particularly inter
esting as giving the key for the original meaning of many obscure abbre

viations, which in the spoken dialects of India form the new system of de
clensions. As far as the declensions are concerned, I think then it will
be admitted that the Bengali is nothing but a modern development of the
Sanscrit language, and that though reduced to a state of great poverty in
its grammatical formation, it has not borrowed the principles of a new life
from the language of barbarous tribes.

   Of the conjugation of the Bengali it would be still more difficult to prove
a non-Sanscritical origin. In comparing the conjugations of the Bengali
with those of the Sanscrit verbs, we are struck with the same phaenomenon
which presented itself to our notice when examining the declensions. The

Sanscrit possesses ten distinct forms, whereby the verbal base is derived
from the primitive root ; and by its three voices, the active, passive and
middle voice, offers to us a rich variety of terminations, destined to express
every form of tense, mood and person. But, what at first sight is most
trange, while those languages which have for centuries been exiled from

their native lands have preserved even in the extreme north vivid proofs of

their ancient wealth and originality, the Bengali, which has remained in its
paternal soil, has degenerated more than almost any other of the Indo-Ger-
manic languages. It is true that the Indian tongue may have felt itself
wearied and oppressed by the abundance of forms produced at the first
burst of its youth ; it is true, that in divesting itself of these exuberances it

was following but a wise ceconomy, and by analytical expressions accommo
dating itself to the wants of ordinary life ; but the primitive beauty of human
speech, the happy harmony between the spirit and the form of the words
was lost, and the wings of human thought were broken. There is in Ben
gali neither middle nor passive; the greater part of its tenses are formed by
means of auxiliary verbs, and according to the common system of the Ben

gali grammarians, there are no longer even different forms in the plural and
singular. But admitting all these differences between Sanscrit and Ben

gali, which, indeed, everybody would expect to exist to a certain amount

between every ancient and modern language, 1 cannot see how a totally
different origin of the Bengali language can                                        like
the following, which Dr. Stevenson quotes in  be proved     btyhedoirffyere:--nces

1. That the second person singular imperative is the root or shortest
form in Bengali and the other languages, while this is the case with only
about one-half the tenses in Sanscrit.

    2. That in Bengali the present tense contains the present participle as a

/constituent part of it followed by the substantive verb, as in our form, am

reading.
3. That it uses an aorist, which denotes past, present and future time.
4. That verbs are composed with the negative particle.
5. That the past tense has no reduplication, and

I6. That the passive is formed in a peculiar manner.
As to the first point, if understand him right, his calculation is wrong.

Except in the second, third, seventh and ninth class of Sanscrit verbs, and

some ancient forms in the Veda, we find in all the other verbs the shortest
form of the inflectional base in the second person singular imperative. These
four classes however comprise only between 150 to 200 roots, while of the
six other classes the first comprises alone about 1000 roots.
As to the second point, nobody denies that Bengali, as a modern language,
employs periphrastical formations instead of the simpler forms of the ancient
             but when               of         participle as well as of the auxiliary
language;   of Sanscrit  the form       the    see why their combination into a peri

phrastical form should point to a barbarous origin. That the Bengalis em
ploy an aorist which denotes past, present and future time, is not at all

extraordinary, since we see in many languages that when a new specific
inflectional base has been assigned to the present and imperfect, the simple
form represents generally the action of the verb only, without reference to

any time, and is therefore called aorist.
As to the next point, the negative verb in Bengali has nothing irregular
in its formation. By the addition of verbal terminations almost every word
                                        a verbal base, and Dr. Stevenson must be

an affirmative verb, vafi, I am indeed, from vata, indeed. The loss of the

reduplicative syllable in the perfect is sufficiently accounted for by the same
occurrence in almost all the modern, and even some of the ancient branches
of the Indo- Germanic family; and in supposing an auxiliary verb like
didhale to be the original form of the terminations of the past tense, like da
or la, Dr. Stevenson seems not to be aware of his quite being in accordance
with Professor Bopp, only that the latter takes not the modern Maratlii form,
didhale, but the ancient and simple form dhd.
   An element, which might perhaps be called aristocratic, lias exercised

much influence in the personal terminations of the verb. The Bengali gram
marians pretend that there are two sorts of terminations equally employed
for the singular and plural. One sort convey a kind of respectful meaning,
the other has a contemptuous sense. This distinction is so generally adopted,
not only by the grammarians but also by those who have written in the lan

guage, that we do not dare to pursue any other method, although we are
convinced that the forms which convey contempt are nothing else but the
singular ones, while those which express respect are the plural. To explain
this distribution of the ancient forms, it is not sufficient for us to have re
course to the analogy of modern languages, in some of which, in speaking
with respect of persons, we may perceive that a sense of superiority has been
often attributed to the plural; for the peculiarity of Bengali consists not so
much in a verb in the plural being connected with a substantive in the sin

gular, but that a verb in the singular is governed by a substantive in the
plural. This peculiarity does not admit of explanation, except on the ground

that Bengali, to speak correctly, has properly no plural in declensions except

in the case of reasonable beings. It would therefore be impossible to em
ploy a third person plural, when we are speaking of animals or of inanimate
            We might say,                      think (think             but if we wished
objects.     the idea ' that  the wise  men    (eat plural),  plural),
to express                    animals   eat '                 we must   say, the mass of

animals eats (verbally, the animal-mass or animality eats) ; hence, in this
way, the plural of the verb will always find itself united with the names of
superior beings, and the singular with those of inferior beings, and thus the
two numbers of the verb must assume, by little and little, the peculiar cha
racter of the substantives on which they are dependent.
342 report-- 1847.

   This signification, once formed and favoured by the double character of
the pronoun, of which there is also a respectful and contemptful form, it
becomes possible to explain how on the one hand the singular of substantives
might be followed by the plural form, denoting respect, and how on the
other hand other substantives would be followed by the singular form, ex
pressing contempt. Thus the pronoun of the second person, tumi, would
take the sense of you (plural), while it was more customary to address a
person of distinction by dpani or mahd^ay (your honour), both of which
govern the third person plural of the verb. The pronoun tui, which always
governs the singular with a sense of contempt, would cease to be regarded,
even in its plural, lord, as a word expressing many individuals, but would be
held to be a collective word with the sense of contempt.
   In general however it may be borne in mind that people of rank do not

employ this pronoun and the corresponding form of the verb even in ad
dressing their servants, because at the same time that the respectful forms of

the plural lay aside almost altogether, by continual use, their respectful sense,
the other become so full of contempt, that in conversation they are injurious.
   The first person alone has preserved both in the plural and singular the
same form ; so that with the exception of the difference between the pro
nouns (ami and mui), the form of the verb remains the same.

   The late Dr. Yates, who, after such a long intercourse with the natives of
                                                                              says in
Bengal, may be considered      as a  good authority    on   "  this subject,  well for  re
ference to these forms of the        and the pronouns                                   the

first and second of these pronouns (mui and tui), and for the verbs that agree
with them, to be expunged from the language ; yet as they are frequently
used in common conversation, it is necessary to notice them, to enable the
student to understand what he will frequently hear. The third often an
swers a useful purpose in distinguishing between the Creator and the crea
Ifture, the king
                                             and the servant, the animate and
the inanimate."                              speaks with the greatest humility
andAntdheasguabijne:ct,"       the master

but it is not found in good composition. From these strictures, however,
the third person must be exempted, as it is used in all good composition for

expressing common facts or events, and will on that ground in future be
embodied in the honorific form of conjugation."
   A slight knowledge of the system of the Indo-Germanic conjugations is

sufficient to show that all the personal terminations of the verb came from
the same source as those of the other cognate languages, and that they con
tain the remains of personal pronouns, added to the verbal root, and changed
more or less in the gradual development of the language. It would be out
of place to retrace here the origin of every Bengali termination, and to show
Ithe greater or lesser regularity of its successive alterations by analogies with
the terminations of other languages.         think that the characteristic differ

ence between the personal suffixes for the present and the imperfect

am, a), as well as the suffixes themselves, speak so clearly as to require
no other proof for their Indo-Germanic descent, and defy any one to find in

any but an Indo-Germanic language, and am, as the sign for the first per
son, and for the second, or en as the termination for the third person
plural. We must only observe, that the terminations of the present and of
the imperative contain the personal suffixes in their simplest forms, without
the addition of any auxiliary verb, and the excellent work of Prof. Bopp will
furnish sufficient instances of analogous forms of the personal terminations
in Sanscrit and its filial languages.

The termination of the preterit, ildm, and of the future (ibo), bear the

greatest resemblance to the corresponding Latin forms (bam and bo), and it
might be possible to adopt the origin, assigned to these forms by Prof. Bopp,
also for the Bengali, so that the terminations of these two tenses, small and
insignificant as they are, might be shown to contain not only the remains of
personal pronouns, but also those of an obliterated auxiliary verb. As to

the future, there is externally not any difference between the pronunciation
of the Latin bo and Bengali va (pronounced bo) ; and the Latin bam might be
compared with the termination of the Bengali preterit Idm, when we re

member that instances are not wanting of the semivowel I having taken in
other languages the place of an original v. Thus Sanscrit svap, to sleep,
IGerman schlaf; Sanscrit vad, to say, Gothic lath-dn.

      prefer however another explanation of this tense, which is more in
accordance with the development which the form of the past tense has taken
in Pracrit as well as in other modern languages of India. There is a
Ichange of letters which is of very frequent occurrence in the popular dia

lects of India, mean the transition of the dental / into a lingual which,
                                                                   /

                                                                                      </,
according to its pronunciation, may often be represented by or r. Adopt
ing this theory, Bengali forms, like karildm, did, would contain a past par
ticiple with an active signification (Sanscrit &arita= Bengali karila), fola
lowed by the secondary personal terminations. That this the real originina
of these forms may be put above every contradiction by comparison withis
                                                     Ia I
the Mahratta preterit, which, as Professor Lassen has shown, has preserved
even the three genders of the participle, saying to held, he did, keli, she
                                                                       I

                                                                             it

                                     is
mi kelem, did (fern.), mi kelom (neuter). This being the case, and seeing
that in Pracrit already all the original historical tenses are altogether lost,
think that even the Pracrit termination of the preterite                  or hi, either in
                                                                   ia

an absolute or neuter state, or followed by masculine termination, may be
taken for corrupted form of past participle, for we see that in Pracrit

the termination ta already changed into da, and that sometimes the                         t
                                                                                               is

entirely suppressed, as osaria for osarida.
The conditional seems to contain         the of its terminations the remains

of a present participial form, to which the secondary personal terminations

are added the same manner as in other clearly periphrastical formations,
isof which we shall have to speak directly. This tense also interesting on
       in                                                      is

account of its having preserved, in the second person singular, the final *,
which dropped in the corresponding form of the imperfect.

   Besides the conjugation by means of the simple terminations, the Bengali
language has yet two other conjugations, which are periphrastical in the
proper sense of the word, although here also the two component parts are
more intimately allied than in periphrastical formations        of the Latin, (like
                                                               These conjugations,

which furnish some tenses only, are formed, the one by adding the auxiliary

verb to the participle, the other by adding to the past adverb. The

auxiliary verb dchi, am, used the present and preterite only.

This auxiliary verb dchi, the same as the Sanscrit asmi, asi, asti, Doric ififii,
iatri, evri, Latin sum, es, est, cannot be regarded as a primitive root. Lan

energy of their impression upon the mind are able to excite an idea (eltios,
phonic image), has not and cannot have word which expresses the abstract
and lifeless notion of mere affirmation or existence. But as the developmenta

of the mind advances, step by step, with that of language, and vice versa, we

         at the   same time,   when by a frequently repeated    perception of the
          kind                 the mind arrived at the general

different
its purest sense, (as copula) without the admixture of any determinative at
tributes, the language by the frequently repeated use of words, which origin
ally expressed different kinds of specific being, forgot, if we may be allowed
the expression, the distinctive character of being, represented by them, and
took them in the general meaning of being without attributes. Thus we find

that verbs, which signified properly to stay, to tit, to grow, to arise, lost in

time their specific meaning, and expressed often, instead of the situation of
staying or sitting, situation or existence in general, and instead of the act of
growing and arising, action in general. It is in this way that the difference
of meaning which, by careful attention and a fine feeling for language, can

often be perceived between the different auxiliary verbs,       must be accounted
for ; and thus we see in Bengali also that the verb dchi,
                                                                I am, cognate as it
is with a verbal radical signifying to sit, has retained something of its primary
                 implies always mere existence or existence in reference to
meaning, and
locality, while  the other auxiliary verb, hay, I am (the same as the Sanscrit
bku, Greek vw, Latin fui), having the primitive meaning of to grow, to
drive or to arise, signifies rather to become than to be. Ex. iumi kimcid

krig hdiydcha, you have become a little thin; though very often it is but the
mere verbal copula, as tini jfidnavdn han, he is wise ; acvapacu hay, the horse
is an animal. The other auxiliary verb dchi, on the contrary, is well em
ployed in phrases like -- is he (alive) or is he dead? tinidchen ki mdriydcheni
God is for ever, icvar sarcahdl dchen. Is he at home 1 tini ki ghare dehen.
By means of the verb dchi, four periphrastical tenses are formed. Ex

ample :

         Ikarite, present participle,    doing.

                kariiechi,I am doing.

                 karitechildm, was doing.

         kariydkfc,aarpriyiaydsdctchhailidd, mveI,rbh,aIvhehaavddionndgeonde(ohna(ehv.ainvgingdodnoen, e,I aImw)a. s).
The meaning of these four tenses is evident by their origin.
   Karitechi, I am doing, describes an action which continues at the moment

Iof speaking ; karitechildm, I was doing, an action, continued in a past time,

always with reference to another action ; as, was doing when he arrived.

Kariydchi, I have done, implies an action accomplished at the moment of
speaking; kariydchildm, I had done, an action finished in a past time with

reference to another action.
In Bengali there is no distinctive form for the subjunctive present, but the
indicative is employed, though the character of the phrase may require a
subjunctive form ; or rather the whole character of the phrase and the man
ner of representing conditional ideas are not the same in Bengali as in other
languages, which, by a change in the form of the verb, are enabled to give
to the colour of the phrase this particular shade. The conditional relation is
in the mind of one who expresses himself in Bengali insensibly changed into
a mere temporal one. Ex. yadi tumi mdra, tave dmi mdriva, word for word,

when you beat, then I shall beat ; yadi dmi tomdr pitd hay, dmdke avacya
Imdnya karive, if I am                                                Tbheeat,ptahretnicleI
                         your father, you must respect me.                                                                       yadi
can also be omitted.     Ex. tumi mdra, tave dmimdriva, you                                                                      shall

heat, i. e. should you beat, shall beat. Sometimes tave also, which usually
                                                    Ex. Iumi
begins   the principal   phrase, is not  added.                mdra,  dmi                                               mdriva,  you
         shall beat, i,  e. should you            shall beat.
beat, I                                  beat, I
                                        ON ETHNOLOGY.                               345

The conditional may be regarded as the past tense of a subjunctive mood,
in the principal as well as in the secondary phrase. Ex. yadi tumi dmdke
mdrite, dmi tomdke mdritdm, if you had                   me, I would have beaten
                                                 beaten  ltd, had I been there, he   you ;
yadi dmi sesthdne haildm, tini e duhkha          pditen                             would

not have experienced sucli distress. The same tense expresses sometimes
Ithe frequency of an action in the past time, without any conditional relation.

Ex. dmi rdjvidydlaye paditdm, used to study in the Royal college.
   The infinitive in ite, has the same power as the infinitive of other lan

guages : thus tdhdke mdrite dmi dsiydchi, 1 am come to beat him ; dmdke

mdrite deo, allow me to beat. Dr. Stevenson remarks, that almost all of these
Indian languages agree in forming an infinitive of very popular use, by add
ing the same letters that are used for the formation of the dative singular
of nouns. It needs indeed but little insight into the origin and definite
nature of the infinitive to see that it is nothing but a verbal noun with dif
ferent, generally obsolete terminations of cases. Taking this view, which

has been

it is easy
dative or

infinitive, formed by the termination kit or ka, represents to us the verbal
noun in the accusative, just as the Sanscrit and Latin terminations in turn.

    The two verbal nouns ending in iyd and He may be regarded as two verbal
adverbs, or as absolute and obsolete cases of a verbal noun. The former is

employed for the past, the latter for an indefinite, often for the future time.
The origin of them is clear, the one corresponding to the Sanscrit form in
ya, the other being a locative of the past participle, with the regular change
of t into I. Both these forms give a great advantage to the Bengali, because
it is possible to express by means of them a whole phrase dependent on an
other, without employing conjunctive particles and without any regard to
gender, case and number. The subject only must be the same in the prin
cipal and subordinate phrases, when the form in iyd is employed. Ex. tini
                                                                                  or when he
phuadslarkeapddththekabrioyodk.vahiEre   gelen,  he went out, after having read,  learnt this
                                        samvrid  janiyd mugdha haildm, having

news, he became insensible.
The most usual form of the present participle has the same termination as
the infinitive. Being a verbal adjective, it has like the other adjectives no

Iterminations for the cases, but it governs the same case as the verb. Ex. dpan

putrake mdrite dmi tdhdke dekhildm, saw him beating his own son.
    As the infinitives of the Indo-Germanic languages must be regarded as

the absolute cases of a verbal noun, it is probable that in Bengali the infini
tive in ite was also originally a locative, which expressed not only local

situation, but also movement towards some object, as an end, whether real
or imaginary. Thus the Bengali infinitive corresponds exactly with the
English, where the relation of case is expressed by the preposition to. Ex.

tdhdke mdrite dmi dsiydchi, means, I came to the state of beating him, or I

came to beat him ; dmdke mdrite deo, give me (permission), let me (go) to the
action of beating, i. e. allow me to beat.

   Now as the form of the participle is the same as that of the infinitive, it
may be doubted if there is really a distinction between these two forms as
 to their origin. For instance, the phrase dpan putrake mdrite dmi tdhdke
 dekhildm, can be translated, I saw him beating his own son ; but it can be ex

plained also as, what they nonsensically call in Latin grammar accusativus
                         to say, the infinitive can be          for a locative of the
cum infinitivo, that is  whole phrase be translated,     taken  him in the action of
verbal noun, and the
                                                         I saw
346                                        REPORT 1847.

beating his own son (vidi patrero caedere ipsius filium). As in every Bengali
phrase the participle in tie can be understood in tliis manner, I think it ad
missible to ascribe this origin to and instead of taking for nominative
of a verbal adjective, to consider as a locative of verbal noun.

fore Rammohun Roy, possessing doubtless the most intimate and delicate
knowledge of the spoken Bengali, does not follow this opinion, but analyses
these passive compounds by taking the former part for the passive participle
                          other Bengali grammars), and the latter for the verb ydite,
(not mentioned
with the sense of to become. Ex. \dkd deoyd gela, money has been given
(money went or became given out) se mdrd ydivek, he will be beaten. What
speaks mostly in favour of this opinion                             that there are in Bengali other

phrases where ydite really joined to the active verbal noun, which retains
always its active or intransitive power. But in this case ydite has another

signification, and impersonally employed in the sense of, goes, happens.

Ex. dmdkc jdnd ydy nd, literally, to know me never happens, e. cannot

be known tomdke dekhd gela, you could be seen, or you have been seen.

In this sense ydite can be combined with intransitive verbs also. Ex. cald

ydij, walking goes, e. we can go out.
   There are still some other Bengali formations which serve to express the

passive, but these too are, although not found in Sanscrit, yet entirely based
ON ETHNOLOGY.  347

upon Sanscrit elements. Thus every passive participle may be taken from
the Sanscrit, and may, when followed by the Bengali verb haite, to be,

form a passive verb, as krlt, done, krit hay, I am done. Besides, the Bengali

has, like other languages, some compositions by which a passive sense can be

expressed, though, grammatically speaking, they are hardly to be considered
as constituting a distinct passive formation. Thus the verbe khdite (to eat)
and pake (to get), are of very frequent occurrence, to express in certain com
binations a passive idea. Ex. duhkha khdite, to eat pain, to surfer pain, or
to be pained ; tndri khdy, he eats or he gets a beating, i. e. he is or gets
beaten, piddle nashta pdivek, he will get destroyed by grief.

   So much in answer to Dr. Stevenson, and enough, I hope, to vindicate
the origin which 1 ascribe to the grammatical structure of the Bengali. It

Iwould be easy to bring forward a great many forms of this dialect, the

Sanscrit origin of which is beyond all doubt, but think that the mere fact
of Dr. Stevenson's not mentioning them in support of his theory, shows
sufficiently that he also did not consider them as arising from the language
of the aboriginal inhabitants of India.

   But now it may be asked, what is the use of these comparisons ? what
does it matter whether Bengali belongs, by its grammatical structure, to
the Indo-Germanic or the Turkish family of languages, provided that a
man knows enough of it to express what he wishes ? My answer is
this : from comparing languages, from finding out analogies between them,
from tracing the origin of forms in modern languages down to the living
roots of more ancient languages, and from going back, as far as it is allowed

Ito us, to see the first manifestation of human mind by human speech, we

derive, think, a threefold advantage -- an historical, practical, and philo-

sophical.
    When poetical tradition is silent, when historical records are lost, when

physiological researches fail, language will speak and decide whether there
has been a community and connection in the intellectual development of
different people. One of the most important questions of ethnological phi
lology, which is now pending, the question of the origin and the con
nection of the Babylonian, Assyrian and Median civilization, art and lan
guage, can only be solved effectively by the language of the inscriptions
which have been found in the ancient cities of Babylon, Nineveh and Perse-

polis. It is as if it were by Providence that these monuments have been
preserved during many centuries under the protecting veil of the earth, and

that they are now discovered at a time when comparative philology has,
by the study of the ancient languages of Egypt, Aramea, Persia and India,
grown strong enough to master them, and to read in the arrows of these
inscriptions the hieroglyphics of the human mind.

    But in India too there are still many questions to be answered as far as
ethnological philology is concerned. We are generally inclined to consider
the inhabitants of this vast country as one great branch of the Caucasian
race, differing from the other branches of the same race merely by its darker
complexion. This difference of colour has been accounted for by the influ
ence of a climate which has produced a similar change of colour even in

Ifthose who, like the Portuguese, have settled there only for some centuries.
     we look however more attentively at the descriptions which have been
given of the physical properties of many tribes inhabiting the west and a
great part of the centre of India, some in the mountainous districts of the
Vindhya, like the Bhillas, Meras, Kolas, Gondas and Paharias, some even
in the northern parts of the Himalaya and Beloochistan, as the Rajis or
348 REPORT-- 1847.

Doms and the Brahuis, and others in the interior of the Dekhan, we cannot

but adroit that we meet here with a different race, which, by its physical and
intellectual type, resembles closely the negro. The historical existence of
this people we can trace in the Mahabbfirata as well as in the history of
Herodotus, in both of which we find them mentioned in the north and north
west of India, while the existence of the same dark race in the south is

authenticated, not only by Indian poems, but also by Strabo.
   There is also some difference between the Brahminical inhabitants of the
north and the south of India, the latter being rather short in their stature
and dark in their complexion, not however so much as not to show still on
both sides the noble stamp of the Caucasian race.
But while on physiological grounds we should find no difficulty in admit-
ting those two races as the inhabitants of India, we have still to account for
Ifthe difference of language which exists between the north and south of this
peninsula.  the great mass of the inhabitants of the Dekhan belongs to

the Caucasian race, one would expect to find also amongst them a Cauca
sian or Indo- Germanic language. Instead of this we find that the southern
languages are entirely and originally different from the Arian languages
spoken in the north, and that they bear, so far as we may judge from the
latest researches, a resemblance to the dialects spoken by the savage tribes,
like the Bhillas and Gondas, which we considered as having a Cushite

origin.

   But although these facts may seem contradictory and perplexing, yet these
contradictions between the results of physiological and linguistical inquiries
may be accounted for and reconciled by the aid of early tradition and

history.
When the Arian tribes immigrated into the north of India, they came as

a warrior-like people, vanquishing, destroying and subjecting the savage
and despised inhabitants of those countries. We generally find that it is the
fate of the negro race, when brought into hostile contact with the Japhetic
race, to be either destroyed and annihilated, or to fall into a state of slavery

and degradation, from which, if at all, it recovers by the slow process of

assimilation. This has been the case in the north of India. The greater
part of its former inhabitants have entirely vanished at the approach of the
Arian civilization ; some however submitted to the yoke of the conquerors,
and many of these have, after a long period of slavery, during which they
adopted the manners, religion and language of their superiors, risen to a
new social and intellectual independence. The lower classes of the Hindus
consist of those aboriginal inhabitants, and some of them continue still up
to the present day in a state of the utmost degradation, living as outcasts
in forests or as servants in villages. Some however who came into a closer
contact with their masters, by living as servants and workmen in the vicinity
of towns, or in the houses of their employers, have intellectually and phy

sically undergone a complete regeneration, so that after three thousand years
it would be difficult to trace the Sudra origin of many highly distinguished
families in India.
   The Arian conquerors of India did not however settle over the whole of

Hindustan, but following first a southern and then a south-eastern direction,
they left a great part of Western India untouched ; and it is there that
we find still those aboriginal tribes, which, escaping the influence of the
Brahminical as well as afterwards of the Rajput and Mahomedan conquer
ors, preserve together with their rude language and savage manners the un-
couth type of their negro origin. North of the tract of the Arian occupa

tions only few of these Autochthones have been spared, yet some remains
of them may be recognised in the tribes of the Rajis or Doms, who live in
the mountainous parts of the Himalaya. They all belong to the same wide
spread people with whom but lately in Gondwana English armies came into
hostile contact to prevent their pillage and human sacrifices ; and it is curious
to see how the descendants of the same race, to which the first conquerors
and masters of India belonged, return, after having followed the northern
development of the Japhetic race to their primordial soil, to accomplish the
glorious work of civilization, which had been left unfinished by their Arian
brethren.

    Wholly different from the manner in which the Brahminical people over
came the north of India, was the way they adopted of taking possession of
and settling in the country south of the Vindhya. They did not enter
there in crushing masses with the destroying force of arms, but in the more
peaceful way of extensive colonization (acramas), under the protection and
countenance of the powerful empires in the north.

    Though sometimes engaged in wars with their neighbouring tribes, these

colonies generally have not taken an offensive but only a defensive part ; and
it appears that, after having introduced Brahminical institutions, laws and
religion, especially along the two coasts of the sea, they did not pretend to
impose their language upon the much more numerous inhabitants of the
Dekhan, but that they followed the wiser policy of adopting themselves the
language of the aboriginal people, and of conveying through its medium their
knowledge and instruction to the minds of uncivilized tribes. In this way
they refined the rude language of the earlier inhabitants, and brought it to

a perfection which rivals even the Sanscrit. By these mutual concessions

a much more favourable assimilation took place between the Arian and
aboriginal race, and the south of India became afterwards the last refuge
of Brahminical science, when it was banished from the north by the into
lerant Mohammedans. There remain still in some parts of the interior of
the Dekhan some savage tribes, never reached by the touch of civilization ;
yet upon the whole the Arian population, though comparatively small in

number, has overgrown the former population, so that physically only few

marks of a different blood remain. It is interesting and important to ob
serve how the beneficial influence of a higher civilization may be effectually

exercised without    forcing   the people    to   give    upbythwehiricho,wnif  language     and to
adopt that of their   foreign   conquerors,    a  result                        successful,   every

vital principle of an independent and natural development is necessarily

destroyed.

   The practical advantage of comparative philology is perhaps less evident,
because only few have availed themselves of the results of this science, and
applied them to the practical study of languages. Every one however knows
how difficult it is to learn the first rudiments of a grammar, because all those

terminations, suffixes and prefixes, with which our memory is at first over
loaded, are to our mind but mere sounds and names, while, by tracing their
origin, their historical development, and their affinity with grammatical forms

of other known languages, we begin to take some interest in them, and by put

ting them in connection with other ideas, find it easier to keep them in memory

quickly and firmly. Besides, having once acquired the real understanding

of any grammatical form, and having put its origin and power into its proper

light, we can afterwards dispense with a great many rules which are neces
sary only from the want of a real understanding of these grammatical forms.
These forms once thoroughly understood, we acquire a kind of feeling which
350  REPORT -- 1847-

tells us in any particular case how far grammatical elements, in accordance

with their primitive power, are able to express different shadows of mean
ing in the spoken language of a people.

   On the advantage which philosophy or science in general derives from
comparative philology, 1 do not venture to add anything after what was
so fully and clearly explained yesterday by Chevalier Bunsen, the re
presentative of German science in this country. Language must be consi
dered, in its connection with nature and with the human mind, as being the
natural expression of every natural impression, as being the higher unity
and absolute reality of objective nature and subjective mind. Language
stands in the system of the intellectual world as light stands in the system
of the physical world, comprising all, penetrating all, and revealing all.
There is more indeed to be read in human language itself than in anything

that has been written in it.

^FFoouurr,th Report on Atmospheric Waves. By W. R. Birt.

IIn accordance with the resolution adopted at the last meeting of the British

Association, have the honour to report that about thirty sets of observations
have been obtained from various stations in the British Islands : the extreme
points of the area embraced by these stations are the Orkneys and Jersey in
one direction, and Galway and Dover in the other. The observations have
been executed with great care by the respective observers, and mostly at the
hours named in the instructions. In some cases the observations have been

continued through October, November and December ; in others, they com
mence about the middle of October and terminate at the end of November.

IAs instances of the increasing interest manifested on this subject, have the
Ipleasure to notice that have been furnished with curves from stations in the
North, where the barometric movements have been considered to result from
the transit of the great November wave. These curves are referred in each case
to the same period, namely, from the 2nd to the 17th of November ; and the
observers have invariably regarded the regular rise and fall that occurred
between these epochs as indicating a well-marked return of the great sym
metrical wave.

observers from which observations have been received : it is right to mention
that a series of observations was received from Birmingham, but the curve
presents so many anomalies, that it has not (except in some minor instances)
been employed in deducing any of the succeeding results.

352 report -- 1847.

   The return of the November wave in the year 1846 occurred under very
dissimilar circumstances to any that have been noticed in former years, and
when contrasted with its transit in 1842, is extremely remarkable. The ba
rometer at London maintained an elevation above thirty inches from the 26th
of October until the 16th of November, both inclusive, with a very slight
depression ("012 only) below thirty inches on the afternoon of the 2nd, the
period of the commencement of the wave. About 9 a.m. of the 17th, the
mercurial column had slightly descended below thirty inches, so that the de

velopment of the wave at London was altogether above thirty incites. In
1845 the crest was scarcely elevated above this line. In consequence of this
peculiarity the London curve is flat compared with those of former years,

the altitude scarcely exceeding half an inch; these circumstances, in connexion
with the usual character of the weather attendant on an elevated mercurial
column, and the absence of strong gales of wind at the commencement and
close of the wave, had no small tendency to mask it in the south-eastern parts
of our island. The projected curve however strikingly developes its essen
tial features. The five subordinate waves, of which the great wave is com
posed, are well seen, although the inflexions are not strong ; the central or
crowning wave at London occupied_/?ve days ; the subordinate waves on the
anterior slope a little more than a day and a half each ; the wave that im
mediately followed the central wave exhibited a greater development, having
an amplitude of four days; and the closing subordinate wave a day and a
half. The epoch of transit, November 9th, was slightly earlier than usual,
but sufficiently near to regard these movements as a decided return of the
wave, and strictly in accordance with the type as expressed in my last report.

I IPrevious to proceeding with the examination of the observations received,

   beg to solicit the attention of the Association to the principle that laid
down in my last report, namely, that a barometric curve, including a com
plete rise and fall at any one station, does not represent the form of any
reality in nature. The peculiar combination of barometric ascents and de
scents occurring about this period of November, and exhibiting a remarkably
symmetrical arrangement under very diverse circumstances and with very-
different barometric altitudes, is a phenomenon that appears to receive its
explanation in the crossing of various systems of atmospheric waves or cur
rents. The south-eastern portions of our island have generally presented the
most symmetrical curves ; and this circumstance, connected with the constant
decrease of oscillation from the north-west, appears to indicate that about
this part of the year, whatever may be the volumes of the individual waves
of pressure, however they may be affected with regard to velocity, or may
be superposed on much more extensive normal waves, the two systems so
cross each other in their respective progressions towards the north-east and
south-east, as to produce by their combined effects the barometric phaeno-
mena (so far as regards the curve) really observed. In the following notices
of the observations, the term wave will be restricted to the protuberances on
the symmetrical curve.

    The most symmetrical curve has been obtained from observations made
on board H.M.S.V. Porcupine, under the superintendence of Captain Fre
derick Bullock. The wave commenced off Walmer on the 2nd, culmi
nated on the 10th, the ship being in Kamsgate harbour, and terminated on
the 17th, the vessel in Dover harbour. This curve is characterized by a
rapid fall, which took place immediately upon the culmination of the great

wave, value 27 between 9 a.m. of the 10th, and 3 p.m. of the 1 1th. A second
culmination, the crest of the first subordinate wave on the posterior slope,

occurred on the 13th.
   The highest reading of the barometer in the series occurred at St. Vigean's
                    ON ATMOSrHERIC WAVES.                                                        353

near Arbroath, east of Scotland, at 3 p.m. of November 12th, the cresc of the
first subordinate wave on the posterior slope, value SO^. This wave at this
station, and indeed at all the northern stations, was so strongly developed as
to appear in. the form of a large protuberance on the back of the symmetrical
wave. The culmination of the great wave occurred at 6 p.m. of the 10th,
value 30"64 ; the fall immediately after this culmination was slight compared
with that at Ramsgate, value '06 ; the barometer commenced rising at St.
Vigean's earlier than at Ramsgate.

   At Stornoway in the Western Isles, the curve obtained from observations
made on board H.M. ketch Sparrow, under the direction of Commander

Otter, presents a most striking and marked difference to that representing
the observations at Ramsgate. At the commencement of the great wave the
barometer at the Western Isles was more than half an inch below that at
Ramsgate, wind S.W., force 9. The two anterior waves, which were scarcely
perceptible at Ramsgate, were well-developed at the Western Isles, the baro
meter at the latter station gaining on that at Ramsgate during their transits.
On the evening of the 6th both barometers began to rise, the one at the
Western Isles very rapidly, so that at noon of the 8th the pressure was equal
at the two stations. The curves then diverged, Ramsgate being still supe
rior, and the movements being of an opposite character until midnight of the
9th. The fall characterizing the Ramsgate curve did not occur at the West
ern Isles ; the curve at the latter station continued to rise until the forenoon
of the 12th, when the altitude of the barometer was equal to that at St.
Vigean's : these curves, Stornoway and St. Vigean's, run nearly together until
the morning of the 15th, both being superior to Ramsgate ; at 9 p.m. of the
15th the Stornoway curve crosses the Ramsgate, the barometer at the
former station falling rapidly. At Stornoway the first wave on the posterior
slope of the symmetrical wave is so strongly developed as completely to
mask the central wave.

   The following Table exhibits the phenomena above noticed ; also the alter
nations of the barometric differences.

   Isles north-west of Scotland, and Ramsgate south-east of England, during

Somewhat similar alternations of pressure were exhibited at the stations
Stornoway and Helstone ; in the following Table the altitudes have been cor

rected and reduced to the level of the sea. It is to be remarked that during
the period of the great wave, the curve at Helstone was altogether inferior
to that at Kamsgate.

sected as many times ; upon the setting-in of the central wave they began to
diverge, Stornoway being superior ; the rise at both stations from 9 p.m. of
the 6th to noon of the 8th was very rapid ; the greatest amount of divergence
occurred on the transit of the maximum on the 12th; after which they
converge until the 16th, when they run together.

   In consequence of the greater development of the first posterior subordi
nate wave in the north-west, the symmetry of the great wave is destroyed in

these localities : the two crests are clearly traceable in all the curves, although
at the Orkneys and Stornoway the crest of the central wave is considerably
below that of its succeeding wave, so much so as to prevent its appearing

even as a subordinate maximum. Observations from the following stations,
Stornoway, the Orkneys, Largs, Applegarth Manse, St. Vigean's, Limerick
and Galway, all agree in reading the maximum of the first posterior subordi
nate wave higher than that of the central wave, and clearly mark out Scotland
and the western parts of Ireland as the area of the greatest development of
this wave. The Limerick

From the 8th to the 12th, the barometers at the Orkneys and Limerick ex
hibited equal pressures. The maximum at Limerick was somewhat similar

to that at Largs, and after its transit the curves at the stations were also

somewhat similar.

The Limerick curve may be classed with the north-western, not only as

agreeing with the Stornoway and Orkneys' curves in the greater development
of the maximum of the 12th, but also in its numerous intersections of the

curves at Stornoway, Largs, Applegarth and the Orkneys. From this we learn
that during the period of the great wave over an area extending from Lime
rick towards the north-east as far as the Orkneys, the barometric differences
did not exceed *30 *. Galway is excepted from this class. During the ante
rior slope of the wave the pressure at this station was generally "30 below that
at the other stations, and with one exception always more than -20.
The curve at Galway in Ireland differs most materially from all the others,

not only in its general form having a large protuberance on the anterior slope
of the great wave, which gives the appearance of a broud crest, extending
from noon of the 7th to midnight of the 12th, with an intermediate depres-

   * This may be interestingly compared with the differences of Ramsgate and Stornoway,
and goes far to show that the greater differences of atmospheric pressure result more or less
from the north-western system of waves, and that the greater oscillations approach us from
the north-west.

sion, but also (with the exception of this protuberance) being considerably
below all the other curves. This, which at first sight appears as a very ano
malous character, is clearly explained by the presence of a ridge of pressure,
hereafter to be noticed, existing in the neighbourhood of Arbroath, of which
the low pressure at Galway appears to be the posterior trough. This is borne
out by the pressure at Limerick so far recovering as to be classed among the
north-west curves.

    The Limerick and Helstonc curves exhibit a somewhat symmetrical alter
nation of pressure. Until midnight of the 6th the barometer at Helstonc was
higher than that at Limerick ; at this time both barometers were rising, but
that at Limerick much more rapidly than that at Helstone. Helstone attained
its principal maximum, the crown of the great wave, on the 9th ; from this
time to the 12th the movements at both stations were opposite, rising slightly
at Limerick, falling slightly at Helstone. After the passage of the second
maximum, which occurred earliest at Limerick, the curves converge, and
cross about 9 p.m. of the 15th at nearly the same altitude as that at which
they intersected on the 6th.

    During the first eight days the Helstone curve is found among those of
the north-western group. From this group it considerably diverges in the
interval between the passages of the two crests on the 9th and 12th, and is
again found among the north-western curves after the 14th.

    The curve representing observations at St. Helier, Jersey, presents a stri
king resemblance to those of Helstone and Limerick, until the maximum of
the 9th ; after this date it more closely follows the Helstone curve. The
intersections of the three curves occur nearly at the same epochs as the inter
sections of the Helstone and Limerick curves, -- midnight of the 6th, and
noon of the 15th. In many respects the Jersey curve resembles that of
Ramsgate ; and it closely agrees with the Helstone curve, in being altogether
lower and not intersecting the Ramsgate curve.

    The whole extent of the British Isles is divided into two barometric areas,
distinguished in one case by the superiority of the maximum of the 9th, that
of the central or crowning wave of the great symmetrical wave ; and in the
other by the superiority of the maximum of the 12th, that of the first sub
ordinate wave on the posterior slope. A line passing between Arbroath and
Newcastle, south of Dumfries, and between Ireland and Wales, separates these
areas. North-west of this line we find the maximum of the 12th superior,
and attaining its greatest altitude at Arbroath. South-east of this line we
find the maximum of the 9th superior. The following Table exhibits the de
pression of the maximum of the 12th below that of the 9th. It will be seen
that this depression increases towards the south-east angle of our island.

Distribution of Pressure.-- In the following remarks the term wave is
       used in the same sense as indicated in my last Report. See definition
      and phamomena of an atmospheric wave.
   Distribution of Pressure. -- In examining the distribution of pressure over
the area of the British Isles, as manifested by these observations, the first
point that strikes our attention is the existence of a crest which extended
from Jersey to Limerick on the evening of the 4th, and transited the stations
in the following order : Jersey, Helstone, Limerick. This crest was situated
on the posterior slope of a wave, probably at right angles to as indicated
                                                                                                                                                     :

by the pressure decreasing from Jersey to Limerick immediately on the
transit of this crest the barometer fell at the three stations; the greatest fall
occurred at Jersey the next in order was at Helstone, and the smallest at

   During the passage of this crest, and indeed nearly throughout the whole

of the transit of the great wave, the barometer at St. Vigean's was supe
rior to those at all the northern stations. The barometer at Newcastle was

also superior to that at Helstone, with only one exception, during the same
period. This exhibited in the following Table, in which the readings of
both barometers have been reduced to the level of the sea.

358 REPORT -- 1847-

   At the commencement of     the   wtahveeoabspeorsvtaetrioionrs,s--lope  that  extended  towards
                                by
the north-west was indicated

      Kamsgate.                            Jersey.
      London.                              Helstone.
      Arbroath.                            Limerick.

It would appear that at stations south-west of Arbroath the barometer
indicated a decrease of pressure, so that a posterior slope contemporaneous
with the one just noticed extended towards the south-west. That the crest
of this last-mentioned slope passed near St. Vigean's is extremely probable,
from the superiority of the Stornoway to the Orkneys' curve. This superi
ority was maintained during the transits of the two maxima of the 9th and
12th : we have consequently the crest passing in the direction of Arbroath

to Stornoway, with a very slow motion towards the north-east
The curves at Largs and Limerick bear testimony to the same conclusion ;
throughout the whole of their course, with one or two very slight exceptions,
the curve at Largs is superior to that at Limerick. The three stations, Ar
broath, Largs, Limerick, clearly indicate                                  of
of this slowly-moving wave*. We have       the presence                          the  posterior  slope

                                           therefore --

I. The posterior slope of a wave extending from north-east to south-west.
II.   The posterior  slope of a wave extending from south-east to north-west
III.   And a wave    moving much more rapidly than either coming from the

      south-west, the crest passing over the area in about one day.
This wave forms the second subordinate wave on the anterior slope of

      the great wave, point a, fig. 8.

   The next remarkable phenomenon that occurred was the transit of the

trough succeeding the posterior slope of the north-west wave (II.), which

took place about midnight of the 6th, as indicated by the intersections of the
curves at Jersey, Helstone and Limerick (see fig. 8, first intersection of
curves). The altitude of the intersection was 3O05. As usual the greatest
rise occurred in the north-west ; but upon the transit of the crest on the 4th
the greatest fall was observed in the south-east The curves in fig. 8, as far
as the point of intersection, illustrate this.

                           Helstone

                        Limerick .

   * The same fact ia indicated by the Ramsgate and Jersey curves. The Jersey curve
throughout the whole of its course is below that of Ramsgate. The same thing holds good
of the Ramsgate and Helstone curves ; Helstone is inferior to Ramsgate.

    The most striking and conclusive evidence we have on this head is the general inferiority
of the Galway curve, which clearly indicates the posterior trough of this slow-moving wave ;
in fact, so low is this curve as compared with all the others, that at first sight we may be
inclined to attribute its inferiority to some circumstances connected with the instrument ; we
however find towards the close of the great wave, and more especially during the succeeding
three days, the Galway curve approaching the Stornoway curve, and intersecting it shortly
after noon of the 20th. The same phenomena are presented by the Jersey and Ramsgate
curves ; the former approaches the Ramsgate curve, and intersects it about the same time
the Galway intersects the Stornoway curve. The movements at Limerick are precisely in
accordance with this slow-moving wave ; the station is situated under the anterior slope of
the succeeding wave. The curve at Limerick first approaches that at Stornoway, intersects
it about the close of the great wave, and rises considerably above Stornoway and Galway.
ON ATMOSPHERIC WAVES.  359

   The abrupt and precipitous rise that occurred at all the northern stations
ofand especially at Galway, appeared to be compounded of the anterior slopes

     the two waves that succeeded ; first, the wave-crest that passed over the
area from the south-west on the 4th; and second, the posterior slope that
produced the diminution of pressure from the south-east towards the north
west at the same time. About noon of the 6th the barometer began to rise
rapidly at Limerick and Helstone; it was nearly 9 at night when the rise
commenced at Jersey and London. It also commenced about the same time
at Largs and Stornoway ; at a later period at Ramsgate, and about midnight
at Arbroath and the Orkneys. The anterior slope of the second south
 westerly wave was fully established over the area by midnight of the 6th.
 The intersections of the Limerick, Helstone, and Jersey curves clearly indi
 cate the presence of the anterior slope of the second north-westerly wave.

     An intersection of the Ramsgate and London curves, from the transit of
 the trough succeeding the posterior slope of the north-west wave (II.), did not
 occur. From the rise of the 6th to nearly the end of their course they run

 together : the curves at Helstone and Jersey run nearly together from the 6th
 until the 1 1th, and this would indicate that the trough either remained in the
  neighbourhood of Jersey, or that it was very broad and nearly of the same
 level. Limerick is usually "10 above Helstone, so that we have a diminution

 of pressure from Limerick to Helstone of that amount. The observations

  from Hobbs' Point agree with this diminution, and clearly indicate the pre
  sence of the anterior slope of the succeeding north-west wave. This wave
  does not appear to have extended much further towards the north-east than
  the line joining Ramsgate and Limerick, as the original slope from south-east
  to north-west exists for several days after, although much contracted, unless
  the south-westerly slope produced the appearance of a succeeding wave.

       The abrupt rise which commenced on the 6th terminated about 9 a.m. of
  the 8th, when the barometer passed a slight maximum at Limerick : this
  maximum also occurred in a slighter degree at Helstone ; at Galway it was
  very decided, and can be traced more or less in all the northern curves.

      This rise was greatest at the north-western stations, those that were situ
  ated towards the trough of the first north-west wave : it appears to have been
  occasioned by the anterior slope of a south-west wave succeeding the south
   west wave that transited on the 4th ; by its influence the curves at Stornoway
  and Largs were brought to a level with the London and Ramsgate curves,
  and this would indicate the direction of the crest. A careful consideration
  of the curves leads to the conclusion that the two south-west waves were en
   tirely independent of each other, the greatest swell of the first occurring in
   the neighbourhood of Jersey, that of the second in the north-west ; their

    directions also appear to be decidedly different.

Phenomena of the Barometric Rise observed over the area on the 6th, 7th, Hth,
                            9th and \0th of November 1846.

   ( 1),(2). Helstone and Limerick, Nov.6, 9 a.m. -- This rise was first observed
at Helstone and Limerick, and at these stations evidently resulted from the
anterior slope of the wave, or rather waves, that succeeded those that transited
on the 4th and 5th. The rise at Helstone was at first rapid, but at 9 a.m.
of the 7th it received a slight check. A very decided bulge occurred during
the night between the 7th and 8th ; at 9 a.m. of the 8th the barometer passed
a slight maximum, the principal maximum occurring at 9 p.m. of the 9th.

    At Limerick the rise was much more rapid ; from the intersection of the
curves at midnight of the 6th, it appears certain that the anterior trough of

the north-west wave had passed Helstone ; the rapid rise, probably from the
360 REPORT-- 1847.

anterior slope of the south-west wave, received a check still slighter than at
Helstone about the same time ; about 10 a.m. of the 8th the barometer

passed a slight maximum.     p.m. -- The   barometer,  which had been falling since
   (3). Galway, Nov. 6, 3
midnight of the 5th, from the same cause as at Limerick and Helstone,
namely, the posterior slope of the south-westerly wave, suddenly commenced
rising very rapidly. Observation at 3 p.m. 29-64. At midnight, after rising
·26 inch, it received a check ; this was about the time the trough of the
north-west wave passed. At 6 a.m. of the 7th it again commenced rising,
and at 9 a.m. had attained the altitude of 30' 10, making a rise of '46 in 18
hours. After this epoch it rose but slightly, attaining a maximum of 30'15

at 3 p.m. of the 8th, the maximum previously observed at Helstone and Li

merick. After this it as gradually declined until 9 a.m. of the 9th, when it
began to fall rather rapidly. From 8 p.m. of the 7th to 9 a.m. of the 9th it

was nearly stationary, presenting a broad well-defined symmetrical crest.

While this stationary character of the barometer occurred at Galway, the ba
rometers at Limerick
   (4). Hobbs' Point,   and  Helstone were       both rising.   succeeding  the wave-

                             6, 9 p.m.--The
crest of the 4th noticed at Helstone, Limerick and Galway, appears to have

oeen obliterated at Hobbs' Point ; it is scarcely observable in the Jersey curve ;
and appears as a very slight rise on the upward movement of the curve at
Hobbs' Point. The great rise commences at 9 p.m., and continues uninter
ruptedly until the maximum of the 8th is attained at 9 a.m. This is about
the period of the Helstone and Limerick maximum, and earlier than the
Galway. The later occurrence of the commencement of the rise appears to
have resulted from the progress of the two anterior slopes. After the pas
sage of                                                      but slight

but slightly discernible at this station. The great rise is however very
distinct, commencing at 3 p.m., and it proceeds almost uninterruptedly until
9 a.m. of the 8th. After this epoch the curve more resembles the Helstone
and Limerick curves in its                       principal maximum of the 9th.

                             3 p.m.

of the 4th and 5th is observed at this station as at Stratton ; the great rise
commenced about the same time, 8 p.m., and proceeded with some rather con
siderable trepidation to the maximum of the 8th, which in this curve appears
only as a slight bulge on the upward movement to the maximum of the 9th.
   (7). Brecon, Nov. 5, 5 p.m. -- The wave-crest of the 4th, extending from

Jersey to Limerick, passed Hobbs' Point, Brecon and Birmingham nearly at

the same time. It is worthy of notice, that at Gloucester, Cirencester, Not
tingham and Newcastle it is nearly obliterated ; the succeeding wave to this
crest was quite obliterated at Brecon, so that the rise at the station com
menced at 5 p.m. of the 5th, and proceeded uninterruptedly until the maxi
mum of the 8th at 9 a.m.

   (8). Jersey, Nov. 6, 5 p.m. -- The rise at this station commenced at 5 p.m. of
the 6th ; this was clearly from the anterior slope of the south-west wave; it is

much less rapid than either at Helstone or Limerick. The interruption of the

7th, observed at Limerick and Galway, is marked by a small bulge, indicating
the same causes to have operated over a tract from Jersey to Galway. These

causes appear either to have ceased or to have been rendered neutral at Hobbs'
Point, Brecon, Gloucester and Cirencester.
   (9). Ramsgate, Nov. 6, 9 p.m. -- An almost uninterrupted rise with the

same bul<>e of the 7th, but a greater range. This range appears to have
arisen from a funnel-shaped depression early in the morning of the 6th.

   (10) . London.-- An undulating rise, the bulge of the 7th well-marked, but
later than at Jersey. The barometer experienced a decided check at 9 a.m.
of the 9th, maximum at night. This check is seen at Newcastle and Ma

kerstoun.                           9 p.m. -- The
                                    at Gloucester
of  (11) . Nottingham,     Nov. 6,                 same obliteration of the waves
    the 4th and ,5th, as  observed                 and Cirencester, is noticed here.
The curves at Gloucester and this station are very similar We may notice,
that this appears to obtain in certain localities and in certain directions across
the island. Thus Applegarth and Makerstoun present nearly similar curves.
The curves at Hobbs' Point, Gloucester and Nottingham, are also very simi
lar, and the direction of these lines, Applegarth and Makerstoun, Gloucester
and Nottingham, are nearly the same. The curves at Hobbs' Point, Glouces
ter and Nottingham, all agree in a very considerable rise previous to the
transit of the crest of the 4th ; but instead of the deep depression noticed at

Jersey after this crest had passed, a very slight depression indeed occurs at
Hobbs' Point and Gloucester, and none at all at Nottingham. The great
rise occurs at Nottingham at 9 p.m. of the 6th, and proceeds almost uninter
ruptedly until the maximum of the 9th, with the exception of a slight bulge
answering to the interruption of the 7th in the south-western and western
curves.
    (12) . Newcastle, Nov. 6, 3 p.m. -- The curve at this station in some re

markable features presents considerable similarity to the curve at Birming
ham, especially in the considerable rise previous to the transit of the wave-
crest of the 4th, and the slight development of this and the succeeding wave.
The great rise commences at 3 p.m. of the 6th ; it is however but slight
during the 6th and 7th, and in this respect presents a most marked contrast
to the great rise at Galway. At 9 p.m. of the 7th a rapid rise took place,
which terminated at 9 a.m. of the 8th ; the barometer, however, continued
to rise until 9 a.m. of the 9th at a slower rate : this rise from 9 p.m. of

the 7th to 9 a.m. of the 9th, appears to have been the same as that noticed
at Birmingham from 3 p.m. of the 8th to 9 a.m. of the 9th, and to have re

sulted from the anterior slope      of a north-west wave.   this  station  presents  an
   (13) . Makerstoun, Nov. 6,       1 p.m. -- The curve at

almost uninterrupted rise from the 6th to the maximum of the 10th; it ex
hibits much trepidation ; the maximum of the 8th apparent as a bulge (only

one observation).         3  p.m. -- The  barometer  commenced    rising   at this

   (14) . Largs, Nov. 6,
station at 8 p.m., the same hour as at Galway, and continued to rise until
3 a.m. of the 7th, when it received a cheek. This is clearlv identical with
the first portion of the Galway curve (Galway -26, Largs -13). This check
continued until 3 p.m. of the 7th, the barometer having risen -02, when it
again commenced rising. At 9 p.m. it was again checked. This second check
appears to be identical with the shoulder of the Galway curve at 9 a.m. of
the 7th. At 3 a.m. of the 8th another rise commenced, and the maximum
of the 8th was attained at 9 p.m., six hours later than the same maximum at

Galway.
   (15) . Applegarth, Nov. 6, 9 p.m The rise at this station could not be

said to have commenced until 9 p.m. The barometer had been slightly
rising since 9 p.m. of the 5th, producing a small bulge ; this bulge is evi
dently the rise of the 5th, the succeeding wave to the crest of the 4th, so
conspicuous from Helstone to Galway. This wave is more or less apparent

in all the northern stations, particularly St. Vigean's ; its principal develop
ment occurred at Galway. The great rise is well-marked, proceeding almost
uninterruptedly to the maximum of the 10th, two bulges marking the curve

   Distribution of pressure. --We have already noticed the direction of the
wave-crest of the 4th across England and Scotland. Arbroath is still the
highest point, indicating the position of the slow-moving crest (I.) ; its alti
tude is about '10 higher than the crest of the second south-west wave. About
midnight of the 7th the curves at Ramsgate and Arbroath intersected from
the transit of the trough of the north-west wave.

    Contemporaneous with the slow-moving crest passing from Arbroath to
Stornoway, we have a depression passing from Newcastle to Dumfries. We
have already noticed Galway as the point of greatest depression ; it is highly
probable that the elevation south-west of this depression raised London and
 Ramsgate above Limerick.

    Although the barometer passed a maximum on the 8th, which is more or
less apparent in all the northern curves, it continued to rise over the whole
area until the 9th, when a fall occurred in the south-east. The passage of
the maximum just preceding this fall, marks the true crest of the symmetrical
wave. The following Table exhibits the epochs of transit, and clearly indi
cates the passage of the. crest from the south-west.

   In the north-west the barometer continued to rise from the approach of the
crest of the north-west wave succeeding the trough before noticed. In con

sequence of the two movements the anterior slope became well-developed
after the 10th.

    From these considerations, we learn that about seven days elapsed during
the transit of the posterior slope of the first north-west wave, the inter
vening trough, and the succeeding anterior slope of the second north-west
wave.

    In the year 1842, the interval that elapsed between the greatest develop
ment of the posterior slope of wave No. 2, which came from the north-west,
and that of the greatest development of the anterior slope of wave No. 4,
also from the north-west, was eight days (Report, 1846, pp. 147 to 153).
During the transits of these slopes we had two waves of the south-west system,
with a small one, Crest No. 7.

   In the fall which succeeded the transit of the crest from the south-west on

the 9th, we observe precisely the opposite effects to those noticed on the

occasion of the rise of this wave, or of that immediately preceding it. When
the anterior slope was coming up, the posterior slope of the north-west wave
extended from south-east to north-west, we consequently had the greatest rise
in the north-west. Now the anterior slope extends in the same direction,

and the crest is rapidly approaching, we have the greatest fall in the south

east.

   Upon the transit of the crest of the north-west wave on the 12th, all the
curves, especially the northern, were characterized by a deep and preci
pitous fall. In the year 1842 a similar characteristic was observed ; the
extent of the fall at the Orkneys and the time elapsed are nearly similar in
both cases. It appears that the transits of north-westerly waves are charac
terized by deep and precipitous posterior slopes in the north-west ; at least,
in so far as the period of the great symmetrical wave is concerned. At the
period of this fall in 1846 the barometers at Arbroath and Stornoway in
dicated an equality of pressure, which was maintained for nearly three days.
Largs, which had been superior to the Orkneys since the 6th, slightly inter
sected at the transit of the north-west crest, but soon regained its superiority ;
this is in strict accordance with our previous remarks on the slow-moving
wave-crest. Dumfries and Ramsgate are the next that intersect at a still
lower level under the posterior slope of the south-west wave ; Helstone is still
lower than Ramsgate and Dumfries ; and Jersey exhibits a still smaller
amount of pressure. The extent of this fall from the transit of the crest to
the close of the great wave is exhibited in Table IX.

   From these numbers it appears that the fall at the Western Isles was more
than three times as great as the fall at Jersey.

   This table brings clearly before us the locality of greatest range, namely
the north-west, a result perfectly in accordance with those of previous inves
tigations. It appears that sufficient attention has not been given to this
subject. Table X. exhibits the barometric ranges from the anterior trough

regular gradation from the north-west to the south-east. A correct deter
mination of the barometric ranges, and the construction of a map of lines of
similar range, would go far to make us acquainted at least with the localities
of great barometric disturbances, and the directions in which these disturb
ances are either compensated by opposite movements or more or less oblite
rated by the interference of different systems of waves. The results of this
and former investigations appear to indicate that the principal line of dimi
nution of range is from north-west to south-east, and that the greatest dis
turbance results from the transits of the north-west waves.

   Table XII. exhibits the barometric fall resulting from the troughs that

crossed in the centre and south-east of England on the 11th of November
1842, and marked the commencement of the great symmetrical wave in that
year. The numbers clearly mark out the area of greatest disturbance, namely
Scotland, Ireland, and the north of England. In the south and south-east of
England the disturbance is less-- it also diminishes in Norway. At Paris and
St. Petersburgh it is very much less than at the other stations, and at Geneva
the movements are almost of an opposite character. The deep and sudden
posterior slope of crest No. 2 ( Report, 1846, pages 147 and 167) did not make

                                    Results.

   In collecting the results of this examination, the following points of simi
larity, with the results of previous investigations, are strikingly exhibited.
   First. The return of the great symmetrical wave. This, as we before no
ticed, occurred in the south-eastern angle of our island under very peculiar and

remarkable circumstances, the barometer being above thirty inches during the
entire period of its development. The area of greatest symmetry is closely in
accordance with the results of our former discussions ; this circumstance goes

garded as, in a certain sense, a nodal point, where irregularities are smoothed
down, and oscillatory movement in general is more or less checked; and
such movements increase in amount as we recede from Brussels as a centre,

especially  towards the north-west as far as Markree." Ramsgate, the                                                                                   nearest
station to  Brussels, presents us with the curve of greatest symmetry.
                                                                                                                                                          It is
however not only the general symmetry of the curve that constitutes this
point of similarity, we have the essential features exhibited in the Jive sub
ordinate waves which peculiarly characterize the great symmetrical wave of
November. As we proceed from the south-east towards the north-west, we

have the symmetry considerably departed from by the greater development

of the first subordinate wave on the posterior slope; this forms a most re
markable contrast to the symmetrical wave of November 1845, which at
this part presented a considerable depression. It is not a little curious,
and goes far to show that we are approaching the true explanation of the
nodal character of Brussels, to observe that movements so dissimilar in

their character, so opposite in their value, and presenting themselves under
such a diversity of aspects, should, in a certain locality and on particular
lines of country, manifest by means of the barometer, constant and well

defined phaenomena that may be recognised year after year, and give to
the curves of barometric rise ami fall during the period of their occurrence

a peculiar symmetrical appearance.
Second. On examining each individual curve, and carefully discussing
the barometric differences between the stations, we are led to the same re
                                                    of the symmetrical wave of

1842, --that two systems of waves
of progress from the north-west, the other from the south-west, traversed the
area during the period of the great wave. The relative positions of these
waves are somewhat different to those of the individual waves of 1842.
There are however these points of similarity, the north-west systems exhibit

in each case the largest waves, both as regards amplitude and altitude ; we
have already seen that the intervals between similar phases of north-west

waves were nearly equal in 1842 and 1846, and also that during the interval
that elapsed between the transits of these similar phases, both in 1842 and
1846, the same number of south-westerly waves passed over the area.
Brussels appears to be situated in or near the point whore these differently-

directed waves most usually cross each other, and this to a great extent
explains both the nodal character of Brussels, and the production of the great
symmetrical wave or curve.

   It appears highly probable, from the examination of the observations of
last autumn, that we have not only ascertained another return of the great
symmetrical wave, but have also detected the return of at least three of the
individual waves contributing to its production.
Third. The very precipitous fall characterizing the posterior slopes of
the north-west system is another striking similarity which is developed by
the discussion of these observations. Although at Ramsgate, London and

Jersey, the barometric movements are gentle and greatly in accordance with
the Brussels movements, yet in the north-west the fall is precipitous, and

towards the close of the wave very rapid. At the Orkneys the movements
of 1842 and 1846, about the same part of the great wave, in each case present

great similarity in this respect.
We now pass on to notice as briefly as possible the actual phaenomena
that occurred over the area embraced by the observations
of the great wave.                                        during the period
                                                          slope of a north
   At the commencement of the great wave the posterior
west wave extended from Ramsgate towards the north-west ; it would appear
that the two anterior subordinate maxima of the symmetrical curve were pro
duced by the crests of two waves from the south-west, the second having a
general altitude in the north-west of about -2 higher than the first; interval
between the crests nearly two days. These waves were succeeded by another
from the south-west with a still greater altitude ; this third wave from the

south-west formed the crown of the symmetrical curve. The effect of the
posterior slope of the north-west wave at Ramsgate is clearly perceptible in
counteracting the rise resulting from the anterior slope of the second south
west wave, and this in some degree contributes to the symmetry of the curve.
By the time the crest of the third south-westerly wave transits the area, the
anterior slope of the succeeding north-west wave approaches, and occasions
a rise of the barometer in the north-west, while it is falling in the south-east
from the posterior slope of the third south-west wave. On the I2th and 13th
the crest of the north-west wave transits, and is immediately succeeded in the

north-west by the deep and precipitous slope that usually characterises the

north-westerly waves.
   During the transits of these waves there appears to have existed a wave
                  ON ATMOSPHERIC WAVES.                                              369

having its posterior slope towards the south-west and its posterior trough in
the locality of Galway, and moving with a very slow motion. It is highly
probable that the high state of the barometer, in certain localities, during
the period of the great wave, was connected with this wave*.
   It is important to notice here that the British Islands present a far too
limited area for the purpose of thoroughly examining these atmospheric move
ments. Throughout the whole course of the great wave, movements of an
opposite character seldom occur, and when they do, they are of a very trifling

nature ; the most striking opposite movements are those at Ramsgate and
Stornoway, Plate II. fig. 4, and these result from waves belonging to two

different systems, and do not continue a day and a half.
   In the more extensive examination which the movements of November 1824

are now undergoing, to which allusion has been made in the postscript to my

last Report, we find four stations at which the barometric movements present
opposite characters during the first eight days of November. These stations
III.are Christiania and St. Petersburgh in the north, and Paris and Geneva in
the south, Plate  fig. 10. The curves at St. Petersburgh and Geneva pre

sent the most decided opposition, which, from a comparison of the movements
at other stations, results from the slopes of two south-west waves, one suc
ceeding the other ; this opposition indicates the half-breadth of the first wave
as extending from St. Petersburgh to Geneva, and clearly shows that, for
the purpose of completely apprehending the real nature of the individual
waves, the crossing of which give rise to the symmetrical curve, we must very
considerably enlarge our area of observation. The rise at St. Petersburgh
results from the transit of the anterior slope of wave, Crest No. 1, discussion
1842, and the contemporaneous fall at Geneva from the transit of the poste
rior slope of this wave : the succeeding rise at Geneva from the anterior
slope of wave No. 3, and the contemporaneous fall at St. Petersburgh from
the posterior slope of No. 1.
There is some reason to believe that the north-west system is composed of

much larger waves than the south-west, and that the crests stretch from the
extreme south to the extreme north of Europe ; a glance at a map of Europe
will immediately convince us that the area over which these waves have

hitherto been examined, is altogether too contracted to give us satisfactory
answers to many of the questions propounded in the review taken of the de
siderata which forms the third part of my last report. The centre of Europe

is well dotted over with barometers, from which accurate results may be ob
tained ; these, however, taken in connection with the British Isles, form but

a small portion of the vast space over which the waves themselves extend.

St. Petersburgh is an important northern station ; but we require good obser
vations from Iceland, the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, and Lapland,

and also from Archangel in one direction ; and from the southern parts of
France, from Spain, Portugal and the northern parts of Africa in the other.
Observations stretching from the most western point of Africa to the extreme
north of Europe, would go far to determine the longitudinal direction of the
crests of the north-west system of waves.
   Taking into consideration the vast extent of these waves, we readily see
that there can bebuton* nodal point common to the European systems. All
our observations direct us to Brussels as that nodal point. It is situated

nearly midway between the extremities of the land, forming the western
boundary of North Africa and Europe, which runs in a general direction
S.S.W. and N.N.E. ; and it is highly probable the centres of the crests of the
north-west systems of waves pass near its locality, having considerably sub
sided as they passed over England. The general directiou of the flowing of
the south-westerly waves would be that of the land above-mentioned, Brussels
being the general meeting-point of the two systems.
In addition to the observations having immediate reference to the great
symmetrical wave, and extending through October, November and December,
I have been furnished with observations from Helstone in Cornwall by M.
P. Moyle, Esq., and also with observations from Newcastle-on-Tyne by
George Muras, Esq. ; from August 1845 to December 1846, they have been
made at 9 a.m., 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., and contain all the requisite data for ex
hibiting the gaseous pressure only, reduced to the level of the sea. As the

vations, with especial reference to the wind at both stations, as elucidatory
of Prof. Dove's parallel currents. This discussion is not yet sufficiently

advanced to present any results to the present meeting.

                                  Progress.

   We are now in possession of materials for examining the great symmetri
cal wave of November, on the occasions of its transits in the years 1842,
1845 and 1846 ; we also possess a few sets of observations for 1843 and 1 844.
Of the above-named years the examination of 1842 has proceeded to the

greatest extent ; the postscript accompanying my last report contains the

latest information relative to the great wave of 1842, with the exception of
the discussion of the St. Petersburgh and Geneva observations, on a plan
similar to the discussion of Mr. Brown's observations, as detailed in my last
report. These stations being considerably removed from those forming the
subjects of the discussion just alluded to, the observations require a par
ticular mode of treatment in order to incorporate them with the others, and
by means of the whole, to trace the law of continuity of the separate waves,
and thus follow them in their progress  over the continent of Europe
respectively pass onward towards the                                                as                   they

careful discussion of the observations at each station in connection with

every other set, from stations to the westward hitherto examined, in order
to obtain a correct notion of the distribution of pressure, and the progress of
the lines of maxima and minima over so vast a space as we have now mace-
rials for examining, is necessary before the observations at stations to the
eastward are discussed, otherwise we lose many of the essential features of the
waves, which become exceedingly modified in their progress, and we fail to
detect them at the more remote stations. The Russian observations, as be

fore stated, will add most materially to our knowledge of these movements ;
but the discussion of
involve much labour.   them on    the  plan above-mentioned, must necessarily
                                  yet  only combined the observations from St.

Petersburgh and Geneva, with those recorded on page 141, and of this ex
tended group they form the most eastern stations. This combination has
proceeded through the first eight days of November, and appears fully
capable of explaining all the barometric movements during those eight days.

It will however be desirable to postpone the further report of this part of the
Iinquiry until the observations at more of the Russian stations have beeu

severally discussed, with reference to the more extended group, as appre
hend some important and valuable information will be elicited especially
illustrative of the transit of the waves over eastern Europe.

   The barometric curve at any one station being a compound effect resulting
from the transit of two or more individual atmospheric waves, before we shall
be able fully to explain the symmetrical curves, as they occur year after year
in the southern and south-eastern parts of our island, as well as the decrease
of oscillation especially from the north-west towards the nodal point, Brussels,
and assign the numerical expression of its increase in different directions from
this nodal point, it will be necessary to study the individual waves, and en
deavour clearly to apprehend them in the totality of their existence ; until we
can do this we shall be unable to assign the true causes of the symmetrical
curve. To assist in this part of the inquiry, we have already alluded to the
importance of extending the range of observation, both in a northerly and
southerly direction, but especially towards the south-west : observations from
the Mediterranean, as suggested by Sir John Herschel, will also be extremely

important.

  A most important point appears to be developing itself by means of such

observations as form the subject of the present report: two localities of
great interest are brought prominently into view. The observations from
the north-west appear most strongly to indicate that, somewhere in that di
rection, the origin of the great barometric disturbances, a centre of oscilla
tion giving rise to the waves that pass onwards towards the south-east, is to
be sought. We have already mentioned Iceland as an important station,
and under the aspect just contemplated its importance is considerably in
creased ; its proximity to the coast of Greenland will render it still more valu
able as a connecting link between the great American and European systems
of waves. From the point of disturbance, wherever situated, the greatest
decrease of oscillation is noticed towards the south-east, or, more strictly

speaking, on a line from the Orkneys to Brussels ; this line more or less ranges
along the eastern coasts of Scotland and England, and conducts us to the
locality of least oscillation, the nodal point, Brussels, already noticed. Were it
not for the south-westerly system of waves, which are continually crossing
those from the north-west, the numbers representing the decrease of oscilla
tion from the Orkneys to Brussels could readily be ascertained ; but before
we can do this in a satisfactory manner we must be well-acquainted with the
phenomena presented by the south-westerly system, and especially ascer

tain if this set of waves also exhibits a decrease of oscillation with its amount,
should it do so. Under this aspect, observations from the south-west will

possess a much greater value, than by considering them only as important to
determine the longitudinal directions of the crests of the north-west waves.

observations,  most respectfully  solicit a continuance  of  the  grant.  Birt.

Plate I. Consists of a selection of twenty curves, that are so arranged as to
exhibit the modifications of form, decrease of oscillation and ap
proach to symmetry which are observable as we proceed from the
north-west, the locality of greatest barometric disturbance, towards
Brussels, the nodal point of the two principal European systems of
atmospheric waves. In the first five curves, which are from stations
bordering on the Atlantic, and embracing nearly the whole of the
north-western boundary of the British Isles, the greater amount of
oscillation is well seen. The decrease of oscillation, the change of
form, and the approach to symmetry, become apparent in the Scotch
curves, as we recede from the area of greatest disturbance ; and                    /'

               these features are more strikingly developed as we proceed across
               England to Kent, which presents us with the most symmetrical
               curve, that obtained from observations at Ramsgate, the lowest in
               the Plate ; the smaller altitude of this curve, especially as compared
               with the north-western curves, is very striking.

             principally consists in the greater development of the anterior sub

'emperature Tables, by Prof. W. H. Dove, Cor. Mem. of the British
 Association : with Introductory Remarks by Lieut.-Col. Edward
 Sabine, General Secretary.

The following pages contain the numerical elements of an investigation on
which Professor Dove has been employed for several years past; they con
sist of the mean temperatures of the different months of the year, of the sea
sons, and of the year itself, at above 800 stations on the surface of the globe,
with the differences between the summer and winter seasons, and the hottest

and coldest months, and a notice of the number of years during which the
observations have been continued in each case, and of the hours of observa
tion. The original memoir, in which this assemblage of the results of ob
servation will be embodied, will appear in the volume of the Transactions of
the Berlin Academy of Sciences, which will be published in the course of
1848; in that memoir the temperatures will be expressed in degrees of

Beaumur's scale, which is more commonly used in Germany than either
Fahrenheit's or the Centigrade ; the transformation of these into Fahrenheit's

scale, in which they appear in the subjoined tables, is Professor Dove's own
work ; a labour undertaken and executed by him expressly for the conve
nience of the members of the British Association, and of those who profit by
its publications. Whether we regard this sacrifice of time, on the part of a
person who is undoubtedly in the first rank of those who are advancing by the
sure path of induction into hitherto uninvestigated regions of meteorological
science, simply as an evidence of his desire to promote the general advance
ment of science ; or, as perhaps we may permit ourselves to do, as an evi
dence of that general desire, of which he has given so many proofs, strength
ened in this particular case by the recollection of the respect and regard with
                                                                              meeting of the British

tables to British readers.

The mean temperatures have not been corrected for the diurnal variation

corresponding to the particular hour or hours at which the observations were

374 REPORT 1847-

Besides the correction already noticed for the diurnal variation of the
temperature corresponding to the particular hour or hours at which the
observations at a station have been made (which has only been applied in a
few specified instances in the subjoined tables, as it appeared preferable to
give generally the original determinations independent of the corrections),
the mean temperatures derived from the particular year or years during
which the observations were continued at each station, will require in each
case to be corrected for the non-periodic variation of the temperature in the
year or years in question. On this subject the reader is referred to the
preface and to pp. 34 to 59 of Professor Dove's fourth memoir (entitled as
above) in the Transactions of the Berlin Academy for 1847. From the
mean temperatures corrected for the diurnal and for the non-periodic
variations, Professor Dove proposes to construct isothermal curves for each
month of the year, and has expressed his intention of taking a future oppor
tunity of communicating the curves to the British Association ; but he is
desirous that in the mean time a few of the more striking phenomena which

have been brought into notice by this extensive assemblage and intercompari-
son of the results of observation should be briefly indicated.

   1. The most novel at least, if not the most important of these, is the re
markable cosmical fact which they establish, of the existence of an annual
variation in the aggregate mean temperature at the surface of the globe,
having its period of maximum during the sun's northern declination, and of

Ifminimum during his southern declination.
         we compare the temperatures at stations in the southern hemisphere
with those of stations of corresponding latitude in the northern hemisphere,
we find that it is generally the fact, that the sum of the simultaneous mean
temperatures at the two stations in the months of June, July and August

(or of those months which constitute the northern summer and the southern
winter), is greater than the sum of the simultaneous mean temperatures in
December, January and February, or in the months which constitute the
northern winter and southern summer. Let us take for example the com
parison of the mean temperatures in the seasons at Toronto, latitude
43° 40' N., and Hobarton, latitude 42° 53' S., derived in each case from five

years of hourly observation at the magnetical atid meteorological observa
tories at those stations ; we have from 37,296 observations at Toronto, and

37,320 at  Hobarton (Sundays not     being days     of  observation)  the mean     tem
peratures  of the different seasons  as follows :  --

   We perceive by this comparison that the mean temperature of the months
of December, January and February at Toronto + the mean temperature of
the same months at Hobarton, exceeds by 22°"7 the mean temperature of
the months of June, July and August at Toronto + the mean temperature

Ifof the same months at Hobarton.

Africa, New Holland, New Zealand, or the Falkland Islands, with stations
in corresponding latitudes in the northern hemisphere, we find a similar
result, though varying, as might be expected, in the amount of difference at
the two periods of the year ; but all testifying that the aggregate mean tem
perature at the surface of the globe is greater in June, July and August,
than in December, January and February. This is a result of the unequal
distribution of land and sea in the two hemispheres, and of the difference
in the effect produced by the sun's heat according as it impinges on a solid
or on a liquid surface. It is well-known that Britain is nearly the middle
point of an hemisphere distinguished by the preponderance of land at the
surface, and New Zealand the middle, or nearly so, of an hemisphere di
stinguished by the preponderance of an aqueous surface. The greater pro
portion of land is consequently in the northern hemisphere as taken with
reference to the sun's path ; whilst the southern hemisphere has the greater
proportion of ocean surface. The existence of a periodical variation of the
aggregate mean temperature derived from the sun, might thence have been
(and possibly may have been) anticipated, but it is now made known to us as
an experimental fact, by the modern practice of systematic observation, and
of the intercomparison of mean numerical results 30 obtained.

   2. The differences between the hottest and the coldest months of the
year, which form a part of the results of Professor Dove's investigation, are

Ifa very important element in judging of climatic relations.

        the intercomparison of these differences be extended so as to include

places which differ in latitude as well as in other circumstances by which
climate is influenced, we may find in these tables striking examples of the
great diversity which takes place in different parts of the globe in the dis
tribution of the mean temperature of the year into its several months and
seasons. Thus if we refer to Commewine in Guiana, and Jakutsk in Siberia,
we find the difference between the hottest and coldest months to be 20,2 of

Fahrenheit at Commewine, and 1140,4 at Jakutsk; and if we limit the

comparison to places which correspond in latitude, to stations for example
in Northern Asia compared with others in Europe or in North America, we

shall still find that the diversity is very great in this respect.
   The terms of Insular and Continental climates have been employed to

characterise respectively those climates in which the difference of the mean
temperatures of the hottest and coldest months is very small, and those in
which it is extremely large.

   The distinction thus established and the designations so employed have
been understood to refer exclusively to the differences between the extreme
temperatures either of months or of seasons, and to be irrespective of the
absolute mean temperature of the year, season or month. It is obvious how
ever that circumstances might exist, which would cause the mean temperature
of the coldest month, for example, at a station to be extremely low when
viewed in reference to what might be regarded as the normal temperature of
that month corresponding to the parallel of latitude, whilst other circum
stances might be wanting which would occasion the mean temperature of the
hottest month to be excessive in the other extreme, when compared in like

manner with a normal temperature corresponding to the latitude ; or vice
versa, that the temperature of the hottest month might be excessive in re
spect to heat, whilst that of the coldest month might not suffer a correspond
ing depression. In such cases the mere difference between the temperatures
of opposite seasons or of the extreme months, irrespective of the difference
of the temperature of either from a normal temperature, would fail to render

manifest and to distinguish the peculiarity which prevails during one portion

of the year only. By the assemblage of a great body of observations from a
great variety of places, normal values may now be assigned for the mean tem
perature of months and seasons as well as of the year, and thus abnormal
differences occurring at any period or during any portion of the year may at
once be recognised. From the progress already made in this branch of the
inquiry, Professor Dove is enabled to show, in respect to the continents of
the northern hemisphere, that northern and central Asia have what may be
termed a true Continental climate both in winter and in summer, viz. a cold

winter and a hot summer ; that Europe has a true insular or sea climate in
both seasons, viz. a mild winter and a cold summer ; and that North America

inclines to a continental climate i;i winter and to a sea climate in summer.

   Consistently with these distinctions, the isot hernials representing mean
temperatures of the year are found in a lower latitude in America than in
either Europe or Asia : the differences between the extremes of temperature
in the year are greater in northern and central Asia than in North America,
and greater in North America than in Europe ; and the lemniscate form of
the winter isothermals around two centres, one in Asia and the other in

America, passes in the summer isothermals into a circular form around an

American centre only. The lemniscate form of the lower isothermals in the

northern hemisphere has been supposed by some philosophers to indicate a

causal connexion with the magnetic isodynamics of highest value, from the
circumstance that these latter have also the form of lemniscates. The

systematic and progressive secular change which the isodynamics undergo
has always, however, constituted a strong objection to this hypothesis of
causal connection ; and it now further appears that the lemniscate form itself
of the isothermals subsists only during the winter season ; that it is in fact

merely a periodical phase, whereas the isodynamic lemniscates undergo no

such periodical variations.

Many local meteorological phaenomena previously known as remarkable
but insulated facts, are found to arrange themselves in due subordinate con
nexion with                                              which  mreesnutltionfsro--m thseo

    By resolving the thus corrected 24 equations, the following values for the
corrections of the Gaussian constants are derived :--

   Moreover, the mean error for one of the 610 primary equations having
been=39'3, it will now, by applying the above-mentioned corrections to the
Gaussian constants, be reduced to 20"^.

The weights of some of those corrections are, for instance, --

of M4''=3'l,          ofA^'=6-5, ofA^°=8-3,                           of Mu=28'l,

whence the mean error: --

for AA4-'= 11-8,      for    =8-2,        for A^°=7-2, for Mu=3'9.

   In order to compare the old errors of the primary equations called n, with
the corresponding errors after the substitution of the new values of the
Gaussian constants, we have chosen 9 stations situated the furthest possible
from each other.

    In this theory the tether is regarded as a continuous fluid substance, and is treated
mathematically on hydrodynamical principles. By means of a new general equation
in hydrodynamics, which the author has discovered, he shows that a filament of the
fluid may continue in agitation without lateral spreading, and that motion may be
propagated along it uniformly, provided the motion consist of vibrations partly lon
gitudinal and partly transversal, following the law of sines. Such a filament in
motion is supposed to correspond to a ray of light. The sensation of light is due to
the transverse vibrations. In a ray of common light the transverse motion is in
planes passing through the axis of the ray, and is alike in all directions from the
axis ; in a plane-polarized ray the transverse motion is in planes not passing through
the axis ; and in an elliptically polarized ray the transverse vibrations are elliptical.
Professor Challis has extended his theory to the phamomena of double refraction,
by a method which involves a new theory of the dispersion of light. He finds the
surface of elasticity to be that of an ellipsoid, which is not in accordance with Fres-
nel's theory of double refraction. The equation of the wave-surface however, the

same as Fresnel's theory.

               By M. Davidow (communicated            Prof. Braschinann).

   This theory gives all positions of equilibrium for any floating body, and contains
new investigations on the general theory of stability of equilibrium, with their appli
cations to floating bodies. The determination of all equilibrium-positions offers

great difficulties to analysis. Dupin resolved this problem geometrically in his
'Applications de Geometrie et de Mecanique,' but M. Davidow has given a general
analytic solution of the problem with numerous
       Determination of the Equilibrium-positions of  applications.     --

Uito fluid remains, as well known, in equilibrium when the weight of the removed
fluid equal to that of the body, and when the line which unites the centre of gra
vity of the body with that of the immerged volume perpendicular to the surface of

the fluid.

    These two conditions suffer some little change we consider that the body
partly immerged into one fluid and partly into another -- the air; and that besides

it. The design of this paper is to show that the equation is not true as a general
theorem, however correct it may be when the value of x is confined within certain
limits.

  If the equation were generally true, then the series on the right side ought, when

expanded according to ascending powers of *, to have zero for every coefficient after
that of the first power.

    Since these terms are alternately positive and negative, it is convenient to consider
separately the case of an even and of an odd number of terms ; and we shall have

   It will be seen, therefore, that in the case of an even number of terms, however
great, the first power of x vanishes, instead of being the only one that is left ; while,
on the other hand, not one of the other odd powers disappears. Also, if an odd
number of terras are taken, the first power of x does not indeed vanish, but its co
efficient is the least of the whole series, while the coefficient of every other term be
comes greater and greater as the number of terms in the original series is increased.

   Whether, therefore, we stop at an even or at an odd number of terms, the equa
tion in question cannot be generally true.

         On      the  ResistancBe yoGf .a  Fluid to two Oscillating  Spheres.
                                           G. Stokes, M.A.

   The object of this communication was to show the application of Professor Thom
son's method of images to the solution of certain problems in Hydrodynamics.
Suppose that there exists in an infinite mass of incompressible fluid a point from
which, or to which the fluid is flowing with a velocity alike in all directions. Con
ceive now two such points, of intensities equal in magnitude and opposite in sign,
to coexist in the fluid ; and then suppose these points to approach, and ultimately
coalesce, their intensities varying inversely as the distance between them. Let the
resulting point be called a singular point of the second order. The motion of the
fluid about a solid, oscillating sphere is the same as if the solid sphere were replaced
by fluid, in the centre of which existed such a point. It is easy to show that the
motion of a fluid due to a point of this kind, when the fluid is interrupted by a sphere
having its centre in the axis of the singular point, is the same as if the sphere's place
were occupied by fluid containing one singular point of the second order. By the
application of this principle may be found the resistance experienced by a sphere os
cillating in presence of a fixed sphere or plane, or within a spherical envelope, the
oscillation taking place in the line joining the centres, or perpendicular to the plane.
In a similar manner may be found the resistance to two spheres which touch, or are
connected by a rod, or to the solid made up of two spheres which cut, provided the
exterior angle of the surfaces be a submultiple of two right angles, the oscillation in
these cases also taking place in the line joining the centres. The numerical calcu
lation is very simple, and may be carried to any desired degree of accuracy.

On Electrical Images. By W. Thomson, Professor of Natural Philosophy
                                 in the University of Glasgow.

   There is no branch of natural philosophy of which the elementary laws are more
simple than those which regulate the distribution of electricity upon conducting
bodies ; yet its impracticability has always been the reproach of the mathematical
theory of electricity. Very few of the varied and interesting problems which it pre
sents have been made subjects for investigation, on account of the apparently extreme

complexity of the conditions to be satisfied ; and even when results have been forced
from it by the analytical skill and energy of a Poisson, the physical interest has been
almost lost in the struggle with mathematical difficulties, and the complexity of the

solution has eluded that full interpretation without which the mind cannot be satis

fied in any analytical operations having for their object the investigation or expres
sion of truth in natural philosophy.

   The researches of our countryman Green have entirely removed this forbidding
aspect from the theory of electricity, and led to the elementary propositions which
must constitute the legitimate foundation of every perfect mathematical structure

that is to be made from the materials furnished in the experimental laws by Coulomb.
Not only do they afford natural and complete explanations of the beautiful qualita

tive experiments which have been so interesting at all times to practical electricians,
but they suggest to the mathematician the simplest and most powerful methods of
dealing with problems, which, if attacked by the mere force of analysis, must have
remained for ever unsolved.
   The subject of this communication       is " the principle of electrical images,"  which

is suggested by Green's elementary propositions, as the proper way of treating a
great variety of problems that present themselves with reference to the distribu
tion of electricity on spherical conductors. The effect of a body electrified in any

given manner   upon an   "  uninsulated    sphere is shown to     be completely    represented
by what may   be called      the image   of the electrified body  in the sphere,"  and a sim

ple geometrical construction is given by which this image may be described. When
an electrified body is placed in the neighbourhood of two uninsulated spheres, an in
ductive                                may be represented by an infinite series of "suc
cessive  effect  is"  produced which   An algebraic expression of this result leads to solu

 the two spheres. When a single conductor bounded by segments of two spherical
 surfaces cutting at an angle which is a submultiple of two right angles is electrified
 by the influence of a charged body, the effect may be represented by means of a finite
r number of images disposed in a symmetrical manner in the circumference of a circle
 passing through the exciting body, and cutting the two spherical surfaces at right
 angles. The principle of electrical images, as applied in these two cases, may be
 illustrated by a reference to the successive images of a candle placed between two
 parallel plane mirrors, and to the symmetrically arranged images which are seen in

 the kaleidoscope.

On the Height of Auroral Arches. By the Rev. Prof. Chevallier, F.R.A.S.

   Of all the phenomena of the aurora borealis, the arches which are occasionally
seen nearly at right angles to the magnetic meridian are the most definite and per
manent, and seem to offer the most promising means of ascertaining the height of the
region in which that modification of the aurora is formed. In the 118th Number of
the Philosophical Transactions, Dr. Dalton has collected several facts on the sub

ject, and arrives at the conclusion that these arches are about 100 miles high.

Having computed the height of three such arches, I am desirous of laying the re

sults briefly before the Association. The first was the aurora of March 22, 184 1,
observed at Dunse, near Berwick, by Mr. William Stevenson ; at Durham, by myself;
at Belfast, by Mr. Stevelly ; and at York, by Mr. Phillips. The observations con
tinued for more than an hour, from 8h 5Gm Greenwich mean time to 10h ; and the posi
tion of the arch was definitely fixed by its place among the fixed stars. The direction
of the arch was magnetically east and west : its height was computed separately from
the observations at York and Durham, York and Belfast, and Belfast and Durham ;
the resulting altitudes being 156, 157, and 165 miles. The second auroral arch was
observed on Sept. 21, 1846, at Esh, near Durham, by myself, and at Norwich by

Mr. W. Marshall. It was visible only for about five minutes. The resulting height
is 106 miles. This determination depends upon two observations only. The third

auroral arch was seen on the 19th of March 1847. It was observed at Darlington,

at Spalding in Lincolnshire, at Cambridge, at Norwich, in London, Oxford, at
Amsterdam and Leeuwarden in Holland. The observations of Darlington and
Cambridge, from a base of 172 miles, give an altitude of 175'9 miles; those of
Spalding and Cambridge, from a base of 114 miles, give an altitude of 174*4 miles;
and those of Spalding and Darlington, from a base of fifty-eight miles, give an alti
tude of 174*9 miles; the mean being 175 miles. The extensive area over which
                                                  A great magnetic disturbance took place at

the same time, extending as far as Toronto. In connexion with the cause of these

phenomena, it cannot escape notice that there is great similarity between the two
kinds of auroral action and the two modes of magnetic action recently discovered
by Mr. Faraday, the ordinary auroral beams being parallel to the direction of the
magnetical meridian, and the arches being at right angles to that direction.

   This method is founded upon Bessel's mode of computing the time of the occulta
tion of a star by the moon. The apparent place of a star, with respect to the centre
of the moon, may be expressed by two groups of quantities ; one depending upon
the position of the moon with respect to the centre of the earth ; the other depend
ing upon the place of observation. The quantities which compose the first group
may be computed for a time near the middle of the occultation by simple formula! ;
and are already computed in the Berlin Ephemeris for all stars occulted at Berlin.
The quantities which compose the second group may be taken from tables easily
computed for a given place, or may be computed expressly for the given epoch, in a
very simple manner. The differences of the corresponding quantities in each of these

groups is taken and laid down on a scale, in which the earth's equatorial radius is

the unit. A circle described with a radius 0-2725 represents on the same scale the
semidiameter of the moon : and the times of immersion and emersion of the star are

given at once to the nearest minute by measurement on an accompanying scale ; the
places of immersion and emersion upon the moon's disc being represented by the same
process. The same scale once drawn serves for all occultations.

                 Oh the Moon's Atmosphere. By John Grooby.

Whether the moon has an atmosphere or body of air similar to that which sur
rounds the earth, has long been a fertile subject of dispute among philosophers ;

some affirming its existence, and others as strenuously denying it. Some who take
the negative side of the argument have urged, in defence of their opinion, the con
stant serenity of the moon's surface, always undisturbed by clouds or vapours, and
even the smallest of the numerous spots or macula; which crowd her surface being
at all times equally visible. This certainly would be a very strong argument against
an atmosphere were the assertions on which it is founded to be relied upon. But

this does not appear to be the case, for on the other hand there are many astrono
mers who affirm that the moon's surface is not always equallyclear and distinct. Again,
the existence of a lunar atmosphere has been denied, because the stars in an occul-
tation, when just about to disappear behind the body of the moon, retain their full
lustre till they seem to touch the very edge, and then vanish in a moment, which
phenomena (it is urged) could not happen if the moon were encompassed with an
atmosphere. Here again the evidence of different astronomers is at variance, one

party affirming and the other denying the fact.

   A third argument against the existence of an atmosphere (and the last I shall
notice) is this : if (it is affirmed) the moon were surrounded by an atmosphere, then
the duration of eclipses and occultations ought to be diminished by means of its
refractive power, and hence a celebrated French astronomer (in a memoir written
expressly on this subject) has endeavoured to demonstrate, that if such an atmo
sphere did exist, and its horizontal refraction amounted to only 8", there could never

Ibe a total eclipse of the sun. Many eminent astronomers concur with the one
have just quoted, in denying that anything like refraction can exist, or has ever been

observed to exist about the moon ; others equally eminent assert that they have ob
served the most unequivocal proofs of it. Both Halley and Euler speak of the evident
distortion observable in the sun's limb in total and annular eclipses. The latter in

particular says, in the eclipse of the sun, which happened in July 1748, he observed
that when the uncovered part of the sun resembled the moon in her quadrature, the
horns of the solar crescent appeared to be bent outwards beyond the circle in which
every other part of his disc was comprehended ; and when the eclipse became annu
lar, the sun's disc was dilated beyond the circle which formerly embraced it. This
dilatation was also observed by M. Poleck at Frankfort, and was estimated by Euler

at 25". Here then we have one astronomer observing in a solar eclipse a refraction
of 12}", while another, from his observations, denies that any perceptible refraction

does or can exist.

    From such contradictory evidence it seems extremely difficult to draw anything
like a satisfactory conclusion. The author suggests, as a means of arriving at some

positive inference on this subject, a careful observation of the approaching eclipse of
       9"tihf,,             attention to the        points or horns, as Euler calls them ; he

micrometer, and bring the contact of the images either to the point of one of these
horns, or, what will be better, to the edge of the annulus the moment it is formed, we

shall (if it be as Euler asserts) see the horn projected, or the annulus overlapping
the other image. It may at first be imagined that this mode of observing the pha;-
noraenon will only enable us to ascertain whether there is any perceptible projec
tion or not ; but it will do more, for if we note the time between the completion of

the annulus and the images ceasing to overlap (from the moon's limb gradually
receding from that of the sun), we shall then be able to calculate with considerable
accuracy at what distance from the moon's surface perceptible refraction ceases, and

it is this which we want to know. It is scarcely necessary to observe that the same
process reversed may also be used (and perhaps more advantageously) at the end of

the annulus.

               On Spots in the Sun. By Henry Lawson, F.R.S.

   The object of this paper was to point out the advantages of employing, for observa
tions on solar spots, telescopes with large aperture. In using these instruments the
author employs a peculiar eye-piece (see Brit. Ass. Report for 1846), which permits
the whole aperture to be effective ; and he has had several occasions of .ascertaining
that peculiar appearances and inequalities of illumination which the large apertures
exhibit, are invisible with smaller apertures.

                       By Sir        W.

The accuracy of the tables which give for an indefinite time the places of the older

planets, is at present sufficient for the purposes of astronomy, and is commensurate

with the accuracy of observation ; or if this statement appears to be exaggerated, it
will at least be admitted that the sensible errors which remain are owing rather to

inadvertence in the numerical computation than to the imperfection of the method

itself. Such a result is owing to the uninterrupted labours of the greatest mathe
maticians from the time of Newton, and is justly regarded as one of the greatest

triumphs of human intelligence. But it must be recollected that these methods, by
which the perturbations of the older planets have been obtained, are applicable only
to the case of orbits nearly circular, and little inclined to each other ; so that the
general solution of the problem of the three bodies, as it is called, remains to the
present day imperfect. The methods in use for the older planets are founded, as is
well known, upon the development of the disturbing function in terms of the mean
anomalies. M . Binet has indeed carried this development to quantities of the seventh
order inclusive ; but such a development is quite insufficient in the case of comets or
planets moving in highly eccentric and inclined orbits, which problem presents far
greater difficulty ; while the nature of the expression is such, that it is evidently im
practicable to carry further such a mode of development, even if the expressions were
sufficiently convergent when the eccentricity passes a certain limit.

   The only memoir with which I am acquainted which professes to give a general

great mathematician has considered the case when r<r', that is, when the disturbed
body is inferior ; and has illustrated the question by the numerical calculation of the
perturbations of the comet of Encke by Saturn. M. Hansen develops the disturbing

function according to multiple angles of the eccentric anomaly of the disturbed planet
literally ; and first, according to multiple angles of the true anomaly of the disturb
ing planet; M. Hansen next converts the cosines and sines of the multiple angles of
the true anomaly of the disturbing planet into sines and cosines of multiple angles
of the mean anomaly of that planet ; so that finally the disturbing function is exhi
bited in terms of the eccentric anomaly of the disturbed planet and the mean anomaly
of the disturbing planet ; but those series which serve to give the sines and cosines
of the multiples of the true anomaly, in terms of sines and cosiDes of the mean ano

maly, are not very convergent ; and the process becomes extremely laborious, even
in the case which M. Hansen has considered, in which, in consequence of the great
distance of Saturn, the approximation does not require to be carried nearly so far as
in the case of the perturbations of the same comet by Jupiter, and in many others
which may require consideration. Moreover, in this as in every other mode which
can be devised of developing the disturbing function literally, all quantities must be
retained of a given order ; although when they are of a different sign, in many in
stances they destroy each other ; but such reductions cannot be foreseen. The nu-

merical substitutions arc also extremely laborious, in consequence of the multitude
of terms which have to be considered.

As the disturbing function, and others which require to be integrated, are finally
exhibited by M. Hansen in terms of two variables, such that direct integration ia
impossible, M. Hansen has recourse to the integration par parties, in which each,
term by integration gives rise to a series of other terms, the nature of which is com

plicated.

   The method which I propose differs from that suggested by M. Hansen in every
particular. Instead of attempting a literal development, I insert the numerical values
of the elliptic constants in the earliest possible stage : by this means the radical,
                                                                                                                 of sines
which expresses   the mutual distance      of the planets, is explicitly a                          function  I  develop

in terras of "the eccentric anomaly of m, after having obtained expressions for the
co-ordinates of m' in terms of the eccentric anomaly of ra. Such expressions are
easy to obtain, and are very convergent. It will be recollected that before I endea
voured to develop the disturbing function in the lunar theory in terms of the mean
motions of the sun and moon, the invariable practice had been (see Mecanique Celeste,
vol. iii. p. 189) to express the co-ordinates of the sun in terms of the true longitude
of the moon j but the equation which connects the eccentric anomalies of two bodies
is far simpler than that which connects the true anomalies, or v' and r, and there
fore the conversion which I employ is made with greater facility. The quantity
under the radical sign in R may thus be considered as a function, of which the gene

ral term can be represented by             / \a --sin ( m. +i,, --W y 1,

i ia being a numerical quantity and omitting the constants which accompany v and
   v. The development of this quantity to the power -- or -- ~, may be facilitated

by the use of tables, which give the numerical coefficients in the development of

{1-- Acosu\~l, {1 -- -«fcos*}-5, &c. Such tables have been calculated for me
by Mr. Farley.                .
When r>r', that is, when the planet disturbed is superior to the disturbing planet,
I am not able to suggest any other course than to develop in terms of the true ano
maly of the disturbed planet, and the mean anomaly of the disturbing planet, and to
integrate par parties. I have obtained the law of the coefficients in the series which
results in this process, and they are highly convergent. I am confident that, by the
processes which I have attempted to describe, the perturbations of planets moving

advantages which I ascribe to them, I hope the time is not distant when the per
turbations of Pallas and of some of the comets may be reduced to a tabular form ;
but the labour required will be very considerable.
   Although my methods are specially adapted to the determination of the pertur

bations of bodies moving in eccentric orbits which cannot be developed in terms of
the mean motions, yet they embrace also the case of a planet moving in an orbit

   The process is the same in substance, whether the orbit of m is highly eccentric
and inclined, or circular, and in the same plane with that of m'; the only difference
being that, while in the former case it may be convenient to detach four terms to
form the quantity 1 + P+q; in the latter case, supposing e' the eccentricity of m' to
be inconsiderable, l-\-P-\-q may conveniently contain only two factors if the deve

required.
The advantages which the employment of tables presents wherever they can be
applied are well known. Not only the march of the figures affords security against
error, but the computer acquires facility in such calculations systematically under

taken, while the operations are more easy than they would be if the quantities re
quired were not connected   by a common origin, or so troublesome as they would be
                            individuals, or by the same individual at different times.
if undertaken by different                                                             ; but,

The use of tables is out of the question in a literal or algebraic       development  that it
on the contrary, it is an important property of the numerical           development
can thus be materially facilitated.
All developments whatever may be resolved into three classes, which I call literal,
quasi-literal, and arithmetic. Literal or algebraical are those which result when the
numerical values of the constants are inserted last, and after the development is com
plete. Quasi-literal are those which result when either a part only of the constants
are expressed by means of general symbols, or when the development is made up of
several distinct processes, and when the numerical values are inserted after a portion

of these, but not all have been accomplished.          Finally, arithmetic or numerical de
velopments are those which result when the numerical values of the constants are
inserted in place of the general symbols before any step of the development is

attempted.

   A literal development is generally preferable, for this reason, that if it can be per
formed, the development which results serves for every possible value which can be
assigned to the constants. Such, for instance, is the development of the disturbing
function due to M. Binet ; and if such a development in terms of the requisite varia

bles could be accomplished and carried out to a sufficient extent, and being accom
plished, numerical values of the constants could be easily introduced, would be
preferable to any other. M. Hansen's development, in his Memoir on the Pertur

I regard as very difficult any development of the disturbing function, either literal

or quasi-literal, when the eccentricity of the disturbed body is considerable and the
perturbations are large, as in the case of Encke's comet disturbed by Jupiter; and
if such were possible, the replacement of the numerous symbols by numbers at the
conclusion, would be an operation of almost insurmountable difficulty. On the

verging series. Such tables, combined with those described in p. 10, afford the
elementary quantities for Jupiter and Saturn in terms of the eccentric anomaly of
the comets.

   When the method of mechanical quadratures is applied to the determination of
the perturbations of comets, ^.correction is required; but when that method is used
for the determination of coefficients of this nature, the limits of the integral are 0
and 360°, and the correction vanishes ; so that by means of several particular values,
rigorous values of the coefficients are obtained. Nor does the width of the interval
matter, provided it is not made too large. It is difficult to give precise rules to
regulate the width that should be employed ; but in the formation of these tables it
was easy to employ various modes of verification. As this inquiry is in its infancy,
I considered it sufficient to retain only those terms which are due to the elliptic
motion ; but hereafter it may be desirable to reconstruct the tables of the elementary
quantities for each of the planets, retaining some of the principal inequalities due to
the disturbing force.

   Pingre, in his work on comets many years since, gave a list of comets, with their
elements. At that time, however, the method of finding the orbit, or even the
distance of a comet, was understood by so few persons, that, from that and other
causes, the numbers contained in that table may not be accurate : many other comets
have been discovered since, and such a table brought up to the present time appears
to be an important desideratum in astronomy.

Lecture on   Shooting   Stars,  delivered at the Evening Meeting in the      FR.aRd.cSli.ffe
   Library,  June 24-,  1 847.
                                 By the Rev. Professor Powell, M.An

After some general preliminary remarks and an historical sketch of the observa

tions hitherto made on this interesting but little-understood subject, the lecturer
proceeded to offer some remarks and conjectures connected with the theory of these
appearances, of which the following is a very condensed abstract.
The question so much disputed as to the connexion of luminous meteors with the
fall of meteoric stones, appears to the author to be answered sufficiently by observing
(I), that some cases of such connexion are undoubtedly established ; (2) that day
light is necessary to trace the actual fall of matter, when consequently a luminous
meteor would be invisible, unless of unusual brilliancy ; while the darkness which
renders a meteor visible precludes the possibility of tracing the fall of stones ; (3)
matter may fall in portions or in a state of division too small to trace, and there is

evidence or strong probability of matter having a meteoric origin in various lighter
forms besides that of metallic or apparently fused masses.
As to the forms of masses known to have fallen, they are by no means generally
angular or fragmentary, as sometimes asserted, in many instances being whole and
rounded in form ; sometimes also broken into fragments by their fall. There is no
evidence of a mass bursting to pieces by an explosion : the detonation heard may be

purely electric.
   Of the size of meteoric masses no sufficient evidence
meters cannot be really determined on account of the        exists.          oTfhemoatpiopnare; natnddiaif
they could, this would only give the size of the            velocity
and not that of the solid mass, if there be one.                              due to combustion),
                                                  flIafmtehe(ihf eiit'libte  be too great to allow
combustion, still less can the apparent size of the electric flash be any guide or proof
of the existence of any solid body at all.

Such small solid bodies may circulate in the solar system, but not probably in any
great number or of large size, unless as truly planetary or satellitary bodies j but
unformed diffuse masses of matter like that of comets or the zodiacal ring, are pro
bably circulating in many parts of space. It is by condensation out of this that, as

probably the existing planets, so also lesser asteroids and satellites may be continu
ally forming, as likewise meteoric masses within the sphere of the earth's influence,
agreeably to Mr. Strickland's hypothesis, that is to say, such masses of diffuse mat
ter circulating through the planetary spaces must occasionally come within the
attraction of the planets and of the earth : in this case they may either undergo a
mere deflection of their orbit, or be drawn sufficiently near to be converted into
satellites, or again may be made to fall directly to the earth. In either instance.

supposing them highly charged with electricity, on entering the sphere of the earth's
electricity, a discharge will take place, but without altering their existing motions.

   The observations of Brandes, Benzenburg and others, as is well known, have
assigned great heights to many meteors, varying from 5 to 500 miles. But M.
Quetelet has shown (2nd Memoir, Acad. Bruxelles, vol. xv.) that the mean height is
from sixteen to twenty leagues, or within the limits of the atmosphere. Hence the
majority of them may become luminous from combustion. Electric light can be dis
played in vacuo. Hence we may have various gradations of the same phaenomenon
from purely electric flashes or explosions at great altitudes to more or less complete
combustion at lower, by which the whole mass may be consumed and dissipated, or
may be partially burnt, and the metallic ingredients more or less perfectly reduced
or fused, and in this condition portions or masses may fall to the earth. And the
explosion is not the bursting of a mass, but an electric discharge : the particles or
masses which fall are portions, not fragments; and the effect, instead of being one of
breaking up, is one of consolidation ; an instance of the universal law which appears
to prevail in the oeconomy of the planetary world.

On Periodic Meteors. By the Rev. Professor Powell, M.A., F.R.S.

   The chief object of this communication was to place on record a table of all the
remarkable appearances of luminous meteors which the author has been able to col
lect up to the present time, supplementary to the very complete list given in M.
Quetelet's second catalogue (Nouv. Mem. de l'Acad. de Bruxelles, torn, xv.), which
comes down to the year 1840. This list is doubtless imperfect ; but the author sub
mits it to the Association in the hope that its deficiencies will be filled up by the
contributions of other members.

On the Eclipse of October 1847. By the Rev. Professor PowELL,iT!f./4^/'./?.5'.

   The object of this communication was to call attention to the remarkable eclipse
which is to occur on the 9th of October next, and which will be annular for a con
siderable part of the south of England. Diagrams were exhibited of the phenomena
usually attending such eclipses, to which attention ought to be directed, and a map
of its course over England and Ireland. The subject having appeared of general in
terest, a committee of the Association drew up a series of suggestions and directions
to observers, which                                                                              members, and of which a
                                 was printed and circulated among the

lowing directions and suggestions, relative to the ensuing annular eclipse of the sun,
which will take place Oct. 9, 1847, are proposed for the assistance of less-practised
observers, or those who may not have better information at hand, but who may

nevertheless render great service by noticing and recording, as well as circumstances
            any of the various points herein

annular in England and Ireland, if on any map a line be drawn through Greenwich
and Gloucester and produced, it will give the northern limit at which the eclipse
ceases to be annular. A line parallel to the last, through Padstow in Cornwall on
                        Torbay on the East, (which                   will extend
the West,     and        just below Cape Clear on                    the West,)           across the Channel to Havre,
            passes                                                                        will be the line along which
&c, and

the eclipse is both annular and central. The Southern limit lies wholly below En

gla"ndI.I. As a rough guide to the time, the commencement of the annulus will be
nearly at 7" 23"' a.m. (civil reckoning) for the extreme South-west of Ireland, at
7" 24m for a line through Land's End and Milford Haven, at 7h 25TM through the
       of Wight and Reading, at
Isle"                                        7h 25m 50*              for Walmer (Greenwich mean time).
       III. For the observations             requisite, a            telescope of very moderate power is best.

    Over a pond at Huggate, in the Wolds of Yorkshire, richly charged with phos
phoric matter from putrescent sources, Mr. Rankin saw, a few years since, in the
evening, a large globular meteor. It wa3 about two feet in diameter, rose from the
leeward side of the pond like a balloon to a height of twenty feet, and then gradually
decreased in size till it disappeared.

   The appearance was of large luminous spots on the shaded part of the lunar disc ;
indeed the whole shaded part appeared a mixture of light and shade, but the upper
part was like the luminous broad top of a mountain. The author imagined these
appearances were due to reflection of the light of Sirius, Procyon and other stars,
these having suitable positions.

    This instrument (which was invented by Mr. James Milne of Edinburgh) consists of
 three wheels, placed side by side on an axle which passes through their centres.
 The wheels are not joined, they have independent movement. An endless screw,
 common to them all, gives them simultaneous motion in the same direction, by pass
 ing onward a tooth of each wheel at each turn of the screw. The three wheels are
 of like diameter, but have different numbers of teeth, viz. 100, 101, 102 respec
tively ; with corresponding graduations on the rims of the wheels when the wheels
 are at first slipped on the axle, and put in gear with the screw, the three divisions
 or intervals of the teeth, which in the model are respectively marked 0, 101 and 102,
 are brought together and geared in the same thread of the screw. The first wheel is
 indicated on by a stationary pointer, marked A on the model. The second wheel is
 indicated on by a pointer (B on the model) attached to the first wheel, and travelling
 with its zero ; and the third wheel is indicated on by the pointer 0 attached to the
 second wheel, nnd travelling with its 101st or concluding division. Here it may be
 explained that the pointer C is joined to the second wheel by a short tube, round
 which the third wheel revolves, and through the bow of which passes the general
 axle of the instrument ; the object of this arrangement being to show the number
 which the 101st division of the second wheel would be seen at on the face of the
 third wheel, were the substance of the wheels transparent.

     The graduations of the first wheel are numbered 10, 20, 30, &c. in one direction,

 and the other two wheels are similarly numbered, but both of them in a direction
 opposite to the first ; at each hundred revolutions of the screw, the general zero of
 the instrument, marked 0, on the first wheel advances one tooth or graduation apart
 from the 101st division of the second wheel, that is, 100 revolutions of the screw (or
 what is the same thing, one entire revolution of the first wheel) will place B at 1
 on the second wheel ; another 100 revolutions will place it at 2 ; another at 3, and
 so on till it reach 101, each unit of which number denoting 100 revolutions, making
 them then amount in all to 10,100 ; and this is the entire range which would be ac
 complished were there only two wheels, and to this extent the reckoning was car
 ried by the twofold differential counter, which was the invention, it is believed, of
 James White, known as the author, among other contrivances, of a peculiar system
 of pulleys and of a singular parallel motion noticed and rewarded by Napoleon. The
·introduction of the third wheel affords, as in the instance of the Julian period, the
 recurring combinations of three cycles, and thereby gives great extension to the
                 TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                      19

range of the instrument. As zero of the first wheel, or what is the same thing, the
pointer B advances one graduation from the 101st division of the second wheel for
every 100 revolutions of the screw ; so for every 10,100 revolutions of the screw, the
101st division of the second wheel, or what is the same thing, the pointer C, falls one

graduation apart from the 102nd division of the third wheel.
   The author adds notices of the applicability of this instrument to a variety of cases

in which revolutions are to be counted, work summed, or distances measured.

Some Account of Observations made at the expense of General Sir T. M,

  J.Brisbane, to determine the variations of the laws of Terrestrial Magnetism

  with respect to height in the Atmosphere. By A. Broun.

The highest of the range of the Cheviot hills is about eighteen miles to the E.S.E.
of General Sir T. M. Brisbane's observatory at Makerstoun, the height of the sum
mit being 2660 feet above the level of the sea, and 2440 feet above the level of the
observatory. The proximity of this hill was suggestive of several experimental re
searches in terrestrial magnetism which could only be well performed with the aid
of a fixed observatory.   A series of
ginning of June, having                observations  was  accordingly made  in the  be
                          two objects  in view :--

First. The determination of the variation of the total force of the earth's magnet

ism with height. For this purpose observations were made at Makerstoun and on
the summit of Cheviot with a theodolite magnetometer by Jones, for the absolute
horizontal intensity, and with an inclinometer by Robinson, for the variations of

dip.
Second. The determination of the diurnal variations of the declination and of the

horizontal component of intensity at different heights.
   Mr. Broun had as yet been able to examine only a portion of the observations,

namely, those having reference to the variations of the magnetic declination.

The instrumental precautions adopted need not be detailed at present ; it may be
mentioned however that observations of the declinometers were made on Cheviot
and at Makerstoun 5° 0* before each hour, at the hour, and 5"° 0* after it. In order
to render the observations strictly simultaneous, two chronometers belonging to Sir
Thomas Brisbane were taken to Cheviot, and these were compared each morning
when the sun shone, with the observatory clock at Makerstoun (eighteen miles di
stant), by a method it was believed new for such a purpose. Mr. Welsh, the prin
cipal assistant at Makerstoun, threw the reflexion of the sun from a common mirror
on the Cheviot station, at times previously agreed on ; when the sunshine was not
affected by clouds, the very brilliant reflexion was seen with great distinctness with
the naked eye, at other times it could be seen with the aid of a telescope. The re
flexion waj intercepted by a screen at 30TM 0', 35TM 0', 40TM 0', &c. Makerstoun mean
time. The errors of the chronometers were thus obtained with great accuracy.
[This method, which had also occurred to Sir Thomas Brisbane, might be found
useful in determinations of longitude.] Gunpowder flashes were also obtained near

midnight.

    Several curious facts had been deduced from a comparison of the observations at
the two stations ; Mr. Broun confined himself at present to two, which were exhibited

with great distinctness.

1st. The greatest westerly declination occurred earlier at the highest station ; that
is to say, the greatest westerly position of the north end of the magnet was attained
sooner after the sun's meridian passage on Cheviot than at Makerstoun.
   2nd. The diurnal range or the amount of the diurnal oscillation was less at the

higher station.
These facts were confirmed by the observations of different days. Mr. Broun
pointed out their importance with reference to the theory of the diurnal variations.

Meteorological observations were made at the same time. A comparison with these
will be made afterwards.

   Observations were made at a station 1600 feet lower, which proved that the differ
ences were due to height only.

These results were obtained from the observations at General Sir T. M. Brisbane's

nents of magnetic force. The units of reduction were obtained by methods de

were exhibited. It would be difficult to describe the peculiarities of these motions
without the aid of the projected figures ; it was shown, however, that the diurnal
motion of the north end of the magnet as projected on the plane at right angles to
the direction of dip, consisted of two or three loops in winter, these loops becoming
gradually unfolded in the spring and autumn months, and disappearing in the sum
mer months. The amounts of motion or the perimeters of the figures are nearly

constant for the six months from April to September. It was believed that these
motions were exhibited for the first time. Dr. Lamont of Munich had projected
observations upon the assumption that the total intensity is constant, which however

is not the case.
   The motion of the magnet due to the varying hour-angle of the moon was also
shown. It was pointed out that the greater part of the motion occurred about the
time of the moon's passage of the inferior meridian, a fact which it is extremely dif

ficult to connect with any hypothesis having reference to temperature as a cause of

these motions.

                                                 M. Faraday,                      F.R.S.

   The subject of Mr. Faraday's discourse was that condition which is induced by a
magnet upon matter not ordinarily magnetic, t. e. not capable of assuming the mag
netic condition of iron. This condition he has expressed by the word diamagnetic ;
implying in some degree both its relation to and distinction from the magnetic con
dition. Both these are made plain by a simple fundamental action which takes place
when matter is subjected to the action of a powerful magnetic pole : if the matter
be magnetic, as iron, it is attracted towards the pole j if it be diamagnetic, it is, on
the contrary, repelled. The magnetic condition of iron is so marked that no pre
cautions are requisite in making its property manifest; but the diamagnetic condi
tion of such a body as water, wax or bismuth, is by comparison so weak that pro
cesses at once powerful and delicate are required to make it and its results evident.
The simplest method is to attach a piece of the substance to be examined to the end
of a light horizontal lever, as a long splinter of deal wood, the lever itself hanging by
a suspender consisting of two or more lengths of coarse silk about twelve inches
long, placed side by side, having equal tension, and attached by sealing-wax to the
same spots on two pieces of card, the one above and the other below. Such a sus
pension has great strength and scarcely any torsion, and therefore, when the pole
of an electro-magnet is placed near the substance to be examined and at the side of

the lever, the moment the magnet is made active the body is attracted or repelled

according as it is magnetic or diamagnetic. It was this fundamental property which
Mr. Faraday particularly insisted upon and illustrated by experiment with Mr.
Walker's apparatus ; for though it causes elongated bodies to take up particular

and characteristic positions, yet similar positions are sometimes given under similar
circumstances to matter magnetic in its nature ; and though the causes of these

results in the two cases are easily distinguished, when the mind is properly directed,
yet it is in the contrary and certain actions of attraction with the one set of bodies,
and repulsion with the other, that the fundamental distinction of all its consequences
are best illustrated and proved. Mr. Faraday separated many diamagnetic bodies
from the magnetic bodies by effects of this kind, and showed how the repulsive force

caused them, when elongated, to assume a position transverse to the line joining the
                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                        21

magnetic poles. He gave also a short list of substances from both classes, and he
expressed his view of the antithetical relation of the two forms of magnetic force,
and the universality of magnetism either in the one form or the other. But as
these and other points are already published in his papers forming the first part of
the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1846, it will be unnecessary further to
refer to them here.

Needle. By                                      Barlow, M.I.C.E.             of the

    Mr. W. H. Barlow is the engineer of the Midland railway, which was one of the
earliest lines on which the electric telegraph was employed.

    The portion of the line on which the telegraph is in operation consists of four main
branches, all centring in Derby.

    1st. From Derby almost directly north to Leeds, seventy-three miles.
    2nd. From Derby to Lincoln, N. 63° East, forty-eight miles.
    3rd. From Derby to Birmingham, S. 28° West, forty-one miles.
    4th. From Derby to Rugby, S. 16° East, fifty miles.
    These several lines are all supplied with electric telegraphs, on the principle
patented by Cooke and Wheatstone, which, although very generally known, it may
be well concisely to explain. The instruments for immediate observation and for
conveying signals consist of a coil of fine wire of great length, contained in a case
resembling that of a clock. On a horizontal axis are fixed two equal magnetic
needles, placed parallel to each other, but in a reversed order, so as to be perfectly
neutralized in respect of terrestrial magnetism, but very susceptible of motion, from
an electric current passing along the wire through the coil to the earth, or the con

trary, from the earth through the wire to the battery. A slight preponderance of
weight in the lower branches of the needles renders their natural position vertical;

and the signals are made by causing the needle to be deflected to the right or left,
accordingly as the coil-wire is connected with the copper or zinc pole of the battery;
the other end of the wire being in connexion with the earth at the distant terminus.

The four instruments at Derby have each an earth-connexion at Derby and at their
respective termini ; at the four places above-named, and of course when these in
struments are not in operation for signals, they are all in connexion with the earth
at Derby and at the four extremities.

   In consequence of certain spontaneous motions observed in the needles when the

instruments had only an earth-connexion, particularly in times of thunder, aurora,

&c, a register was ordered by Mr. Barlow to be kept of all such spontaneous de
flections, and was continued for six weeks ; and from a careful comparison of the

motions thus recorded, there appeared strong reason to suspect that, beside the

larger motions, such as those proceeding from atmospheric electricity, there were

smaller motions which occurred daily in the same direction at certain hours in the
day, and in a reverse direction at certain other hours, the morning change occurring
at about 10 a.m., and the evening change towards the same hour p.m.

   As however these instruments were frequently employed for the service of the

railway, the case could not be entirely established from these observations ; but as
there were some spare wires belonging (by agreement) to the Telegraph Company,
not yet put on duty, Mr. Barlow obtained permission of that Company to employ
them in his proposed further investigation. He also procured very delicate deflecto-
meters, constructed on the same principle as the telegraph- instrument, but suspended
on knife-edges instead of circular bearings, and with a face graduated to degrees.
With these instruments he caused observations to be made and recorded every five

minutes, day and night, for a fortnight, on the two telegraph-lines from Derby to
Birmingham and to Rugby.

    The details of these observations, both in a tabular and diagram form, have been
presented to the Royal Society, and from those it appears that the needles of the in
struments were generally vertical at about 10 a.m. The upper end of the needles then
commenced a deflection towards the right-hand, increasing in amount to about the
middle of the day ; they then gradually returned, becoming vertical again late in the
22 REPOBT-- 1847.

nevigehntin--g   ; the deflection   then commenced to     the   left-hand, increasing to about mid
                then returning,    became vertical again   in  the morning ; and the next day per

forming, with trifling irregularities, the same course, and this was found to recur every

day during the fortnight the observations were continued. It is thus rendered ob
vious that, from some cause still to be discovered, a current of electricity passes
during certain hours of the day along the wire and through the coil in one direction,
and for the remaining hours in a reverse direction. It appears also that the coils

and contacts were so arranged, that when the needle was deflected to the left the
direction of the current was such that a horizontal needle placed above the wire
would (from the electric influence of the wire) have its north end deflected to the
east ; and of course when the deflector was to the right, a horizontal needle similarly

situated would have its north end deflected to the west. It follows therefore that

the character of the current passing along the wire from north to south during the
midday hours, may be represented by a current passing from the copper to the zinc
pole of a battery, and during the midnight hours from the zinc to the copper pole.
The next question is, is the earth-connexion necessary for the attainment of these

results ? To test this question, the wire was disunited from the earth at each extre
mity, in which case no motion could be detected in the needle. The wire was next

connected with the earth at one extremity only ; but still no motion was observable.

A complete circuit was then made of eighty-two miles, by uniting two wires at Bir

mingham, but still without effect ; but in every instance motion was sufficiently ob
servable when the extremities were both in connexion with the earth.

From these facts the author concludes that the currents are on the earth's surface,

and that they flow spontaneously and alternately as in the wire itself, which he sup
poses from its earth-connexions to participate in the general conduction, of course
in small quantities, but which become very observable when the amount is magnified
by the coils. Moreover, as the times of vertically or of non-action on the deflecto-
meter, and the times of maximum intensity, agree so nearly with the times of change
and maximum deviation in the daily motion of the horizontal needle ; and as such
currents on the earth's surface would, from the known laws of electro-magnetism,

produce such horizontal deviations, he still further concludes that the two pheno

mena are intimately connected, and that there is strong presumptive evidence that

these currents are the immediate cause of the diurnal variation. Since the discovery
by Oersted of the reciprocal action between a galvanic conducting-wire and a magnet,
several of the phenomena due to terrestrial magnetism have been attributed to the

probable existence of terrestrial electrical currents ; and since the discovery of thermo

electric magnetism by Seeback, the sun has been considered as the probable source

from which such currents might be produced ; but this I believe is the first instance

of the phienojnenon being practically exhibited.

These experiments and observations open a new and interesting field for investiga
tion, which can only be effectually pursued by the cordial co-operation of individuals
in different localities. The question naturally occurs, what is the actual direction of

such currents? Are they directly north and south from the poles to the equator,
or have they any reference to the magnetic meridians ? The lines on which these
observations have been made are, with the exception of Derby and Lincoln, ap

proximating towards meridians ; but it would be interesting to ascertain what would
be the results obtained on an east and west line, as for instance from Norwich to
Yarmouth, or from the Red-Hill station, on the South-Eastern line, to Ashford, as

well as in other cases. The line from Derby to Lincoln inclines, as we have seen,

greatly to the east ; but it was stated in the conversation which took place at the
meeting by Mr. Barlow, that the effect on this line was not less than on the other
three. He stated further that he had made observations on the lines between Derhy
and Leicester, and between Derby and Loughborough ; that the effect exhibited on

these lines was very small, and that he believed, if he could have selected an inter
mediate station, no currents could have been detected, judging from the circumstance
that the currents were not only very inconsiderable at these places, but also of an op
posite character. The ready and liberal manner in which Mr. Hatcher, the Secretary
of the Telegraph Company, conceded the use of the Company's wires to Mr. Barlow,
leaves no doubt that this company, as also any railway company, would render every

facility to any gentleman conveniently situated near a line, having any desirable di

rection, for the further investigation of this highly interesting inquiry.

   The possibility of guarding buildings and other structures against the destructive
effects of lightuing has been made a great question in practical science, from the
time of Franklin to the present day ; and it is of considerable public importance,

of lightning, to bring this question completely under the dominion of practical

science.

damage by lightning, and for this simple reason, that what we call lightning is
the result of the electrical agency forcing a path through resisting matter, such as
the air, and extricating with explosive and expansive force both light and heat in its
course. When, on the contrary, it falls upon comparatively non-resisting bodies,
such as the metals, then this form of lightning vanishes, and the discharge assumes,

if the metallic body be sufficiently capacious, the form of a comparatively quiescent
current. Our object should be therefore in defending any building or ship from

lightning, to bring the general mass so far as possible into that passive or compara

tively non-resisting state it would have supposing it a mass of metal. This is in fact
the single and simple condition of such an application, without any reference whatever
to assumed forces of attraction, or peculiar specific powers manifested by certain
bodies for the matter of lightning, andwhich really do not exist. Thissimple principle,

by a careful mechanical arrangement calculated to render it practical and applicable

to all the duties which the general structure of a ship, together with its masts, has to

perform, is now universally carried out in the navy with the most perfect success ; so
that damage by lightning in thevessels so fitted has for the last fifteen years quite ceased.
The masts are made completely conducting by capacious plates of copper reaching from
the highest points to the keel ; and are tied into one general connection with all the
great metallic masses employed in the construction of the hull, and united by the
large bolts of copper passing through the keel and sides, with the copper expanded

over the bottom and with the sea. It is quite impossible that a discharge of light

ning can fall on the vessel in any place without being at once transmitted safely by
the conductors, not under the explosive form of lightning, but under the form of a
current without explosion.
   The author then laid before the Section certain remarkable instances of ships of
the Royal Navy thus armed being struck by powerful discharges of lightning on
foreign stations, in which the views he had been discussing were completely sub
stantiated.

                    By    Sir W.

   The author commenced by a brief account of the theory of electricity resorted to

by the French philosophers, and then proceeded to notice some physical facts which
appeared to invalidate this theory ; amongst others, the electrical condition of a
well-insulated body in a space nearly void of resistauce, and which, if preserved at a

considerable distance from conducting matter, maintained a charge as well as under
ordinary circumstances. The author, by a careful process, had been enabled to pre
serve the electricity of a small sphere in an exhausted medium for a very consider
able time, many days. In conveying a charge to a common electrical jar it might
                                                             it,
                                                                 a
be proved, that equal quantities were received into in equal times, until there was
   sort of overflow, being more analogous to the filling vessel with an inelastic fluid
a

such as water, than the condensation of an clastic fluid such as air. The action of the

proof-plane and the balance of torsion as employed           by     the celebrated philosopher

Coulomb, was next adverted to here the author endeavoured to show that great
                              ;

difficulties arose in deducing accurate results, inasmuch as the proof-plane could not
be considered as an element of the surface, and any electrometer, acting on the prin
ciple of repulsion, was liable to great uncertainty, and that hence deductions as to the
particular distribution of electricity on the surfaces of bodies were inconclusive. It
might so happen that the distribution might be uniform, and yet a proof-plate come

away more highly charged from one point than from another. The author called
attention to an experiment of the celebrated Volta, who found that an electrical

charge reposed more quietly on a long rectangular parallelogram than on a square,

although the areas of the surfaces were the same. It was to be regretted, on account
of the received mathematical theory of electricity, that all our experimental evidence
relative to the distribution of a charge on the surface of conductors rests upon expe

riments with the proof- plane, or some other body brought into contact with the
given conductor and subsequently removed from it. The author, by a new method
of experiment, had Bhown that the intensity of a charged surface of any rectangle
was the same as when rolled up into the form of a cylinder, the quantity of electri
city being the same, and that the intensity of a circular area was the same as that
of the sphere into which we might conceive it to be transformed. An electrometer

depending on the attractive forces exerted between a charged and neutral plane, was
here exhibited to the Section, and was said to be susceptible of great accuracy in
measurements of this kind. The author supposes every case of electrical attraction

to resolve itself into the conditions of the Leyden experiment, and to be a simple
case of electrical charge obtained by the opposition of two conducting surfaces with
an intervening non-conducting medium, and it is well known that in the electrical
                                                                             of

sion.                                                                            the  universe,  and to be charged

with electricity, there appears no reason from experiment to suppose h priori an un
equal distribution upon it, be the form what it may ; but if we conceive a second body
to be called into existence, then the action termed electrical induction arises between

the two, which is again reflected back by the second body upon the first, and in a
space void of resistance this induction, htfwcver small, would cause an electrical
current to flow through a space however great; but if a resisting non-conducting

medium be interposed between these bodies, then we have to consider the action upon
the interposed particles, and we have immediately a case of charge between the opposed
surfaces of the two bodies, and which will be greater in proportion to the amount of
induction or electrical disturbance of which the previously neutral body is susceptible.
In this way we may consider any two conducting bodies when opposed to each
other as forming the coatings to an intermediate mass of air, and these are all the

conditions we have to consider.

   In the case of two spheres opposed to each other, one insulated and charged with
a given quantity of electricity, the other uninsulated and free, the determination of
the laws of the attractive force were simple and the problem easy of solution, with
out any complicated consideration of an hypothetical distribution of the electricity
upon the spheres and conductors connected with them ; we had in fact a chargeable

system, with convex coatings ; we have only to consider the opposed areas. Here, in

whatever way the primary forces between the surfaces may be conceived to exist,

they are finally reduced to an action between opposite and similar points, depending
on the engagement of opposed positive and negative forces, by which an exclusive

action between certain points is established. The attractive force between the spheres,
or rather opposed hemispheres, is as the number of attracting points directly, and
as the squares of the distances inversely ; we con hence determine the position of

two points q q' within the surface of each opposed hemisphere in which we may con
ceive the whole force to be collected and to be the same as if derived from every point
on the surface. The whole force will vary as the squares of the distances between
these points inversely ; so that a unit of force at a unit of distance between the
nearest points of the spheres being given, it is easy to assign or predict the force at

any other distance at which the intermediate air can become charged. The follow

ing formula was given by the author for determining the distance of the points q q'
within the hemisphere.

in which z is the distance of the point q, a the distance between the nearest points of
the spheres, and r the radius.
   When both hemispheres are equal, the whole force will vary as                                                                 --- -- ; as the

distance between the spheres increases, the points q q' recede from the surface and
would finally coincide with the centres of the spheres, which would limit the distance
at which a charge could possibly occur.
   The author exhibited to the Section the striking agreement of the calculation with
experiment, by means of his electrical balance, consisting of a delicate scale-beam

with a duly poised suspended sphere ; the weights requisite to balance the force be

paper some magnetic experiments were exhibited illustrative of the action of the

forces between similarly placed and opposite points.
   The author observed, that every kind of case in ordinary electricity could be easily
and simply investigated upon these principles, and that unless the air between con
ductors could become charged, no attractive force would be apparent, and this would
of course limit the distance at which such force could exist                                                               has been shown by

matter to make the indications of the other instruments agree exactly. I must add,

that the differences are not owing to an error or uncertainty in marking : the mag-
netographic bars are furnished with mirrors and can be observed in the usual way.

The observations made in this way, while the instruments were marking, have in
every case shown that the marks are perfectly correct.

   My instruments, as I have mentioned before, mark forty-eight hours ; the cylinders
are about one inch in diameter. There would be no difficulty in making the instru

ments go for several days, or mark every quarter of an hour. I think observations

made  every  quarter of an  hour  would  Ibreemexatrienm, edleyar  valuable.

                  On Galvanic Connexion. By Mr. Harper.

All who are familiar with voltaic batteries have experienced the inconvenience of
connecting the positive and negative poles with other instruments, and when several
batteries are employed, of connecting one to another, in consequence of the stubborn
ness of the wires commonly used, and the time taken up in arranging the binding-

screws and wires. In order to obviate much of this inconvenience, I beg to lay be
fore the members a method which I have successfully adopted, which only suggested
itself to me last week ; it is by using a thin wire spirally formed, at each end of which
                               turns,                                                      piece of brass,
is a helix of three or  four   to the  which helices being slipped              --onthias  I have found to
soldered or fixed by a  screw          battery or other instrument,

be a sufficient contact in every case in which it has been tried. By this method
balls of wood have been covered with copper in the electrotype process for knobs of

Leyden jars, &c.

   All thin, porous bodies, derived from the vegetable and animal kingdoms, if not

exceeding ^th of an inch in thickness, may be totally deprived of their electricity by
simply holding them before a good fire for four or five seconds ; and, what is very
remarkable, though they will in a few seconds reacquire their former humidity, they
will not regain their coating of normal electricity before six or seven days have
elapsed, even in damp weather. When the same substances were pasted upon
metal or wood, they could not be deprived of their electricity by the greatest degree
of heat that could be applied without burning. The author was able, by depriving
very thin paper of its electricity by the preceding process, to connect 300 slips toge
ther, by merely smartly rubbing the uppermost six or seven times in one direction
·with India rubber. When the slips were tested, it was found that the greatest
proportion were in a negative, and the rest a positive state, though India rubber
communicates only positive electricity to paper. On the use of a flannel rubber,
which only gives negative electricity to the slip of paper which is rubbed, all that
were under it were found to be either in a positive or negative state, but without
any regularity of succession. On holding the same papers, totally deprived of elec
tricity, to the prime conductor of a plate machine, the positive electricity, on distri
buting itself throughout them, rendered some leaves plus, and others minus, as before.
The same result took place when the slips were held close to the cushions, which

ought to have communicated only negative electricity, according to received theories.
From all these facts the author infers that there is but one fluid, which becomes
positive by accumulation, and negative by distribution.

   The author afterwards investigates the nature of conduction, and shows that it
arises from the attraction between the fluid, and the metallic or other body when
charged ; and that therefore conductibility and affinity are the same powers, con
sidered under different points of view.

   It is his opinion that as conduction arises from an attraction between the metal and
28 REPORT -- 1847.

the fluid, so induction is nothing more than the repulsion of the fluid on one body
by its existing in excess on another close to it. This he exemplifies by the instance
of two bits of paper positively electrified, which will repel one another, because they
are liyhl and flexible, as well as bad conductors ; but in the case of two cylinders a
different result takes place, from their being too heavy to be moved by the fluid ;
and, if metallic, being likewise good conductors, the fluid that is in excess will retire
to the opposite end of each cylinder, if they should be both charged, according to the
law of similar states. For the same reason, when two insulated wires are placed
side by side, and a charge sent down one of them, the presence of this excess of fluid
is sufficient to cause a displacement of the normal electricity of the other wire, which
it drives before it ; and, on the current ceasing to be directed down the first wire, the
fluid that had been displaced on the other wire, being now unopposed, returns along
it, and distributes itself over the wire in the same way as at the outset.

   From these and other considerations adduced, the author is of opinion that every
case of electrical phenomenon, however complicated, may be referred to either attrac
tion or repulsion.

              On the Magnetic and Meteorologic Observatory at Bombay.

                                   By A. B. Orlebar.

   The comparatively low price of intellectual labour in India has enabled the obser
vatories there to accomplish more work than any other. The market- value of a person
competent to take the observations, and of sufficient general information to take in
terest in his duty, is not greater than that of an English ploughman ; and the market-
value of one qualified to share in the labours of the superintendent is less than that
of two. Thus, in nine months of 1845, there had been produced the materials
of an unusually thick volume of observations, which had been printed at the
American mission press of Bombay, by order of the Hon. East India Company, and
which was laid before the Section. Arrangements had been made so that the
Bombay observations of each year should be in the hands of the printer at the close
of that year, and be ready for issue at the end of the next. Thus, all the observa
tions would be available at a very early date for the use of magnetists and meteoro
logists. At the end of each volume it is intended to append whatever reductions the
superintendent may have been able to accomplish without impeding the issue of the
observations themselves. The volume before the Section contained reductions of the
declination and horizontal force for 1845 only. The peculiar method by which those
reductions had been effected was briefly explained. In seeking to estimate the accu
racy of the observations, it appeared that the accuracy of the term-day observations
is much greater than that of ordinary days when each instrument was read only once
an hour. In the case of the horizontal force, the accuracy of the former is nearly
one hundred times greater than the latter. These discrepancies were attributed
solely to the greater concentration of the observer's mind in observing. On this
account, and in order to detect any smaller changes which may occur in different
months, in the plan instituted for 1847, the hourly observations have been sacrificed
to terra observations three times a week. In this arrangement however the bihourly
observations have been preserved according to the desire of the Association. The
observations for 1846, checked by those of preceding years, have also supplied the
third diurnal change, viz. the vertical force. The practical difficulties which had im
peded the working of the balance magnetometer had been surmounted j and it had
been found advisable to suspend all dependence upon the induction inclinometer,
which is exposed to strong theoretic objections, which (if just) render the instrument
useless. The result from the balance magnetometer is that the character of the ver
tical is the same throughout the year, and is very similar to that of the horizontal
force, excepting that it changes little during the night. The assistants had noticed
that in bringing the lights to illuminate the crosses of the balance magnetometer at
night, the needle had been set in vibration. As it was proved by experiment that
the unlighted lamps were quite free from magnetism, there seemed no possibility of
attributing this to anything but light. The accidental construction of the observatory
permitted this to be tested. The sun's rays were thrown on the needle, both directly
and by reflection on the whole line of the needle, on the north end, and on the south
           TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                               29

end, whilst the needle was undisturbed in its case. The result was always the same ;
the magnet always indicated increase of strength, which diminished to its original
condition so soon as ever the light was withdrawn. This uniformity of result in all
cases is quite incompatible with any supposition that the disturbance of the magnet
was caused by currents. In order to complete the theory of the vertical force, itwas
necessary to obtain the coefficient of reduction. The method of Dr. Lloyd was ex
posed at Bombay to peculiar objections, particularly on account of the little depend
ence that could be placed on the determination of the dip, which could not be safe
within a degree, but which enters as an important quantity into Dr. Lloyd's formula.
A statical method was therefore used. The latter had the advantage of allowing fre
quent repetition ; and therefore, although not superior to Dr. Lloyd's in other re
spects, permitted much greater accuracy to be obtained in the determination of the
coefficient. This method was invented only at the close of last year ; but since that

time a daily determination of the coefficient has been made. The effect of tempera
ture upon all the magnets used in the observatory under ordinary atmospheric changes

had been proved to be insensible. It had further been shown that the diminution of
magnetism by increase of temperature was not due to the quantity of heat imparted,
but to the velocity with which it was imparted. After the heat is withdrawn, the

diminution still continues ; and after a time the magnetism gradually returns into

the magnet as before the application of heat. These discoveries explained why the
correction for temperature under ordinary circumstances had proved to be nothing.

The declination at Bombay is only about 11' East. The scale of the declinometer is
therefore read by a transit instrument ; and the readings had never gone out of the

field of the telescope even in the largest disturbances. Thus each observation be

came an absolute determination. The declination was generally moving eastward
throughout 1845. The diurnal changes of declination are not of the same character
throughout the year. From the 1st of April to the 8th of October, the most easterly
position of the magnet's north end is at I6h G.M.T. It then moves through about
4'-5 westward until 20h. Next back again through about 2f,8 until 0h or lh. Then

it again moves westward until 3h. After this time it slightly rises ; but from 5h to
13b (Bombay night) it remains nearly in its mean position ; and then in the course
of 3h moves through half its wh( la range to its extreme easterly position. But about
the winter solstice the curve has .. isumed a different figure. It has now one extreme

easterly position at 0h, and one extreme westerly position at 15h. From the early
part of October to the early part of December, the changes gradually pass from the
first to the second of those above described.

   The horizontal force has the same character of diurnal change throughout the year.

It is at a minimum about 0h, and a maximum not far from the 17th hour. The
horizontal force, which had been determined every day nearly by the Gaussian me

thod, was diminishing. The horizontal force magnetometer gave the same result.
The two however did not agree in details, and the Gaussian method seemed least
satisfactory. The Gaussian calculations however proved that the magnetisms of all

the needles were gradually diminishing, and other experiments seemed to show that

all magnets give out magnetism, some quickly and some slowly.
Time did not allow more than a reference to some of the more important steps
which had been taken in meteorological inquiry. The actinometer had engaged

much attention ; but the observations of 1841, 1842, 1845, 1846, which had been

taken to determine the daily curve, were not found to supply, even in the favourable
atmosphere of Bombay, a sufficient number of observations in perfectly clear sky to
allow any certain determination. The curve however appears to be an hyperbolic
arc, symmetrical on each side of an axis which represents the noonday heat ; the
ordinate's parallel to the axis of the hyperbola representing the heat, and the abscissae
along a line parallel to the tangent of the vertex of the hyperbola representing the
time. The  reduction of the  pterminpceipraletusre:,--tihne  order to  determine its laws, had been
commenced  on the following                                   changes  of heat during the day origi

nate in two causes ; the earth is continually receiving heat from the sun, and is con

tinually cooling by radiation. Supposing these two causes only to be in operation,
and the commonly-received laws of solar and terrestrial radiation to be assumed, a

differential equation between the hour of the day and the amount of heat in the air

at the surface may be formed and integrated without difficulty. Thus it may be

 ascertained what should be the effect of a uniform gun heating a clear calm atmo
 sphere. This will give a curve owing to the chief causes, as the elliptic curve of the
earth's motion round the sun is owing to the law of gravity towards the sun. And
 as the earth's ellipse is perturbed by other causes, so this curve will be perturbed by
 the inequality of the sun's heat, by the presence of clouds and vapour, and by winds.
The value of these perturbing causes may then be easily ascertained. But since
 solar radiation is very imperfectly understood, it was found better to ascertain the
 laws of the night in the first instance. From sunset to sunrise the earth is continu
 ally cooling by radiation ; and on a calm cloudless night ought to cool exactly ac
cording to the Newtonian law. And if a single coefficient can be ascertained, which
coefficient will depend upon the radiating power of the fields, trees, houses, &c.
around, the heat at sunset being given, the form of the curve can always be ascer
 tained for any clear calm night. Reversely from the observations on such clear,
calm times, the coefficient of radiation can be determined. Thus the curve of a clear,
calm time being determined, the value of the perturbations from winds and weather
may be ascertained from the observations. The law of perturbations thus deter
mined, they may be deducted from the actual curve of the day. Thus the day curve,
owing only to solar and terrestrial radiation, may be formed, and thus the law of
solar radiation deduced. To apply this it was necessary in the first place to analyse
the winds. Time did not permit any explanation of this analysis ; but one new fact
with regard to the wind much assisted this investigation, and deserves attention.
By comparing a great number of ship-logs, Commander Young, I.N., has formed
charts of the winds in the Indian seas. From these it appears that the south-east
trade being drawn above the equator in the month of May, in conformity with
Dove's laws, becomes a south-west wind, and following the bend of the African and
Arabian coasts becomes the south-west monsoon. This stream crosses the equator
between the African coast and 60° of longitude. It meets the peninsula of India at
Bombay, after flowing in a south-westerly course nearly in a straight line, to the
north of which it curves upwards, and to the south of which it curves southwardly.
Thus it is brought to circulate round the Maldive Islands, to the south of which it
again becomes a south-east trade.

    In order to ascertain something with regard to the uniformity of the sun as a
heating body, the solar spots have been carefully examined, and their places on the
sun's surface calculated. This has led to a classification of the spots into four
genera, assuming the distinctions and principles of Sir W. Herschel. The first con
tains those spots which are formed by strong eruptions when the luminous supply is
abundant ; the second, by weak eruptions under the same conditions as the sun's
atmosphere ; the third, by strong eruptions when the supply is weak ; the fourth, by
weak eruptions under the same luminous state. The last two are the most common ;
consequently the greater the number of spots, the weaker is the luminosity of the
sun. And therefore the calculations and statements which have shown that a greater
number of spots occur in the cooler years is not contrary to Sir William Herschel's
theory, as it has been supposed, but in exact conformity with it. Thus, some esti
mate of this important element may be formed by a careful study of the solar spots.

Notice  of  Observations carried on at the  Kew  Observatory.

                         By F. Ronalds.

    Mr. Ronalds presented his fourth annual volume of observations and experiments
made at the Kew Observatory, and stated that his preliminary experiments on the
photographic registration of the atmospheric electrometer, the thermometer, the

barometer and the declination-magnet having been (long since) completed and
published, and their results having warranted the cost and trouble of constructing
apparatus of a durable and convenient character ; a declination-magnet and a baro
meter have been mounted at Kew, which scrupulously fulfil the requisite conditions,
without the intervention of those friction-rollers, levers, pivots, or other mechanism,

which have hitherto rendered self-registering apparatus so objectionable. He added,
that it is his intention to provide, during the ensuing year, complete apparatus on
like principles for registering as many of the other meteorological and magnetical
instruments as he may have the means of doing ; and concluded by expressing a

strong desire that we should possess strictly comparable observations of atmospheric
electricity, magnetism, and the aurora made at Alten or Hammerfest (in Finmark),
at Bombay, and in thiB country ; for, he said, it may be safely affirmed, that not
withstanding all that has been written about the relationship of the aurora with
electric and magnetic phenomena, the regions, or apparent regions of the aurora
have never been subjected to electric observation in a manner at all approaching to
accuracy, or comparability with observations made here or elsewhere. Neither has
an electrometer at Bombay ever yet been compared with one in England (or even in
Europe probably). We have surely been deducing conclusions on this very curious
subject without sufficient materiel.

    Under the auspices of Col. Sabine, Dr. Lee and Col. Sykes, something must be
accomplished. In fact, an electrical apparatus is now almost on its way to Bombay
at the cost of the Honourable East India Company.

   This mineral occurs in detached mammillary masses, sometimes larger than a
walnut, and pellucid in a high degree. It is harder than glass, but is scratched,
though with difficulty, by steel, and, according to a single experiment very carefully
made, its specific gravity is 2-1016. As the mean of four experiments scarcely dif
fering from each other, it yielded

   The Mexican hyalite therefore is quite peculiar as respects the amount of its con
stituent water, this being not more than two-fifths of what has been found in the
least hydrated variety of the mineral whose analysis has been published.

   The most remarkable circumstance connected with this mineral remains to be

mentioned. The hyalites are, in all treatises on mineralogy, described as single re
fractors ; but upon transmitting through the mineral whose composition has been
given above, a ray of plane polarized light, and examining this in the usual manner
with some analysing eye-piece, it was found to possess in a very marked degree the
property of depolarizing the ray. The action, however, exerted by it appeared of an
anomalous kind ; for while in all doubly-refracting minerals, whether uniaxal or

biaxal, hitherto described, there are two positions of the crystal in which, if inter

posed for example between two tourmalins whose axes are crossed, the light con
tinues excluded, there is no position into which a lamina of this hyalite can be brought
by revolving it in its own plane in which the light will not be restored.

    The action therefore of this mineral on polarized light is not of the ordinary kind,
and can, as far as my knowledge of this difficult subject extends, only be explained
by supposing that, like rock-crystal in one particular direction, and certain essential

oils and aqueous solutions of sugar, dextrine, &c, it possesses the power of changing
the position of the plane of polarization of a plane polarized ray, or of causing it to
revolve through a greater or less angle. This view would seem to be established by

several experiments which the author detailed.
    From the facts observed Dr. Apjohn thinks he is justified in concluding that this

hyalite exercises the power denominated rotatory polarization. This property too
it possesses, no matter in what direction it is traversed by the plane polarized ray,
a circumstance which would seem to identify it with that exerted by liquids, and
32 REPORT -- 1847.

distinguish it from the analogous influence of quartz, which is manifested only in
the direction of the optic axis.
   Since the preceding remarks were put together. Dr. Apjohn has found that a ray

of light polarized by reflexion, and made to disappear by the interposition of a Ni-
choll's prism, was restored when transmitted through a particle of hyalite from
                                All varieties therefore of this mineral may be concluded

to possess the same optical properties.
To this notice Dr. Apjohn wishes to add that, on continuing his experiments, he
has since found the results to be somewhat different according to the part of the
lamina of hyalite traversed by the light, the change in the position of the plane of
polarization not having always the same direction or value, and being sometimes
null ; a fact which would seem to point to a different explanation of the phenomena
from that already suggested, and to identify the optical characters of hyalite with
those of rock crystal, the differences being explicable upon the hypothesis of the for
mer mineral being composed of a multitude of minute crystals of the latter, thrown

together without any regular or symmetric arrangement.

By Sir David BreOwnsttheer,PoKla.Hriz.,atDio.nC.Lo.f,thFe.RA.tmS.oLsophnedre.. $ V.P.R.S. Edin.

Sir David Brewster read a paper on the Polarization of the Atmosphere, and ex
hibited a Map of the Lines of Equal Polarization,  which he had projected for the
Physical Atlas of Dr. Bcrghaus and Mr. Johnston.     In this paper he treated --
1. Of the neutral point discovered by M.Arago.
2. Of a secondary neutral point which he had discovered accompanying that of
       M. Arago.
3. Of the neutral point above the sun discovered   by M. Babinet.
4. Of the neutral point below the sun discovered   by himself.
5. Of the maximum polarization of the sky.
6. Of the form of the lines of equal polarization in the atmosphere.
7. Of the construction of the map of the lines of equal polarization.
Under these seven heads the author gave a brief account of the results of his ob
servations on the polarization of the atmosphere, made during upwards of four years
at St. Andrew's, near the level of the sea. The observations were made with a Polari-
meler of his own invention, by which he measured the polarization of any part of the
sky, by a compensating and opposite polarization indicated by the polarimeter. In this
way he ascertained that the curves of equal polarization have the general character of
Iemniscates, resembling the curves of equal double refraction in biaxal crystals, the
neutral points corresponding with the poles of no polarization, or the optic axes in

biaxal crystals.
   In the normal state of the atmosphere, at sunrise and sunset, the distance of the
neutral point from the sun, or from the point opposite the sun, is taken in conformity
with observation at 18j°. As the sun descends below the horizon, M. Arago's
neutral point separates from the antisolar point, or the point opposite to the sun.
As the sun rises the other two neutral points approach to his disc, and after the sun
passes the meridian they separate from it. When the sun is in the zenith the system
of curves is the same as that of uniaxal crystals.

After giving an account of some new results at which he had arrived in the pro
secution of this subject, and showing how the position and magnitude of the bands
could be determined when the indices of refraction of the two media were known,
and how by this means the indices of refraction of the ordinary and extraordinary
rays in doubly refracting crystals could be measured at different inclinations to the axis
or axes of double refraction, the author stated that he would not have again called the
attention of the Section to the controversial part of the subject, had not Dr. Whewell,
in a late work, persisted in asserting that Mr. Airy had completely explained this
class of phenomena by the undulatory theory. The author gave a brief notice of
the three papers in which Mr. Airy had made this attempt, and showed by a com
parison of the theoretical with the experimental results, that the undulatory theory
had entirely failed in giving an explanation of these bands. The author also stated

that he had arrived at the true explanation of them without any theoretical assump

tions whatever.

    Sir David Brewster exhibited a map of the dark lines which he had discovered in

the red space of the solar spectrum, which he had rendered visible beyond the ex
tremity of the spectrum as given by Fraunhofer ; and he explained the construction
of the telescope and the nature of the methods by which he had observed and pro
jected these lines.

   The telescope by which these observations were made was executed by Mr. Dollond
at the expense of the Royul Society of London. The object-glass consisted of two
lenses of the same glass, according to the formula of Sir John Herschel for correcting

spherical aberration. The eye-glasses were similarly constructed. The aberration
of colour was not corrected because the light of the object was perfectly homogeneous.

The conclusion which the author deduced from his observations was, that the

   In drawing this conclusion the author assumed it as a fact that anatomists were

Meteorological Observations, by J. R. Crowe, Esq., Her Britannic Majesty's

These observations are a continuation of others which have been made by this dili

meetings at York, Cambridge and Southampton. They consist of observations of the
barometer, made on every day of the year, at the hours of 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m.
and 10 p.m. Observations of the thermometer made on the same day and at the same

the direction of the winds at the same hours of each day for every month in the year.

    The meteorological tables for 1846, from Alten, are not yet arrived in England;
they will be forwarded in the course of the summer by Mr. S. H. Thomas of Alten,
according to whose statement the mean height of the barometer increases from the
equator to 30° 13', where the maximum is found. From this point it decreased to
68° 24', where the minimum occurs, and afterwards it increases towards the poles ;

and he informs me that this result agrees very nearly with the mean corrected ob

J.On behalf of the Alten Literary and Scientific Society, I have the honour to sub
scribe myself, Sir, your most obedient servant, (Signed)                        H. Grewe, Alten, West

Finmark, 21st March, 1846.

   Remarks on the above papers on the advantages to be derived from the establish
ment of a permanent or even of a temporary magnetic and electro-meteorological
observatory at Alten in Lapland.

   Alten is the most northern town on the globe ; its latitude being N. 69° 50' 0"+
and its longitude 23°+ East, that of Christiania being 59° 54' 1" and longitude
10° 45' East. During the French Revolution the present king of the French made
a tour in Norway and visited Alten ; and since his accession to the throne of France

some French officers have been sent to make scientific observations in the north of

Sweden and Lappmark, and they visited Alten and left there some meteorological
and magnetic instruments, which since their departure have been presented to the
Literary and Scientific Society at Alten.

    Some Norwegian and Swedish officers are now employed under the patronage of
the king of Sweden and Norway, and under the direction of Baron Wrede and Pro
fessor Zelander of Stockholm, the Astronomer Royal of Sweden, and Mr. Skogman,
an officer of the navy, in continuing some observations by triangular admeasurements
from Enontekis and Kautokeino towards Alten and Hammerfest and the North Cape,
in order to ascertain with greater accuracy the latitudes of these and other places,
and of the North Cape, and these observations will probably be completed in the
year 1848 or 1849.

    Owing to the position of Alten and of Hammerfest, which is the sea- port of Alten,
and their great degree of northern latitude, it would be highly desirable that a per
manent or even a temporary magnetic and electro-meteorological observatory should
be established there for three or more years, and it is therefore suggested that the
present summer would be a most desirable time for such an object, whilst the Nor
wegian government is proceeding with its operations, and whilst there will, be some
intelligent young men in the service of the Alten Copper Mining Company, who are
capable and willing, during their leisure hours, to assist in the observations; and if
the British Association should not feel itself in a position to establish such an obser
vatory, with the aid and advice which could be derived from the Committee of the
Alten Mining Company resident in London, it is to be hoped that the Norwegian
government, or the Swedish Royal Society of Stockholm, might be induced to do so,

if the object should be recommended by the British Association.

    The important remarks on the nature and origin of the Aurora Borealis by the
Rev. Mr. Fisher, which arc published in the volume of the Society's Transactions
for 1845 (see p. 23, Transactions of Sections), might furnish abundant matter for
attention and re-examination, in addition to other objects of research, in an obser

Itvatory at Alten, especially such as observations on refraction at so high a latitude.

     appears that several members of this Association are favourable to this recom
                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                            35

mendation, some of whom are acquainted with the locality of Hammerfest and Alten ;
and Mr. Ronalds, of the Observatory at Kew, informs me that there is at Kew a small
apparatus for electrical observations, which in his opinion might be advantageously
employed at Alten for this purpose, and not at present in use ; and he has with a
true zeal for science volunteered to supply such parts of the apparatus as may be
deficient and which might be required.

   It might be the more desirable to carry this object into effect during the present
year at Alten, as electro-meteorological observations might be carried on simultane
ously with those which are about to be made at Bombay under the superintendence
of Professor Orlebar, the apparatus for which place is nearly completed.
   At Alten there is a transit instrument by Mr. Dollond, and a sidereal clock by

Mr. Dent of London, and these instruments will probably be used by the Swedish
officers, who are expected at Alten to measure the arc of the meridian, in verifying

Iftheir work by astronomical observations.

        the British Association should think proper to recommend this undertaking to
the Royal Society of Stockholm, some Swedish or Norwegian officers would probably
be appointed to carry it into effect, and the offer of some instruments from this

Association might be acceptable, and would be received with due acknowledgement.
Professor Langberg and Mr. Esmark of Christiania, and Mr. Augustus Georgii
and Count Rosen, and Mr. Nilsson of Stockholm, will favour the meeting with their
presence ; and the recommendation of this Society might be conveyed to the Swedish
authorities by these gentlemen, being men of science, on their return to their country.
   Also the advantages to be derived from simultaneous observations at Kew under
the care of Mr. Ronalds, and at Bombay under Mr. Orlebar, and at Alten, relative to
auroras and magnetism and electricity, would be at this time of the greater import
ance, as it is to be hoped that observations on these branches of science are now

being made on the northern coast of America by the expedition under the command
of Captain Sir John Franklin, R.N.

   The establishment of an observatory at Alten would assist to illustrate some re
marks made by Mr. Airy in his paper on the Auroras in 1845 ; and Mr. Birt, in his
recent paper on Atmospheric Waves, has named Alten as one of the places where
observations should be made.

    Several philosophers had found that the red, orange and yellow rays were endowed
with an antagonistic action, preventing and destroying that produced by white light,
or by the rays properly called photogenic rays.

   It appears that the first who discovered this property was Dr. Draper, who made
J.experiments with the pure rays of the spectrum upon the Daguerreotype plate ; but

even previously Sir Hcrschel had made similar discoveries with the pure rays of

the spectrum upon several photogenic papers.
   Dr. Draper found also that the red, orange and yellow rays which protect the

plate from ordinary photogenic action were themselves capable, when isolated, of
producing a peculiar photogenic effect.

   Contrary to the fact of an antagonistic or destroying action exercised by the red,
orange and yellow rays, M. Ed. Becquerel announced that these rays were endowed
with the property of continuing the action commenced by the photogenic rays.

   M. Claudet has made a series of observations upon light transmitted through cer
tain colouring media, through the vapours of the atmosphere, and through red,

orange and yellow glasses.                                                     d2

     Having directed a camera obscura upon the sun, when its disc appeared quite red,
 he obtained after ten seconds a black image of the sun. The red sun had produced
 no photogenic effect, although the surrounding spaces had been sufficiently affected

 by the photogenic rays proceeding from the zenith to attract the white vapours of
 mercury. This proved that the red rays had no photogenic power.

     In another experiment he left the plate in the camera for twenty minutes. The
 sun had passed over a long space of the plate, and there resulted a long image of the
 sun quite black throughout, so that not only the red sun had produced no photoge
 nic action, but the red rays had destroyed the effect produced previous to the sun's

 passage.

     He then operated in a different manner, not content with the slow motion of the
 sun ; he moved the camera obscura from right to left and vice vend, lowering it each
 time by means of a screw.

     In this manner the sun had passed rapidly over five or six zones of the plate. Its
 passage was marked by long black bands, whilst the intervening spaces were white ;
 showing again that it was sufficient in order to destroy the action of the photogenic

 rays to let red rays pass rapidly over the spaces previously affected by the photo

  genic rays.
     He operated afterwards with coloured glasses. After having taken upon a Daguer

 reotype plate the impression of a black lace by white light, he covered one half of
 the plate and exposed the other half to the radiation of a red glass. The mercury
 developed an image of the lace on the part which had been acted on only by the
 white light, and the other which had afterwards received the action of the red rays
 remained black. The red glass had destroyed the photogenic effect, as had taken
 place with the red light of the sun.

     He made the same experiments with orange and yellow glasses, and obtained ana
 logous results, but in different periods of time.

     These experiments proved that the red, orange and yellow rays destroy the effect
 of photogenic light, whether these rays be produced by the dispersion of the prism,
 or by the action of coloured media ; but M. Claudet believes that he was the first to
 observe, that after the destruction of the photogenic effect the plate is perfectly re
 stored to its former sensitiveness to white light.

     After exposing a plate to the daylight, and then submitting it to the destructive
 action of red, orange or yellow rays, it will be found again sensitive to the same
 white light.

    It appears from M. Claudet's observations that a plate may be exposed to the two
 actions alternately for any number of times without altering the final property of
 the surface, which will be invariably sensitive to the vapours of mercury if it has
 been lastly exposed to the action of white light, and that it will be deprived of that
 sensitiveness if it has been lastly exposed to the restoring action of the red, orange

 or yellow rays.

    It results from the restoring action of the red, orange and yellow rays, that Da

 guerreotype plates may be prepared in open light, and that to give them sensitive
 ness it is only necessary to place them for some minutes under red glass, before
putting them in the camera obscura. This will be advantageous to persons wishing
to take views in places where it is difficult to find dark rooms to prepare the plates.

    Besides the destructive action of the red, orange and yellow glasses, these same
radiations are endowed with a photogenic action of their own, that is to say, they
have, like the blue violet rays, the power of causing the fixation of mercurial vapours.
Therefore these radiations are endowed with two contrary actions, one destructive
of the effect of the photogenic light, and the other analogous to the effect of that light.

    The photogenic effect of the red rays is 5000 times longer than the white light,
that of the orange is 500 times longer, and that of the yellow 100 times.

    The destructive action of the red rays is 100 times longer than that of the white
light, the orange is 50 times, and the yellow only 10 times.

    When a plate has been exposed to the destructive action of any particular ray, it
cannot be affected photogenically by the radiation which has destroyed the first
effect ; it is only sensitive to the other radiations.

   The photogenic or the destructive action of any radiation cannot be continued by
another.

    The solar spectrum is therefore eodowed with three different photogenic actions,

and three different destroying actions corresponding to the red, yellow and bine rays.
    The three photogenic actions of the spectrum thus divided have distinct charac

ters ; each radiation is endowed with a photogenic power peculiar to itself, and which

gives to the Daguerreotype plate an affinity for mercurial vapours ; nevertheless these

three actions are so different that we cannot by mixing them artificially make them

assist each other, as they are antagonistic. The effect produced by the blue rays is

destroyed by the red and yellow, the effect of the red is destroyed by the yellow, and
that of the yellow by the red, and the effect of the two latter is destroyed by the

blue.

    The alternate change of the surface of the plate by these three radiations seems to

prove that the chemical compound remains always the same under these different
influences, and that there is no separation or disengagement of the constituted ele
ments ; and the destruction by one ray of the effect produced by another, restoring
the plate to its former sensitiveness, likewise favours this conclusion.
    Electricity, which probably accompanies each radiation, acts positively under the
influence of one, and negatively under the other, without changing the chemical
compound. In one case this influence would give an affinity for mercury, and in the

other it would destroy it.                                        |

              On a proposed Optical Experiment. By Mr. Dale.

   At the last meeting of the Association Mr. Dale proposed an experimental method
of determining a point in physical optics on which some mathematicians have enter
tained a different view from that of Fresnel, Airy and Cauchy ; whether, namely, in

a plane polarized ray the vibration is parallel to the plane of polarization instead of
                 it ;

apparently dependent on the temperature of the earth. Prof. C. P. Smyth has pur
sued such observations in detail at the observatory on the Calton Hill, Edinburgh,

subjacent soil made under the direction of Prof. Forbes by thermometers sunk in

the ground. The movements both in the level of the transit and also in azimuth, are

   On these data we may observe, in the first two cases the refraction of white light
or a mean ray would thus correspond to that of a ray in the green space near the
border of the blue ; a part of the spectrum which can hardly be regarded in any
sense as the mean and far from the most illuminating part.

   In the two latter cases, and more especially in the last, the deviation is yet more
striking ; the mean ray corresponding to the full red in one case, and even to the
lowest part of the red in the other; while in either case the numerical mean of the
extreme indices agrees closely with the observed index for F, at the junction of the

green and blue spaces.
   These apparent anomalies are probably connected with those yet unknown pecu

liarities in the nature of dispersion which occasion the primary paradox, that prisms
of different media give perfectly pure rays of the same colour in widely different
proportions, and yet when these spectra are recompounded, in all cases the same
white light is reproduced ; a paradox, which, though now fully evinced by observa
tion, was doubtless the real ground of Newton's so positive denial of the fact of

unproportional dispersion.

On the Electric Currents by which the Phenomena of Terrestrial Magnetism
                   may he produced. By Professor Thomson.

   It is a well-known theorem, first demonstrated by Green, that the action of a mass
of any nature, in attracting an external point, may be represented by means of a
distribution of matter of the same kind over the surface of the body ; that is to say,

that a certain distribution of matter over the surface of a body may be determined,
which will produce exactly the same force, whether of gravitation, of magnetism, or
of electricity, as results from the body itself. Thus, by applying this theorem to the
case in which the force considered is that of terrestrial magnetism, we see that a
certain distribution of imaginary magnetic matter may be found, which would pro
duce all the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism observed at the surface of the earth
         if        except those which are due to atmospheric or external sources of mag
or above    it,

netism, any such exist. This proposition, although of great theoretical interest,
cannot be entertained as expressing a physical fact for there are only two ways in
which we can conceive internal sources of terrestrial magnetism to exist. We mayit

wholly or in part the magnetic phenomena,
    becomes an interesting question, whether mere electric currents could produce the
it

actual phenomena observed. Ampere's electro-magnetic theory leads us to an
affirmative answer, but an answer which must be regarded as merely theoretical
                                                                                             ;

the molecules of matter as having a physical existence. The idea of an electro-magnet

ternal distribution of closed galvanic currents, occupying a certain limited space be
low the surface ? The answer is, that whatever be the form and magnetic contents
of the earth, the same force as that which it exerts upon any exterior point, may
actually be produced by means of a distribution of closed electric currents on the
surface. I have arrived at this result with the aid of Ampere's theory of the closed
circuit, by means of the theorem of Green already mentioned, and by an analogous
theorem of which a physical demonstration may be given by considerations connected
with fluid motion. The steps                                               of

III. Construct on the surface a " map of the values of U."
  If wires be laid along the lines round the surface corresponding to sufficiently
close equidifferent values of U, as indicated by this map, and if currents of equal
intensity be made to circulate through them (each being a closed curve), the elec
tro-magnetic force that will result, upon external points, will be the same as the force
of terrestrial magnetism.
The explicit solution of this problem is very easy, when the body considered is a
sphere ; as is actually the case, to a sufficient degree of approximation, with refer

ence to the earth.

   Thus, if the potential at the surface be given by the equation

                                 V=Y,-|-Ys+Y,-r-&c.,

where Y,, Y2, &c. may be calculated, for any latitude, by means of the Gaussian

constants, we readily find

                              U = l{2V+(YI+|Ys+lY8+&c.)}
Hence we have the means of constructing an electro-magnetic model of the earth,
which would exhibit all the peculiarities that can be expressed in a map constructed

upon Gauss's theory.

   The principal object of Mr. Brooke's communication wa3 to explain the varieties
of disturbances which have been recorded in his photographs, obtained by means of
the apparatus of which a description has been lately published in the Philosophical
Transactions. Of these disturbances four principal varieties were described. In the
first, which has been of most frequent occurrence, the disturbing cause gradually
arrives at a maximum value, and again gradually diminishes, thus producing a more
or less deeply-indented undulation in the line ; the period of duration of these is
from a few minutes to several hours. In the second, which is comparatively rare,
the disturbing cause comes into full operation instantaneously, and after remaining
uniform for periods varying from a few seconds to half an hour, abruptly ceases,
leaving the magnet free to return to its former position. The angular value of these
last disturbances has rarely exceeded 10', and by them the declination is invariably
increased. In the third kind, the magnet is suddenly thrown into vibration about
its mean place, and is gradually brought to rest by the damper in periods varying
from 1TM to 20m. Several of the photographs, it was observed, demonstrated the fact
that a much shorter period was occupied in bringing the magnet to rest with the
mercury damper described in the paper alluded to, than with the oil damper used
in the earlier experiments. In the fourth variety of disturbances, the magnet com
mences vibrating about its mean place, by gradually increasing oscillations, which,
after reaching a maximum, gradually subside. The greatest amplitude of oscillation
rarely exceeds 4' or 5', and the duration from about 3TM to 15TM. Mr. Brooke stated
that a London thoroughfare having been the locality of all the observations, he did
not consider the reality of the two last varieties of disturbance free from doubt ; the
point however could not be settled until sufficient evidence has been obtained in
situations least liable to purely local disturbance. He also remarked, that although
the comparison of many hundreds of observations showed an exact accordance
between the movements of the magnet at the Royal Observatory, and the registered
magnet, yet in some few instances the difference in the amount of disturbing force in
the two localities was not less remarkable.

    The inefficiency of any periodic method of registration was proved by a reference
to some of the registers, in which, at different periods of the same day, the variations
of the magnet are shown by the continuous line to be essentially different in their
character ; although the outline formed by joining the consecutive points at intervals
of lOTM would not indicate any sensible difference.

    Mr. Brooke concluded by explaining a simple method of subdividing the whole
length of the line representing twelve hours (which, from the unequal contraction of
different registers in drying, varies sometimes as much as 0-2 in. in length) in twelve
or more equal parts. This consisted of dividing the scale on a strip of vulcanized
caoutchouc, which being attached to two pieces of wood sliding on a bar and fixed
by a screw, might be stretched to the exact length required, without sensibly affect
ing the equality of the subdivisions.

On Anemometers and Resolvifig Scales. By Capt. Cockburn, R.N.

The author calls attention to the advantage of a correct registration of the winds
at sea, and selecting for this purpose the construction of Dr. Robinson (Association
               1846), has endeavoured to make it applicable  to use in the navy. In par
Report    for  has, with the assistance of Professor Smyth,  arranged a ' resolving scale,'

        On the   Cause  of the   Aurora, and the Declination            of the     Needle.
                                  By G. A. Rowell.

    On the admission that electricity is raised by evaporation, carried northward in
the high regions of the air, and then brought down by condensation, Mr. Rowell
infers the existence of compensating under-currents of electricity returning from the
circumpolar (positive) parts of the earth's surface to the tropical (negative parts).
To these currents he ascribes the direction of the magnetic needle ; and to the inter
ruption of these currents, by the dry and non-conducting state of the air in the

frigid regions during some parts (whereby the electricity is accumulated in the clouds
till it flashes back through the higher and rarer air toward the more temperate re
gions), he refers the exhibition of aurora, and the coincident disturbances of the needle.

   On the same basis he endeavours to explain the production and locality of the

magnetic poles, which he supposes not to be subject to periodical displacement, but
to be variable in intensity and relative influence, according to physical conditions,
such as the openness of seas, geological changes, &c.

On the  Cause    of Evaporation,           Rain,  Hailstones, and  the      Winds  of temperate
                                             By
                                 regions.         G. A. Rowell.

   For the explanation of rain and cognate phenomena, the author submitted the

following hypothesis. Electricity having no weight, and diffusing itself equally on
the surface of bodies, the minute particles of water, even In their most condensed
state, being completely enveloped in the natural coating of electricity, occupy together
with this envelope nearly the space of an equal weight of air, and are thus ren

dered buoyant ; when by heat their specific gravity is lessened, and their capacity
for electricity enlarged by the augmentation of surface, they are uplifted in the air ;
and when the particle becomes condensed, the electricity, being in excess, escapes
to the earth, and dew is deposited ; or the particles, being above the earth's electrical
attraction, attract each other and form clouds and rain. To the fall of rain, and the

partial vacuum thus occasioned, the author ascribes many (especially the more irre
gular) winds, and with this view refers to cases of extraordinary depths of rain
falling in very short times.

           On a Chart of the Dew-Point. By Capt Shortrede.

   The number of papers already before the Section being so great as to preclude a
separate communication, the President, at the conclusion of Dr. Lee's paper, exhi
bited, as on a kindred subject, a chart by Captain Shortrede, showing the relations
which he has traced between the temperatures of the dry and moist bulb thermome
ters and the dew-point. The chart consists of horizontal lines, curves, and lines drawn
diagonally. The temperature of the air is counted on the horizontal lines, and the de
pression of the moist bulb on the curves ; the intersection of these gives a point, which,
referred to the diagonals, gives the temperature of the dew-point. For barometric
pressures different from thirty inches, a correction is required, which is made on the
temperature of the air, and consequently also on the depression, for which there is a
simple rule. Then, with the temperature and depression so corrected, the chart gives
by inspection the temperature of the dew-point. The chart is protracted from tabu
lated quantities deduced from a strict analysis, after the method of Apjohn, using for
the elasticity of vapour the tables deduced from the formula exhibited to the Section

last year at Southampton.  _

Barometrical Leadings in the Madras Presidency. By General Cullen,
                urith Observations by Lt.-Colonel Sykks, V.P.R.S.

   Colonel Sykes exhibited and explained two maps constructed by Major General W.
Cullen, of the Madras Artillery, comprising five sections of country, showing the re

lative levels, by barometrical observation, at distances varying from ten to twenty
miles ; one section, from Cape Comorin to Multai, at the source of the Tapti, a
distance of about 1170 miles, proceeding through Madua, Trichinopoly, Bangalore,
Hyderabad, and Nagpore to Multai ; another from the Caves at Ellora to Masu-
lipatam, through Jaulna, Beder, Golconda, Condapilly to Masulipatam, being a
road-distance of 545 miles. The second map contained three sections, one from
Nagpore to Jaulna, through Oomrawuttee, of 265 miles ; another from Goa to
Bellary, through Belgaum and Dharwar, 280 miles ; and a third, from Madras to
Mysore, through Seringapatam, Bangalore, Vellore and Arcot, road-distance 293

miles. A third map gave barometrical sections from Madras to Bellary, on a
line about W.N.W., 244 miles ; and from Bellary to Iddamaeul, on a line about
W. by S., 156 miles. This map, without pretending to be a complete geological

section, showed the prevailing rocks on the route. Associated with the sections
were notices of the climate and mortality at most of the principal stations, com
prising the maxima, minima and mean pressure of the barometer for some years ;
the maxima, minima and mean indications of the thermometer ; the falls of rain ;
the nature of the monsoons ; and the sickness and per-centage mortality of the
European and native troops. The whole of these laborious results indicated no
ordinary industry and judgement. Colonel Sykes's object in exhibiting the sections
was to call the attention of railway engineers to the use of the barometer as the pre
cursor of the theodolite, in determining the general levels of a country with a view
to the selection of lines. He suggested also that geologists might use the barometer
to fix the height above the sea, of the strata described. He stated that in the tropics
the moderate oscillations of the barometer admitted of levels being determined with
some accuracy, even when the instrument was used independently ; but that when
the instrument used had been previously compared with a standard barometer, and
contemporaneous observations were made, he could testify from his own experience
that a height so determined might not differ ten feet, when re-tested or re-observed
after a lapse of years.

laston's process for drawing to extreme tenuity a wire of gold or platinum enclosed
in a cylinder of silver.

On simplifying and improving our National Measures, Weights and Money.

             By Major-General Sir Charles W. Pasley, K.C-B.

    After adverting to the proceedings and reports of parliamentary committees, royal
commissioners, &c, on weights and measures, from the year 1758 to the present
time, and to a book published by him in 1834, of which he offered to present a copy
to any member of the Association who might take an interest in the subject, he
submitted the following abstract of his present plan, which, as he observed, differs
only from that suggested in his publication, in regard to the standards of weight

and of apothecary's liquid measure.

                            1st. New Lineal Measure proposed.

                  10 tenths                                               1 digit.

    The new standard of lineal measure to be the fathom of 6 feet, marked on a rod
of brass or other metal, and made equal to 6 feet 0-91548 inch of our present mea
sure, at the temperature of 17° of the centigrade thermometer, or 620-6 of Fahr
enheit's scale. This proportion will make the proposed mile equal to 1012"716

surveys of meridional arcs now in progress, under the direction of, or in concert with
Professor Struve, lead to a more accurate value of the said minute, it is proposed
that the necessary correction shall be effected, not by changing the standard rod,
but by altering the legal temperature to a higher or lower point than 620-6 of Fahr

enheit. All measures of surface, solidity and capacity to be derived from this
standard.

                      2ndly. New Land Measure proposed.

                    100 square links                                      1 square fathom.
                  1000 square fathoms
                                                                          1 imperial acre.
                  1000 imperial acres                                     1 square mile.

                      3rdly. New Square Measure proposed.

                  100 square digits                                       1 square foot.

   Materials or workmanship now priced by the square yard or by the rod of 272J
superficial feet (omitting the fraction), to be priced either by the superficial foot or
by the 10 superficial feet.

           ·Hhly. New Measures of Solidity and of Capacity proposed.

                  1000 cubit digits                                       1 cubic foot.
                     10 cubic feet                                        1 quarter of corn.

                            For retail purposes exclusively.

                  2 gills, or 10 cubic digits                                       1 chopin.

                  2 chopins                                                         1 pint.
                                                                                    1 quart.
                  2 pints
                  2\ quarts, or 100 cubic digits                                    1 can.

             10 cans                                                                1 cubic foot.
44 REPORT -- 1847.

   Thus the cubic foot will be divided into 10 cans, 25 quarts, 50 pints, 100 chopins
and 200 gills. The new names Can and Chopin are recommended to designate the
tenth and the hundredth parts of the cubic foot respectively, being its most im
portant subdivisions.

   In measuring corn for wholesale dealings, as well as sand, lime, &c, he proposes
to use measures of 1 cubic foot, and of 5 cubic feet, two of the latter, open at top and

bottom, to be put together on a level floor or platform, and form a 10 cubic feet
measure. Deer, wine and other liquors to be priced and gauged, and the duties col
lected by the cubic foot.

        5thly. New Apothecary's Liquid Measure proposed.

        60 minims                                                          1 tenth of a cubic digit.

        600 minims, or 10 tenths                                           1 cubic digit.

        10 cubic digits                                                    1 half-pint or chopin.

                               6thly. New Measures of Weight proposed.

        100 grains                                                         1 cent.

        100 cents, or 10,000 grains                                        1 pound.

The standard one-pound- weight to be exactly l-60th part of the weight of the

new cubic foot of distilled water, as ascertained by brass weights at the temperature
of 17° of the centigrade thermometer, or 62°-6 of Fahrenheit, with the barometer
standing at 24J digits of the new lineal measure, or 29'7738 inches of our present
measure. By this arrangement 100 lbs. of the new will be equal to about 108 lbs.
of the present avoirdupois weight ; the new grain will weigh about Jths of the pre
sent Troy grain, and the new minim of distilled water will be equal to the new grain
in weight, whilst in measure it will be about four-fifths of the present apothecary's
minim.

The grain to be subdivided decimally into tenths and hundredths for very delicate

purposes, and its decimal multiples the 10 grains, the 100 grains, the 1000 grains,
and the pound, to be used exclusively for weighing and pricing all valuable articles
to which Troy weight is now applied, and to the entire exclusion also of pearl weight,

diamond weight and all the carat weights.
   All goods now sold by avoirdupois weight to be priced in future by the pound,
with its hundredth part the cent, and its decimal multiples the 10 lbs., the 100 lbs.,
and the 1000 lbs., to the exclusion of ounces, stones, hundred weights and tons of

our present avoirdupois weight.
The only weights absolutely necessary for weighing groceries and other goods by
                               system will        weights of 1             cents, 5 cents,             20 cents,

without specifying the contents or amount of each, in cubic feet or pounds weight,

as may be.

  If the foregoing suggestions, or any system on the same principle for simplifying
our national measures and weights, should be adopted, the fine idea generally sup
posed to have been intended in Magna Charta, and most clearly and unequivocally
expressed in one of our ancient laws of subsequent date, but which has never yet

been realized in this country, will be literally accomplished, namely, that there

    He suggests that the centigrade thermometer, first proposed by Celsius and gene
rally adopted in France and other countries, having its zero at the freezing point,
the only invariable point of temperature in nature, and its 100th degree determined
by the temperature of boiling water when the barometer stands at 24j digits of the
new lineal measure proposed, shall be adopted in preference to Fahrenheit's scale.

The barometer to be marked in digits and tenths of the new measure,  instead of

                        8thly. New Monetary System proposed.

                    10 tenth parts      I cent.

100 cents                               1 pound sterling.

   In order to establish this system he proposes the following coins only to be used :--
1 tenth of a cent, 2 tenths of a cent, 4 tenths of a cent, in copper ; 1 cent, 2 cents,

3 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, in silver.
   The three new copper coins should be marked cent, -fa cent and T% cent, and
may be of the same size nearly as our present farthing, halfpenny and penny pieces,
from which they will only differ in legal value by one twenty-fifth part in defect, in
consequence of the pound sterling being divided into 1000 tenth parts of a cent
instead of 960 farthings. The new silver coins proposed w.ill be equal to two pence
four-tenths, to four pence eight-tenths, to seven pence two-tenths, to one shilling,
and to two shillings, of our present money, respectively, and must have their value in
cents marked on each, which will soon impress the new monetary nomenclature on
the minds of the people and obliterate the memory of shillings, pence and farthings,
except in referring back to the old coinage for the sake of comparison. He does not
recommend any silver coin of greater value than the 10 cent piece, because nothing

is saved in weight  by  such coins  itasdioffuicrupltretsoenotbhtaailnf-ccrhoawnnge.andIfcraowcnoinpieocfetsh, ewvhailcuhe
only give trouble   by  rendering
of 25 cents, equal to our present crown piece, were considered necessary, he would
prefer having one of gold, which would save weight.
   He observes that the multiplicity of names has been one great source of confusion
in our national system of measures, weights and money, and therefore he does not

think it expedient that the 10 cent silver coin proposed should be designated by any
peculiar name, such as a Royal, because he considers it best in accounts of every
description, to state them in decimal parts of the pound, so that 76 pounds 18 cents
and 4 tenths of a cent would be stated as £76-184, in preference to writing it as
76£ 18'iCts., which might also be done.

  9thly. Advantages of the New System of Measures, Weights and Money proposed.

    In the first place, the mile proposed being the nautical or geographical mile used
exclusively for the purposes of navigation by all the maritime nations of the world,
not excepting the French, and inserted in the scales not only of charts, but also of
the maps of all countries, in addition to scales of the customary leagues, miles, or
other itinerary measures of those countries, is already a universal measure, and the
only one now recognized in every part of the globe. Hence, if the governments of
all civilized nations should hereafter appoint competent commissioners to assemble
and report upon the best universal standards of measure and of weight to be adopted
 by common consent of all, the fathom or toise, and the foot derived from the pro
posed mile, might justly claim the preference, because the latter differs so little from
the former foot of France and from the present foot of all other countries, that it
would not cause any embarrassment to practical men, nor any more confusion than
the substitution of the imperial gallon for the former ale and beer gallon has done
in this country, that is little or none. The same remark applies to the standard
pound weight, derived from the proposed cubic foot, which in like manner differs so
little from the former French pound weight, and from the present pound weights of
other countries, that no embarrassment or confusion could be created by adopting it.

    By the new system proposed a simplicity and precision will be given to measures
of distance and area on the surface of the globe, of which our present standards
afford no criterion. For example, nobody knows or can even guess how many rods
or yards there are in a given number of statute miles, nor how many acres or square
rods there are in a given number of square miles of our present measure, which can
only be ascertained by very troublesome calculations; but 173 miles of the new
measure would be known at once to be 173,000 fathoms, and 248 square miles to
be equal to 248 thousand imperial acres, or to 248 million square fathoms.

   In like manner, though no one can even guess how many cubic feet a given num
ber of gallons of our present standard measure of capacity arc equal to, or vice versa ;
46 REPORT 1847.

this embarrassing uncertainty and the necessity of very troublesome calculations in
order to compare those two denominations together, will be avoided, by establishing
the cubic foot as the only standard both of solidity and of capacity.

   In all buildings and other works of Architecture, Engineering.&c, which are always
measured by the foot, the necessity of computing artificers' and labourers' work, as
well as materials, duodecimally, and in goods sold by weight, the troublesome re
duction of tons into cwts., quarters and pounds, and vict versd; and in all accounts
the reduction of pounds sterling into shillings, pence and farthings, and pice verid,
will also be avoided, which will be an immense saving of time, trouble and risk of
error.

    Sir Charles Pasley further observes, that after a very careful investigation of the
history of our national weights and measures from the time of Alfred to the present
day, he has ascertained that with the exception of our lineal measure, none of our
present standards are venerable from their antiquity, as might naturally be supposed
by those who have not had the means of such investigation, they having on the con
trary been subject to much greater changes than any which he now proposes, and
all those changes having originated from accident, error, bad workmanship or neglect,
with the exception of the establishment of the imperial gallon in 1824, which, strange
to say, but no less true, was the first and only modification of our existing standards,
adopted systematically, as an improvement and with a view to the public benefit, in
the course of 800 years. Such as they were, however, even the legal standards were
disregarded in every part of the kingdom, where such an immense number of incon
gruous and discordant local measures and weights prevailed, differing in such an
extraordinary manner from those standards and from each other, not only in every
county, but in every market, as rendered them a perfect chaos, and quite as unin
telligible to the public generally, a3 those of the ancient Egyptians or Babylonians
would be.

The Rev. G. L. Cooke presented two volumes from the East India Company, con
taining the Measurement of an Arc of the Meridian and Trigonometrical Survey in
India, by Col. Everest.
The President presented to the Association, through the Section, four volumes
from Prof. Strove, 'Researches on Galvanism and on Electro-magnetism,' by M.
Jacobi ; ' Etudes   d'Astronomie Italienne,'   p'aCr hMro.noSmtroevteric;     ' Positions of the Fixed
Stars,' by Bessel,  edited by M. Strove ; and                                 Voyages between Altona
and Greenwich, for the purpose of determining the geographical longitude of the
Central Observatory of Russia,' by MM. F. G. W. Struve and O. W. Strove.
Prof. Struve begged to say a few words. He had received the commands of the
Emperor Nicholas to present three of these volumes. He dwelt on the importance
of accurately connecting the observatories of Russia and of Greenwich, without which,
both the vast geographical surveys going on in that empire, and stellar astronomy
must be imperfect. All were agreed on the importance of having a principal point
from which to count longitudes ; and friends had urged him, as a matter of national
pride, to adopt a principal point for Russia, independently of any other country ;
but he replied that there was no place here for national pride. Under these circum
stances it became necessary to fix the geographical position of Poulkova, with respect
either to Paris or Greenwich ; and, for many reasons, he fixed on Greenwich. Since
previous operations, in 1813 and 1814, had determined the difference of longitude of
Alten and Poulkova to be 1° 21'32"-523, with a probable error of only0"-03, it was

determined to connect them and Greenwich by transporting chronometers by the

steam-boats which ply twice each week between Hamburgh and London; and Mr.

Airy and M. Lebrumacher, when applied to, most cordially gave their assistance.
Twenty chronometers were selected. In these observations it was necessary to allow
for the influence of changes of temperature ; and to attempt to do so by thermome-
tric observations would have required a process of integration troublesome and in

exact. This was remedied by a simple contrivance. The compensation for tem-

perature was taken off from one of the chronometers, and it was placed in the centre
of the box which contained the twenty others. The difference of its indications from
the others give, by an easy reduction, the mean change of temperature in the inter
val. After two months' work with the chronometers, the difference between the
longitudes of Greenwich andAlten was determined to be 0°39'46"-151, with a pro
bable error of 0"-012 ; and thus the total difference between Poulkova and Green
wich was 2° 1' 18"-674, with a probable error of only 0"-057, care having been taken
to determine the personal errors of the observers, and every other circumstance
which could influence the result.

On the Regulation of Combustion. By N. Arnott, M.D., F.R.S.

The author, after noticing the many applications of heat which require regulation,
and the advantage of giving this regulation by mechanical self-acting arrangements,

describes the latest of these arrangements which he has completed, viz. the balanced

valve, which is more easily made and managed than the thermometric regulator.
This valve acts not by changes of the stove temperature, like the thermometer
valve, but by the impulse or force of the entering current of air, and under all fluctua
tions of the chimney-draught it admits only the same uniform stream of air, and which
is great or small, according to the adjustment made for the time. So perfect is the
uniformity of combustion thus effected, that the quantity of coal to be consumed is
determined to within one pound in twenty-four hours, without further watching or

attention, after the stove is charged and the valve is adjusted as desired.
   The balanced valve regulator consists essentially of a small weighbeam and scales

so placed that one scale becomes a flap air-door to the stove. A B C D in the dia
gram marks the beam and scales distinguished by dotted lines. On one of the scales,
A, the regulating weight is placed, while on the other, I), the impulse or momentum
of the entering air (indicated here by small arrows) acts as a counterweight. This
air enters by the opening E and F in the external case or shell O PQ R of the valve,
before reaching openings in the internal tube G H I K L M, which leads directly to the
ash-pit and fire beyond S. As the entering air obeying an ordinary chimney -draught
through the fully open valve exerts more force on the scale D than is sufficient to
overbalance the weight placed in the scale A, it depresses the scale D, but in doing
so, it at the same rate is obstructing the aperture G H, by which the air has to pass
to the inner tube and fire, for the scale D then becomes a closing flap or door to the
opening of the internal tube ; and the stream of air that can enter at the external
open door E F above is lessened by the closing of this inner door beneath, until

only as much gets in as by its impulse just balances the weight in the scale A.
From this condition, things cannot change so long as the chimney-draught continues ;
and the free space for the passing air will become less when the draught is strong

and larger when the draught is weak ; but the impulse and the quantity of air wilt

remain the same so long as the regulating weight is the same.
   It is                               however, that           total force of the chimney-draught
          further  to  be observed,  two parts, -- 1st,  the    impulse of the moving descending
on the    scale D  is  made up of                         the

air, as above described, which varies exactly as the quantity of the current varies ;
and, 2ndly, of the steady, tranquil suction, as it is called, of the partial chimney
vacuum, which in a heated chimney is always acting whether air be entering or not,
and indeed is strongest when the valve completely closes for a time. This second
portion would often by suction bring a single plate D close to the aperture G H, and
keep it there, shutting the passage altogether if means were not found to prevent

still the popular phrase) that, instead of one internal door D, two are used, D and N,
and are so placed that this action on the one is in a direction exactly the contrary of
that on the other, and therefore each destroys or neutralizes the effect of the other

On some Phenomena of Photography. By Charles Brooke, M.B., F.R.S.

   In the application of photography to the purposes of registration, Mr. Brooke had
found that an impression made on paper prepared with the bromide of potassium
and nitrate of silver gradually passed away, so that at the end of ten or twelve hours
very little evidence of actinic action could be detected. In preparing highly sensi
tive papers Mr. Brooke had found that the addition of a very small quantity of iodide
of potassium to the solution of bromide of potassium very materially improved the
sensibility of the preparation.

   Numerous specimens of Daguerreotype and other photographic copies of very de
licate microscopic objects were exhibited. These were peculiarly beautiful, and were
obtained by the use of the solar microscope, the object being thrown upon the paper
or plate instead of upon the ordinary screen. The minute fidelity of these copies
was far beyond any thing which could be obtained by the artist ; and the ease with
which they were produced, particularly on photographic paper, recommended this
application of the art to the attention of naturalists.

tables suspended in the room. The first of these was intended to show the commercial

rically the relation between the proportion of nitrogenized and non-nitrogenized prin

by the data afforded in the preceding table, from which

the case of rice the former will be 70 and the latter 100, whilst the commercial value

of wheat may be stated at 75, and that of rice at 100.
   From similar calculations made with respect to Indian corn, did not appear that

its use was oeconomical on the ground of furnishing more nutritive or heat-producing

   Mr. Faraday exhibited at the Section certain specimens of diamond, being three

coke, opake, black and brittle. The specific gravity of the diamond before the

On a new and practical Voltaic Battery of the highest powers in which
          Potassium forms the positive element. By John Goodman.

   In pursuing researches into the identity of the various existences or forces of
light, heat, electricity, &c, the author devised several experiments with the inten
tion of constructing a voltaic arrangement in which potassium should form the posi
tive element, being at the same time a metal possessing powers of the highest

chemical as well as the most intensely electrical nature.

The result of many fruitless attempts was the production of an arrangement in

which a membrane was interposed between the potassium and the exciting fluid,
which produced a quiet and very manageable voltaic combination.
   A small glass tube was closed at its lower end by a membrane of turkey's craw.

The tube was filled with mineral naphtha, and its lower end was inserted in a strong
solution of sulphate of copper in a wine-glass. A small piece of potassium was
screwed upon the end of a piece of copper wire against a button of wood secured

near its extremity. The metal was then introduced so as to rest upon the mem
brane, upon which a globule of mercury had been previously placed for its amalga
mation.
   All accessary connexions were formed between the potassium and a platinum
plate already inserted in the cupreous solution immediately below the membrane.
The arrangement was also devised for raising the potassium from the membrane into
the supernatant fluid when required to be out of action.
   With this single voltaic pair a current of 50° was exhibited by a galvanometer,

and water was decomposed with the greatest facility.

  A gold-leaf electroscope was afterwards employed, and it was found that twelve

pairs deflected the gold leaf to a considerable degree.
Six pairs produced a very satisfactory deflection. Afterwards five pairs, four,
three and two pairs were tried, and a deflection took place measurable with facility
by a micrometer, and ultimately one pair alone produced the deflection of J^th of
II.an inch.
   It is thus more strongly than ever corroborated, as first adduced by Sir                    Davy,
that chemical affinity and electrical energy are one and the same thing, for the sub
stance which possesses the highest chemical affinity manifests also the most exalted
electrical energy or tension ; and the general results in this paper tend to show that
the electrical energy of substances is at all times proportional to the measure of their

    On the Coloured Glass employed in glazing the new Palm House in the
                   Royal Botanic Garden at Kew. By R. Hunt.

   It has been found that plants growing in stove-houses often suffer from the scorching

influence of the solar rays, and great expense is frequently incurred in fixing blinds to
prevent this destructive calorific influence. From the enormous size of the new Palm

House at Kew, it would be almost impracticable to adopt any system of shades which
should be effective, this building being 363 feet in length, 100 feet wide, and 63 feet

high. It was therefore thought desirable to ascertain if it would be possible to cut
off these scorching rays by the use of a tinted glass, which should not be objectionable
in its appearance, and the question was, at the recommendation of Sir W. Hooker and
Dr. Lindley, submitted by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests to Mr. Hunt.
itThe object was, to select a glass which should not permit these heat rays, which are
the most active in scorching the leaves of plants, to permeate                           By a series of ex
periments made with the colou>:d juices of the palms themselves, it was ascertained
that the rays which destroyed their colour belonged to a class situated at that end of

the prismatic spectrum which exhibited the utmost calorific power, and just beyond
the limits of the visible red ray. A great number of specimens of glass variously
manufactured were submitted to examination, and it was at length ascertained that

glass tinted green appeared likely to effect the object desired.
    Some of the green glasses which were examined obstructed nearly all the heat rays ;
but this was not desired ; and from their dark colour these were objectionable, as
stopping the passage of a considerable quantity of light, which was essential to the
healthful growth of the plant. Many specimens were manufactured purposely for the
experiments by Messrs. Chance of Birmingham, according to given directions, and it
is mainly due to the interest taken by these gentlemen that the desideratum has been
                                                                        distinct sets of experiment:

parency to luminous influence ; 2nd, to ascertain the amount of obstruction offered
to the passage of the chemical rays ; 3rd, to measure the amount of heat radiation

which permeated each specimen. The chemical changes were tried upon chloride of
silver, and on papers stained with the green colouring matter of the leaves of the

palms themselves.
    The calorific influence was ascertained by a method employed by Sir John Herschel
in his experiments on solar radiations. Tissue paper stretched on a frame was smoked
on one side by holding it over a smoky flame, and then, while the spectrum was
thrown upon     it,the other surface was washed with strong sulphuric sether. By the
                         by
evaporation of the aether, the points of calorific action were most easily obtained, as
these dried off in well-defined circles long before the other parts presented any ap
pearance of dryness. By these means                 was not difficult, with care, to ascertain

to this class of rays that the scorching influence is due, there is every reason to con
clude that the use of this glass will be effective in protecting the plants; and at the
same time as it is unobjectionable in point of colour, and transparent to that principle
which is necessary for the development of those parts of the plant which depend upon
external chemical excitation, it is only partially so to the heat rays ; and it is opake
to those only which are the most injurious.

   The glass is manufactured by Messrs. Chance of Birmingham, and the absence of
the oxide of manganese, commonly employed in all sheet glass, is insisted on, it
having been found that glass, into the composition of which manganese enters, will
after exposure for some time to intense sun-light, assume a pinky hue, and any tint
of this character would completely destroy the peculiar properties for which this glass

is chosen.
    Melloni, in his investigations on radiant heat, discovered that a peculiar green glass

manufactured in Italy obstructed nearly all the calorific rays; we may therefore con
clude that the glass chosen is of a similar character to that employed by the Italian
philosopher.

    The tint of colour is not very different from that of the old crown glass, and many
practical men state that they find their plants flourish much better under this kind of
glass than under the white sheet glass which is now so commonly employed. It is
satisfactory thus to find practice confirming the conclusions of science.

The experiments here described were made two years ago, and were intended as the
commencement of a series of researches on the influence of quantity in voltaic arrange
ments, both as regarded the generating and also the conducting portions of the circuit.
A single cell of a zinc and platina diaphragm battery charged on the negative side
with peroxide of manganese and hydrochloric acid has a more intense action and will
decompose more water in a given time than a similar battery charged with nitric
acid ; but two or more cells of the former, arranged in series, are far inferior to a
similar number of the                  paarristiecsu, laIrlbyeliief vlaer,gefroemlectwroadnets                    This infe

negative element : the chlorine is slowly liberated and much diluted by the liquid
hydrochloric acid, while the nitric acid supplies an indefinite quantity of what we may
term liquid oxygen. Thus the cathode is in the one case bathed by hydrochloric
acid, and in contact with n comparatively small portion of chlorine, while in the other
case it is covered to nearly its whole extent by oxygen ; in other words, the sectional
area of the efficient electrolyte is smaller in the first case than in the second. It is
admitted that in metallic conductors the facility of conduction is directly as the sec
tional nrea of the conducting substance; but the problem is rendered more complex

in electrolytes by the polarization or reaction occasioned by the liberated ions, and also
by the quantity of the efficient chemical ingredients contained in the electrolyte,
whether they act directly as ions or secondarily by absorbing or preventing the libe
ration of the cations at the cathode. Dr. Faraday, in.his ' Researches,' has shown
that separate pairs of electrodes, interposed in the same circuit, yield the same amount
of gas whatever be their size ; and this result has been misinterpreted by many, and
regarded as establishing the position that the size of electrodes with regard to that of
the battery plates makes no practical difference in the amount of gas liberated. From
the great practical experience which the application of voltaic electricity to the electro

tIypbeeliaenvde  its kindred   arts has promoted, this error has now for some years been removed.

surface, at the rate of 110 cubic inches per minute. The voltaineterusedin the following
experiments was one which M. Gassiot caused to be constructed upon a suggestion of
mine, and which consisted of five pairs of plates, each exposing to the other eight square
inches of surface. Any number of these plates could be thrown into action at a time, so
that excluding the outward sides of the exterior electrodes, the sectional area of the
electrolyte would be 8. . 8 + 8. . 16 + 8, and so on up to 72 square inches. The dimi
nution of the sectional area of the electrolyte in the battery occasioned by the porous
cells was ascertained by first charging a given battery with sulphate of copper without
any porous cell, ascertaining the amount of decomposition per minute, and then
                                                                                          soaked in the same

    A voltameter was constructed with two plates of 2 square inches each on each
side of a stout platina wire. The two plates made positive and the wire negative, or
vice vend, gave on a mean of several experiments, a very slight balance in favour of

the plates positive and wire negative, but the difference was so slight as to be probably
due to the more perfect cleaning of the plates by the nascent oxygen.

   From the whole of the above experiments it will appear that however different the
combination be, yet the amount of gas is greater the larger the electrodes, though
beyond a certain point the increase is indefinitely small ; secondly, that variation in
the relative sizes of the anode and cathode makes no difference in the result ; and,
thirdly, that provided the size of the electrodes be proportional to the battery, the
amount of gas is as the surface of the battery plates

On the Mecltanical  Equivalent  of  Heat, as determined                                   by the Heat evolved by

Manchester.

The author exhibited and described an apparatus, consisting of a brass paddle-wheel

working in a vessel filled with liquid, with which he had repeated the experiments
brought before the Cambridge Meeting of the Association.                                  By these experiments he
had discovered that heat is invariably produced by the friction of fluids in exact pro
portion to the force expended. Two series of experiments had been made, one on the
friction of water, the other on the friction of sperm oil. In the former of these series
the heat capable of raising the temperature of a lb. of water 1°, was found to be equal
to the mechanical force capable of raising a weight of 781-5 lbs. to the height of one
foot ; whilst in the series of experiments on the friction of sperm oil, the same quantity
of heat was found to be equal to a mechanical force represented by 782-1 lbs. through

one foot.

The author also stated the result of some experiments made more than a year pre

viously, by which he had found that when a spiral steel spring was compressed, no heat
was evolved. The steel spring, whose particles were thus forcibly disturbed without

                On an Amorphous Boracite. By Dr. M. Karsten.

    When boring for rock-salt at Neusalywerk, in the neighbourhood of M in Jen in
 Prussia, at the depth of about 1400 feet, a bed of amorphous boracite was found, of
 which specimens were brought out by the boring apparatus.

    The chemical analysis, which proves that the composition of the amorphous mineral
is exactly the same as that of the well-known crystallized body, was made by me in
 Berlin, particulars of which may be seen in the monthly reports of the Berlin Aca
demy. It seemed to me interesting to examine if that uncrystallized species would
show the pyroelectric quality which in so high degree is to be seen in boracite crystals.
Sir D. Brewster has pointed out a way by which the pyroelectric quality of pulverized
tourmalin may be shown. By heating that substance, the fine particles cohere toge
ther and show that a polarization has taken place in them. The same phenomenon
is to be seen in the particles of the amorphous boracite by pulverizing and heating it
on a metallic plate. These boracite particles show by their pyroelectric properties
that they must be crystallized, although by microscopic examination the crystallization
cannot be discovered. The conclusion must be, that the difference between the cry
stallized and the amorphous state cannot be exactly determined, since the microscope
shows in this case no crystallization where the pyroelectricity is a proof that we must
suppose a crystalline structure.

 On the Directions of Plants as influenced by Light. By Prof. Maccaiiie.

   The following are the points demanding most attention in this paper: -- 1st. That
the theories advanced to explain the curling up of tendrils do not agree with the ex
periments made on those of the Tamus communis, and that it is the result of a vital
irritability acted upon by chemical agents. 2nd. That the direction of the green
parts of plants towards light is not the result of an attraction properly so called.
3rd. That the bending outwards of slit stems is due to the elongation of the cellular

tissue by endosmose of water and the resistance of the cuticle. 4th. That the quan
tity or rapidity of endosmose is not influenced by heat or by light. 5th. That light
is the onlv agent of the natural position of leaves and of their turning over when in
verted. The blue rays are the most, the red the least, active rays. 6th. That light
does not act in this case by a physical attraction or repulsion properly so called.
7th. That the turning over of leaves takes place sometimes by a torsion of the foot
stalk ; sometimes by a curling of the flat part of leaves. 8th. The blue ray appears
to be the most, and the red the least, active in operating the turning over the leaves.
9th. That the exhalation of leaves is much increased when their inferior surface is
exposed to light. 10th. That the decomposition of carbonic acid and the disen
gagement of oxygen gas are under the same circumstances considerably diminished.

The influences which constitute the solar beam, luminosity, caloric, and actinism,

each possess two orders of physical effects ; the one apparently constant in quality
though varying in quantity at all angles of refrangibility, the other varying in quality.
The constant property of illuminating and the varying one of colour characterize lu
minosity. The constant property of antagonizing mechanical cohesive force in bodies
unites in caloric with the variable properties pointed out by Melloni in that principle
at various angles of refrangibility.
   As to actinism, it would seem to have a chemical action of a constant character at
all angles of refrangibility, as well as certain chemico-dynamical effects, some of which
seem constant, others variable; while also the different manner in which different

bodies absorb this principle at different refrangibilitieg (which may be called their
chemical colour), would seem to point to a similar variable property to those of the

other  two principles.          then, actinism  appears to be a force antagonistic         to that

   In

holding in union the elements of a salt ; probably never of a sufficient power, as found
in the solar beam, to effect decomposition in any salt, not even in the argentine salts,
without the presence of water, organic matter, or some other second body. But
while actinism tends to destroy the force which holds in union the atoms of each salt
present, those atoms arrange themselves into new groups of bodies, which again are
liable to a similar decomposition where the necessary conditions are present, as in the
negative process with iodide of silver, and the positive process with iodide of potassium.
Thus too we find silver deposited in the argentine processes on paper, and not its
                                                                                            of soda,
oxide, as may be proved by its various  reactions    with    ammonia, hyposulphite
cyanide of potassium, nitric acid, &c.             view    it is the affinities of the     elements
                                        In this

of one salt for those of another, or for some simple body present, that carry out into

decomposition the tendency to resolution given by the actinic influence.

   It is worthy of remark, that the order, in point of facility of resolution, of salts
(taking the argentine salts as the type of others), in the case of these actino-chtmical

(or rather actinolytic) decompositions is apparently identical with the electrolytic
series. First stand the chlorides and the haloid family, then the strong acid salts,
nitrates, &c, and then the weaker ones, acetates, benzoates, &c, and finally oxides

and sulphides.
Connected with the chemical action of actinism is the very interesting phenomenon
of development of photographic action. There are three sorts of development. One,

where merely reagents are used to produce contrast where the decomposition hai. been
produced. The next is a very interesting one, namely, where an effect, often invi

sible when first set up by the light, is gradually brought out spontaneously by re
maining in the dark, or is hastened and made more perfect by the addition of some
compound of a character which readily undergoes the kind of change set up pre
viously by the light. It would seem to belong to the class of metamorphoses which
Liebig has accounted for in his view of catalytic action being a communication of
motion from one atom to many. The third kind of development                   is,
                                                                                   where vapours are
enabled to. attach themselves to surfaces by these being exposed to actinic action;
this belongs to the actino-dyuamical or mechanical effects of actinism, to which we will
next refer.

hydrogen with chlorine, carbonic oxide with chlorine (phosgene gas), benzol with
chlorine (chloro-benzin), are instances of this synthetical power, which is probably
the result of a mechanical compression by vibratory motion of the molecules of these
bodies by which their atoms are brought within the spheres of their mutual attractions.
The similar properties of nascent bodies are recognized as the result of their mecha

dynamical action ; the power of condensing vapours may be induced on polished pure
metallic surfaces, and in the Daguerreotype process we have no evidence of decompo
J.sition. The singularly different effects of rays of different refrangibility, as shown by

Sir Herschel, Draper, Claudet and others, seem to point out the dissimilarity of

action to that on paper processes.
   The doctrine of interferences, as proposed by Dr. Draper, seems best to account for
these effects ; and Professor Groves 's theory of the vibrations of light acting in matter

itself and not in an setherial medium, strongly favours the idea.
   The variable effects of light at various angles of refrangibility may be supposed to
result from the rapidity of the vibration, while its constant attributes may be supposed

as resulting from its extent or form.

On two new Salts of Gold. By the Rev. J. B. Reade, M.A., F.R.S.

The author stated that if a few drops of liquor ammonia? be added to 20 or 30 grains
of iodine, and the compound be slightly heated and stirred over the flame of a spirit-
lamp, the result is an ammoniacal solution of iodine having iodine largely in excess.
The fluid thus obtained is an instantaneous solvent of gold leaf; and when saturated
with the latter metal, it yields, upon spontaneous evaporation, four-sided prismatic
crystals of ammonio-periodide of gold. These crystals have very much the colour of
iodine itself. The application of a gentle heat disengages one equivalent of iodine,
Ifand leaves ammonio-iodide of gold as a white crystal. A higher degree of heat vola
tilizes all the ammonia and iodine, and metallic gold remains.      a few drops of the
solution be crystallized rather quickly on a slip of glass, arborescent metallic gold may
be obtained, under the application of heat, as a very beautiful microscopic object.
These salts may probably lead to the more accurate determination of the equivalent
of gold, which at present varies from 66 to 200.

Besides nitre, some other salts have this property. Quartz, on the contrary, loses

its crystalline nature by being fused, and becomes amorphous, which the case also

                       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                           59

Crystals generally arise from the deposition of fresh matter upon an original cry
stalline nucleus, so that the formation of the interior part of the crystal is prior in
point of time to the exterior parts. But in the case of fused nitre, the formation of
the whole crystal is simultaneous, and is doubtlessly produced by the contraction of
the liquid mass in one direction, producing an energetic internal tension.

   Since external pressure (produced by screws, &c.) causes glass to assume a weak,
doubly refracting structure, SirD. Brewster has conjectured that all double refraction
is owing to a permanent internal tension of the particles of transparent bodies, caused

probably by their molecular attractions.
This experiment on nitre seems to prove the theory to he true. Indeed that a con
siderable tension takes place in the nitre when it grows cold and solidifies, is manifest
from the particle sometimes cracking in two. When it does so, the two portions on
different sides of the crack become each of them a perfect crystal, but the two crystals
have not the least relation to each other in respect of the position of their axes, which
chance alone determines. Hence it is evident the crack takes place owing to differ
ent portions of the crystal, while cooling, tending to contract in different directions;
and as it is probable that there must be a tendency in a thousand different particles

to contract in as many different directions, it is remarkable that, unless a crack actually
takes place, these irregular tendencies are overpowered, and the contraction takes
place in one determinate direction (perhaps the resultant of all the others). The
truth of this is manifest from the employment of polarized light as a means of exa
Ifmination, for that would immediately detect the least irregularity in the crystalline
structure.  the different portions of the fused particle did not all possess the same

direction of crystalline axis, part of it would depolarise the incident polarized light,
while another part did not do so. But such is not the case, for all the portions mani

fest the same action with entire accuracy. Hence the conclusion seems irresistible,
that in the case of nitre, a strongly developed internal crystalline structure is due to
nothing else than internal tension, which tension took place simultaneously throughout
the whole mass when it grew cold, and without in the least affecting either its size or
its external outline.
But since the growth of crystals of nitre, like that of other salts, from a small pri
mitive crystalline nucleus is a fact capable of easy observation, and that one fact can
not possibly be destroyed or in any way altered by another fact, it follows that the
above new principle of crystallization is not to be viewed as in any way hostile to the

 ExperimetUs on Cryttallization under extreme Pressure. By W. S. Wa rd.

   This was a statement that a number of experiments had been made since the last
meeting of the Association, with a view of determining if a speculation then thrown
out was correct. Common salt, muriate of ammonia and other salts were exposed,
in solution, to a pressure of 100 atmospheres ; but no difference in their crystalliza-
ble powers were apparent. It was therefore proved, that under a pressure equal to
that found in the depths of the Mediterranean no crystallization from pressure would

take place.

Mr. Ward exhibited a new Galvanometer.                                                     In this instrument the current is
measured by the deflection of the conducting wire by a permanent magnet. The coil
of wire being placed vertically over the poles of the magnet, is free to move, and as
the current is more or less powerful, the coil requires a greater or less weight to
bring it to its original position : hence the force of the current is expressed in grains
instead of in degrees.

The author stated that in the year 1815 the Sulden glacier had moved for a space
of more than two statute miles down the valley from its ordinary position, and that
in the year 1845 it had retired again to the same place as it ordinarily occupied ; but
iti the April of 1845 it again commenced to move; and early in 1846 it had moved
upwards of 2000 yards, leaving about three quarters of a mile still to be passed
over before it would arrive at the point in which it had before stood. Sir Thomas

state of repose has changed. The ice puffed up, burst everywhere, displaced itself,

Dudley limestones and shales, proposes as a matter for further determination, the true
age of the Walsall shales, which may, he conceives, possibly be found to be of older
date and in that case the Hay Head limestones would not be equivalents of the
Dudley rocks, but of older Silurian strata.

   The object of the present paper to lay before the Association some facts con
nected with the distribution of marine plants in the county of Worcester.

   In botanizing some time since on fhe banks of the Droitwich Canal, which pro
ceeds from the borough of Droitwich into the Severn near Worcester, was
surprised to find several patches of Glattx maritima and Armaria marina, two plants
so undoubtedly marine, that, as far as know, they have never been elsewhere

Now as this canal connected with the salt-works of Droitwich, quantity of

62 REPORT -- 1847.

1st. Did the seeds of these plants find their way to the canal from the marine
districts which are their usual habitats? or

2nd. Did such plants originate from seeds which have lain dormant in the earth

for an indefinite period ?
   The author answer* the first of these questions negatively; and in considering the
second point, describes the general structure of the Severn valley, especially its
terraces of different elevation, due to successive vertical movement.

That these terraces mark the height of the water there can be little doubt, as they
are made up of marine gravel and sand ; and in several places these sands have
yielded specimens of marine shells, at once testifying to the truth of a large strait or

sea receding would cause the destruction of such plants as really required saline water

to struggle on; and the following list of such plants now growing in the vale of the
Severn affords curious examples in illustration of this point.

appear when circumstances are favourable; and, coupled with the evidence adduced

in support of the hypothesis that the district along which the Droitwich Canal runs,
and other places contiguous to the Severn, were occupied until a comparatively recent
period with a littoral flora, lead to the conclusion, that the Droitwich marine plants

nave been derived from seeds which have long been lying dormant, and having been

exposed by the making    of the canal, were called into activity by the subsequent adap
tation of circumstances   to their wants; -- in short, that these plants are the offspring

of those which were there when the saline conditions formerly prevailed.

out of the strata in our cliffs, seems to indicate that since this deposit took place
there can have been no violent disturbance in this strata. The coincidence of ray
having found the same remains, especially the crocodile, in a group in the same
strata, and at the same height or thereabouts from high-water mark on both coasts,
strikes one as indicative of the space occupied by the freshwater lake or river, at the
time of their deposit, being nearly similar, or equivalent to that now occupied by*

   J.On Detritus derived from the London Clay and deposited in the Red Crag.

                                  By the Rev. S. Henslow.

    Peculiar nodules in the red crag at Felixtow in Suffolk had been formerly con
sidered by the author to be of coprolitic origin ; but it had since been satisfactorily
shown that they were detrital materials from the London clay. Nodules containing
about 56 per cent, of phosphate of lime occur in great abundance at Colchester in
the London clay ; and those in the crag are only nodules of this description slightly
rolled and somewhat modified by having had a portion of iron pyrites converted to
oxide of iron. It was the author's object to show also that the Cetotolites described
by Professor Owen, numerous fragments of bones, and many highly mineralized fossils
found in the crag must be classed as detrital materials from the London clay. The
genuine crag fossils are readily separable from those of the eocene period by their
not being mineralized ; and such is the case with fish-bones, crustacean and other re
mains, as well as with the testacean shells, so abundant and well-known in the crag'.
There are hollow nodules of oxide of iron in the same beds, with other detrital
materials ; and it was considered that these had been derived from decomposed nodules
of sulphuret of iron, so common in the London clay. The materials which had fur
nished the phosphate of lime to the nodules first noticed appear to have been derived
from decomposed bones, teeth, and crustaceans.

            On a New SpeciesByofJaNmauestiluIns qfrloism, Mthe.IKHalifax Coal Beds.

   The author offered to the attention of the Section of Geology two remarkable
species of Nautilus, one supposed to be new, which he had obtained from the Halifax
beds of the Yorkshire coal-field. The new species he proposed to name, in honour
of the President of the Association, N. IngUsii.

On  the  Plants  of the  New  South Woks and Van Diemen's  Land Coal-fields.
                              By Frederick M'Coy.

    The essay contains figures and descriptions of seventeen new species, and enu
merates (together with observations on) most of the species described from the same

district by Brongniart and Morris. All the species are peculiar to Australia and Van

Diemen's Land, except the GlossopterU Browniana, both of the varieties of which
occurring in the supposed oolitic coal-fields of India were here noticed.

    The new species belong to the genera Vertebraria, JEtopterit, Cyclopterit, Spheno-
plerit, Glostopterii aad Phyllotheca, of which the first and two last are only known in
coal-fields of the oolitic age, and the others are common to those of both the oolitic
and carboniferous periods. The new Vertebraria is closely allied to one from the
Burdwan coal-field, and throws some light on the structure of the genus. Two new
species of Phyllotheca are described, and the inflorescence of the old one, which is
stated toexactly resemble the inflorescence of the recent Casuarina stricta, thus widely

separating those fossils from the Eqaisetacem, with which botanists had compared them.
All the other points of structure were also shown to agree closely with Casuarina, in
ducing the author to place them in the same family. Another recent Australian form
was recognised in the Pecopterit odontopteroides (Morris), which the author ascer
tained to have possessed a dichotomous frond, as in the recent Gleicheria ; the plant
was placed in the genus Gleichenitet (Gbp.), but the close affinity to the Keuper genus
Heptacarpus was pointed out. The South Esk and the Jerusalem coal basins of Van
Diemen's Land were stated from the fossils to be of precisely the same age as the

from those localities, it was stated that no trace existed of Lepidodetidron, Sigillaria,
Fatmlaria, Stigmaria, or any characteristic fossil of the old coal of Europe or America.

On Count  Keyserling's Geology of the            North-eastern    extremity  of Russia  in
                    Europe. By Sir R. I.
                                                 Murchison,     F.R.S.

Sir R. Murchison exhibited the new work, entitled "Wissenschaftliche Beobach-

tungen auf einer Reise in das Petschora-land"; and explained its value incompleting
the acquaintance of geologists with the great north-eastern angle of Russia in Europe,
which is watered by the river Petchora. The geographical and astronomical obser
vations in this expedition (to a region previously known only imperfectly to the
Russians through the traders in fur), are by M. P. Von Krusenstern of the Imperial
Navy. The geological outline of the present work (executed in 1843) was communi
cated to Sir It. Murchison previous to the publication of the volumes on the geology
of Russia and the Ural Mountains, and constitutes one of the chapters of that work ;
but the object of this communication was to call attention to the additions which had

appeared, first in regard to the physical and geological delineations of this wild
country in two maps ; and secondly, to the numerous plates (23 in number) of the
organic remains of the Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, and Jurassic

systems occurring in a hitherto unexplored region which extends over near 1 1° of
lat. ; viz. from 60° to 71° N. lat., and 25° of long., including the northernmost range
of the Ural Mountains. Sir R. Murchison stated, that although the eastern flank of
that chain had been touched upon at one or two points by the authors, and notably
in N. lat. 65°, enough had only just been done by them in this respect to connect in

an approximate manner      the structure of the  northern end of the chain with that  pre
viously described: -- all  this rocky territory  extending 3° and 4° of lat. beyond    the

limits of arboreal vegetation is now under the survey of a distinct expedition com
manded by Colonel Hoffman, and sent out under the auspices of the Geographical
Society of St. Petersburgh. The chief geological interest attached to the work of
Count Keyserling (in addition to the points alluded to) is the determination of an
axis of palaeozoic rocks constituting the Tiraan Ridge, which branching off from near
the Ural Mountains in lat. N. 62°, trends in a N.N.W. direction on the left bank

of the Petchora to the Bay of Tcheskaya, and is prolonged into the promontory of
Kanin-Nos in lat. 68° 45'. This ridge, divergent from the meridian direction of the
Ural Mountains, but parallel to their northern extremity, seems to form a part of the
great girdle of palaeozoic deposits which wrap round the crystalline nucleus of Lapland
and Scandinavia, of which the Baron Leopold von Buch, by his description of the
fossils collected there, has recently determined an important fragment of carbonife
rous age in Bear Island near Spitsbergen, on the north-western flank of Scandinavia.

On the Fossils obtained by tlie Marchioness of Hastings from the Freshwater
      Eocene Beds of the Hordle Cliffs. By Professor Owen, M.D., F.R.S.

   Of the fossils obtained by the Marchioness of Hastings from the above-described
freshwater deposits, some specimens indicative of a new genus of Pachyderm {Palo-

plotKerium) intermediate between the Palteotherium and Anoplotkerium, had been
recently described by Professor Owen at the Geological Society of London. Those
which were exhibited by Lady Hastings to the Geological Section, consisted of two
remarkably perfect fossil skulls of an extinct species of crocodile, and the singularly
complete carapace of a freshwater tortoise (Trionyx). Professor Owen commented
on the extremely fragile and crumbly character of the fossils when first extracted
from the sands described in the preceding memoir, and on the skill and care with
which the rare and valuable fossils exhibited had been re-adjusted, cemented, and
restored to their original perfect state. All the requisite characters for determining
their nature and affinities could now be studied with the same facility as in the skulls
of existing crocodiles.
These were divisible into the three genera of Gavials (Gamalis), Alligator (Alli
gator), and Crocodile proper (Crocodilus). The two specimens on the table differed
from the modern Gavials and ancient Teleosaurs in their broad and strong and com-

parativcly short jaws. With regard to the remaining genera, the first character
             out was the relation of the large canines of the lower jaw to the upper jaw.

foninttheedAlligator these teeth pass into depressions on the palatal surface of the upper
jaw, and are concealed from view when the mouth is closed : in the true Crocodiles
the inferior canines rest in grooves or notches upon the outer margin of the upper
jaw when the mouth is closed, and their entire crowns are exposed. In this character,
as well as in the festooned contour of the alveolar border of the upper jaw, both the
Hordle crocodilian skulls exhibited by Lady Hastings agreed with the true Crocodiles

and differed from the Alligators.
    l'rofessor Owen then entered into a comparison between the fossil crocodile of the

eocene sands of Hordle, and the fossil crocodile figured in Buckland's ' Bridgewater
Treatise' from the eocene clays of Sheppey, and showed that whilst this resembled
in the regular attenuation of the snout and the comparatively straight border of the
upper jaw the existing crocodile of Borneo (Croc. Schlegclii), the fossil crocodile of
Hordle more resembled the crocodile of the Indian continent in the greater breadth
of the muzzle, and the strong festooning of the border of the upper jaw.

    Both the fossil species however were plainly distinct from their nearest existing
congeners; and us Dr. Uuckland had given to the Sheppey crocodile (Crocodiliu
Spcnceri) the name of the possessor of the rare specimen of that species, Professor
Owen proposed to call the extinct species from Hordle Crocodilus Hastingsia, in
honour of the accomplished lady by whom the singularly perfect examples of the

 species had been recovered and restored.

    It would seem that the Crocodilus Haslingsice was not the only specimen of Saurians
from the Hordle cliffs. Dr. Mantell refers to "a fossii species of Alligator (Alliga-
 tor Hantoniensis) described by Mr. Searles Wood, from a specimen of the lower jaw
and teeth found in the freshwater beds at Hordwell Cliff."

On the Formation of Coal, &c. Extract of a Letter from Prof. Boguslawski
                      of lireslau, communicated by Prof. Powell.

    Dr. Gopping, now Rector Magnificus of the Royal University and President of the
Silesian Society, has succeeded, after many years' experiments, in converting vege
tables in the moist way (at a temperature of 140° to 210° Fahrenheit, which he only
employs however in order to accelerate ihe process), after the lapse of one year, into
brown coal or lignite, which is hardly to be distinguished from the true lignite ; nay
more, by an addition ofj'jth of sulphate of iron, in order to supply the place of
the sulphuret of iron or pyrites, which often occurs in coals, he has succeeded in
producing the black colour peculiar to coal. He ha3 also been able by his process to
cause Venetian turpentine, produced from branches of the Pinus larix by digestion, to
acquire in the same time the insolubility of the fossil resins (such as retin-asphalt,
amber, &c.) in alcohol. These experiments, which I have seen myself, seem to prove
to my friend that no very long geological period is required for the formation of

coal.

On the Origin of the existing Physical Outline of a portion of Cardiganshire.
  By A. C. Ramsay, F.C.S., Prof, of Geology in University College, London.

The object of this paper was to explain the probable causes that gave rise to the
existing physical outline of certain parts of Cardiganshire.  Two geological sections
were exhibited on a horizontal and vertical scale of six inches to a mile, extending from

the interior of South Wales to the coast of Cardigan Bay. The district to which the
paper referred is composed of a portion of lower Silurian strata highly contorted.
The country is intersected by numerous valleys. It wa3 shown that, in accordance
with the curvatures of the beds as exhibited in the sections, large masses of rock

(the outcropping edges of which rise to the surface) ivere once continuous above the
existing curves. These were removed in a period subsequent to the disturbances that
effected the contortions of the strata. The sections were described as being nearly pa

rallel, running from east to west, and about twenty miles apart. By drawing straight

but never rose                                                                                      two    planes of
eighteen miles  above them. These lines therefore represented                                       angle   of nearly  about
                in length gently inclined towards the sea at an

and beneath them all the valleys are excavated. It was attempted to be shown that
these coincidences probably arose from some general cause applicable to the whole
district, namely, the peculiar manner in which the denudation of the country was
produced.

    Suppose before the removal of parts of the curved strata that originally rose above
the inclined planes, the relative levels of sea and land were such that the highest
points of land now immediately overhanging the sea were lowered to its level ; then
suppose a gradual sinking of the district bearing a proportion in time to the amount
of waste effected by the action of the sea ; then, as the sinking and denudation pro
gressed, by the time the sea had eaten in as far as the highest points in the interior
touched by the inclined lines, there would be an inclined plane beneath the level of
the sea, extending seaward from that point at some given angle. In this instance it
is represented by the angle that the line which touches the hill-tops of the sections
makes with the horizon viz. 1J°, and this would give a depth of water (not allowing
for the accumulation of debris spread on the floor thus constructed by the ocean for
              of about two hundred fathoms at the distance of                               eighteen miles from shore.
Iittsewlaf)s  then stated, that as the land again emerged from                              the sea, or during various

subsequent oscillations of level, valleys were excavated by further denudation, and that
the higher points of land as they now exist are only the relics of an average general
gentle slope represented by the straight line drawn from the inland heights towards
the sea. It was further stated, that if in the construction of other sections across this

country exceptions should be found to the rule that points of land do not rise above
the inclined plane described, this would not invalidate the general argument, since
many cases may have occurred in which outlying islands resisted the progress of
denudation long enough to break any absolute uniformity.

In noticing the preparation of these maps, and especially those which were con
structed by H.R.H. the Crown Prince of Sweden, Count Rosen mentioned the
great labour and perseverance of His Royal Highness in collecting authentic mate
rials for his work. He has in fact corresponded with every curate, every mine-
inspector, almost all the iron-masters, mine-holders and smelters in the country, and
with every man in office over the country who has anything to do with the mining
department, or with the woods and forests.

level of the sea of the different points, -- every hundred feet being designated by a
different colour. Thus, for instance, dark green comprises all those places which
are situated on a level less than 100 feet above the sea ; light green those between

100 and 200 feet ; brown, those between 500 and 600 ; and so on.
At the foot there is a table, showing the elevation of the towns above the level of

laid down in green, and the different shades are intended to designate the different
character of the forest; thus the light shade of green represents those forests which

can only be employed for firewood, charring and home consumption ; whereas tbe
dark shades represent those which can produce large timber for exportation. Un
fortunately this map is not finished, for the Prince had not had time to lay down all

the deeper shades when I copied it ; from this circumstance it happens that a great
many of the finest and the oldest forests in this map only appear fit to produce fire
wood and timber for buildings such as are used in the country : of course this will
be altered as soon as the skeleton map has been finished. The forests of Swedeu
are, as may be perceived from this map, immense; nay, in the north and in the far

interior, there exist forests where the axe never yet resounded, and where the human

foot hardly ever trod.
   No. 3. Map of Sweden, representing its Iron produce. -- This map is very peculiar,

and, as I think, quite unique in its kind, for it shows at one glance the whole move
ment of the iron produce, which is well known to be the most important branch of
commerce in Sweden. Upon it all the mines are marked or shown by small round
marks of different colours, according to each different mining district or inspection.
Thus, for instance, the blue designates the northern district or inspection, while
yellow designates the upland district, in which are situated those well-known mines
of Dannemora, whence conies that superior iron which is sent to England to be con

verted into steel, and whereof a part finds its way back to Sweden.
From the mines, a line of the same colour leads to all the blast furnaces which
prepare the ore of those mines, and from the blast furnaces another line of the same

colour leads to all those forging places or iron-hammer works which use the pig-iron
produced at the blast furnaces. From all the forging works a line of lake colour leads

to the respective ports where this produce is shipped. We can therefore, as I said,
with great facility trace upon this map the movement of the iron produce from the
place where it comes out of the mine in the shape of ore till it is loaded in one of
the ports in the shape of bars. Here I hope it will be allowed for me to remark,
that since the last year a new a-ra has begun in the iron trade, for up to that time it

was fettered by numerous restrictions; for instance, each forge was not allowed to
produce yearly more than a certain quantity of iron, proportionate to the quantity
Itof charcoal which each iron-master could produce within a certain district.
                                                                                                                    is

needless to remark what a baneful influence this and other restrictions which were
removed last year, necessarily had upon the iron trade. I have no hesitation in
saying that within a very short period the iron trade of Sweden will revive, and
become again what it once was, one of the most important branches of commerce
in Europe.

   The differences of principle, as to the colouring of geological maps, which exist be
tween their various authors, render the comparison of distinct areas difficult, and will
always present obstacles in the way of generalization, while such various methods exist.

   The object of this communication is to propose one uniform scale of colouring
applicable to all districts, -- by adopting as its basis the prismatic spectrum. The
advantage of adopting such a standard is obvious, since it is acknowledged by all
scientific men of whatever country ; and it fortunately offers us a sufficient number
of distinct colours, yet graduated and harmonized with each other, for all the chief
groups of strata acknowledged by geologists.

   The prismatic spectrum of Newton, as seen in the lower arch of the rainbow, con
sists of seven colours, and these it is proposed to apply in the annexed diagram to
the geological scale. The older and obscurer strata seem most naturally to be re
presented by the dull and darker end of the spectrum, and the brighter ones will
represent the approach to the modern period. The annexed divisions are not strictly
what each geologist must admit, but the upward or downward extension of any one
will not affect the general principle.

strength for the middle division, and giving to the third or uppermost a slight ad
mixture of the succeeding colour; or if further subdivision be attempted by colour,
each of these shades may be varied ad libitum by the admixture in various propor
tions of the binary colour which is complementary to it. Thus the three shades of
red may each be varied and divided into bands by varieties of green, yellow by

varieties of its complementary purple, blue by orange, &c, as in the annexed

and with intervening long periods of rest, became slower and slower, and the dis
continuance of the elevation was of less duration. On the leeward coast, along the
road which leads from Bridgetown to Speightstown, lines of rounded and angular

pieces of limestone, piece3 of coral, &c, heaped upon each other, prove decidedly
that it was formerly a shingle beach. The author was told that Indian hatchets had
been found among these fragments, which would fix the date of the last movement

within the historical period.
There are proofs that Barbados has been elevated gradually to its present height
within the epoch of existing shells. Species of the genera Trochus, Lucina and
Pectunculwi, have been found near Sugar-hill, Chimbaroza and Mount Wilton. The
casts of these shells are merely found at that elevation, while those met with at a
height from fifty to three hundred feet, possess in many instances still their lustre,

and do not differ from those in the adjacent sea.
   The fossil shells are frequently larger than the recent; and others, which at the
period when they were imbedded must have been abundant around the island,
are now very rare, or are only found further northward, among the Virgin Islands,

the Bahamas, and the south-eastern coast of North America.

Some of the recent shells found in the fossil state have retained their pearly lustre

and colour in such a surprising degree, that one is tempted to disbelieve that they
have been lying buried for ages. This refers chiefly to specimens of Strombns pugilit,
Bulla striata, Cyprcca cineraria, &c. The author found a fragment of a gigantic
shell one inch and a half thick, which apparently belonged to the genus Tridacna.
It enclosed a Petricola.
The coralline rocks harden frequently into a compact limestone with conchoidal
fracture, and translucent on the edges. This mass has occasionally the appearance
of stratification, chiefly near the road between the Chapel Estate and St. Philip's

Church. A certain kind of the coralline limestone is quarried for the purposes of
building, and although soft when taken from the quarry, it becomes quite hard by
exposure to the air. Another kind, which is a conglomerate of minute pieces of
shells, is quite porous, and is used for drip-stones.
Quite different in appearance, and in regard to its structure, is the "Scotland" di
strict, which resembles an alpine country in miniature. The various modifications
of tertiary rocks which are found in this district have been already alluded to ; never

theless, their character, under all modifications, possesses an original uniformity.
The stratification of these rocks is more or less inclined, and changes in some instances
in closely allied rocks of sandstone, from the horizontal to almost the vertical. The
stratification is at other times wavy, and at Chalky Mount and Mount All it is greatly

contorted.

    The earthy marl, or as it is called in the colony, the chalk, constitutes by far the

greater part of the series. It occurs in masses, from a few inches in thickness to
several hundred feet, us on the southern and western sides of Mount Hillaby. The

very summit of tlii.s mountain, which has a height of 1148 feet above the sea, con
sists of marl.

   On the south-eastern  declivity of Mount Hillaby,   near Groves, bitumen   --has  been
discovered, containing,  according to the analysis of  Mr. William Herapath,

Bitumen, resolvable by heat into tar and gas                 61*6

Sulphur,                 ...

The superposition of the rocks is here bitumen, bituminous sandstone, gray clay,
clayey sandstone mixed with ferruginous sand, and earthy marl. Bitumen of similar
nature is likewise found near Codrington College, near the Estate Cambridge, and
in other situations. The author observed a thin seam of bituminous coal traversing
the sandstone near Springfield, and another at Burnt Hill traversing limestone.
The seams near Springfield contain sometimes bituminous wood, resembling Sur-
tnrbrand.
 . The elevation called Burnt Hill, which rises near Conset's Bay, is reported to have
been accidentally set on fire by a slave, and continued to burn for five years. Slags,
which are found in large masses on the declivity, and near the beach at the foot of
712 REPORT 1847-

the hill, show distinctly that they were subjected to a great heat, and confirm the

popular tradition. The rocks near the summit, which have a blackened appearance,

have not been subjected to fire, and constat of bituminous fine-grained sandstone*,
and an argillaceous rock or a dull yellow colour, dry and rough to the touch, resem
bling in its mineralogical character Tripoli. At Skeete's Bay is a Htratum of volcanic
ashes, and pumicenus particles are disseminated through the marl.
In the white marls and other rocks of Scotland district, Professor Ebrenberg of

Berlin discovered a new and great group of siliceous-shielded animalcules, which iu
a report read before the Koyul Academy of Sciences he described as Polycystina.
The regular apertures and articulation of the minute shells which cover these ani
malcules distinctly bespeak an independent animal structure and development.
They possess large apertures at the extremity of the body, which has no analogy

among plants, but occurs very commonly among animals. These siliceous loricated

organic forms from the rocks in Barbados differ alike from Polygastrica and Polv-

thalamia, but develope an important relation to these two groups, which Professor

Ehrenberg considers, not upon conjecture, but fruiu actual investigation, to form two
separate types. They approach most nearly in systematic arrangement to Polythala-

mia, and would occupy a separate group among animals possessed of vessels but
without a heart and pulsation, and provided with a simple tubular intestinal canal.

The forms developed in the highest degree in that division would be Holothuriae

and Echinoidea.                                     of

Of these more than three hundred are new forms.
   The great discovery of the Polycystina, which might he almost called a new class,

since they amount to upwards of 280 species, a larger number of specific forms than
is contained in some classes of animals, may guide us to form an idea of the geolo
gical age of the rocks in Scotland district, by comparing these forms with similar
fossil animalcules from rocks upon the age of which geologists have agreed. Ehren
berg considers that the Polycystina from the rocks of Barbados resemble more the
animalcules from rocks of the secondary period than of the tertiary. The author's
investigations lead him to consider the rocks to belong rather to the tertiary period,
and in this he is confirmed by some shells found on the summit of Bissex Hill and
at Springfield, which Professor E. Forbes considers to belong to the miocene period.
At Bissex Hill, the teeth of two species of shark (from the genus Lamna and Odon-
Itupis) and spines of Echini were likewise found. One of the shells from that hill
is a new Scalaria, which Professor Forbes has described as S. Ehrenbergi, and the

Ifnew species of Nucula from Springfield as N. Packeri and N". Sehomburgkii.

       we inquire now into the circumstance which produced the elevation of the
Scotland series of rocks, and transformed the horizontal strata of sandstones into
almost vertical and contorted stratifications, we cannot doubt that submarine move
ments raised the old sea-bottom, and volcanic agency acting violently from a given
point, gave rise to the local derangements of this formation. The strata of sand
stone are more disturbed near Chalky Mount than anywhere else; the line of dis
turbance extends from that hill towards Forster Hiil and Mount Hillabv. It is a
very remarkable fact, that while the earthy marls and clays from the Scotland di
strict abound in Polycystina, not one species has been discovered in the red and blue
clays from Swcetbottom, from Mount Wilton, and from the cliffs in St. John's

parish, thus attesting the great contrast in the geological age between the coralline

    · The slags have apparently consisted of a similar sandstone, and the large quantity of
bitumen probably assisted to feed the fire.

formation and the Scotland district. The earthy marl and gray clay of which the
summit of Mount Hillaby consists, contains no less than fifty-live species of Poly
cystic, two species of Polygastrica, four species of Geolitliia, and seven species of

Phytolitharia.

   It would be of great interest to have rocks from other localities in the West India

Archipelago examined microscopically, in order to discover whether they contain
Polycystina, which might lead to conclusions of importance to the relative ages of
this group of islands. In looking over a collection of rocks from Jamaica at the
Geological Society, the author noted a strong similarity in their mineralogical cha
racter. This referred chiefly to some rocks presented to that Society by the Rev.
Mr. Jelly from Clarendon, which seemed almost identical with some of those from
Barbados. Among those from Jamaica were likewise bituminous coal and bitumi
nous wood. 

          Extract of a Letter from Mr. E.Vivian of Torquay, respecting
                              the Phenomena of Kent's Cavern.

    The important point which we have established is, that relics of human art are found
beneath the unbroken floor of stalagmite. After taking every precaution, by sweeping
the surface, and examining most minutely whether there were any traces of the flooi
having been previously disturbed, we broke through the solid stalagmite in three
different parts of the cavern, and in each instance found flint knives, closely resem
bling the rudest of those found in the most ancient barrows. The nearest spot at
which flint is found is Aller, about five miles distant. The thickness of the stalag
mite is about two feet. In the spot where the most highly-finished specimen was
found the passage was so low, that it was extremely difficult, with quarry-men's tools
and good workmen, to break through the crust ; and the supposition that it had been
previously disturbed is impossible in an age when no metal appears to have been in

use. The spot was about 400 feet from the entrance. If the Secretary of the Geo

logical Society has sent you the plans which were exhibited before the Society when
my paper was read, it will be seen marked upon the ground plan.

The mantle of this hitherto undescribed mollusk is very large, extending much
beyond the shell, and is fringed with filaments, one of which is much longer than
the rest. The mantle is open, except for a short space before and behind, and
forms posteriorly a short syphon with a single aperture. The foot is very large,
thick and tapering, and has a disc like the foot of Nucula. It forms a fine byssus.
The branchial leaflets are two on each side.

and is eminently natatory.

   It was shown that after passing from the mite-like form in which it leaves the egg,
N. ascidicola, Allm., has the cephalic segment, succeeded by four distinct segments,
each bearing a pair of true feet. These feet however are still in a rudimental state,
and furnished with long bristles like the setigerous feet of an annelide. In its gene,
ral form and motions indeed this stage strongly reminds one of the annelidan type
of structure. It is probable, however, that between the earlier cxtra-ovine stage
and that just described, there are certain intermediate phases which have not been
yet observed. In a more advanced stage it was shown that a coalescence had taken
place between the last foot-bearing segment and the region of the body which im
mediately succeeds it, and which is destined to support the great dorsal ovigerous
chamber. The legs have now acquired nearly the form which they possess in the
adult. The next stage observed by Professor Allman is that of the fully-developed
animal. In this, the first of the segments bearing true feet has coalesced with the
cephalic region, and there are consequently now only two distinct segments sup
porting natatory feet. While the consolidation has been going on in the anterior-
posterior direction, a lateral coalescence has also been in operation ; for the great
dorsal ovigerous chamber, which in the second of the observed phases consisted of
two distinct portions separated from one another along the mesial line, has in the
third and fourth assumed the condition of a solitary organ, dorsal and median.

Herbstii.Leach. 2nd, Nebalia Geoffroyi, M. Edwards ; Nebalia Strauri, Risso. With
regard to the Chirocephalus of Prevost, it appears evident that the genus Branchipus,
as originally described by Schseffer, and minutely figured by him in all its details, is
quite distinct from the species found in England, and described by authors under
that name. The differences are so great and well-marked, that it is necessary to
refer them to the genus Chirocephalus of Prevost, so beautifully figured at the end of
Jurine's work on the Monoculi of Geneva.

forthcoming work on the British Mollusca. It is an attempt to group our native

species in natural families, founded upon the more important and at the same time

variable importance in the different tribes. The general habit, and often the scalp-
tare of the shell, are usually in striking accordance with the most essential features
of the animal. Characters derived from the hinge and from the position of the liga

ment, hitherto mainly depended upon by conchologists, prove to be in the majority
of instances bad guides for determining the natural affinities of the mollusk, and

seldom of more than generic value.                      by the authors :--

 Notice of Dredging Researches in progress. By Prof. E. Forbes, F.R.S.

  A number of specimens of remarkable British animals were laid on the table, pre
served in very perfect condition by Mr. Goadby, who is at present accompanying Mr.
M'Andrew on a dredging voyage in the seas of the Zetlands and Hebrides. Mr.
M'Andrew has forwarded to the meeting specimens of a living Terebratula dredged off
Skye, identical with the crag fossil T. cistellula of Mr. Searles Wood. A new Holo-
thuria, discovered by Mr. Gwynn Jeffreys, was also laid on the table.

                 By AlbanyOnHtahne cAoncaktomanyd oDf.ScEymllabelae.ton, M.D.

    The internal structure of this animal was found pretty accurately to agree with
the details given by Cuvier, though some important matters relative to the digestive
apparatus seem to have been overlooked. The presence of a gland at the commence
ment of the oesophagus, its small stomach receiving large ducts from the biliary
masses, its large and long intestine approximate it to the Doridida; ; but the
stomach with an internal dental apparatus would appear to be peculiar. Its branched
system of tubes in the skin and branchial tufts show its relation to the Eolididse ; but
the redivision of some of these tubes on the periphery of the globular biliary organs,
with the convolutions of which they communicate, on the one hand, and the passage
of others on the other hand into the intestinal canal, are peculiarities of structure not
found in either of the families mentioned.

                                                  Hoven of Leyden.

   The author, after noticing the successful labours of Prof. Owen in this department
of anatomical science, observes, the chief modifications which result from the

anatomical investigation of the Nautilus in the general anatomical characters of the
Cephalopoda are, that not all mollusca of that group have eight arms round the
mouth, nor two venous hearts beside the middle aortical heart, nor only two gills,
nor an ink-sac. Those characters are common to Sepia, Loligo and Octopus. In the
Nautilus, on the contrary, there are no lateral venous hearts ; there are four instead
of two branchite. The place of the eight arms is occupied by flat digitations of a far
greater number, including vermiform and annulated tentacula, which can be exserted
and retracted. My celebrated friend Owen has founded on those characters a di

stinction of the Cephalopoda into two orders, viz. the dibranchiafa and tetrabranchiata.
To the second division belongs, under the now living mollusca, no other genus
hitherto known, except Nautilus. Another inhabitant of a concamerated or poly-
thalamic shell, the Spirula, is not sufficiently known to us ; but still what we know
concerning it, is quite sufficient to show that the animal has no analogy with the
Nautilus, and belongs to the dibranchiafa division.
My friend De Vriese, Professor of Botany at the University of Leyden, lately gave
me a specimen of Nautilus pompilius, which was in a bad state of preservation, but

still of great interest to me, as I found occasion to observe a conformation of the

head quite distinct from that which has been described by Owen and Valenciennes.

As to the external tentacula, I found only this very unimportant modification, that
there were but nineteen at each side instead of twenty. Internal to this part, whose
upper or dorsal part, called hood by Owen, fills entirely the opening of the shell,
the integument forms a prolongation, rising up to another more internal circle. To
the ventral or inferior side this prolongation unites by a transverse part with the
external tentacular ring. This part shows many transverse impressions parallel to
the margin and many irregular excavations, which gives to it a reticulated appear
ance. The prolongation is divided on each side in eight digitations of different size,
inclosing each a tentacle similar to that of the external set, but of a more minute

size.     parts  correspond  to the superior labial processes  of Owen, ' Memoir  on the
   Those

Pearly Nautilus,' tab. iv. jr. g.; but in Owen's description, and also in that specimen
which has been described by Valenciennes, there are many more tentacula, twelve
78 REPORT-- 1847.

in Owen's specimen, and even thirteen in that of Valenciennes. The last-named
author calls this                                                  Toward the inferior
part of the head,  part the superior pair of the internal arms.   at the median ventral
                   nearer to the infundibulum, which is situated
line, there are two other processes in Owen's and Valenciennes' specimens, the in
ferior labial processes of the former, the inferior pair of the internal arms of the lat
ter. Owen attributes also twelve tentacula to each of these processes. In this point

my specimen is entirely different. On the right side I found four tentacula ; three

on a common flat pedunculus, the fourth and inferior on a separate digitation. I

can also not agree with Owen in calling these inferior labial processes, interior as
they were in his specimen. In the specimen examined by me, they were on the con
trary more interior than the superior labial processes. But at the left side a still
greater difference was to be observed. Instead of a labial process, there was a great

conoid body compressed from each Bide ; at the basis its measure from the dorsal

to the ventral surface was one inch ten lines, from the right to the left only one inch.
This part was proved to me by dissecting it to be formed by the union of four un
usually developed tentacular slips, one of which was shorter and more free, the three
others chiefly composing the singular body. This part occupied a great space in the
interior of the tentacular circle of the head, and perhaps its great development may

be the cause of the more imperfect state of the other three pair of labial processes.

               On the Lepidosiren. By A. G. Melville, M.D.

   On a careful examination of the Lepidosiren the author had no hesitation in refer
ring it to the class of amphibia, and was unwilling to unite that class to the closely
allied one of fishes. He rested its reptilian character upon the absence of the supra-
occipital bone, the presence of the large epi- and basi-cranial bones, the non-deve
lopment of the maxillary and inter-maxillary bones, and especially on the enormous
magnitude of the vomerine bones, which became subservient to mastication, and
were anchylosed to the expanded pterygoids ; also on the composition of the tym
panic pedicle; on the nostril being double, and the posterior aperture intra- oval;
(referring to Rusconi's remark on the position of that aperture as influenced by the
relative development of the superior maxillary and vomer) ; on the double auricle,
septum ventriculorum and semi-spiral bulbus arteriosus ; on the arrangement of the
vessels distributed to the external gills and to the lungs ; on the addition to the left
pulmonary artery pointed out by Peters, of a right one, having like its fellow its origin
from the truncus aorta; ; on the existence of external cutaneous gills during the adult
condition, which did not occur in any fishes, and were not the homologues of the
deciduous filaments found in sharks and rays ; on the co-existence of external and
internal gills with lungs; in other words, on its exhibiting the different modes of cir-
culative respiration seen in the proteus, second stage of the larva of the frog, and
amphiuma, or menopoma. He instances the like case of the tadpole of the Rana
paradoxa, in which there were internal gills and lungs with a cartilaginous chorda
dorsalis, ossified neurapophyses, and protruded hinder extremities : were this arm
too in its development before the external gills have wholly disappeared, we should
have an animal essentially similar to the Lepidosiren. The form and relative size of
the brain in relation to its containing cavity, and certain calcareous concretions which
overlie the fourth ventricle, supply additional arguments, &c. Many of the peculia
rities were to be classed among the adaptive characters ; and for some excellent re
marks on this subject in reference to the osseous system in another tribe, to wit the
Plagiostome fish, he would refer to Mr. Owen's Lectures, vol. ii. ; the absence of
respiration by the surface as in other amphibia might have an influence on the great
development of the respiratory organs. In conclusion, although the Lepidosiren
is the most fish-like of the amphibia, still he is forced to regard it as a true amphi
bian, and not as a fish, and thus revert to the determination of Bischoff.

        On Changes in the Fauna of Sweden. By Professor Nilsson.
               {Abstracted from the Swedish. By N. Shaw, M.D.)

    As a proof of the oscillations or periodical changes observed in the fauna of Sweden,
Professor Nilsson mentioned, that the Canis Lupus, at the time when Olaus Magnus
published his ' Historia Gentium Septentrionalium' in 1535, or about 300 years ago,
was very common in Sweden, and during the severe cold of the Swedish winter ex
ceedingly dangerous to travellers; but that 180 years later (1735, or 24 years prior
to the appearance of Linnteus's ' Fauna Suecica ') the same animal had become very
rare. In our days this animal has again reappeared in large numbers, although by
no means so numerous or so dangerous as in the times of Olaus Magnus. Another
animal, the Vesperiilio noclula, the largest of the Swedish bats, was formerly not
found in Sweden, and was unknown to Linnaeus. Retzius of Stockholm (who likewise
has published a 'Fauna Suecica') never saw this species; and Nilsson, during the
first ten years ho collected the materials for his Swedish fauna, never met the animal
either alive or in any of the Swedish museums. But a very few years after the pub
lication of Nilsson 's ' Fauna Suecica,' or about the year 1825, the Vesperiilio noclula
made its appearance in the south of Sweden, and has become numerous in the walls
of the ancient cathedral of Lund. This has formerly been the case ; and during
some late repairs to the cathedral, a number of very ancient bones and skeletons
of bats, the greater part of which belonged to the Vesperiilio noclula, were discovered

in a hole in the old walls. It is very clear that these bones must have remained in

the walls about 700 years, and at a time when the animal was very frequent in
Sweden. Since that date it vanished from the country, and has again in our time

reappeared.
    Among birds, the same periodical change takes place. The Motacilla alba was

thirty years ago very numerous in Sweden, has since vanished, and again reap
peared. The Pyrrhula vulgaris has, as far back as Nilsson remembers, been very
common in' Scania every winter ; but during the last three winters not a single ex
ample of this little friendly guest has been seen near Lund.

species of brevipennate birds, all of which were speedily destroyed by the early
colonists. Mauritius was the birth-place of the Dodo, the 6rst notice of which was
not, as erroneously stated, by Vasco deGama (who never visited Mauritius), but by-
Van Neck, a Dutchman, in 1598- Several successive voyagers mentioned the bird,
down to Cauche in 1633, and in the latter year a live specimen was brought to Lon
don, and was described by  Sir Hamon                           The pictorial evidence respecting
the Dodo consists of four  oil-paintings  L;c--stroannegein.  the British Museum without the

artist's name, one at the Hague, another at Berlin by Roland Savery, and one
at Oxford by John Savery his nephew. All these are evidently from one design,
and may have been drawn from a specimen which Van Neck brought to Holland.
The oiteological evidence* of the Dodo consist of the foot in the British Museum, the
head and foot at Oxford, and a head lately discovered at Copenhagen. The three
former specimens were exhibited, and a cast of the latter had also been sent for the
meeting, but was detained by the vexatious formalities of the London Custom

house.

The Oxford head and foot have been recently dissected, and from the characters
thus exposed it is certain that the Dodo was not related either to the gallinaceous
birds, the ostriches, or the vultures, as others have conjectured, but is closely allied
to the pigeons. With the exception of its short wings, it approaches greatly to the
Treront or fruit-pigeons, and still more to the DidunculuM, a kind of pigeon from the
Samoan Islands, of which the only specimen in Europe was exhibited at the meet
ing. The author supposed that the Dodo fed upon the cocoa-nuts, mangos, and

other fruits which in tropical forests fall from the trees at all seasons of the year.
The lecturer then drew attention to the island of Rodriguez, visited in 1691 by
Leguat, who has given a description and figure of a brevipennate bird which he

calls the Solitaire. Several bones of this bird from the museums of Paris and of
Glasgow were on the table, and a comparison of them with those of the Dodo clearly
proved that the Solitaire was an allied but distinct species, longer legged than the

Dodo, and related like it to the pigeons. It was next shown from the narratives of
several voyagers that the island of Bourbon was also formerly inhabited by two
species of short- winged birds, of the same abnormal group as the Dodo and the So
litaire. Unfortunately we have as yet no osseous remains of these birds from Bour
bon, but they might doubtless be procured from the caves and alluvial deposits of
that island ; and by similar researches in Mauritius and Rodriguez the entire skele
tons of this remarkable family of extinct birds might be reconstructed. In conclu
sion the lecturer expressed his obligations to the directors of the public museums of
Paris, Copenhagen, London, Glasgow and Oxford, who had contributed bones of the

Dodo and the Solitaire for exhibition to the meeting.
   In the sectional meeting Mr. H. E. Strickland pointed out the various characters,
external and internal, which prove the Dodo to be an aberrant genus of the family
Columbidee, and to have no connexion whatever with the Vultures. His arguments
were chiefly drawn from the form of the beak, the position of the nostrils, the form
of the palatine bones, of the nasal fissures and of the zygomatic bones, the muscu
lar gizzard, the shape of the feet, the structure of the calcaneal processes, and of the
posterior metatarsal, all which closely agree with the Pigeons, and especially with
the genus Treron.

    On certain Blind Species of Insects. By J. O. Westwood, F.L.S.

After alluding to the physiological interest possessed by those species of animals
which are deficient of the organs of one or more of the senses which are enjoyed by
the majority of the species throughout the classes of which they are members, and
to the necessity for investigating the habits of such species, so as to discover the
peculiarities which are concurrent with such deficiency of any organ of sense, Mr.

Westwood mentioned the rare occurrence of the want of organs of sight in the annu-
lose animals, alluding to the recent discovery of a blind Macrourous Crustacean (Calo-
caris Macandreee, Bell, Brit. Crust, p. 233), and to two other blind species commu

nicated by W.Thompson to the British Association on the preceding day; also to
the singular discovery of various blind species of hexapod insects in the mammoth
caves of Kentucky, and in the caves of Styria, where the Proteus anguinus occurs ;
to the Anommatus terricola of Wesmael, the Anophlhalmus Langclandii of Aube, and
to two species of ants, also blind, one of which he has described under the name of

Typhlopone fulva, and had placed it in the family Formicidse, a situation which had
been since disputed by Mr. Shuckard, but which Mr. Westwood had clearly deter
mined by the examination of other allied genera of ants, as well as of the other blind
ant which he exhibited to the meeting, and which from its singular habits (as de
scribed   by Mr.               the Transactions of the Entomological Society,
         p. 1) is  Savage  in  western tropical Africa under the name of the                    vol. v.

From the circumstance that this species is very sensitive to the rays of the sun, Mr.
Westwood suggested the possibility of the existence of the rudiment of the optic
nerve beneath the corneous integument of the sides of the head.

Three distinct cells enter into the formation of the stomata of this plant. Two of

these are like the ordinary stoma-cells, being, during the open condition of the stoma,
cresccntic with the concave surfaces opposed, while the third is an elongated cell
which runs round the other two, completely surrounding them, except in a very
small space, which remains exposed at one extremity of the long axis of the stoma.
This open part of the peristomatic cell is invariably turned in a direction opposite
to that of the base of the frond.

The subject of this communication is to be found in the form of minut» gelatinous
patches on the submersed stems of certain water-plants. When examined under the
microscope, these patches may be seen to consist of radiating, dichotomously-
branched, prostrate filaments adhering in their entire length to the surface on which
they are developed and composed each of a single series of cells flattened on the ad

herent surface, and convex on the free, where they are also much contracted at the

articulations. The branches are approximated, and the centre of the upper or free
surface of almost every cell gives origin to a short vertical filament which is formed
of a single series of cells not contracted at the articulations.  The whole plant is
enveloped like Chcetoplwra in a mucous investment. Its affinities to this genus are

indeed sufficiently obvious, while its relations to Coleochiele are also well-marked.

On Friday, at 3 o'clock, after the sectional meetings were concluded. Dr. Daubeny
gave a lecture at the Botanic Garden in explanation of the researches he had been
carrying on there at various times on subjects connected with Vegetable Physiology
and Agricultural Chemistry, and of the Apparatus by means of which they were

conducted.

    He first detailed the experiments, instituted by him prior to the year 1836, on the
action of the different rays of the spectrum upon growing plants, determined by
transmitting light through coloured glasses, the effect of which glasses upon the
sunbeam had been first determined.
It appeared from the results obtained, that the value of the ray in stimulating the
functions of plants was in proportion to its illuminating rather than to its heating or
its chemical influence, a conclusion at that time opposed to the experiments of Sen-
                                                                          The functions so influenced

were, --

1. The decomposition of carbonic acid and the consequent evolution of oxygen,
always however accompanied in his experiments with more or less nitrogen.
   2. The production of the green colour of the leaves.

3. The expanding or unfolding of the leaves, and the existence of that excitability
which belongs to the sensitive plant.

4. The evolution of water from the leaves.

5. The absorption of the same by the roots.
The second train of experiments carried on within the garden related to the pro
portion between the amount of oxygen expired by the leaves of plants during sun
shine, and that of the carbonic acid emitted from all parts of a plant at other times.
Priestley and Saussure had concluded that the balance was in favour of the former
process ; Ellis, on the contrary, had inferred from his experiments, that the latter

might after all exceed the former in its influence upon the atmosphere.
By means of an apparatus of simple construction, in which the plant was con
fined within a bell-jar of pretty ample dimensions, and in which portions of the air
contained in it might at any time be withdrawn for examination, Dr. Daubeny suc
ceeded iu satisfying himself that the air of the jar contained a greater and greater
per-centage of oxygen the longer the plant was confined within
                                                                          by                                       re

Dr. Daubeny then explained the nature of the agricultural experiments which he

in the room, did not upon the whole tend to confirm the theory of the excretory-
function of the roots which had been espoused by Prof. P. Decandolle and Mons.
Macaire of Geneva, but showed that the deficiency in the soil of organic matter,
fitted for supplying plants with carbonic acid and ammonia, caused by continued
cropping, contributed to that falling off in the amount of produce which was esta
blished in both instances, but especially where the crop was permanent ; and that so
far as the same was dependent upon a diminution in the phosphatic and alkaline
ingredients originally present in the soil, the deficiency consisted solely in that por
tion of their amount which had been in a state to be taken up readily by the vessels
of the plant, or in what he would call an available condition, the quality of the same
locked up within the soil, or in a state of aggregation such as enabled them to resist

the ordinary agents of decomposition, being to the last amply sufficient for many suc
cessive crops of the most exhausting kind.

    After these explanations the party proceeded to the Experimental Garden, where
the Professor pointed out the apparatus and the plots which he had employed, and
likewise showed in a contiguous building the dep6t of seeds kept for the British As
sociation, intended to serve towards the elucidation of the relative degree of vitality
which different species or genera may possess, deduced from determining the utmost
limit of time to which they severally retain their power of germination.

On the Anatomy of Monocotyledonous Stems. By Arthur Henfrey.
Hitherto he had not been enabled to follow out the structure in exotic forms, and

the present paper was almost wholly confined to the description of the principal
modifications found in natives of this country.
The result of his inquiries is the confirmation of Schleiden's opinion, that the
character founded on the nature of the fibro-vascular bundles is the only universal
mark of distinction between the stems of dicotyledons and monocotyledons.
The distinction between the two classes of forms having developed or non-developed
internodes, as established also by Schleiden,   was substantiated. Among
class are two modifications ; the first where,                                              the  second
                                                as in the tulip, crocus, &c,                the   leaves
pass off from the base of the stem ; the second where, as in the lily, &c, the upper
portions of the fibro-vascular bundles going to the leaves remain united together more
or less, forming an ascending stem giving off the leaves at intervals. The asparagus
differs only by giving off branches. In these cases the ascending stem is to be
looked upon rather as a flowering branch. The stems at the bases of the bulbs are
alike in both of these modifications. Of those forms having the internodes developed
we have the grasses, with which Tradescantia is almost identical, differing chiefly in
being solid. The points where the leaves pass off are true nodes, and these nodes
are to be compared to bulbs. In Sparganium ramosum, the branching rhizome affords
an intermediate form, in which the nodes become completely like bulbs. This view is

supported by the production of roots at the nodes and the capability of being grafted,
which grasses have lately been shown to possess.
   The indigenous bulbs and rhizomes were shown to possess the three regions de-
described by Mohl in the Palm, namely, the cortical, the central, and the interme

diate fibro-vascular layer, in which the bundles of the stem lose themselves, and from
which those of the roots arise. Drawings were exhibited of the development of the
buds in Sparganium ramosum, which fully confirmed the now generally-received view
of the course of the vascular bundles, that they all lie above and outside those pre
ceding them.
                                                 >
The structure of Tamus and Smilax was alluded to; and the author stated that
these have closed bundles like other monocotyledons, and that the woody ring was
due to a peculiar development of the cellular tissues of the central region, which also
occurs in a slight degree in the lily, crown imperials, &c. Fibrous bundles exactly
resembling liber were described as existing in the cortical layer of Sparganium.

84 REPORT 1847.

   The waters, and especially the newly-formed ice of the whole Antarctic Ocean,
between the parallels of C0° and 80° south, were found by the author to abound in
an order of organisms, whose true nature had until very recently been disputed ; but
which the recent discoveries of Mr. Thwaites in England had proved to belong to
the vegetable kingdom. This order occurred in such countless myriads as to stain
the sea everywhere of a pale ochreous brown, in some cases causing the surface of
the ocean, from the locality of the ships, as far as eye could reach, to assume a
pale brown colour. Though peculiarly abundant in the Icy Sea, these plants are
probably uniformly dispersed over the whole ocean, but being invisible from their
minuteness, can only be recognized when washed together in masses, and contrasted
with some opake substance. They were invariably found in the stomachs of Salpa
and other sea animals, in all latitudes between that of the north tropic and the
highest parallel attained by the Antarctic Expedition. Many processes were em
ployed for obtaining the species, which on being brought to Europe were placed in
the hands of Prof. Ehrenberg of Berlin for examination and publication. A con
sideration of the results of l'rof. Ehrenberg's examination, and of his own observa
tions on these plants, has led Dr. Hooker to the following very curious results : --

   1. That a vegetation, very different from Lichens, Mosses, &c. (orders which had
hitherto been supposed to comprise the most antarctic vegetables) abounds on the
waters of the antarctic circle, the species apparently increasing in number with the
latitude up to the highest point attained by man.

   2. That on this vegetation the whole of the animal kingdom, which swarms in the
waters of the Antarctic Ocean, perhaps ultimately depends for its existence. It main
tains that balance between the animal and vegetable kingdom which prevails through
all other latitudes; probably also purifying the vitiated atmosphere, as plants of a
higher order do in more temperate regions.

   3. The genera and species of Diatomacem collected within the antarctic circle are
not all peculiar to those latitudes ; on the contrary, some of the latter occur in every
country between Spitsbergen and Victoria Land. Others, or even some of these,
have been recopnized by l'rof. Ehrenberg as occurring fossil in both Americas, the
south of Europe and north of Africa, in Tripoli stone and in volcanic ashes ejected
by living and extinct volcanos ; whilst others again have been found floating in the
atmosphere that overhangs the Tropical Atlantic : for Mr. Darwin, during the voyage
of the Beagle, collected an impalpable dust, which fell on Captain Fitzrov's ship
when to the west of the Cape de Verd Islands, and which on examination was
proved to consist of the remains of DiatomacecE, including species common in the
antarctic regions.

    4. The death and decomposition of this antarctic vegetation are gradually producing

a submarine deposit or bank of vast dimensions. This bank consists mainly of the
shields (the siliceous coatings of the cells) of Dialomacete intermixed with Infusoria
and inorganic matter. Its position is from the T6th to the 78th degree of south lati

tude, and between the meridians of 1G5 east and 160 west longitude, thus occupying
an area of 400 miles long by 120 wide. All the soundings taken over this deposit
were in the finest green mud occasionally mixed with sand, at a depth of between
200 and 400 fathoms. The lead sometimes sank two feet into this pasty deposit,
and on examination of what it brought up, showed the bottom to consist in a great
measure of the remains of the species now living on the surface.

   5. This deposit may be regarded as resting on the shores of Victoria Land and Bar
rier, and hence on the submarine flapks of Mount Erebus, an active volcano upwards
of 12,000 feet high. Knowing as we do that Infusoria, Diatomacea>, and other organic
constituents, enter into the formation of the pumice and ashes of other volcanos, and

are still recognizable in those minerals, it is perhaps not unreasonable to conjecture,
that the subterranean and subaqueous forces, which keep Mount Erebus in activity,
may open a direct communication between this Diatomaceous deposit and its volcanic
fires.

  6. The Diatomaceous deposit flanks the whole length of Victoria Barrier, a glacier of

ice 400 miles long, whose seaward edge floats in the ocean, whilst its landward is
extended in one continuous sweep from the crater of Mount Erebus, and other moun
tains of Victoria Land, to the sea. The progressive motion of such a glacier, and
accumulation of snow on its surface, must result in its interference with the deposit

Dr. Gamier has been in the habit of growing the Canna Indica in larger quantities
out of doors, several beds being rilled with it alone. The importance necessarily
due to any article possessing dietetic properties, at a season when so much anxiety
has arisen from a fear of scarcity, led me to trespass on Dr. Garnicr's attention
in order to ascertain how far the roots of the Canna Indica would

West Indies, as a nutritious article of diet, and strongly recommended to the invalid
in lieu of the fiecula of the Maranta arundinacea or Arrowroot. I am indebted to
the great kindness of Dr. Gamier for a supply of the roots of the Canna Indica from

Bishopstoke, and my experiments were made on the produce of one bed about ten
feet in diameter, which furnished twenty-four roots. The plants had grown about
five feet high. The roots when first received weighted 49lbs, on being washed and

   Upon examining some of the Tous les Mois from a respectable chemist, I found it
to contain particles .so different to those described by Pereira and others, that I sent
to Messrs. Hickson and Son for some, and find it a totally different preparation ; it

appears composed principally of starch globules, which, like those also of the Canna

Indica, are larger than the arrowroot. I made a jelly from each, by mixing 1 dram
of the powder with 3 oz. of cold water, and then bringing them to the boiling-point ;
upon standing a day, I am disposed to think the firmness of the jelly is rather in
favour of the two latter over the arrowroot.
   To institute a series of experiments on the comparative nutritious properties of
these fiecula, would require a considerable larger quantity than I can procure, and a
careful investigation over some long period of time ; but I have thought any one link
added to the chain of nutritive articles might deserve a short attention from the
members of the British Association, at any rate afford interest to the botanist, from

the circumstance of a treatment adopted towards the cultivation of the Canna Indica
in this country being very unusual, and, in the hands of Dr. Gamier, for some years
most eminently successful.

                          On the Plant which yields Gutta Percha.
                        By Edwin Lankester, M.D., F.R.S.
   This plant is a tree, a native of Singapore, Johore and Coti, also at the south-east
of Borneo, and at Sarawak. From an examination of the leaves alone the late W.
Griffiths had supposed it to belong to the Sapotads. The Rev. E. White, who had

seen the flowers and fruit, which consisted of a calyx with six sepals, a monopetal-
ous corolla, six-cleft with twelve stamens, and a superior ovary, referred it to either
Ebenads or Sapotads. From an examination of a plant collected by Mr. Jobb in the
herbarium of Mr. Fielding of Lancaster, the author could not reconcile the plant
with either of these orders. Sir William Hooker had referred it to the Sapotads and
to the genus Bassia*. Small portions of the wood of the tree had been sent with
 Mr. Lobb's specimens, from which it appeared that the Gutta percha was deposited

in layers in the wood of the tree. It was first introduced to the notice of the British

 public by Dr. Montgomery, who had observed it to be used by the Malays for making

 the handles of knives, axes, and the like. It had however been long imported into

 this country in the form of whips and elastic sticks, which had been regarded as
 varieties of caoutchouc. In chemical composition gutta percha was identical with
 caoutchouc. Its most remarkable physical property was that of becoming quite soft
 at the temperature of boiling water, without being in any way adhesive, and on cool

 ing it recovered its primitive hardness. It is insoluble in water and alcohol, but

 soluble in scther, turpentine and the volatile oils. As the supply of this substance is
 large its applications will be probably very extensive. The Malays use it for many

 of the purposes of wood and bone. The Chinese use it for sticks and whips. In

 this country it had already been employed with success as a substitute for leather in
 making mill-bands, and thus it could be probably employed for any other purpose
 to which leather is applied. Its property of softening by heat without sticking ren
 dered it susceptible of impressions, and it could be used for copying seals, imitating
 carved wood, and all the purposes of moulding.

             On the Vitality of Potato Seeds. By John D. Murray.

     In 1832 or 1833 a portion of ground in my garden, which had produced a crop of
 potatoes, was trenched to the depth of eighteen inches, and after bearing various
 crops for several years after, was turned into a flower garden and covered with turf,
  which was kept regularly mown. After having been kept as a flower garden for
 eight or nine years, I this spring turned it again into a kitchen garden, and for that
 purpose agnin had it trenched eighteen inches deep and sown with beet-root. About
  a month ago, when weeding and thinniug the beet-root, I observed that a considera
  ble number (perhaps thirty plants) of seedling potatoes had sprung up. They were
  spread irregularly over the whole piece of ground, a few being in the rows with the
 beet-root, but the greater part in the intervals between the drills. When I last saw
  them (about three weeks ago) they were looking very healthy, and exhibited con
  siderable variety in the shape of the leaves. I have no doubt that they are the pro
  duce of seed from the crop in 1832 or 1833, which had been allowed to ripen on the
  ground, and the seed having been buried eighteen inches deep had remained dormant
  until brought again to the surface by the trenching this spring.

     * Sir William Hooker has recently received perfect specimens of this plant from India,
  n drawing of which will be shortly published in the Journal of Botany. There can be no
  doubt of its belonging to the Sapotads, and being a species of the genus Isonandia, Wight.

On Conjugation in the Diatomaceae. By G. H. K. Thwaites.

   In the early part of last month (May 2) the author had the good fortune to
discover examples of Eunotia turgida, Ehrenberg, exhibiting in a most satisfactory
manner the process of conjugation in its various stages ; not long afterwards he de
tected Cocconema lanceolalum, Ehr., Gomphonema minutusimum, Agardh, and Gom-

phonema         ? (Sphenella vulgaris, Kiitzing, ?) in the same interesting condition.
In all the above-named species the process of conjugation is very similar, and in its
essential character corresponds exactly with what takes place in the Conjugates and
Desmidiece. At the commencement of the process the frustules are seen to be ap
proximated in pairs, and in each pair a corresponding surface of the frustules in more
or less close apposition. After a time each frustule splits asunder into two halves
(in the plane where fissiparous division would ordinarily take place), and all its endo-
chrome finds egress and combines with that of the opposite frustule through two
channels; thus two distinct masses of mixed eudochrome are produced, around each
of which a membrane is developed, and in this way two sporangia are the result of
the conjugation of a pair of frustules.
The sporangia are at first cylindrical and short, and their membrane extremely

delicate ; subsequently however they increase considerably in length, so as to far
exceed in dimension their parent frustules, become somewhat fusiform and slightly-
curved, and with their cell-wall firm and marked with numerous transverse striae :

when mature they bear a very close resemblance to the frustules of Cocconema ;
indeed, the sporangia of Cocconema lancenlatum differ apparently in no respects from
the frustules of that species, except in their much greater size ; nor is there any per
ceptible difference in the character of the endochrome. It seems most probable that
the cell-wall of the mature sporangium is equally siliceous with that of the frustule,
but the author had not been able to ascertain this point.
   A considerable quantity of mucus or gelatine is developed around each pair of

conjugated frustules and holds them attached to their sporangia, even when the latter

are mature, or nearly so. In the several species a difference is observable as to the
relative position of the mature sporangia to the frustules from .which they were pro
duced. In Eunotia turgida the sporangia are situated at right angles to the empty
frustules, whilst in the other three species above-named they are parallel to them.
Every one familiar with the mode of conjugation of the DesmidietB must perceive,
from the foregoing account of this process in the Diatomacea, how precisely it agrees
in every particular in the two families ; and, although in most of the Desmidica: only
one sporangium is produced from the mixed endochrome of a pair of cells, still in
one or two species of Closterium two sporangia are always developed under similar

circumstances.

The question as to the animal or vegetable nature of the Diatomaceae may now be
considered settled, for it is surely scarcely possible to refer these interesting produc
tions to the animal kingdom without also including with them the Desmidiea: and

Conjugates, which few naturalists will be disposed to do.

    On the Comparison of theBFyloMraissofTBwriitnaiinng.with that of other countries.

    By comparing the flora of our own island with that of the continent, and also
with a general view of other parts of the world, a more correct idea may be ob
tained of the number and value of the plants indigenous to Britain ; and by con
sidering some of our native plants in connexion with the whole order or group to
which they belong, but of which they are only small and humble types, they will
acquire considerable additional interest. Even the Euphorbia, which is chiefly known
here as a small weed in gardens, is of the same remarkable structure in the parts of
fructification and as worthy of examination as the more highly developed species of
that tribe which in hot countries acquire a vast size and very different aspect. Other
plants of this order are among the most singular in their character and uses. Of
the great tribe Leguminosse we have several herbaceous species, but only Ulex and
Spartium of a shrubby nature. In proceeding southwards we find Cytisus and
many trees in this group ; in the Tropics some of the most magnificent flowers
88 REPORT-- 1847-

belong to trees of this class, and the largest and toughest timber trees also. The
Composite arc all herbs here, but some of the British genera are found developed in
the hot regions of the world, in trees or shrubs, as Sonchus in Madeira, Chryso-
coma at the Cape, Aster in Australia, &c. In St. Helena nearly all the trees are
in this tribe. In other gruups we possess the finest species, as the Oak, Ash and
Willows of our island. Sumetimes (he very same plant is found in other countries
with no difference of character, but in very different situations, in order to find a
suitable climate. Thus, Saxifraya c/jipositifolia, which grows on hills in Yorkshire,
Wales and Scotland, may be found in Switzerland, Germany and France, but in
much more lofty localities than those of Britain ; on the highest Alps, often near the
limits of perpetual snow, and on the mountains of Bohemia and Moravia. In Mel
ville Island, it is in a sufficiently cool temperature on the level plain. Vaccinium
Myrlillus grows on moors and low rocks in Britain, but in Switzerland on the highest
parts of the passes of the Alps. Some Ranunculus, which grow here in meadows,
find a proper temperature on the sides of the Himalayas. In the Callitrichineae
tribe the same little plant represents it in very wide localities ; the small Callitriche
verna of Britain being found in Lord Auckland's Isle and in the Azores, and Calli

triche autumnalin of our ponds or ditches covers the same watery situations in Ice

land. The English botanist may study first in fields and woods of limited extent,
but he will find much gratification in pursuing his researches and tracing out the
links which connect some even of the most insignificant plants of our isle with the
more highly developed productions of wanner climates, or in watching the gradual
diminution of other species towards northern regions, and their disappearance on
                                      ______

                       On the Arboreal Vegetation of Spain.
                  By Capt. S. E. Widdhington, R.N^ F.R.S.

Papers on the distribution and habitats of the genus Pinus were read before the
Association at Newcastle and Plymouth, which included those of the Peninsula. In
his works on Spain, published in 1834 and 1843, the author had treated of most of
the native forest trees in the same country. The object of the present paper was to
bring together the information obtained at different intervals, and in a condensed
form, to give a general idea of the forest vegetation of Spain.
                                      the Oaks,
   The author     commenced with       described       as hitherto on the whole   the least known
and attended      to. The species                      are, -- 1. The Q. Encina,  or Spanish Ilex,
yielding the sweet acorn. 2. The common Ilex of Italy and the south of France.
3. The Q. Suber, or cork-tree. 4. The Q. Vahntina of Cavanilles. 5. The Q. Au
stralia of Link ; and 6. The Q. Coccifera, or Kermes oak. These are all evergreen.
The deciduous section comprises the Quexigo of the Spaniards, for which the
native name is proposed. This species has never been made out or properly described
until the last work of the author was published in 1843.

Q. Robur.

                  the north, or cold   and humid ;     the  middle, or  temperate zone,  comprising

the greater part of the country ; and the warm or torrid zone, formed by the region
along the Mediterranean.
The Q. Encina is on the whole the most widely-extended species, ranging from the
high range of Cantabria, which divides the Castiles and Leon from Asturias to the
shores of the Mediterranean, and from the Valley of Andora in the High Pyrenees
to Gibraltar. This species alone gives the sweet acorns.
The next species in importance is the Quexigo, which is found nearly over the
same range as the Encina, but at a rather higher elevation, and not on the shores of

the Mediterranean. It is sub-evergreen, retaining the foliage nearly all the year in
lower and sheltered localities.
The Alvar, Q. Tosa, is found in the great central range through the Peninsula
above the preceding species, and immediately below the Pines.
   The other evergreen oaks are described as inhabiting various parts of the middle

and southern regions ; the Q. Ilex being the most rare of them, and only confined
to a small locality in the north.

known, peculiar to Spain, till introduced to Britain by the author in 1832. The
P. Pinaster, P. Pinea and P. Hahpensis are spread over wide localities of the middle
and southern region, the Pinaster also occupying large tracts of the northern zone,
and extending through the Peninsula. Of the Abies, the A. pectinata

common and widely spread and in one locality near Malaga;                              is  the newly-discovered

species first announced by the author in 1834, A. Pimapo.
   The other genera are cursorily treated, but require the less notice, as the paper
will be published in extenso in the Ashmolean Transactions.
The localities principally mentioned are the upland plains of the Castiles and
Estremadura, the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian range along the Bay of Biscay, the Sierra
de Guadarrama, Sierra de Guadalupe, Sierra Morena, Sierra Nevada, and Serrania
de Honda, Sierra de Cuenca, &c.

The author called the attention of botanists and others to the procuring acorns
from the oaks of Italy, and other localities of the south of Europe, more especially
of those of the vast forests in the Roman, Neapolitan, Dalmatian and Grecian
territories, in order possible to give synoptic view of this interesting branch of
natural history.if

Since the paper by the author on the Spanish forests was read and the conversa
tion followed took place, has occurred to the writer that would be very desi

rable  such members as may have the opportunity, either personally or by the

assistance of their friends, would contribute to collecting accurate information re

specting the species of oak which are indigenous in the Italian peninsula more
especially that the acorns and plants of what called Quercus Apennina should be
collected and sent to the Horticultural Society or to Kew Gardens, and also that
accurate information should be obtained of the species forming the extensive forests
of Tuscany and the conterminous Roman state, those of the Abruzzi and of the
marshes in the vicinity of Porto d' Afizo, and of those in the kingdom of Naples near
St. Germano, and those which supply the building materials at Castelmare.

servation and reproduction of this structure. Forms of e, in his senses, feelings,
emotions, passions and voluntary movements. Forms of d, in his intellectual phe
nomena, mind and moral sentiments.

   It is important to remark, that in each class the phenomena indicate that the
additional assumed force does not supersede, but is superadded to the prior ones. In

vegetable bodies, for instance, the vital force (6) does not supersede the more im
portant and ordinary phenomena of inorganic matter (a), cohesion, impenetrability
and weight, but is superadded to them. So in animal bodies, consciousness and
volition, the senses, emotions and voluntary movements, which are forms of (c), do
not supersede the forms of a and b, the vital or the inorganic phenomena, the mor

phological phenomena or the weight, impenetrability, and cohesion, but are super
added to them. Lastly, in man, the intellectual and moral phamomena are superadded
to animal, vegetable and inorganic natures. Moreover, as the presence of the forces
is assumed from an appropriate classification of facts, so therefore what is acknowledged
in the facts must be acknowledged in the forces also.
    It is known that the human embryo, when visible only by the aid of the microscope,
is simply a group of cells; manifesting an epigenesis and morphology conformable to
a fixed natural type, and thereby       known to               be possessed of a vital            foerictehe(r4)c. ordB,ut

proof of sensation, feeling, voluntary movements or reason, so therefore the appro
priate place of the early human embryo is in the second class. Before birth there are

phenomena clearly denoting consciousness and voluntary movements, and when these

are recognized, the body takes it3 place in the third class. It is only after birth that
intellect, mind and moral feelings (forms of d), establish its scientific title to the class

of man.

    Remarks upon the Vital Principle. By James Billet, M.R.C.S.

   The object of this communication was to show the affinity of the vital principle,
or rather vital property, to electricity -- electricity subjected to certain influences by
reason of its presence in the animal body, whereby its characteristics were rendered
not so traceable and distinct as when placed in other circumstances.

is bound down to the lamellated tissue of the cornea by fibres which pass into the
four or five more superficial lamellae and lose themselveB upon them. At the border
of the cornea it terminates in similai; fibres which penetrate the sclerotica. Its pur
pose seems to be to sustain the due curvature of the front of the cornea and to support

the epithelium.

The next point noticed is the nature of the interstices of the lamellated cornea,
which the author shows to be tubular, and to form a system of channels having a very

size, and have a remarkably straight course, lying in numerous superposed series cor
responding to the lamella?. They appear not to be continuous with the lymphatics
or blood-vessels, but yet probably serve as the special conduits for the nutrition of
this beautifully transparent structure.

    The author then passes to consider the nature of the connexion existing between
the lens and the outer case, and conceives that u muscular structure intervenes to

which may reasonably be assigned the adjusting power of the eye. This structure is
that gray ring lying between the sclerotica and ciliary processes, and generally known
under the name of the ciliary ligament. The author terms it the ciliary mutcle.

    The posterior elastic lamina of the cornea is described as terminating in a plexiform
                                 in a
elastic fibrous tissue passing  three  radiating   direction   towards                            the ciliary ligament.

circularis iridis.'

    After alluding to the nature of the connexion subsisting between the lens and the
ciliary body of the choroid, the author describes the ciliary muscle as possessing a

decidedly fibrous texture, the fibres passing from the margin of the cornea over the
outside of the ciliary body, and being inserted into that tough layer of the choroid
coat, from which the ciliary folds pass towards the lens. He shows that the muscle
is of the unstriped variety, loaded with nuclei ; that its blood-vessels accurately re
semble those of such muscles ; and that though its nervous supply is very large, yet it
bears a constant relation to its mass. He argues that the motor element of the ciliary
nerves, derived from the third nerve, is larger than the iris can be supposed to require,
and therefore that this structure, which receives a considerable part of the ciliary
nerves, is contractile; particularly as it contains none of the distinguishing vesicles
of ganglia.
    The author next adduces the correspondence in arrangement and structural con
nexions between this structure and that which Sir P. Crampton long since described
as muscular in the eye of the bird, and enters minutely into the anatomy of the part
in the bird, with the view of establishing the identity of the two organs. He also
alludes to the coc/ilearis muscle, as probably an analogous structure in the cochlea of
the car, and which was lately described by Dr. Todd and himself.

   The author then considers what would probably be the action of the muscle upon the
<J'2 REPORT 1847.

internal parts of the eye ; and conceives that it would act from the border of the cornea
as its must fixed point, and that it would on the whole serve to advance the ciliary
body towards I he cornea, and with the ciliary body the lens also; this effect being
aided by the compression of the vitreous body, and the intervention of the canal of
Petit.

Lastly, the author describes the system of divisional planes on the opposite surfaces
of the human kits as more complicated thai: is usually supposed. In the human
foetus they appear to be triple, as in most mammalia ; and in some cataracts of infanu

this triple division has been very apparent; but in the adult human eye these planes
branch again and again, so as to amount to sixteen or more, often running in an ir

regular manner and dividing the lens into very unequal compartments.
    A brief account  of most of the points detailed in this paper was given in June in
the ' Physiological  Anatomy and Physiology of Man,' by Dr. Todd and the author.

The gutta pcrcha, when applied to this purpose, is to he softened by immersion in
boiling water and rolled out in sheets of a size and thickness proportionate to the
object of which the cast is to be made. For small and moderatc-jized objects, a thick
ness of from firth to ^th of an inch is sufficient. An appropriate piece thoroughly
softened in boiling water is to be placed upon the object and pressed firmly by means
Ifof the fingers or a soft pad into all the irregularities of the surface, and allowed to
cool, when the mould will admit of removal.     it is desired to take the mould of a

cylindrical body, such as a long hone, or other entire object, the sheet of gutta percha
may be made to surround it entirely, and the whole while hot is to be firmly swathed
with a tape or other fit band, so that the overlapping edges of the sheet may be welded
together by the pressure. Moulds of this latter sort are to be removed by slitting

them up in one or more directions, and after the object is removed, bringing the cut
edges carefully together and binding the whole again firmly with the band as before.
An opening must be made for the admission of the liquid plaster. In the case of

delicate or very irregular objects, the mould should be removed from the cast after
the former has been softened by immersion in boiling water. In this case one cast

only can be taken from each mould.
This mode of modeling is applicable only to objects sufficiently firm to bear the re
quisite pressure and the removal of the mould when hard. But soft objects, if resilient,
such as the human flesh, admit of being modeled in this way.

On the Blind and Deaf and Dumb. By Richard Fowler, M.D., F.R.S.

   The author commences by referring to the cases (six in number) of persons blind,
deaf and dumb from infancy, which he has seen, and particularly instances two young
girls whom he saw last autumn in an asylum for the deaf and blind at Bath, as re
markable for the great progress they had made in instruction.

   Judging from the mode in which persons blind and deaf seek to inform themselves
of external objects by the sense of touch*, the author thinks that that sense is not
limited to the ends of the fingers and to the mouth, but is extended to every volun
tary adjusting muscle in the body, and indeed that the perceptive sensations by touch
are to be found rather in the muscular sense than in any specific nerve appropriated
exclusively to that function.

   The most marked difference between persons both blind and deaf, and persons who
possess both vision and hearing, consists, the author thinks, in this, that the latter
pass rapidly from the sensational signs of objects to the objects themselves which
excited these sensational signs, whereas to the blind and deaf these signs are more
abiding objects of the mind's attention.

 * See Sir H. Davy's ' Sensations of extended Touch after breathing the Nitrous Oxide Gas.'
                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                         93

   The perceptive efficiency of the other senses besides touch, the author considers to
be, in a great measure, dependent on the adjustments effected through the medium

of the muscular sense ; for if we would have distinct perceptions, we must look and

listen with adjusted eyes and ears.
    But besides this, the author observes, that the mere adjustment of the eyes and ears,

although these organs have lost their special sensations, aids the persons labouring
under such deprivations to interpret the communications addressed to them by the
touch ; and this he thinks is the explanation of the fact observed by all instructors of

the deaf or the blind, viz. that their task is much facilitated if light and sound are

remembered to have been perceived, or can still make impressions, however faint and
indistinct ; for these impressions excite proportionate adjustments.

    What has now been stated appears to the author to solve the problem how some
persons newly couched recognise by the eye objects long known by the touch, and
why others do not. For when any two of our senses have been impressed by the same

object at one and the same time, the sensations reciprocally recal each other.

   It is not possible to have distinct information from any one sense till its impres

sions have been inteq>reted by simultaneous impressions from at least one of the
others. When all the senses concur in their testimony that they are impressed and
excited by one and the same object, we have then, the author thinks, the evidence,
and probably the only evidence, our nature affords of its external identity ; except in
the concurrent evidence of astronomical calculations and observations of the appear
ance, situations and occultations of planets and their satellites*, for he is unaware of
any fact to prove that the mind is perceptive of any object external to our sensations
in some organs of sense. These sensations are a language, and the internal and in
nate ideas by which many of them are interpreted are our appetites.

   The instantaneous mutual recognition by the slightest touch of the hands of Laura

Bridgeman and her blind companions, as they passed each other, led the author to
think that simultaneously with the retransmission of the motor power for the adjust
ment of muscles, there must be also retransmission to the muscular fibres of the mi

nute arteries of the part to increase and sustain its sensibility and contractile powers.

As it is now admitted with few exceptions that the                              blood is the sole source of the
                                                                                -- that the heart (Sir C. Bell's
specific properties of all animal tissues and   secretions,
sixth sense) is the centre of our emotions,                                       the effects of arterial activity
                                               -- and that

accompany the expression of all our appetites and most of our passions, the author
thinks it probable that the attention of the blind to the sensations excited by contact
may be followed by an accelerated flow of blood to the parts touched so as to render

them more sensitive.

    Many instances of this mental influence on the sensibility of parts of the body in
cases of hysteria, hypochondriasis and rabies must be familiar to medical men. The
larynx may be felt to vibrate distinctly while articulating some letters of the alphabet,
but few are aware of this till they have attentively watched the feelings by which
such vibrations are indicated.

those of a horse, the latter not being cloven.

    The foals in question were out of two pony mares and supposed to have been got
by a stag.

   Dr. Fowler however observed, that notwithstanding the testimony of several re

On the Physiological Condition of the Blood in Erysipelas, and probably in some
 other cases of Inflammation. By John Goodman, M.R.C.S.L., Manchester.

   The author having generally used venesection in erysipelas (where admissible), has
long remarked a peculiar contrast and dissimilarity between the quantities of serum
and coagulum in tlood taken from individuals labouring under that malady.

   This constantly occurring difference has frequently induced the author to weigh
separately these two constituents of the blood, and he has invariably found the

coagulum, after standing twenty-four hours, to preponderate considerably.

   The first quantities which he weighed several years ago were, scrum 4J ounces,
coagulum 22 ounces. This has been generally about the average proportion which
he has met with ; and by repeated bleedings afterwards to a smaller amount, or in
proportion to the strength of the patient and the severity of the symptoms, with the
usual applications and remedial agents, as well as by the exhibition of drinks, gruel and

other fluids taken into the system, the two constituents have been gradually reduced to

an equality in volume or thereabout, when the patient has as certainly recovered.
   The buffy coat was found to be no indicator of the necessity for venesection, for

generally the last amount taken would be more cupped and buffy than any preceding
ones, and yet the sanguineous fluid had already assumed those proportions by which
the author could predicate a freedom from the disease. The author has also witnessed
the same conditions of the blood in pericarditis and some other inflammations.  But

his observation has not extended much to the nature of this fluid in other cases,

although he has reason to believe that a similar condition prevails more or less in all
diseases of an inflammatory character ; for the whole profession, una voce, consign
inflammatory action mostly to the plethoric or byperamic condition of the system.
In these, his observations have led him to the conclusion that where it is discovered
that a preponderance of coagulum is found to exist, venesection and diluent drinks
have been highly serviceable ; but where there has been a superabundance of serum,
as in Chlorosis, &c, blisters, diuretics and very trifling abstractions of blood have been

found most successful.

On the supposed Antagonism between Consumption and Ague.
                            By Dr. Groshaus.

The author, after noticing the progress of the celebrated theory of antagonism
between ague and consumption, and mentioning as the result of his personal expe
rience in the clinical course of 1845 to 1S46, that among 115 patients he had ten
cases of ague, four of tubercula pulmonum, and thirteen of consumption (the di
stinction of these two last-named classes of disease is insisted on  inbyRtohteteraduatmhor):,--adds
the following observations, derived from his personal experience
1. In some countries consumption appears not to be acute; it is connected with

very few inflammatory symptoms ; and though it is always a very dangerous disease,
still there may be more hope of recovery than in other districts. In other cases it
may assume a very protracted form, with great intermission of symptoms.
   2. It would he difficult to give the cause of these variations in the disease, but it

appears that this favourable modification is to he met with principally in those districts

where ague is most endemic.
3. In those countries consumption is not so much characterized by that peculiar
frame of body which is known by the name of habitus phthisicus, and as the disease
may appear unattended by many of its common symptoms, so this may have given
occasion to suppose that it is a more rare disease than it really appears to be ; for by
aid of physical examination during life and post-mortem examinations, it may be
ascertained that consumption is a most common disease even in those countries to
which we allude.

4. Still there is reason to suppose that consumption, though always very common,

is not so frequent in those countries ; but through want of statistical facts, this cannot
be ascertained at present.

   5. We are daily taught by experience that those labouring under tubercular disease,
and even under consumption, may at the same time become affected with ague.

   G. Though perhaps ague does not appear in them in so severe a form, still ague
when met with in tubercular individuals cannot be considered as salutary, for we know
by experience that the softening of tubercles is commonly fostered by ague so much,
that it may be ascertained as a practical rule, that ague in tubercular individuals ought

to be cured hy specifics as quickly as possible.

In September last I was furnished, hy the kindness of Professor Edward Forbes,
with one of the living specimens of Amphioxus lanceolatus, which that gentleman
exhibited at the meeting of the British Association at Southampton.
    On the succeeding day I proceeded  to examine the blood of the animal, but it un
fortunately no longer exhibited any
                                       signs of life, and it was with difficulty that I

obtained two drops for that purpose; the one by making an incision into the skin
(having first carefully dried the surface), the other by cutting off the extremity of
the tail. This difficulty will, I trust, be a sufficient excuse for the want of that com

   The blood was thin and had a very slight rusty tinge. Under the microscope (ob

jective £th of an inch, Ross) it presented the following appearances: in both specimens a
number of large irregular pale greenish granule-cells rather more than sVtra1'1 of an inch
in diameter; these contained a few scattered strongly refracting granules, were shot
out into one or two irregular processes, and adhered together into masses. Besides
these there were others having much the same characters, but possessing either more
or fewer granules, so that there was a complete gradation exhibited from those which
were full of coarse granule?, to those which had quite a fine texture without any gra
nules at all.

By the action of water the processes became obliterated, and the granules all
assumed the form of a very pale and colourless globular cell, with large granules here
and there, and a very pale nucleus occupying rather less than half its diameter. In
one part of the field I perceived such a nucleus floating about attached only to a
number of granules, which appeared bound together by an intermediate substance in

three-fifths of that extent. Tliis nucleus was greenish-looking, and refracted light
strongly, while the cell-wall was of a pale reddish colour and exceedingly delicate,
so much so that it seemed more like a reddish halo round the nucleus than a distinct

structure. Altogether, with the exception of the last-mentioned corpuscles, the
blood of the Amphioxus had a most remarkable resemblance to that of an invertebrate

animal, and that in every particular. [This communication was illustrated by figures.]

Statistical  Remarks relating              to the several States        under   the Crown of Den
    mark.                                                              of the  Danish Legation in
             By M. Rudolph                 Bielke, Secretary

London.

The    e--ntDireenmpaorpkulaptrioonpera,t  the last "Census, February  1840, was  2,406,800, divided
thus:                                      1,355,000; Slesvig duchy,   348,526;   Holstein, 455,093;

Lauenborg, 45,342. This population (excluding the Colonies, population, 126,462,
Fero Island, 0,928, and Iceland. 56,055) is distributed over 1030 geographical square
miles, making on an average 2070 inhabitants to each square mile. The duchies are
proportionately more populous than Denmark proper, as will be seen by the follow

ing table.
    Denmark proper, average population per square mile, 1855; Rural districts,

average population per square mile, 1478; Slesvig, average, 2107; Rural districts,
1759; Holstein, average, 2940 ; Rural districts, 2430; Lauenborg, average, 2386 ;
Rural districts, 2038.
   The smallest average population is on the west coast of Judland, being fi81 only;
the greatest, on the small island of Oro, being 5416 to the square mile. The town
population is to the rural in Denmark proper about 1 to 4, and in the duchies about
1 to 3. The births of males exceeds that of females, but the proportion of males to
females alive is as 1000 to 1015, in the entire state. This proportion is changed in
Holstein into 1000 to 986, owing to the number of women who seek. employment
in Hamburg and Lubeck. More than one-third the population is under 15 years.
The proportion employed in agriculture is one-third; in manufactures more than
one.fifth; military and naval service, 1 in 17; paupers, 45 in every 1000 inhabitants.
The number of married persons in 1840 was less than in 1801 by from 11 to 12 per
cent., the reason of which may be found in the diminution of early alliances, trace
able to the increased pursuit of comfort, luxury, and the advance of artificial wants.
The number of marriages dissolved by divorce and those dissolved by death in the

years 1836 to 1839 was 130 and 7954 respectively.
   The number of births per annum was to every 100 of the population on the average

of 5 years, from 1835 to 1839,-- in the kingdom, 321 ; in the duchies, 3 32. The
number of deaths in the same period was 2-32 in the kingdom, and 2-20 in the duchies,
to every 100 individuals. Since 1833, there has been a slight decrease in the pro

portion both of deaths and births. The increase of population on an average of 39
years up to 1840, was 0'83 per cent, for the kingdom of Denmark and 0*89 for the
duchies. Since that period it has been at the rate of 0-88 per cent, for the kingdom
and 0'97 for the duchies. This increase is only due to the diminished mortality ; and
the more favourable proportion in the duchies is owing only to the less favourable
proportion of births to deaths in Copenhagen. The increase is on the whole however
greater in the towns than in the country, especially such towns as possess commerce
and shipping, between which and the increase of population there is a perceptible

relation.

   On the origin and language of the population it was stated that the whole of the
inhabitants of Denmark proper were of Gothic origin ; those of Slesvig partly of the
Scandinavian, and partly of the Germanic and Frisic family ; and those of Holstein
entirely of the Germanic, with an intermixture of 60,000 Ditmarkes of Frisic origin :
the inhabitants of Lauenborg appear to be of Germanic origin, although the circum
stance of this country forming a part of Sclavonia, has led to the supposition that
they were Veudes. There are upwards of 8,000 Jews scattered through the states.
   The language' of Denmark proper is a branch of the Scandinavian, spoken in the

whole north in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, and preserved up to the pre
sent day in its exact idiom in Iceland. In Holstein, the German prevails. In Slesvig,
the Danish, German and Frisic are all found : the German has been gaining ground
during the last three centuries. The Danish preponderates north of a line drawn from
Flensborg or the eastern to Tondern on the western coast, being used in the
churches, schools, and courts of law by a population of 1 15,000 people, or a third of
the inhabitants. In the southern part of the duchy a population of 150,000 use the

German, while in the intermediate space upwards of 80,000 inhabitants, the Danish,
Frisic and German are spoken. In this district, the language of the churches and
schools is German, and the popular dialect with the lower orders is Danish. The
religion of the states is Lutheran, which the king is obliged to profess ; the other
religions are Calvinism, which has 1600; Roman Catholicism, which has 2330; and
Judaism, 8000 followers. There are also 678 Hernhutters (Moravians), and 30 mem
bers of the Anglican church.

The object of this paper was to demonstrate the number of the idiotic portion of the
community ; to state the nature of their peculiarities and deficiencies, as well as the
method of overcoming such defects; and, lastly, to show how, by the establishment
of institutions adapted to minds the most irregular and wanting, public attention
would be advantageously drawn to the large proportion of that low class of minds
prone to, and easily led into the commission of crime.
According to a late return made by the Commissioners in Lunacy, it appears that
there are in the workhouses of England and Wales upwards of 4000 paupers born
naturally deficient in mind. To this number must be added all those placed in asy
lums and living with their friends.
In the county of Lancaster it appears from an investigation made at the beginning
of this year, that of those paupers returned as insane but not placed in asylums, 185

Ifonly have been attacked with insanity, whereas as many as 503 have been mentally
deficient from birth.  to this large number of paupers be added those belonging

to every other grade of society, we become conscious of the extent to which idiocy

prevails in the community.
In stating the peculiarities belonging to this class of persons, all minute description
of the various forms of idiocy was avoided, and the main features, namely, the pre
sence of strong instincts and propensities combined with feeble moral and intellec
tual powers, was mainly dwelt on. The means of remedying these defects by systema
tic training was then stated to have proved successful. Lastly, it was argued that
by the establishment of institutions destined to regulate that lowest grade of human
beings born with strong but misguided passions and propensities, public attention
would be directed to those parties considered responsible, in whom there is a natural
proneness to crime, owing to like deficiencies, namely a more or less low moral and

intellectual power combined with fully-developed perceptions, passions and appetites.

   The facts respecting the supply of silver coin were all taken from (he correspon
dence on the operations for the relief of distress in Ireland, which had been presented
to parliament. The Board of Works in the summer of 1846 found that, notwith
standing the quantity of silver coin they distributed in payment of labourers' wages,

great difficulty was experienced in getting change for notes. In the commencement
of September the government sent 80,000/. worth of silver coin direct from the Mint
to Ireland to supply the deficiency. After the end of October the Bank of Ireland

was employed to import large quantities of silver from the Bank of England. By the
4th of December the banks in Ireland found the silver coin returning more freely to
their coffers. But in the Skibbereen district, on the 6th of December, the paymaster

found it impossible to get silver coin, and from the delay of payment of wages conse
quent on this difficulty, an assault was attempted on one of the overseers, and others
were exposed to great danger, and the entire works nearly stopped. On the 16th of
December a steady and general increase was observed in the supply of silver coin in the

banks. On the 1st of February 1847, the coin had accumulated to such an extent at
Skibbereen and some other places that the stowage of the banks was entirely filled.
Such being the variations in the supply of silver coin, the attempts to account for them
hitherto offered were unsatisfactory. The Board of Works only said the coin disap-

   By the adoption of this mode of payment in a fixed quantity of produce, the So
ciety undertook the risk of good or bad seasons, and Mr. Vandaleur the hazard of

high or low prices.
By the terms of the agreement Mr. Vandaleur placed a large amount of property
in the hands of persons completely devoid of capital, and whose prejudices and igno

should fail, the property should revert to the proprietor at the end of the first year.
The objects of the Association were,-- 1st. The acquisition of a common capital.
2nd. The mutual assurance of its members against the evils of poverty, sickness, in-
firmity and old age. 3rd. The attainment of a greater share of the comforts of life
than the working classes ordinarily possess. 4th. The mental and moral improve

in accordance with the laws, and at the same time to improve the condition of every
member of the Association. The members of the Society were to work as many
hours, to do as much work as common labourers or workmen, and to draw no more
from the funds of the Society than would have been paid them for wages as such.
This they were to continue to do until they had a capital of their own. A regular
account was kept of the time and labour of each individual each day, and at the end
of the week the same sum was paid to each upon his or her labour that Mr. Vanda
leur had formerly paid them for wages. All the profits were to accumulate until the
value of the stock and implements, as per inventory, should be paid off; when the
Society would decide what was to be done with the surplus in future. The money
advanced by Mr. Vandaleur on the labour of the members was in labour notes, pay
able only at their   own store.   thTehfeollnouwminbgerproofptohretsioenrseg:--istered       circulation

    Whenever the member* required article* not sold at their store, they could ex
change the labour notes for cash by application to the Treasurer. But no smoking,
drinking of spirits or gambling were allowed by the rules of the Society. The Dum
ber of adult persons selected for the experiment in the first instance was 40 ; con
sisting of 21 single men, 7 married couples=14, and 5 single females. The number
was too small to cultivate 326 acres, and some additional members were therefore

highly requisite  "  ; but   during   the first few weeks no person would offer  to become  a
member of the        new    system,"  as they emphatically termed the Society.    However,  a

short space of time was sufficient to induce numbers to seek admission. By the rules
no person could be admitted without the approval of the president, nor could he
force one upon the members against their will as expressed by the ballot. They had
also the power, after a new member had lived among them for a week, to reject him

by ballot, if he did not promote the interests of the Society. This was followed in
some cases with beneficial results.

   In January 1832 there were 50 members, and admission was earnestly desired on
account of the comfortable circumstances of the members, which were superior to
those of even the farmers of the neighbourhood. The wages of the members were
as follows, deductions being made for absence from work : -- Secretary, superintend

assistant, smith's assistant, gardener, butcher and mason, 6*. each per week. Plough
men, 5*. each per week. Agricultural labourers, 4*., and women, 2*. fid. each per
week. The labour of the youths under 17 was not entered into the labour-sheet, but
it was found more than equivalent to the expense of their support and education.

   Reports were made at the close of each day of the labour performed by each adult
member, and copied into the labour-sheet alluded to above. Each appointment was
specified and classed, whether on the farm, for the family, or for improvements.

The Society had built several cottages for the newly-married members. They had

appearance had improved. All articles of consumption were paid for as received,
and habits of prudence were acquired which before had been unknown. The aspect
of the Association promised a career of success, when circumstances compelled Mr.
Vandaleur to leave Ireland, which put a stop to proceedings which had exhibited to
the world the possibility of governing the Irish people upon a plan at once practi

           On Education and Crime. By F. G. P. Neison, F.L.S.

   At the meeting of the British Association in 1846, Mr. Neison communicated some
calculations and deductions on the influence of education on crime in England and
Wales, during the interval between the years 1841 and 1845. On that occasion it
was shown that of a variety of elements tested and supposed to exercise some mate
rial influence on crime, none were found subject to any definite law, or to manifest
any direct control on the increase or decrease of crime, except education. The pre
sent paper was read in continuation of the former inquiry, and embracing the period
of years 1834-1844. It was stated that if the term education be held to signify the
culture and elevation of the moral character, it is evident that its immediate and
essential influence is to destroy crime. In fact, in such sense, education and freedom
from crime must bear the relation to each other of cause and effect ; and therefore,
when education is at a maximum, crime must of necessity be at a minimum, so that
if the term be viewed in this light, no statistical evidence would be d priori necessary
to solve the problem proposed ; but if the term education be used in its ordinary
acceptation, and merely imply instruction, it then becomes a fit and important ques
tion, to determine whether education, in this limited sense, has any influence on the
development of crime. The best available test of education in this country is that
furnished by the records of the Registrar-General, which show the proportion of the
persons marrying who are unable to write their names in the marriage registers. By
following out this test, it was found, that in those districts of the kingdom in which
the greatest proportion could write their names, crime was about 31 per cent, below
the average of the whole country ; but in those districts in which the least proportion
could write their names, crime was 13 per cent, above the average. But, lest it should
be argued that in the two groups now referred to, the difference in the amount of
crime may be owing to the influence of some other element than simply education or
instruction, a still further analysis of the facts was attempted. In so far as the sub
ject had yet been investigated, it might be fairly said that a high state of education is
always found accompanied with a reduced rate of crime, and that a low state of educa
tion carries with it an increased amount of crime ; but it still remains to be determined
whether that difference may not arise through the agency of some other element. It
may be held that a high state of education is generally the concomitant of wealth or
more advanced position in the social scale of society, and hence the reduced rate of
crime ; and that a low state of education is usually associated with a peculiar grade of
employments and manufactures, subject to marked fluctuations in prosperity, exposing
those engaged in them to deprivation, temptation and vice, and thus directly increa
sing the amount of crime, which is falsely believed to have arisen from want of edu
cation, instead of the poverty and distress co-existing with it.

    An arrangement was made with a view to diminish those supposed disturbing
forces, by which the various counties and districts were divided into sections, so that

the two differed from each other only in the degree of instruction or education ; and
hence go far as statistical tests are at present available, the two sections or classes com

                      available, more conclusive evidence could not be hoped for of the
now applied
influence of education on the diminution of crime.
This test, however, having been derived from a source partly independent of the
criminals themselves, has led to similar analysis of an educational test derived from

borne in mind that although 33 per cent, is the average for all England and Wales,

there are some districts in which the proportion is as low as 12 and 14. per cent., and
others in which it is as high as 50 and 51 per cent, for the male sex ; but as it has

also been hitherto shown that no reliance can be placed on the mere gross or the
average results so given, it is imperatively necessary to separate the whole into groups
in which the influence of wealth, manufactures, and agriculture is common ; in fact,
into groups differing in respect of education only, so as to furnish a proper argument
for or against the influence which education, under the present test, may have on
the amount of crime. An analysis on this basis was made of all the counties in
England and Wales, and a series of tables presented containing the results arrived at,
from which it appeared that-- taking parallel groups of counties in which the amount
of crime is from  0 -- 15 per cent, above                                 aavnerdagbeeloofwthtehewhaovleerakgien,g--dotmhe,

    Thus far it would seem that the evidence furnished by criminals themselves would
go to show that even the small amount of instruction thus recognised has a material
influence in the development of crime. Were the investigation carried no further,
we should be forced to conclude that since the most criminal districts show a higher

ratio of uninstructed persons among the criminal population, and the least criminal
districts a less proportion, who are wholly destitute of the rudest elements of educa
tion, an immediate inference is, that even this small degree of instruction tends

to the repression of crime. Unless, however, the analysis were carried beyond its
present limits, it may be objected, as in the former paper, that the peculiar results
produced may arise from some other cause than education, and that differences
of manufactures, of agriculture, of wealth, or of position in the social scale of society,
existing in combination with the degree of crime already noticed, may be the real
and active agent in producing the peculiar results attributed to education. In order
to see how far the facts of the case would support this view of the question, an ela
        series of tables                                                                    was presented, of

   From the preceding abstract, it will be seen that in all the combinations or groups
there is a marked difference in favour of education, or, in other words, there is con
stantly an. increased ratio of uninstructed criminals in those sections where crime is
above the average, and also a reduced ratio of uninstructed criminals where crime is
below the average. In the greatest agricultural group it will appear, that in the section
in which there is an inferior degree of education in the general public, and also an
increased rate of crime, as shown in the preceding abstract, there will, at the same
time, be found an increased ratio of uninstructed criminals when compared with tbe
parallel section of the same group, the difference being 8'G per cent. Again, take
the two sections of that group in which the manufacturing and agricultural interests
are nearly equal, and it will be found that in the section of least crime there is S'9
per cent. less of uninstructed criminals. Also, take the two sections of that group
representing those districts of the country in which the persons marrying and unable
to sign their names exceeds the average by 33$ per cent., and is less than the average
by 25 per cent., and it will be found that the former section shows an increase of
crime of about 44 per cent, above the latter, and at the same time an increase of 7*7
per cent, of uninstructed criminals. In this instance, as well as in the other groups
represented in the preceding abstract, a remarkable combination of features is pre
sented. The districts of the country in which the general population is worst educated,
the districts in which the greatest amount of crime prevails, and the districts in which
 there is the largest proportion of uninstructed criminals, constantly assimilated ;

while on the parallel sections of the same groups, will be found those districts of the
country which are the best educated, the least criminal, and in which a less propor

 tion is found of uninstructed criminals, invariably combining. The agreement, there
 fore, of those very different tests may be held conclusive, and to establish as a fact
 that the mere mechanical processes even of education or instruction carry with them
always a powerful protection against crime. As already stated, education in its
 higher sense must of necessity dissever itself from crime, and this eminent degree
of education will long be impossible of attainment to the whole population of any
country; but there seem to be no insuperable difficulties in the way of imparting to
the bulk of a community something above the mere elements of reading and writing,
 at least ; and in this limited sense it has evidently a powerful check on crime, and a
 most efficient means of subduing the evil passions of the people.

   The next portion of Mr. Neison's paper is devoted to an examination of the in
 fluence of education on specific forms of crime, according to the classification given

in the Home-office returns.

   This branch of the subject is considered by him under the following heads: --

                       1. Offences against the person.
                    2. Offences against property committed with violence.
                    3. Offences against property committed without violence.
                    4. Malicious offences against property.
                    5. Forgery and other offences against the currency. And,
                    6. Miscellaneous offences.

    The form or shape into which the facts were now thrown, was done with a view

to determine, if possible, whether there was any, and what, difference in the educa
 tion of criminals committed for various classes of offences ; and a table, from which
 are abstracted the following facts, showed that the proportion of criminals who could

 neither read nor write was highest in class 4, but least in class 5, being nearly 35 per
 cent, in the former, and about 24 per cent, in the latter. Again, the ratio of those
 who could read and write well was least in class 2, being 9-5 per cent., and highest
 in class 5. Those also of superior instruction were likewise lowest and highest in
 the same two classes, being 0'23 per cent, in class 2, and 225 per cent, in class 5.

    The preceding results were for the male sex, and they were found to be in some
 instances exactly reversed for the female sex, as the entire of those who can neither
 read nor write was lowest for class 4, being 31-82 per cent., and highest for class 5,
being 47'34 per cent. During the four years 1836-39, it appears that not a single
instance occurred in the whole of England and Wales of a female being returned in
 class 4 as able to read and write well, or possessing a superior education ; so also
in classes 3 and 5, not a single instance occurred in the whole of those four years of a
female having been committed possessing superior instruction. Tables were pre-

sented showing the relative degree of education among male and female criminals, by
which it was found that while a higher ratio of females were able to read and write
imperfectly, there was a greater proportion of them who could not read nor write at
all ; and while 5"12 per cent, of the females     could read and write well, there was
11°33 per cent, of the males equally instructed.
                                                   It appears anomalous if education be

held to have so powerful an influence in repressing crime, and females being less
educated than males, that the amount of crime is not also greater among the female
sex : this argument would be found based on a very narrow and limited view of
the question. The application of the mere test of education itself will not always
be sufficient to determine the relative amount of crime. Before applying this or
any other test, it is necessary, in order to witness its full effect, that the two groups

compared should be similar in all other conditions, social and otherwise, and simply
differ in regard to the one element, the force of which it is proposed to measure.
Among the various elements influencing crime, sex has formerly been shown to be
a most important one, on the aggregate of ages the tendency to crime in the male
sex being to that in the female sex as '2978 is to "0633, in fact, nearly five times
greater in the male sex. It is not enough to take into view simply the mental and
moral conditions of the mind itself, but those conditions in relation to the external

circumstances and state of society. Sufficient evidence was brought forward in the
former paper to prove that while education remains unaltered or constant in the
country, crime may be fluctuating or gradually increasing or decreasing under the
influence of the altered external circumstances with which man is surrounded, and in

like manner may education increase and become more general, as appears to have
been the case from the facts disclosed by the registers of marriage, which show that
the proportion of males unable to sign their names has gradually changed from 33-7
per cent, in 1839, to 32-4 per cent, in 1844, while during the same years the propor
tion of male criminals who could neither read nor write has decreased from 3353

per cent, to 2977 percent. ; and all this time crime may also have increased ; but,
still it will remain a fact that education counteracts the tendency to crime, so long

as the returns show that, everything else being the same, crime is at a minimum

where education is at a maximum, and that where education is least, crime is highest.

 , The concluding portion of Mr. Neison's paper entered into an examination of the
relative tendency at various ages to specific forms of crime. In the paper read at
the meeting in 1846, the tendency to crime in its aggregate form, at various terms of
life, was shown to follow a very remarkable law. From the age of 20 it was found
that the tendency to crime in the male sex decreases at the rate of 33*333 per cent,
for each term of life recognised in the tables presented ; and in the female sex the
decreasing tendency is at the rate of 25 per cent., but as then anticipated, it will now
be seen that the element of age becomes of still more importance in the investigation,
when considering specific forms of crime. The results thus obtained were set forth
in a series of tables, of which the following are striking examples. Comparing the

It is therefore obvious that the tendency to crime at different ages is not the
               class or form of     crime, and that its relative intensity                in various classes
same in each                          For while in the latter of the above
at given ages  is also different.                                                         terms of life there
is an increasing tendency in class 1 of 20-95 per cent, above that of the preceding
term of life, in all the other classes there is a less tendency to crime at the superior
time of life, varying from 39-01 per cent, in class 2 to 7'77 per cent, in class 5. At
other ages like differences are to be found.
   The importance to criminal jurisprudence of a solution of tnis problem must be
evident. No preventive measures can be safely adopted till the knowledge exists of
the particular tendencies to certain propensities and forms of crime at different ages ;
but with this knowledge the chances of success in averting crime must be greater, as
the means are furnished of knowing in what particular sections of the people the
strongest tendency exists to specific forms of crime.
On reflection, we shall now perceive with still greater force than formerly the neces
sity which exists for a very refined analysis being followed in investigations on crime

before drawing any conclusions. The importance of determining the rate of crime
at the different terms of life has already been shown, in order to determine the rela
tive amount of crime in different districts, as well as to understand whether crime be
on the increase or decrease. It also appears equally important to determine the ten
dency at the respective ages to the specific forms of crime, otherwise the perturbations
of which the various classes are susceptible may vitiate conclusions based on any

evidence resting on mere general averages.
During the years 1834-39, it was found that the tendency to crime was not so great
at 20 years of age and upwards, as during the years 1842-44, but at the inferior ages
crime was higher in    the remote    iylleuasrtsrattheanthdisur:i--ng  the  more                           The fol

It is thus seen, that from 20 years of age and upwards there has been an excess of
crime in the period 1842-44 over that of 1834-39, varying at the different ages from
20 to 35 per cent., and in the former paper it was shown that the tendency to crime
in the intermediate period of years 1840-41, was something like a mean between
the results given in the preceding abstract, and therefore pointing to a gradual in
crease in the criminal calendar of the country within these periods. One feature in
this abstract is deserving of particular attention, the fact that during the recent pe
                               increased tendency to crime at ages                  20 and upwards, while
riods there has been       an  to 20 there has been a decrease of
at the period of life      15                                                       crime to the extent of

14*588 per cent. This is contrary to the popular opinion held on the subject. But

the former paper also showed that all the facts of the case went to prove that there
was no increase of juvenile crime, and that if any change or movement be found in
the state of crime of any particular district, that change will be discovered to have
been promoted, not so much by fluctuations at the terms of life, 10-15, and 15-20,
as by the increase or decrease among persons of more advanced ages. It is hence
evident that over a period of eleven years, ending December 1844, instead of there
having been an increase, there has been a positive decrease of crime at the younger

The author's chief object in this paper was to show that India in cases of dearth in
England could be looked to with confidence for a supply of bread stuffs ; and India
having the advantage of its principal crops ripening in January and February, the
moment a failure of the crop should be known in England in August, orders for sup
plies from the following January crops of India could be sent ; and the supplies landed
in England, even by the route of the Cape of Good Hope, two or three months before
the ripening of the crops in England. Colonel Sykes furnished averaged prices for
years, from various parts of India; but he enumerates very many grains, cheap, nu
tritive, and in general consumption, which do not appear in the price lists, and whose
names even are unknown in Europe, excepting to tbe learned. The first price list
gives an average  from  1827 to   1845 at seven markets    in the Deccan    u:n--der     the  Bom
bay Presidency.    The  ultimate  result is shown in the   following table

Now these lOOlbs. weight of Jowaree for two shillings are sufficient for the sup
port of a man for two months at the least. But in 1828 and 1843, at the market of
Kullus, the average price of Jowaree was 2041bs. for two shillings, or more than
21bs. for a farthing ; so that in those years a man could live for less than a farthing
per diem for meal.      Colonel Sykes gives  various other tables of prices at 53 military
stations in Bengal,                          particularly one from the Saugor and Ner-
                     some for Goojrat, &c,
buddah territories, from 1831 to 1840 and from 1843 to 1846. In 1843 wheat sold

at 1671bs. avoirdupois for two shillings, and at seven markets enumerated the price
per quarter English varied only from five shillings and sixpence to seven shillings and
sixpence three farthings.
The Bengal tables, independently of the bread stuffs, give the prices of beef, mutton,
fowls, salt, sugar, &c. From these it appeared that at some places a bullock could
be bought for ten shillings, a sheep for one shilling, and twenty fowls for two shillings j
salt vatied exceedingly in price from 5}ibs. for two shillings at Calcutta to 49^-lbs. at
Cuttack; the averages being 201bs. 9oz. for two shillings. The government sold the
monopoly salt at from 20 j lbs. to 251bs. for two shillings ; and a curious fact was elicited
from the tables, that out of the limits of Bengal proper and beyond Allahabad the
retail price of salt was lower than the wholesale government price; the wholesale
price of Cuttack salt being 20jlbs., and the retail price out of Bengal proper 23f,
showing that there are sources of supply independent of the government monopoly
salt. At a labourer's wages of six shillings per mensem, a third of a month's wages
would supply him with a sufficiency of salt at the different stations, varying from
three months in Calcutta    to thirty-five  months at Kheer in the Deccan, and
five months in Bombay.     The following                                                      forty-

Revenue  Statistics of   the Agra Government, or North- West                Provinces  of
                           By Lieut.-Colonel Sykes, V.P.R.S.
                Bengal.

   The whole of the territory comprising the Agra's government having been regularly
surveyed and measured, and the cultivated lands being distinguished from the uncul
tivated, and the latter from waste and barren lands, a satisfactory basis is afforded for
the statistical data given. The area is 61,861 square miles, comprising 43,937,062
statute acres, of which ?2,340,824 are cultivated ; 10,538,658 culturable, but not
cultivated ; 1,167,610 free lands, and 8,983,373 barren, together with 916,397 acres
undistinguished whether free or barren. The government is divided into six Pro
vinces, Delhi, Meerut, Rohilcund, Agra, Allahabad, and Benares ; and each of these,
except Benares, is divided into five districts, Benares having six. There are 79,033
towns and villages ; and the assessment upon the cultivated land, constituting the
land tax for 1846-47, was 4,039,152 rupees, averaging therefore one rupee, twelve
annas, and eleven pie the statute acre, or three shillings and sevenpence halfpenny
per statute acre ; and this tax is upon lands which produce those remunerative re
turns, sugar, indigo, cotton, condiments, &c. &c. The average maximum in any
district is only five shillings and sixpence per acre, and a rate of four shillings per
acre or above that amount only obtains in fourteen out of the thirty-one districts of
the Agra government. The minimum average land-tax is fifteen pence per acre in the
Hurrianah district. Colonel Sykes gives the proportions of the land in some districts
devoted to sugar, cotton and other crops, and from these facts and other elaborate
evidence, demonstrates the utter fallacy of the asserted oppressive nature of the

Indian land-tax ; admitting, at the same time, that there may be local exceptions.
   The population of the Agra government is stated to be 19,733,742, giving 380.!

souls to the square mile; the average maximum (setting aside the cities) being
599-6, and the minimum 98-4 to the square mile. In the return which Colonel
Sykes makes use of, the sexes are not distinguished, and in twelve districts only is the
population separated into Hindoo and Mahomedan, agricultural and non-agricultural.
The Hindoos would appear! to have the largest proportion of agriculturists in the
ratio of 4,051,484 to 2,148,472 non-agriculturists. The Mahomedans, on the con
trary, have only 507,295 souls engaged in agriculture to 746,826 not so engaged. It
has been usual to consider the proportion of Hindoos to Mahometans in India as
15 to 1 ; but in the above twelve districts the Hindoos being 6,199,956 and the

Mahomedans 1,254,121, the proportion is about 6 to 1.

   The object of the author was to show the beneficial influence of education in less
ening the amount of those crimes for the commission of which men are brought before
the bar of justice. He showed from official records, extending over a period of
eleven years, 1836 to 1846, that while the yearly average number of persons who
were charged with offences in England and Wales was 25,812, viz. 20,969 males,
4843 females, the yearly average number among them who had received any in
struction beyond reading and writing was only 106, viz. 102 males, 4 females, or only
41 in 10,000 accused, and that, on the average, more than one-half of the 52 counties
failed in each year to furnish any educated criminal, while 7 counties failed during
the whole period to furnish any cause of accusation against educated persons. During
the two years 1845 and 1846 that were submitted to a more minute examination, it

was shown, that in 1845, among 24,303 accusations, only 89 were against educated

persons, and that in 1846 the whole number accused being 25,107, only 85 among
them were of the educated class, being in the proportion of 37 in 10,000 in 1845,
and 34 in that number in 1846. The number of educated persons convicted was 45
in 1845, and 48 in 1846, only one female in each of the years being found in the list.

It was also shown that educated persons form no part of our youthful offenders, not

one under 15 years being found in either of the two years, and only 6 between 15
and 20 years. During seven years the proportion of educated females to the whole
number of that sex accused of offences was 1 to 2029, and the average yearly pro
portion to the whole female population 1 to 3,162,453. On the average, only 1 in
110 REPORT -- 1847.

17 of the 52 counties furnished yearly during 11 years any charge against an educated
female. This small proportion of educated female offenders was attributed in great
part to the circumstance               persons are generally either of
or supported by natural   that such     or maintained by the labour            independent means,

and are thus removed in a great degree from the temptations that assail uneducated
females. It further appeared, from an examination of the records for 1845 and 1846,
                                                                    were not   of a heinous

which was imprisonment for six months. In Scotland the proportion of educated

criminals is greater than in England, being 178 in 10,000 accused, but neither are
any of them found under \i> years of age. The larger proportion of educated crimi
nals in Scotland is attributed, in part, to the more genera! spread of education,
whereby the instructed are placed, as regards their means of finding honest employ
ment, in a less favourable position than the educated in England. A much larger
proportion of offences in Scotland than in England is classed under the head of crimes

committed with violence, and this greater proportion is seen among the educated
                                       Its occurrence is attributed to the proportionately

Favourable as the results thus shown are to the effects of education, they are not

more so than might reasonably be expected. In Nova Scotia ample provision is made
for the education of every child born in the province, one fifteenth part of the public

revenue being every year set apart for that purpose, in addition to still larger private

contributions.

the province, and the law provides for the appointment of jailers, the buildings are
untenanted, and it has not hitherto been found necessary to fill up any of the appoint

ments ! People thus educated are enabled to ndiipt themselves to circumstances,
and to provide for their honest subsistence when uuinstructed persons would be un
able to do so. They are also brought to a juster appreciation of the consequences
of their actions, and to see the truth of the axiom, that in even a worldly point of

view, "honesty is the best policy." If one honest course be closed against the edu
cated man, he can open for himself another, and is led to exert himself to that end
by the conviction that he has little to gain but everything to lose by swerving from
the path of virtue. The man whose mind has not been opened,                    ;

Of all the resources of Ireland few perhaps are more capable of affording an ex
tensive and speedy relief, during the present season of great scarcity and want, than
the sea fisheries. In such industry no delay occurs in the return for the capital and
skill applied, and the yield almost miraculous.
The general length of the Irish coast amounts to 2346 statute miles, and on all
parts of the pursuit of fishing would afford employment to very large number of
                                                                               a

abundance cod, ling, haddock, hake, mackerel, herrings, whiting, conger, turbot,
brill, bream, soles, plaice, dories and salmon are those most frequently met with
but several other sorts are by no means uncommon, such as gurnet, poltoch, skate,
glasser, sprats, &c. Besides the large supply of fish in the immediate neighbourhood
of the shores, very prolific fishing-grounds of considerable extent are to be met with
at various short distances from the coast, but to the misfortune of Ireland these deep
sea- fisheries are turned to little or no advantage, as the bonts in use are, generally
speaking, not large enough to enable the fishermen to venture out so far. The value
of the Irish fisheries appears to have been known at an early period to foreign nations,
and their fishermen were accustomed to approach the island for the purpose of fish
                                                                               would be difficult to

persons, has not been spared on the Irish fisheries. Large bounties were paid both

before and after the Union on the tonnage employed in the fisheries, on the fish
cured, and on the fish exported. £270,784 were so expended during the thirty years
from 1800 to 1830, being £9200 a year on an average. These bounties not only
failed to establish the fisheries on a permanent footing, but were, as might be ex
pected, open to great fraud, and many of the herrings exported as Irish produce, only
deserved that character from occupying an Irish barrel instead of a Swedish one.
The earliest record that we have been able to meet with of the number of persons
employed in the fisheries is given by Wakefield, who, in 1812, states their number

to be 9911 men. The next return is in 1821, when the Fishery Board reported the
number of fishermen to be 36,159. In 1829 their numbers had increased to 64,771 ;
but by 1836 they had decreased to 54,119.                                     the number of men
and boys employed in each year from 1843         toTh1e84f6oll:o--wing  were

With respect to these returns it is to be remembered that bounties were in force

up to the end of the year 1829, and the decrease exhibited in 1836 is to be attributed

to their cessation. The increase after 1836 proves however that the abolition of the
system of bounties did not long interfere with the progress of the fisheries. There

is however every reason to be quite certain that the large increase in 1846 over 1845
cannot be borne out, and that a considerable decrease took place in 1846, as a natural
result in the late lamentable mortality and an unusually large emigration. The fol

    The want of small piers and harbours of refuge has been a great impediment to
the employment of a better class of boats, but these necessary accommodations
have been much increased of late, and are now likely to receive still further attention
in consequence of recent parliamentary grants for such purposes.

    The chief occupation of the fishermen at present appears to be the white fishery,
for taking such fish as cod, ling, hake, haddock, &c. The cod caught on the south
ern coast arc said to be preferable to those caught in the American seas, and as they
abound on the banks off the coast, the principal English markets might receive from
Ireland a much better description of fish and in a much better condition than that

with which they arc now supplied. It has been proved that fast-sailing well-boats,

favoured with the westerly winds which so much prevail on the coast of Ireland,
might, in fine weather, carry fish from the Nymph bank off the coasts of Waterford
and Wexford to London in three or four days, whereas the well-boats from the North
Sea, and the north-east coast of Scotland, sometimes reach Gravesend with difficulty
in as many weeks, with the fish so much bruised and injured by the agitation of the
sea as to be hardly fit for sale. A company was formed in Waterford in 1802, for
prosecuting the Nymph- bank fishery, but owing to the mismanagement of the di
rectors it soon failed, although, when, under the direction of a single individual,

two boats, previously employed by the Company, fished in that locality with great
112 REPORT -- 1847-

success. We are not without hope that the deep-sea fishery on the southern coast
may soon become of some importance, as in 1844 the Fishery Commissioners re
ported that at Dunmorc near Watcrford, the deep-sea fleet comprised twelve very
fine cutters, averaging a weekly produce throughout the year of nearly £100. On
the average of three years the returns to one company had exceeded 15 per cent, on

the capital invested.

   Towards the close of the last century the herring fishery of Ireland was of con
siderable importance, but since that period it has materially declined. At that time

the herrings appear to have come closer to the shores than they do at present, and
the inability aud disinclination also perhaps of the fishermen to follow the herrings
to sea, may be looked upon as the principal cause of the failure of the fishery. The
superior qualities of the Irish herring have                                                                                                            are thus

in quality, and bring higher prices in the Scotch markets than the herrings caught
in Scotland ; and in many other parts of the evidence similar testimony is given.
   The English boats from Penzance appear to take advantage of the summer herring
fishery in the Irish Channel. It is stated that about 100 boats from Penzance are
at Ardglass, on the north-east coast, every season, and remain about three months.
Large quantities of herrings are purchased from the Englishmen engaged in the

fishery, at 4*. a hundred, and are cestoid in Liverpool at 6s. to 12s. a hundred. In
1846 a fish factor in Liverpool stated that his sales of Irish herrings, from the 21st
of June to the 1st of October 1835, amounted to £12,237, and another fish factor
was doing a similar amount of business at the same period.

    The salmon fisheries of Ireland were, previous to the passing of the present fishery
laws, in a very neglected state, and the Commissioners, in their report on those fish
eries in 1844, remark, that they never did up to that time, nor do they even now as
a whole, yield more than a small proportionate part of that value of which they are
capable under a proper system. In the report of 1844 no fewer than fifty-six rivers

are enumerated as localities where salmon are taken.

   Frequent evidence of the abundance of lobsters is produced, and the fishery for
them might be rendered a valuable source of wealth and employment to the people.

   In addition to the want of adequate and convenient shelter for the boats, the
absence of efficient means for curing the fish has also been a great impediment to the
development of the fisheries, and to adequate advantage being taken by the people of
the supply of food from that source.

    Government has lately granted considerable sums towards the first object, and
they have also erected model curing establishments on different parts of the coast ;
but for improvement in the skill and exertions of the fishermen themselves, we must
look to the well-directed efforts of persons possessing local influence and knowledge,
who in many instances doubtless have it in their power materially to assist the in
habitants of the coast in procuring efficient boats and gear, and to induce them to
pursue the occupation of fishing with energy and industry.

       On the Origin of the Gallas. By C. T. Beke, Ph.D., F.R.G.S.

In the annals of Abessinia it is recorded, that towards the beginning of the six
teenth century that country was invaded by numerous hordes of a wild and warlike
people. The year 1537 is mentioned as the precise date of their first appearance in
the kingdom of Bali, the south-easternmost province of the empire*. In Abessinia
and the neighbouring countries, these people are called Gallas ; and by this name they
are also known to Europeans.

   As regards the signification of the n&mefialla, the Jesuit historian Father Bal-
thezar Tellezf derives it from the Hebrew ^7l"li *""! the Greek yaXa, milk, because

(he says) they were originally a white people, namely a colony of the Israelites, who
after the captivity and dispersion settled in Eastern Africa between the Indian ocean
and Bali. In Shoa the name is said to be taken from the river Gala in Guragie, a
province in the south-west of Shoa, on the banks of which river a great battle is said

Jto have been fought between them and the Abessinians. M. d'Abbadic relates that
the Abessinian Moslems give the following quaint etymology of the name. When
                                                        Islam, the first chief of the Galla
summoned by Mohammed's messenger to adopt

and he derives from this word the    name by which      these people            are generally known.
                                     ascertained fact
Still I am not sure of its being an                     that "Galla"            is really a          n"attihvee    de

signation. The Gallas themselves                        proud title of

   At the time of the first inroads of the Gallas into Abessinia, that once-powerful
empire had been sensibly weakened by the invasion of Ahmed Gran (Mohammed
Granhe), the celebrated Mohammedan king of Adel. Hence it could offer but a
slight resistance to the new invaders, who soon acquired a firm footing in the country.
Since then the history of Abessinia has consisted of little more than the record of a
succession of conflicts between the natives and the Gallas, in which the latter, though
repulsed at times, have gone on advancing and appropriating to themselves the fairest
portions of the empire. At the present day, the provinces of Enarea, Damot, G6djam,
Shoa, A'ngot, Amhara and Bi6gamider (not to mention minor districts), are all

occupied by the descendants of the invaders. Even the government of the empire of
the alleged descendants of king Solomon and the queen of Sheba, has become here
ditary in the family of Ras Guksa, a Yedju Galla, whose grandson, Ras 'AH, rules at
the present day in the name (and scarcely in the name) of the titular emperor, who
is a mere puppet in the hands of his powerful representative.

   Iu the year 1G21, that is to say, nearly a century after the first appearance of the
Gallas in the south of Abessinia, Father Jerome Lobo met with tribes of this nation
at Jubo, on the eastern coast of Africa, almost under the line* ; and at that time these

tribes had conquered and held possession of Melindah, situate about three degrees
further to the south. From the recent explorations and researches of Dr. Krapf, we
learn that vast tribes of nomadic heathen Gallas, in numbers estimated (but probably
over-estimated) by him at from eight to ten millions, are spread over the entire coast
from the equator as fur as the fourth parallel of south latitude, and that they extend
                            more powerful tribes of the nation                    wcahroamvanth--oseproof

f.bably about 300 to 350 miles
A nation which is thus found to occupy, even if not exclusively, regions extending
over sixteen degrees of latitude (about 1000 miles), must naturally be deserving of
the consideration of scholars in numerous points of view. Yet little is known of the
Gallas except their language, and even with this we have become acquainted only
during the last few years through the labours of Dr. Krapf and Dr. Tutschek. Of
their origin and history we know really nothing positive. And unfortunately the

only sources whence we may hope to derive information on these subjects are the na
tive and Ahessinian tradition;;.
The earliest Abessinian tradition is that recorded by the learned Job Ludolf J, on
the authority of Abba Gregorius, the intelligent native who was of so much service to
him in the preparation of his standard works on the history and literature of Abessi
nia. According to Gregorius, the Gallas arc the descendants of a number of slaves of
a certain nobleman of Abessinia named Mattliaeus, who being harshly treated by then-
master, fled into the districts to the south of that country, where they were joined by
many other fugitives and persons of had character, till they at length acquired suffi

cient strength to invade Abessinia.

Abba Gregorius was a native of Shoa, and in that country the legend, which in
his time (the end of the seventeenth
to have been since then developed     century) existed in the form stated above, appears

                                      with much more particularity. From Dr. Krapf
we learn § that the ancestress of the Gallas is said to have been a wfiizoro (princess)
of the imperial family of Ethiopia, at the time when the court resided on Mount
Ent6to in the neighbourhood of Gur&gie||. This princess was given in marriage to
a slave from the south of Guragie, by whom she had seven sons. The sous adopted
their father's language and customs, and followed his occupation, which was that of
a herdsman. Three of them were named Tuloma, Karaiyu and Mecha (Maitsha),
from whom are descended the tribes of those names. These sons of the princess,

when they attained to manhood, became great robbers; and having gathered many
people to them, they at length found themselves powerful enough to attack the Abes-

siuians, whom they frequently vanquished, and especially, on the occasion already
adverted to, near the river Gala in Guragie. These particulars Dr. Krapf informs us
are written in a small treatise of which he has succeeded in obtaining a copy.
   On these traditions of Shoa it may be observed, that as the Galla tribes were
upwards of two centuries ego, not less than they are at the present day, spread in
vast numbers over countries extending at least three degrees to the south of the
equator, it seems hardly likely that their original seat should have been anywhere near
the confines of Abessinia, the southern limit of which empire, even iu its most pros

perous times, cannot be placed further south than about the eighth, or perhaps the

seventh parallel of north latitude. Hence we may probably be justified in inferring
that legends which attribute to them an origin in the immediate vicinity of Abessinia
itself, are without any sufficient foundation. Or, at the most, they should be considered
as relating only to the tribes inhabiting the kingdom of Shoa and its vicinity, who are
all closely connected, and have a common point of union on the banks of the river
Hawash, to the south of Shoa, where they meet to worship a large tree, called Woda-

nabe*. It is however proper to remark that Tellezf asserts, that the districts which

lie between Bdli and the ocean are the proper country and habitation of the Gallas.
And according to the Mohammedans of the coast, as reported by M. d'AbbadieJ, this
nation derives its origin from three sisters, daughters of Jerusalem, to whom are ap
plied traditions similar in character to the relations in Genesis, vi. 4, and xix. 36. Their
progeny are said to have invaded the kingdoms of the south, i. e. Arabia; whence

they crossed over into Africa by Bab-el-Mandeb.
    Bruce, who describes at some length the Gallas as they existed in his time in

Abessinia §, considers that originally they probably lived under or beyond the line,
and he states that they all agree that when the nation advanced to the Abessinian
frontiers they were then in the centre of the continent. The ground beginning to rise [?]
before them, some of their tribes or nations filed off to the east toward the Indian

ocean ; and after making settlements there and multiplying exceedingly, they marched
forwards due north into Bdli and Dawaro. Another division of seven tribes went off

to the west, and spread themselves round the south side of the river Abai, and all
along its banks round G6djam ; while a third division, likewise of seven tribes, re
mained in the centre due south of Shoa.
During the latter portion of my residence in Abessinia, namely in the years 1842
and 1843, I became acquainted with several traditions of the Gallas themselves with
respect to the primitive seat of their forefathers. The first of these traditions, which
                                      me in G6djaui, says                  that the country of the  (GGainllgaisrol)a, y--facronto
was communicated to                                                        kingdom of Djandjaro
the south -east of that               porfovGinucrea,gieb,e--yonandd  the  the opposite side of a bakr (lake or large
                                                                      on
sequently to the south
river ||), which separated it from the country of the Amharas or Christians of Abes

sinia. The Gallas were then the rudest savages, without the knowledge of any arts,
without clothing, without agriculture, without cattle, even without any food except
the fruit of trees and roots dug up by them with their hands. This description cor
responds with that which at the present day the Gallas give of the Do/cos, a savage
people said to inhabit the countries south of Kafiu and Djandjaro, of whom, as a
separate nation, very strange tales have been related^T. As however the word Doko
in the Galla language means "stupid" or "ignorant," it may be
the term is not used in the same indefinite sense as our expression                            q"uessatvioangeed,"  whether
                                                                                                                    without
being properly applicable to any particular race of people. A woman of the Amharas
or Christians (so proceeds the legend) sent across the bakr a boat, in which were
bread, clothing, a spear, a shield, and other articles. The arrival of these novelties
excited the wonder of the savage Gallas. They tasted the first, put on the second,
tried the use of the others ; and being pleased with them, they crossed the bahr in
.order to become the possessors of more. By so doing they came in contact with the
Christians. This led to quarrels and wars; and the Gallas, conquering their oppo
nents, swept across their country, dividing the population into two parts, of which
the one remains in the Abessinia of the present day, while the other inhabits the
countries further to the south.

   This tradition, which exists among the Gallas of Gudeni, has the merit of being in
accordance with the fact that the former Christian inhabitants of the south of Abes
sinia have actually been divided into two parts by the irruption of the pagan Gallas.
For, at the present day, a Christian population exists in Kaffa and the neighbouring
countries ; though, from the conclusive evidence of the languages of these people **, they

are of a distinct origin from that of the inhabitant! of Abessinia Proper, with the ex
ception alone of the small remains of the G6ngas, who inhabit the valley of the river
Abai, in the extreme south-west of the peninsula of G6rijam.

   The next tradition which has to be mentioned is derived from quite a different
source, namely from among the Yedju (Edjow) and Raia Gallas inhabiting the
ancient kingdom of A'ngot and other districts further to the east It says that the
nation came originally from Hashgama, a country situate beyond a bahr. A cow in
calf belonging to this people, being chased by wild beasts, swam across the bakr, and
when arrived on the opposite shore became in the course of time the progenitrix
of large herds. The Gallas water their cattle only two days out of three, conceiving
that by this means they obtain more milk and of better quality. These wild cattle
however went down to the water every evening ; and Hashgama lying to the east of
                                                                                                                                                               this was

related, I  objected, that if it had been possible for

of the cattle from the western to the eastern shore, the cattle themselves must surely

have been visible ; and 1 suggested the possibility of the fact being, that the cattle
were on the eastern side, and that it was the reflected rays of the sun which rendered
them visible, when under ordinary circumstances they would not have been so. But
this suggestion was not admitted ; so that we must be content to take the tale
as it was related.] This daily visit of the cattle to the bakr attracted the attention of
the Gallas, who justly concluded that they must be wild and without owners. They
consulted as to going over to obtain possession of the cattle, and after some debate they
joined hands in order to prevent their sinking or being carried away, ond thus they
crossed the bahr. Arrived on the opposite shore and rinding the country good, they
settled there ; and in the course of time, as they increased in number, they spread
out till at length they reached Abessinia.
   In these two                                                                        It is                                                         that the Gallai

called by the Yedju and Raia Gallas Hashgama, is in Shoa generally known by the
name of Bargamo ; and the Shoans, who seem to be particularly addicted to fanciful
etymologies, explain this name as meaning literally Bahr-gamo, that is to say,
"beyond the bahr." But this interpretation is open to the objection that the term
in question is not likely to have been compounded from two different languages, the

and as among the Gallas inhabiting the right or northern bank of the Baro that river
                    the main stream of the   Nile, it would result that the signification of

Bar gama
which the Gallas issued must be placed far in the interior of Africa to the west of the
Nile ; whereas the traditions which have been here repeated, expressly and pointedly
state that it lay to the east of the bahr. Brace's information however makes them to

have come from the west.

From the name thus given hy the Gallas to the country of their ancestors, and from
the various directions in which it is said to lie, it may be concluded that they are in
fact ignorant of its real position. Still, this very name Tulu Wolil, or the un
known mountains, may seemingly be regarded as a proof that the primitive Gallas
were the inhabitants, not of the low plain country bordering on the Indian ocean,
where they are known to have been settled for upwards of two centuries, but rather
of some high and mountainous one. And this conclusion is corroborated by the
fact, that as a people their complexion is fairer than that even of the Abessinians,
whose colour as a red race, results from their country generally being of much greater
elevation than that of the negroes inhabiting the valleys of the Nile and its tributa
ries towards the west, or than that of the dark but not negro nomadic tribes skirting
Abessinin to the east. Indeed it was probably the great fairness of the Gallas which
led the Jesuits to derive their name from yaka, milk. And it is highly deserving of

remark, that the further we proceed from Abessinia southwards, along the elevated
plateau of eastern Africa, the fairer is the complexion of the inhabitants of that plateau ;
a convincing proof that the land continues to rise as it approaches the equator*.
From the foregoing considerations we may reasonably arrive at the conclusion that
the Gallas come from a high mountainous country, situate far to the south of Abessinia,
beyond, and apparently to the east of a large river or lake (bahr). Now Dr. Krapf
informs usf that the Galla caravans proceeding from the eastern coast of Africa near
Monbasa (Mombas) for a distance                                                          of thirty or  ftohretyredsaeyasr'chjoeus rnwehyic,hcoImheavtoe  a country

on the   subject, is  no   other than the upper                                               ctohuerseemopifretheofmMai6nnos-tirle/aomezio--f tthhee    N" ilMe,outnhe

    On the table-land   of Eastern     Africa

to the north, dwells the nation of the Meremongao, whose country, according to infor
mation obtained by Mr. Cooley §, is about two months' journey inland from Monbasa,
behind the Wanyika|| . The Meremongao are known to the merchants on the coast
as the great smiths and cutlers of Eastern Africa, and as the principal consumers of
brass wire, which they wear twisted tightly round their arms. These customs of
the Meremongao, coupled with the position of their country, lead to the opinion
that they are Gallas. For, in Southern Abessinia it is the Gallas who are noted as

the most skilful cutlers and workers in iron ; and in Shoa, the inhabitants of which

kingdom are essentially of Galla extraction, the custom prevails of wearing a number
of brass rings, sometimes covering almost the entire forearm from                                                              wrist
elbow, which rings or bracelets are not removable at pleasure, but                                                       the     the                     "tobrathses

wire" of the Meremongao, arc tightly and permanently fixed on the arm by a smith.
So far then as our information will allow us to offer an opinion, the country of the
Meremongao, as a mountainous region, situate far to the south of Abessinia, and lying
in the vicinity of a large river (the Nile), presents strong claims to be considered as
the place whence the Galla tribes of Eastern Africa issued eastwards to the shores of

the Indian ocean, and northwards into the countries intervening between them and

Abessinia, and subsequently into Abessinia itself. Nevertheless, in the present in
sufficient state of our knowledge on the subject, it would be wrong to regard this as
anything more than a first approximation.

Addition by the Author. -- Mr. Daniell haa this day placed in my hands a small

                   people   to be somewhere             about  the equator, and in at least 25 degrees of

east longitude, which would place it in the elevated land in which it may reasonably
be conjectured that some of the head-streams of the Nile have their sources. This
figure has a necklace of red and white Venetian seed-beads, and a string of the same
beads round its loins. Beads of this description are not known on the south-western
coast ; but they are common in the Red Sea and North-eastem Africa, whither they
are brought by the way of the Mediterranean and Egypt This circumstance is a
proof that this image comes from a part of Africa connected commercially with the
north-eastern coast. The carving of this figure is extremely good, and its features,
which we are warranted in considering to represent those of the people by whom it was
made, are intellectual and pleasing, and of a type seemingly Indian rather than African.
The nose is large and prominent, the mouth and lips small, and the forehead tolerably
high and well-formed.             In one remarkable particular the head bears a resemblance

to the ancient Egyptian representations of that portion of the human frame, namely,
in the position of the ear, which is placed so high up as to                                     with the eye.
Of course it cannot be said whether or not this is natural                       be  on a level   themselves;

but the fact that a light-coloured race, dwelling most probably within the limits of the
upper basin of the Nile, should possess this peculiarity in common with the ancient
Egyptians, even if only in their works of art, is highly deserving of consideration.--

  On the Aboriginal Tribes of India. By Major-General Briggs, F.R.S.

   The Hill Tribes of India represent a race distinct from the great mass of the proper
Hindoo population. It is in the highest degree probable that they inhabited the whole
continent of India between the Indus and the Himalaya at a period anterior to the
entrance of the proper Brahminical race.

    This latter people have no historical record of their invasion of India. They ac
knowledge that they came from the north-west, and their ancient books mention that
they found inhabitants everywhere in their progress, living in mountains and forests,
to whom they applied the term Mlecha, signifying impure barbarians.

    The fact of small communities answering to this description, existing here and
there, has been occasionally mentioned in the periodicals published by the several
societies of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Ceylon.

    The Hindoos, following the doctrines of the Vedas, have peculiar customs, such as
rules of caste, municipal institutions, and social habits, which require the absti
nence from certain food, and from partaking of that which has been prepared by
any but persons of their own caste, with other distinctions that mark them as a people
separate from all others in India or elsewhere. Notwithstanding the great antiquity
of this race, and the fact of their sacred Vedas being at least three thousand three
hundred years old, they had not, two thousand years ago, established their power
over the Peninsula of India, nor over any country south of a line drawn nearly east
and west in the latitude of 22° north.

    On the other hand, the inhabitants of the hills and forests are wholly distinct from
the Hindoo race, whilst they exhibit a close uniformity of habits, customs and reli
gion to each other ; standing everywhere in the same relation to the Hindoos. They
have no such institution as caste. Their communities arc governed by patriarchal
and not by municipal laws. They are ignorant of the use of letters, and have no
belief in a future state, or in the existence of a beneficent Supreme Being. Their
religious ceremonies require the spilling of blood ; sometimes human. Their natural
occupation is hunting, seldom cultivating the soil for their own use. One branch,
however, possesses large herds of cattle, which they chase from one pasture to an
other, subsisting on their flesh and milk.

   These tribes appear to be marked in their moral character by an inflexible fidelity
towards those to whom they owe allegiance ; by their contempt of danger; by active
courage; by their love of truth, and by their hospitality : but they wage perpetual war
with civilized man, by incessant robberies, and murder when resistance is offered.

    The comparison of the common languages of India, together with the aid derived
from dictionaries and vocabularies, both published and in manuscript, leads the au
thor to believe that there will hereafter be found proofs of the existence of one uni

form language anterior to the introduction of the Sanscrit. It has, however, been

inundated with Sanscrit vocables to such an extent as to render it difficult to separate
remains of the aboriginal from the learned tongue.

   No satisfactory physiological comparison between the aborigines and the several
members of the Caucasian family in India has yet been made.

in many points from the Galla of AbyBsinia, and resembling in a remarkable manner
the Somali dialect of Barawa. Remarkable also for containing a number of Amharic
and JEthiopic words. This language belongs to a different class from the three fol

II.lowing ; these being related to each other.

            a. The Sawahili, b. The Pocomo, c. The Wanika.
a. The Sawahili is the general language of the coast of Zanzibar, known at present
only through the medium of short and incomplete vocabularies.
b. The Pocomo is spoken by the Pocomo tribes resident on the banks of the great
river Pokomosi (the Maro of the Gallas) which runs into the so-called Bay of Formoso
on the north of Melinda. The vocabulary of Krapf represents the particular Pocomo
dialect of the village of Kallindi, and was taken from the mouth of Hadshi Omar,
brother of Bonnaia Dacha, the chief of the tribe there resident. According to this
authority, the language of the upper course of the river differs from that of the coast ;
a statement which is borne out by the character of the Wakamba language (or dialect),
spoken by the tribes of the interior, and obviously related to both the Pocomo and the
Sawahili. Of the Wakamba language specimens have been sent by Dr. Krapf to
Professor Ewald of Tubingen, along with vocabularies of two other languages not
mentioned in the                                                         Ukuafi), and are

tends far into the interior, and is likely to be of great practical importance in
African researches.

of Rabbai, Keriaina, Kambe, and Dshogai ; the southern idiom of the Wadigo Wanika
tribes differing a little from that of those of the north.

120 BEPORT -- 1847.

1st. The Chippewyans Proper. -- This tribe, probably from their having been the
first witli whom the whites became acquainted, are considered as the germ of the race.
They range the country from Hudson's Bay to Athabasca Lake, and extend as far
north as Slave Lake and the Fish Kiver, a large stream not yet laid down in our
maps, and said to flow into Chesterfield Inlet. The dialect of this tribe is considered
the standard of the ( hippewyan tongue ; which is harsh and guttural, difficult of
                                to the ear. As a language                                    it is exceedingly
enunciation,    and unpleasant  as most Indian languages                                     are, of abstract   meagre and
              not only barren,                                                                                  and general
imperfect --
terms, but singularly deficient in the means of expressing the commonest objects of

nature    ; thus,  there  is but one word   for a kettle, a  stove,                          a spade, a epoon, and  a tin
         because   these  articles are all  manufactured     from                             iron. This character  runs
dish --

throughout the language ; and the poverty of vocables arising from this cause induces
a complexity of structure and a necessity of circumlocution, which barely enables the
individual to indicate the idea which he cannot express. This circumstance renders
it very difficult of acquisition to Europeans, who never become masters of the tongue.
2nd. The Beaver Indians extend from Lake Athabasca, along both bides of the
Peace River, to the Rocky Mountains.
   They range from the head waters of the Saskatchewan to the sources of the Riviere
aux Liards, a tributary of the M'Kcnzie. Their language differs considerably from
that of all the other Chippcwyan tribes, being softer and somewhat more copious. They
come more frequently in contact with the Crees and other tribes of the south, which

may partly account        for this circumstance.  Mountains,                                 we  have, --
    Proceeding along      the chain of the Rocky
3rd. The Daho-dinnics, a mountain tribe, and, like most mountaineers,
                                                                                                                a bold and

hardy race, and    of a   "soMmaeuwvhaaits  warlike turn. Hence the name given to them by the
Canadian traders     of                     Monde." They inhabit the country around the upper

waters of the River Liard.

   -ith. The Strong Bows are likewise a mountain tribe, not easily distinguishable from
the former, except by a dialectic difference of language, which is however consider
able. They present still closer analogies to the Hare Indians, inhabiting the banks
of M'Kenzie's River, with whom they come in contact, between Fort Norman and
Fort Good Hope, where that stream approaches the mountains.

   The fifth division of the Chippewyan family is the Hare, or Slave Tribe, as they are
sometimes called ; who extend along either bank of the M'Kenzie from Slave Laketo
the Arctic Circle. They are in the most intimate connection with the Hudson's Bay
Company of all the Chippewyan tribes, and they show the effects of that connection.
Their condition is the most wretched and deplorable that can be imagined. Canni
         Italmisobstutjujustsitfiehdowbeyvetrhetoexstareymtehatnetcheisssiptyracotifcetheis

tent.                                                                                         looked upon     with horror   by

the tribe generally, and many rather than resort to this dreadful expedient put an
end to their own lives. Instances have been known of parents destroying their o*n

families and afterwards themselves to avoid this fatal alternative.

   They are almost entirely clothed in the skins of rabbits, tagged together after the
rudest fashion with the ends of sinew ; hence the name of Hare Indians applied to
the tribe. They have neither tents nor huts of any kind, living all the year round in
the open air. As might be expected, they are a puny and stunted race, and are ra
pidly decreasing in numbers, and must soon disappear altogether. Y et it is from this
wretched tribe that the Hudson's Bay Company draw nearly all the profits of their
trade in this quarter.
6th. The Dog Ribs form the sixth division of the group. They inhabit the barren
grounds around Great Bear Lake, and extend as far east as the Copper Mine River.
They live upon
the migrations     the rein-deer, which     frequent their lands in great numbers, following
                   of these animals as
                                            closely as if they formed part and parcel of the
herd. They are almost entirely independent of the whites, and present a marked
contrast with their neighbours of the Hare Tribe. They are well-clothed in the skins
of the rein-deer, and have all the elements of comfort and Indian prosperity within
their reach. They are a healthy, vigorous, but not very active race, of a mild and
peaceful disposition, but very low in the mental scale, and apparently of very inferior
capacity. There is no reason to think that they are decreasing in numbers. They
receive the name of the Dog Ribs from a tradition that they arc descended from the

dog.

7th. The Yellow Knives, sometimes called the Copper Indians, inhabit the country
situated between the Copper Mine River and the Fish River, already mentioned, and
thus bring us round to the point from which we began our enumeration. The de
scription given of the Dog Ribs applies also in many respects to this family. In point
of intelligence they seem however to be considerably their superiors. They have a
strong claim on the gratitude of Englishmen for the valuable services they have ren
dered to the different Government expeditions that have been from time to time en
gaged in the survey of the northern shores of America.
    8th. The Carriers form the last division of this extensive group. They occupy the
greater portion of the district known under the name of New Caledonia, west of the
Rocky Mountains, where they seem to he now the only remaining representatives of
the race to which they belong. They may be regarded as an extension of the Beaver
Indians, or, perhaps, the Beaver Indians are an extension of them. They are the
lowest and most degraded of all the Chippewyan family. Their physical condition

is scarcely, if at all, above that of the Hare Indians on the M'Kenzie, while in point
of moral and intellectual capacity they are described as much their inferiors. They
are sunk even below the Indian level in sensuality and filth, and eaten up by disease.
Their principal food is salmon, of which they dry large quantities for their winter's

On the  Nehanni  Tribe  oBfya    Koloochian Class       of   American  Indians.

                                 A. K. Isbister.

    The most numerous and powerful of the Koloochian tribes with which the writer

has any personal knowledge are the Nehannies. These range the country between
the Russian settlements on the Stikine River and the Rocky Mountains, where they
are conterminous with the Carriers of New Caledonia on the south, and the Daho-
dinnies of M'Kenzie's River on the west. They are a brave and warlike race j the

scourge and terror of the country round. It is a curious circumstance, and not the

less remarkable from the contrast to the general rule in such cases, that this turbu
lent and ungovernable horde were under the direction of a woman, who ruled them
too with a rod of iron, and was obeyed with a readiness and unanimity truly mar
velous. She was certaiuly a remarkable character, and possessed of no ordinary share
of intelligence. From the fairness of her complexion and hair, and the general cast
of her features, she was believed to have some European blood. Whether through
her influence or not, the condition of the females among the Nehannies stands much
higher than among the American Indians generally. The proper locality of the Ne
hanni tribe is the vicinity of the sea-coast, where they generally pass the summer.
In the winter they range the country in the interior for the purpose of bartering, or
plundering, furs from the inland tribes ; acting as middlemen between them and the
Russian traders. They agree in general character with the Koloochians, having light
complexions, long and lank hair, fine eyes and teeth, and many of them strong beards
and moustaches. They are not generally tall, but active and vigorous, bold and
treacherous in disposition ; fond of music and dancing, and ingenious and tasteful in
their habits and decorations. They subsist principally on salmon, and evince a pre
dilection for a fish diet, which indicates their maritime origin. Like all the north
west tribes, they possess numerous slaves ; inhabitants, it is understood, of some of
the numerous islands which stud the coast, and either taken in war, or bought of the

neighbouring tribes.

                 On the Loucheux Indians. By A. K. Isbister.

   The Loucheux, or Quarrelers, inhabit the country on botli sides of the Peel, a tri
butary of the M'Kenzie. Ethnographically considered, this tribe is important, being
conterminous with the Esquimaux, Chippewyan and Kolooches. Their language, though
differing considerably, in vocabulary is evidently closely allied to the Esquimaux.
Most of the Western Loucheux indeed spoke Esquimaux fluently, and were perfectly

The Loucheux arc a more numerous and widely-spread tribe than is generally sup
posed, extending from Esquimaux Lake on the east of the M'Kenzie to Colville's
River (a large stream not yet laid down in our maps) flowing into the Arctic Sea in
long. 162° 14' west. They range in an easFand west direction, nearly parallel to
and at no great distance from the coast. They maintain friendly relations with the
Esquimaux in most parts of their course, but at the mouth of M'Kenzie's River the
two tribes are continually at hostilities. With the Chippewyans, on the other hand,
they do not seem ever to have had much intercourse. They are an athletic and fine-
looking race, considerably above the average stature, most of them being upwards of
six feet in height, and remarkably well-proportioned.         They have black hair, fine

sparkling eyes, moderately high cheek-bones, regular and well-set teeth, and a fair

On          the  Lexicography     of the  Semitic    and Indo- Germanic  Languages-
                                          Professor
                          By the  Rev.                JarRett, M*A.

After a few remarks on the advantages that might be derived by ethnology from
a series of lexicons written on a uniform plan, the author proceeded to ofler some
suggestions for an improved method of arranging the words in lexicons of the two
above-named families of languages, and showed how much this new arrangement

would lessen the labour necessary to learn them.

   I. The first suggestion was, that in all lexicons the words should be arranged under
their primitives, instead of being placed in alphabetical order. This i3 seldom done
except in the Semitic languages, and not always in them. 2. For the Semitic, a
method was pointed out of so arranging the words that all the cognate roots come
together, and that these groups of cognate roots are so placed that all words are
readily found as well by a person knowing nothing of the language as by the person
most familiar with it. This method consists in arranging all words under their per
manent letters. The permanent letters of a word are those which can neither be
introduced nor lost by inflexion. The author has in the press a Hebrew lexicon

arranged    according to this plan ; a    plan, that, with a  very   slight modification,  woarpdpli:e--s
to all the  Semitic languages. The        following are the   rules   for finding any

Reject (1) the inseparable particles and pronominal affixes, (2) every tvau and god,
and (3) every letter of the word Heemanta which is not included between two letters
not found in that word. The letters that remain are permanent letters. Under each
existing combination of permanent letters there arc placed, first, all the rrrbs accord
Ifing to the order of the alphabet, and, secondlj', all the other words, arranged also in
alphabetical order.        there are no permanent letters in the word, it will be found
under the head Hcemantio, at the beginning of the lexicon. 3. The modifications
necessary to apply this method to Arabic and Syriac will readily occur to a person
                                      4. The two     next suggestions apply to all the Indo-

The natural order for Anglo-Saxon and English is the same as for Latin, the u>

naturally place themselves under their roots, and that the most difficult parts of the
verb show at once to the learner their probable primitives.                               6. The next suggestion

Notice of the Ghadamsi Dialect of Berber. By Professor Newman.
Mr. James Richardson has brought home from the Great Desert certain contribu
tions to our knowledge of the Ghadamsi and Tuaryk dialects. They consist of two
short vocabularies, one of which has been printed, a Tuaryk alphabet, and the third
chapter of Matthew, translated into the Ghadamsi.              In this dialect Graberg de
Hemso had already communicated a glossary, and a fable of Lokmanf ; but as the
itlatter was not accompanied by a literal translation, no very distinct knowledge of the
dialect could be gleaned from                          Mr. Renouard, however, was able to deduce, that
the language was really a branch of the Berber, in spite of the very strong and

startling differences.
   The third chapter of Matthew will shortly be printed, by the order of the Foreign
Office, with an interlineary translation into Latin, which Mr. Newman has succeeded
in executing J. Almost every word in Lokman's fable also is now explicable, and there
cannot be a moment's doubt as to the Ghadamsi being (in every ethnographical sense)
a Berber dialect, although it is impossible to judge whether a man of Ghadames could
hold intelligible conversation with a Kabai'l. The personal pronouns are modified,

especially by using sh for k : the demonstrative and relative systems are so different
from those of Kaba'il, that it needs close analysis to ascertain their relation. The
vocabulary is not only altered by the introduction of a different set of Arabic words
(which again eject a different set of native words), but when the vocabulary is pure
from all Arabic, the Ghadamsi and the Kabai'l are often quite unlike, and the diver
sity of sounds is not to be accounted for by any mutation of consonants.              In De
Hemso's glossary six words are found, which give the idea that the Ghadamsi has a
development of the verb essentially diverse from anything yet proved and known

concerning the other dialects. They are :

yasekr, faciens                              I yusakr, factus  I sakard, facti

asakran, facientes                           | tuskar, facta   | atkranat, facts :

· Soon after the meeting I ascertained that the Fazoglo of Tutschek was the Zamamyl of
Caillaud. Upon reaching Munich Dr. Tutschek did the same, and has since communicated
the discovery. He has also communicated a grammatical sketch of the Tumali language,
which, along with his remarks on the Fazoglo, is published in the Transactions of the Phi

flological Society.

from the Berber verb yttkar, fecit. Yet the translations cannot be absolutely trusted.
The point of interest is, the apparent change from an active to a passive sense by the
modification of a vowel. A few instances of this Mr. Newman gathered in his Ber
ber (Kabail) grammar ; and we have here a hint, that the Ghadamsi may possibly
furnish us with purer and older methods of conjugation than the dialects which are
more Arabized. All, however, that appears of the development of the verbs in the
third chapter of Matthew (to which Logman's fable may be added), closely agrees
with what is known of the other dialects.

    The columns of short sentences given by Mr. Richardson yield one point of ethno
logical interest. The Berber hitherto accessible has failed to impart a positive
knowledge of the native pronouns of interrogation, owing to the extensive borrowing
of Arabic, even for these necessary ideas. By a process of rather refined reasoning,
it has been made out that one primitive demonstrative particle of Berber is Da, fem.
Ta (which is seen even in the Arabic Dhalek, ille, Telek, ilia) ; that a second is Wa,
fem. Ta ; which are often used with the sense of a relative. Analysis likewise shows
cases* where the element Wa entering words gives them an interrogative force; and
a few individual yet clear instances exhibit Wi in isolation as an interrogative. De
Hemso also has Nitu thillun, illud cujus est? where th may seem to be the inter
rogative element ; but this needs fuller elucidation. But there is a third particle,
Ka or Ki, which enters the system as a relative. Mr. Newman had already called
attention to the formula in Delaporte's ' Tale of Sabi,' Konni k-ayy-idifkan, Vos rd
mihi dans ; or, Vos o2 mihi dantes ; and in the Ghadamsi third chapter of Matthew

there is K\ d yetasun, qui est venturus ; and apparently also tskl means In quo, which

again yields Ai=qui. We have thus a sufficient account of the letter K, which runs
through a whole class of Kabail demonstrative and relative adverbs. But the Gha
damsi sentences now obtained distinctly exhibit as a pure interrogative, Kay, quia?
 Tay, quse? (quid?) ; if at least we may presume on the distinction of gender.

     The word Kay here comes once only, and the translation is unsatisfactory^, as it
is certain that tefrid means A mas, Desideras ; yet analogy puts the sense of Kay be
yond a doubt. With this we must couple the phasnomena of the Haussa language,
the pronominal system of which has other strong resemblances to the Berber. In

   The letters of the alphabet are found carved on the rocks of the Sahara as far as
the Touarick authority extends ; sometimes whole blocks are covered with them.
Their names and their corresponding equivalents in the Arabic were dictated to Mr.
Richardson by an intelligent native. It is possible that the whole alphabet may not
be represented within three or four characters. Some of the letters appear to be
written both horizontally and perpendicularly : they are also written both from right
to left and from left to right. The former seems to be the case with the Arabic and
foreign words, the latter with the native Touarick. The resemblances between these
characters and those of any other nation are partial and indefinite. The most appa

In the year 1838, four young negroes were entrusted to the charge of Dr. Charles
Tutschek of Munich. They had been purchased and emancipated by the Duke Maxi
milian of Bavaria during his travels in the East. At first suspicion and mistrust made
the efforts of Dr. Tutschek to obtain information unavailing. An attack of illness
however on the part of one of them converted this into openness and afTection. The
       discovery made by Dr. Tutschek, upon tli« increase of                                        that

understood his mother-tongue thoroughly.
From these Dr. Tutschek began the collection of vocabularies and the formation of
grammars in their respective languages ; availing himself of a talent possessed by all
four in a great degree, viz. the talent for narrative. The result was, that in spite of
difficulties, both in the way of grammar and orthography, the dictations of these
youths amounted to a sufficiency of material for the addition of several important data

     Ethnological Outlines of France. By M. Raymond de Vericour.

   The present unity of France has gone far to obliterate the original distinctions of
race or tribe. The Northern Provinces retain the Germanic elements of population
and language in a greater degree than the South. The Germanic influence upon the
French language tells most upon the pronunciation, next upon the syntax, least upon
the vocabulary. The Langue d'Oc dialects fall into three main divisions, the Nor
man, the Picard, and the Burgundian.

   In the Langue d'Oc districts there is amongst the common people a strong infu
sion of Spanish, Moorish and Jewish blood.

    Rousillon is more Spanish still. Gascony is Basque rather than Castilian.
   The Bretons are more Celtic than the Gascons are Basque. Normandy has traces
of the old Norwegian influences of the Northmen.
   Provence best represents the remains of the old Roman or Italian population.
   In Lorraine and Alsace, where the German elements are at the maximum, the na
tionality is French.

The object of this paper is to give a slight sketch of the geology of the vicinity of
Stamford, with some remarks on the position of the Collyweston slates, and their
relation to those of Stonesfield, near Woodstock. [The authors here refer to the
already published notices of Conybeare, Greenough, Phillips, and Lonsdale, and
describe the physical features of the district.]

                               Geological Structure.

   The formations comprised within the area under review, are the Upper Lias, Inferior
Oolite, Great Oolite, Cornbrash, Oxford clay and drift. The drift is locally distri
buted, patches of it being observed in many places ; at Luffenham Mill is a bed of
no great extent, about six feet thick, overlying the oolitic slates, and full of nodules
of rounded chalk, flint and other pebbles ; at Stanyon also the blue drift may be
observed with chalk nodules, and so in other localities.

   The Oxford clay is well-seen in   the Wigsthorpe cutting near Thorpe Aychurch,
and is marked by zones of Septaria                 containing fossils, Am. Kotiigii,  &c,

Fuller's earth rock of Mr. Smith does by no means furnish a constant or well-
marked line of distinction between the middle (great or Bath) oolite and the inferior
oolite ; and I am decidedly of opinion, that in the northern part of Northampton
shire, and throughout Rutland and Lincolnshire, there is but one thick oolitic rock

beneath the cornbrash, resting upon brown sandstone, which immediately covers
the upper lias shale." (Geol. York, vol. i. p. 130.)
   The upper lias which forms the base of the series here described, occurs in the
valley through which the Welland flows ; smalt sections are exposed in the railway
towards Luffenham, near which place there is a deep cutting in the same bed, con
taining much selenite, and the characteristic fossils, as Am. H'akotii, A. communis.

                                               Faults and Subsidences.
    It has not been found practicable to trace with precision the faults which have
more or less affected this series of beds. Near Thrapston, however, a slight dislo
cation is visible on the line of the Peterborough and Northampton railway, affecting-
the cornbrash, great oolite and inferior oolite.
   A small disturbance of the inferior oolite near Stamford has been before alluded
to ; and some very interesting appearances of disturbed stratification, in which the
lower slaty beds and inferior oolite are lying at various angles and much confused,
are seen at the cutting near Luffenham Mill and along the railway line beyond this
point. Similar evidences exist near Stamford, and it appears generally the case fat
least numerous instances are visible) that those portions of the oolitic series which
abut upon the valleys and form the lower escarpments of the hills have been sub
jected to some disturbance, the beds having been displaced or brought down from
higher levels, as they do not appear to occupy their original horizontal position and
relative heights. (Outlines, p. 215.)

                                                         General Observations.
   Having thus attempted a brief review of the stratigraphical arrangement and
mineral characters of these deposits, we shall conclude with a few general observa
tions regarding the analogies of these beds and the conditions under which they

were accumulated.

   To the lias clay, with its characteristic fossils and the inferior oolite, here of
limited thickness, but swelling out considerably westward, a new series of effects
succeeds, indicating not only a change in the depositing materials, but in the
character of the fauna; for although some of the species may belong to the lower
beds, a considerable introduction of new species is evident. These flaggy beds or
Collyweston slates which succeed, have been shown to possess a considerable range
in this district, and to underlie the mass of the great oolite, thus being analogous in
position to the slates of Stonesfield, for the correct location of which we were first
indebted to the laborious researches of Mr. Lonsdale ; nor do they differ much in
lithological character and zoological contents from the Stonesfield deposit, or from
                                                                                   ethdeitioCnototefstwheold'   hills, and

nated, indicating a quiet accumulation of the materials, and a condition favourable
to the existence of the testacea (as proved by the various sizes of growth of the
species here allocated) ; for although fragments of ferns and other land plants are
mixed with the shells in some places, indicating transporting powers, yet these may

have been slowly drifted along from the neighbouring land.

At Edith- Weston a species of Lingula, near to, if not identical with, L. Beanii
(Phillips), occurs in great abundance, indicating like the recent congeners its gre
garious habits, and there mixed up with numerous fragments of the Pecopteris poly-
podioides in fructification.
   A concretionary sand-bed sometimes succeeds the Stonesfield slate, and this is
overlaid by beds of oolitic ragstone and indurated marly limestone, which are
tolerably rich in fossil shells, zones of Nerintea occurring in both with Lucina liraia,
Modiola plicata, &c. ; but a marked feature in these beds is the frequent occurrence
in patches of fragments of the Pecopteris polypodioides, a fern also abundant in the
carbonaceous shales of Gristhorpe Bay, Yorkshire. The dissimilarity of the great
oolite series (in its carbonaceous shales) with that of other parts of England is very
striking, and the abundance of land plants, their mode of deposition, as well as the
general absence of marine testacea and the occurrence of fluviatile remains, as the
Cypris and Unio described by Mr. Bean, and other species of which also exist in
the collection of Professor Phillips, indicate that they must have been deposited
either in an estuary or not far distant from the ancient shore. The occurrence of
similar species of land plants as the Pecopteris polypodioides, equally abundant and
in the same state of preservation around Stamford as on the Yorkshire coast, but at

the former place associated with marine shells, seems to point out the seaward ex

tension of these beds and their coeval nature, more especially as many of the shells
here associated with the plants are also found in the oolitic beds of Yorkshire, which
are intercalated with the carbonaceous scries containing the vegetable remains.

That fluvio-marine beds may have existed at all periods of the earth's surface, is a
point for further inquiry ; but at least where land existed either insular or continental,

small or large streams may have emptied themselves into the ancient hydrographical
basins, carrying with them the spoils and detritus of the land. We have evidence
of such conditions during the Carboniferous and partly also in the Triassic ana, and
during the Oolitic epoch similar proofs are not wanting ; the beds mentioned by Mr.
Robertson in Scotland, and the carbonaceous series of Yorkshire described by Pro
fessor Phillips, are instances of fluvio-marine deposits, and are well contrasted with
the really fluviatile or true Wealden so well elucidated by Dr. Mantell, although
this too must have had its fluvio-marine extension. To the beds last described

succeed the upper portions of the great oolite, well marked in some beds by a pre
ponderance of oviform bodies which form the mass of the rock and constitute the

freestone stratum, in which organic remains are but sparingly distributed ; the crash
or rag beds which overlie these last, and consisting of comminuted shells, &c, afford
evidence of greater transporting powers, or of accumulations in a shallow sea ; the
abundance of Cerithium, Turritella, Rissoa, &c. is a marked feature in these beds.

To the latter succeed a series of laminated shales and clays, with layers of shells
(one with numerous Neoerae) and carbonaceous matter, proving a considerable change
in the area of deposition, both as regards the nature of the material and the dimi

nished power of the transporting currents. These beds are interesting, inasmuch

as on the one hand they may represent the upper carbonaceous stratum of the
Yorkshire coast, or on the other, be considered a3 the equivalent of some portion of
the Bradford clay and Forest marble of the south.

                                 ByW. S. Ward.

   The apparatus consists of a reservoir composed of several copper tubes (in the
present apparatus seven) 1^ inch in diameter and 9 inches long, put together like
a faggot, so as to give great strength in case the mixed gases with which they are
filled should by accident explode. Six of the tubes are arranged round the centre
one and soldered into a piece of brass drilled so as to connect them all ; and in this
apparatus mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen and of oxygen and carburetted hydrogen
were repeatedly exploded to prove its safety. The apparatus is very portable, of
small size, not heavier than to prevent its buoyancy in water, and is capable of giving
a light equal to five or six candles for about a quarter of an hour. The mixed gases,

after passing through a Hemming's jet, issue through a small aperture so as to ignite
a ball of lime, producing a small but very brilliant light, which is covered by an in
verted bell-glass placed in a shallow vessel of water, so that the products of com
bustion escape under the edge of the inverted glass shade. In this form it may be
used with great facility in moderate depths of water, the chief requisite being to im
merse it quickly before the glass shade becomes so hot as to be broken by the con
tact of cold water. The gases are compressed into the reservoir by a force-pump ;
and common coal gas is preferred to be mixed with the oxygen gas, the former being
in excess, so that the carbonic acid which results from the combustion may effec
tually keep out the water from the glass shade. This pressure is ten atmospheres.

The coal gas is more manageable than pure hydrogen, the most intense part of the
flame being further distant from the aperture of the jet, and having so little effect in

destroying the lime ball, that it does not require to be often turned ; and the mixed
gases are scarcely liable to explosion unless the aperture be of much greater dia

meter than is requisite in this apparatus. It is submitted that this apparatus may
be useful to divers inspecting the holds of sunken ships and other dark places at

moderate depths under water.

On commencing a NEW SERIES of THE ANNALS and
MAGAZINE of NATURAL HISTORY, the Editors trust that

they may refer, with some degree of confidence, to the contents
of the Twenty Volumes which have been published under their

superintendence, as the result of their endeavours to succeed in
establishing a comprehensive and permanent Journal of the de
partments of knowledge to which the work is devoted.

    Viewing Natural History, so far as the study of Organized

Beings is concerned, as a science each branch of which is essen

tially connected with the others by principles and phsenomena
common to all, it has been the object of the Editors to include
2 NEW SERIES OF THE ANNALS OP NATURAL HI8TORY.

whatever tended to the advancement of the study both of the

Animal and Vegetable Kingdom.
    The important duty of making known in this country the

labours and discoveries of Foreign Naturalists, the Editors trust

has hitherto been to a considerable extent fulfilled, in the great
number of Translations and Abstracts from the principal Journals
and Memoirs of other countries, and in Notices of Foreign Works
in all branches of Natural History, which have been given with
a view to enable the lovers of the science to keep pace with its

progress in every stage of advancement.
    With regard to the Naturalists of our own country, it has

been a source of great satisfaction to the Editors, that their
Journal should have been instrumental, from its circulation at

home and abroad, in diffusing a knowledge of their labours : and
to what extent it has been efficient for this purpose will be

evident from the multitude of references to the original commu

nications which have appeared in it that arc to be found in foreign

Journals, and in the Reports on the various branches of Na
tural History by Wagner, Miillcr, Von Siebold, Erichson, Bronn

and others, as may be seen in the translations which have been

published by the Ray Society.

   Of the manner in which their endeavours have been seconded

by the lovers of Natural History, the Editors can speak with

much gratification, as the pages of the Annals have been conti
nually honoured with contributions from Naturalists of the first

eminence : and they regard as the most satisfactory testimony
which they could receive as to the conduct of their Journal, that

its successive Volumes have been enriched by the original com-
municatious of so great a number.

    For the principal Bodies connected with the study of Natural
History in this country, the monthly numbers of the Annals

furnish an early and faithful record. Authentic reports of the
proceedings of the Linnamn, Zoological and Entomological
Societies of London, and the Botanical Society of Edinburgh,
are officially communicated through its pages.

    The commencement of this New Series affords the Editors

a fit occasion for expressing a hope that they may now receive
an accession to the number of their supporters. They would
urge how much their means <>f giving additional interest and

value to the Annals, both as to quantity of matter and en
NEW SERIES OF THE ANNALS OP NATURAL HISTORY.                     3

gravings, must depend upon the extent of the sale ; in the hope
that those lovers of Natural History who arc not already sub
scribers may take this convenient opportunity of increasing the

number of those by whose support the work has been upheld.

The Journal is published on the first of each month {price
2s. Gd.), containing five sheets of  Letter Press,   and   one or two
Plates, besides Wood Engravings      when required.         half-yearly
                                                        A

Supjjlement is also published at the conclusion of each Volume.

Jan. 1, 1848.

    The following Prospectus, originally issued at the commence
ment of the work, will more fully explain its nature and objects :--

  In undertaking the Annals of Natural History, the Editors

are desirous of making them not merely a vehicle for original com
munications pertaining to the entire subject of Natural History, but
a means of enabling their readers to keep pace with the progress of
the science in every stage of its advancement.

   Memoirs on Descriptive Zoology ; Monographs ; characters of
new Genera and Species; notices of the habits, instinctive faculties,
and geographical range of animals already known ;-- as also Zooto-
mical communications, in so far as they serve to correct or confirm
the systematical station of species or entire groups, will occupy a
due share of this Journal.

    With regard to the Vegetable Kingdom, besides the space which
will be devoted to Monographs and to Descriptive Botany, atten
tion will also be given to Vegetable Physiology and Phytotomy.
To all Naturalists, even to those who do not make Botany their

peculiar study, these subjects must be interesting, and indeed indis
pensable for the acquirement of a general proficiency in Natural

History. A portion of our pages, therefore, will be especially de

voted to them, as well as to all that pertains to the accurate charac
ters of Families, their geographical range, their uses in the arts, and

in medicine.

    The investigation of Fossil Organic Remains stands in such inti
mate connection with Zoology and Botany, that the claim of this
subject to a place in this Journal can hardly be questioned. Due
attention will therefore be given to those departments of descriptive
Geology that come within the province of Natural History.

    Biographical sketches of illustrious Naturalists, and those who
have travelled for the sake of advancing science, will be occasion
ally introduced ; and the Editors also hope to be enabled to furnish
the reader with matter of popular and general interest supplied by
           NEW 8EEIF.S OF THE ANNALS OP NATURAL HISTORY.

the correspondence of Naturalists who are engaged in voyages of
discovery.

   Reviews of new works, and Notices of the most important British
and Foreign Publications connected with any of these subjects, will
be regidarly brought before our readers.

   From the Foreign sources of intelligence, which in Natural Hi
story are abundant and valuable, such a selection will be made as
may give early and copious information of the labours and disco
veries of the Naturalists of other countries.

    The kind assurances of cooperation which the Editors have re
ceived from eminent Naturalists, both in this country and abroad,
warrant them in already entertaining a confident hope that this
Periodical will prove in no degree inferior in interest and utility to
those of the highest reputation on the Continent ; and they rely on
the favourable disposition of those to whom such a work may seem
desirable for the support and encouragement requisite for its success.

    The following notices may be appealed to as showing the estimation
in which tJie work is held in oilier countries: --

"This Journal occupies, from the value and quantity of its con

tents, a place among the principal and best-conducted Journals

devoted to Natural History." -- Archiv far Naturgeschichte : Berlin,

1841.

  "The 'Annals of Natural History' now incorporates the Maga

zine successively conducted by Messrs. Loudon and Charlesworth,
and is becoming in England, what the 1Annates des Sciences Natu-

relles' has long been in France, an index of the active occupations

and results of the observations of the zoologists, botanists, and
geologists of the country." -- Calcutta Journal of Natural History,
October 1841.

   "There can be no doubt that tte 'Annals and Magazine of
Natural History ' will sustain the same high position in the various
departments of which it treats as each of the Journals of which it is

composed did previous  to their union ; and it  would seem strange
                                                 American Journal,
if it should not rise  above it"-- Silliman's

Vol. 35. No. 1.
   " The Annals of Natural History, one of the richest journals in

original articles : it moreover contains the proceedings of Scientific

Societies, notices and reviews of English and Foreign works." --

have publislied only such extracts as related to events subsequent to tliose narrated

examination of the manuscripts, found so much instructive and interesting in

such matter as had previously been omitted. By adopting this plan, considered

and the obscurest by-paths of Grecian literature and antiquity, has seldom been equalled
and not often approached, in unlearned England ; while those Germans who have rivalled
it, have seldom possessed the quality which eminently characterises Mr. Grote, of keeping
historical imagination severely under the restraints of evidence."

   " We strongly recommend this work to public notice. It is the first account of what are
   called the Northern Provinces, which form the most industrious, civilised, wealthy, and in all
   respects important portion of the Chinese Empire. Mr. Fortune was sent to China for the
   purpose of obtaining new plants, and his instructions directed him to pay all possible
   attention to the horticulture and agriculture of the people ; and on these points his work
   will be most welcome. The author has amongst other things completely elucidated the
   history of the Chinese Tea. For this highly interesting account we must refer to the work
   itself, which contains some clever woodcuts and plates, illustrating the scenery and habits
   of the people."

James has made a judicious selection of the Fables themselves, and of the version to be

which we take to be peculiar to English seamen. The honours, praises, and gold medals
which awaited Sir James Ross, on his return, had been well deserved."

the system of small farms, and the application of that system to Ireland. In the discussion
of these subjects, Mr. Thornton evinces considerable ability, and has bestowed more
research than any previous writer upon the illustration of the working benefits of a theory,
of which he frankly avows himself not the investigator, but the advocate."

   u Mr. Layard has been prosecuting discoveries with singular success. His
memoir on Kuzistan evinces great power of observation, enlarged activity, and
an acquaintance with the language, manners, and life of the wild tribes, very
unusual in a European. Mr. Layard seems qualified in every respect for the
service. About six miles from MobuI, lower down the Tigris, is a place which
bears the traditionary name of Nimroud. It occupies a large amount of artificial
mounds. On the largest of these, Mr. Layard made his first attack. On digging
down into the rubbish, chambers of white marble, covered with arrow-headed
inscriptions, a gigantic bull, winged lion, bas reliefs, hunting scenes and battle
pieces, and other extraordinary specimens of Assyrian art were discovered."

      The Monuments of Assyria are highly important as illustrative of the history, manners,
   and civilization of one of the earliest and most powerful Empires of Asia. They are no less
   interesting, as furnishing a link hitherto wanting, in the history of Art and to the Biblical
   Scholar they are of the highest value, as elucidating and corroborating many passages of
   Holy Writ.

   Some of the Sculptures, of which Drawings will be published, have been secured for the
   British Nation, and will,          hoped, be placed ere long in the National collection but the
                              it

   greater number were too much injured to bear removal, and have fallen to pieces since their
   discovery. Of the latter these Drawings are the sole record, and
                                                                                           alone by publishing
   them that the Monuments of a people that has perished from the face of the globe, all traces
   of w hom were supposed to be lost, can be preserved.

   The Engravings will be accompanied by short descriptions of the Monuments.

                                      One handsome Folio Volume.
