    Report of the Council of the British Association, presented to the
                   General Committee at Oxford, June 27, 1860.

   1. The Council were instructed by the General Committee at Aberdeen

to maintain the establishment at Kew Observatory by aid of a grant of £500.
They have received the following Report of the Committee to whom the

working of the Observatory is entrusted.
REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.  XXXI

   2. The continuance of Magnetic Observations, at stations indicated by the
General Committee at the Leeds Meeting, has engaged the attention of H.R.H.

the President, and of the Council ; and they have had the advantage of co-
operation on the part of the President and Council of the Royal Society.
Every means has been adopted for pressing the subject on the favourable
attention of the Government, but, it is to be regretted, hitherto without

success.

   3. The importance of telegraphic communication between sea-ports of the
British Isles, has been the subject of much attention since it was urged on
the General Committee by the Aberdeen Meeting. The Council are happy
to find that Admiral FitzRoy has been authorized to proceed in bringing to
a practical issue the recommendations offered on this subject to the scientific
department of the Board of Trade; and they, congratulate the Association
on the share they have taken in a cause so dear to humanity.

   4. The expedition suggested by the Royal Geographical Society, and con-
curred in by the General Committee of the British Association, is on its
way ; Capt. Speke, under the direction of the Admiralty, with his assistant,

Capt. Grant, having sailed from Zanzibar. Sir R. I. Murchison, in reporting
on this subject, expresses the obligation which is felt by the promoters of this
great step for the exploration of Africa, to Lord John Russell, Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs.

    The Report of the Parliamentary Committee is received for presentation
to the General Committee this day.

   5. At the Meeting this day, in pursuance of the Notice placed in the

--Minutes of the General Committee at Aberdeen, it will be proposed "That

a permanent distinct Section of Anatomy and Physiology be established, in

   Report of the Kew Committee of the British Association for the

                       Advancement of Science for 1859-1860.

    Since the last Meeting of the British Association, the self-recording mag-
netographs have been in constant operation under the able superintendence
of Mr. Chambers, the magnetical assistant.

  A description of these instruments has been given by Mr. Stewart, the

Superintendent, in a Report which is printed in the Transactions of the British
Association for 1859. The drawings for the plates connected with this

Report were made with much skill by Mr. Beckley, the mechanical assistant
at Kew.

   It was mentioned in the last Report of this Committee, that a set of self-
recording magnetic instruments, designed for the first of the Colonial Obser-
vatories which have been proposed to Her Majesty's Government, had been
completed and set up in a wooden house near the Observatory.

    Shortly after the meeting at Aberdeen, the Chairman received a letter from
Dr. P. A. Bergsma, Geographical Engineer for the Dutch possessions in the
xxxli  --REPORT 1860.

Indian Archipelago, requesting that the Committee would assist him in pro-
curing a set of self-recording magnetic differential instruments similar to
those at Kew, the Dutch Government having resolved to erect such at their
Observatory at Java.

    In consequence of this application, and as the instruments which had been
completed were not immediately required for a British Observatory, it was
resolved that they should be assigned to Dr. Bergsma ; this gentleman has
since arrived, and has for the last few weeks been engaged at the Observatory

in the examination of his instruments.

   The usual monthly absolute determinations of the magnetic elements con-

tinue to be made.
   Application having been made through Padre Secchi, of the Collegio Ro-

mano, for a set of magnetic instruments, for both differential and absolute
determinations, for the Jesuits' College at Havanna, the whole to cost 600
dollars, or about £150, General Sabine obtained, at a reasonable price, the
three magnetometers that had formerly been employed at Sir T. Brisbane's
Observatory at Makerstoun, and also an altitude and azimuth instrument.

With these instruments it is expected that the application from Havanna
Observatory can be met within the sum named; the instruments are now in
the hands of the workmen, and will be ready early in July.

   Two unifilars, supplied by the late Mr. Jones, for the Dutch Government

(one for Dr. Bergsma, and the other for Dr. Buys Ballot), have had their
constants determined. Observations have also been made with two 9-inch
dip-circles belonging to General Sabine, which have been repaired by Barrow,
and with two dip-circles and a Fox's instrument designed for Dr. Bergsma.

  A set of magnetical instruments, consisting of a dip-circle, an azimuth

compass, and a unifilar, previously used by Captain Blakiston, have been
re-examined, and have been taken by Colonel Sraythe, of the Royal Artillery,

to the Feejee Islands.

   As it was feared that the Kew Standard Barometer might have been

injured by the workmen who some time since were repairing the Observatory,
a new one has been mounted. The mechanical arrangements of this instru-
ment have been completed in a very admirable manner by Mr. Beckley ; and
the mean of all the observations made shows that the new Barometer reads

precisely the same as the old. This result is satisfactory, not only as showing
that no change has taken place in the old Barometer, but as confirming the
accuracy of the late Mr. Welsh's process of constructing these instruments.
The height of the cistern of the new Barometer above the level of the sea is

33-74- feet.

   Mr. Valentine Magrath having quitted the Observatory, at his own request,
on the 14th of February last, Mr. George Whipple has taken his place as
Meteorological Assistant, and has given much satisfaction.

   On the 12th of March, Thomas Baker was engaged at the weekly salary

of 8s., to be raised to 105. in six months if he gave satisfaction, which has

hitherto been the case.
    Since the last meeting of the Association, 173 Barometers and 222 Ther-

mometers have been verified at the Observatory.
    Professor Kupffer, Director of the Russian Magnetical and Meteorological

Observatories, visited the Observatory, and was presented with a standard

thermometer.
    Mr. J. C. Jackson, Lieutenant Goodall, R.E., and Mr. Francis Galton,

F.R.S., have visited the Observatory, and received instructions in the mani-

pulation of instruments.

   Mr. Galton has made some experiments at Kew Observatory, to determine
            REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                       XXX111

tlie most practicable method of examining sextants, and otlier instruments
for geographical purposes. Considering that these instruments, after having

been once adjusted, are liable to two distinct classes of error, the one constant

for any given reading, and the other variable, it is an object to form Tables

of Corrections for the constant errors of instruments sent for examination,

and also to ascertain the amount of variable errors which might affect their

readings.

   As a groundwork for examination, it is found that small mirrors may be
permanently adjusted, at the distance of half a mile, so that when the rays

of a mirror of moderate size, standing by the side of an assistant, are flashed

upon them, they may re-reflect a brilliant star of solar light, towards the

sextant under examination.

   By having four permanently fixed mirrors of (his description, separated by

intervals of 20°, 60°, and 40° respectively, and by flashing upon them with

two looking-glasses of moderate size, it is possible, by using every combina-
tion of these angles, to measure every twentieth degree, from 0° up to 120°.

   The disturbing effects of parallax are eliminated without difficulty, by

mere attention to the way in which the sextant is laid on the table, or, in

the case of a zero determination, by a simple calculation.

Moreover, the brilliancy of the permanent mirrors is perfectly under con-

trol, by the interposition of gauze shades in front of the looking-glasses that

flash upon them. This renders an examination of the coloured shades a

matter of great ease and certainty.

Based upon these principles, Mr, Galton has drawn up a system for the

thorough examination of sextants. Each would not occupy more than two

hours in having its constant errors tabulated, and its variable errors deter-

mined; nor would an outlay of more than £!30 be required for the establish-

ment of fixed tables and permanent marks. Difficulty is, however, felt in

setting the system in action, owing to the absolute need of an assistant

having leisure to undertake it.

   The sum of £179 12*. 6d. has been received from the R,oyal Society,

to defray the expense of erecting a model house for the reception of the

instruments for Colonial Magnetic Observatories.

The Photoheliograph has been an occasional source of occupation to the

mechanical assistant; but before daily records of the sun's disk can be ob-

tained, it is absolutely requisite that an assistant should be appointed to aid

Mr. Beckley, because his duties are of such a nature as to prevent his de-

voting attention at fixed periods of the day to an object requiring so much

preparation as is the case with photoheliogrnphy. Unfortunately, the funds
at the disposal of the Committee are quite inadequate for this purpose; and

unless a special grant be obtained, the Photoheliograph will remain very little

used.

   At present Mr. Beckley is preparing the instrument, under Mr. De la Rue's

direction, for its intended trip to Spain, for the purpose of photographing the

eclipse which takes place on July 18th. The expenses of these preparations,

and of the assistants who will accompany Mr. De la Rue, will be defrayed

out of the grant of the Royal Society for that object.

   The requisite preparations are somewhat extensive ; for it has been deemed
necessary to construct a wooden observatory, and to make a new iron pillar

to support the instrument, adapted to the latitude of the proposed station

both the observatory and iron pillar may be taken to pieces to facilitate their

transport.

   The wooden house is 8 feet 6 inches square, and 7 feet high ; it is entirely

open at the top, except that portion divided off for a photographic room,

xxxiv  --REPORT 1860.

The open roof will be covered by canvas when the observatory is not in use ;
and when in use, the canvas will be drawn back, so as to form an outer casing
at some little distance from the wall of the photographic room ; and, in order
to keep this room as cool as possible, the canvas will, in case of need, be kept

wetted.

   The chemicals and chemical apparatus will be packed in duplicate sets, so

as to provide as far as possible against the contingency of loss, by breakage

or otherwise, of a part of them.

   Mr. Downes, of the firm of Cundall and Downes of Bond Street, has
promised to accompany the expedition ; Mr. Beckley will also go ; and Mr.

De la Rue has engaged Mr. Reynolds to assist in the erection of the observa-

tory in Spain, and in the subsequent photographic operations.

   The Admiralty, on the representation of the Astronomer Royal, have pro-

vided a steam-ship to convey this and other astronomical expeditions to Bil-

bao and Santander. It is proposed that the Kew party should land at Bilbao

and proceed to Miranda. Mr. Vignoles, who is constructing the Tudela and

Bilbao railway, has kindly promised his aid and that of his staff of assist-
ants, to promote the objects of the expedition, and promises, on behalf of the
contractors, the use of horses and carts for the conveyance of the apparatus.

The expedition will sail from Portsmouth on the 7th of July; and, should the

weather prove favourable, there is reasonable hope that the various phases
of the eclipse will be successfully photographed. Whether the light of the
corona and red prominences will be sufficiently bright to impress their images,

when magnified to four inches in diameter, is a problem to be solved only by

direct experiment.

   Professor William Thomson (of Glasgow) having expressed a desire that
the practical utility of his self-recording electrometer should be tried at Kew,
his wish has been acceded to and the instrument received, and it is expected

that it will shortly be in operation under his direction.

  A Report has been completed by the Superintendent on the results of the

Magnetic Survey of Scotland and the adjacent islands in the years 1857 and
1858, undertaken by the late Mr. Welsh. This Report is printed in the

Transactions of the British Association for 1859.

   The following correspondence has taken place between General Sabine
and the Rev. William Scott, Director of the Sydney Observatory :

                                                                       " Observatory, Sydney, March 2, 18G0.

 --" Sir, The great interest which you take in the promotion of Magnetical

Science encourages me to address you on the subject of the establishment of
a Magnetical Observatory at Sydney. The report which I send you by this

mail will explain to you the character and position of the Astronomical Ob-

servatory under my direction.
   " I am convinced that an application to our Government, from influential

persons at home, for the establishment of magnetical observations on not

too expensive a scale, would be readily attended to. I am not practically

acquainted with any magnetical observatory, with the exception of that at

Greenwich, and am ignorant of the cost of a set of instruments, and the
exact amount of space required for working them ; but I believe we could

find sufficient room in the observatory without any additional building; they

would be under my own supervision, and all that would be required would
be an additional assistant, to share with myself and my one assistant in
observing and computing. The Governor-General, Sir W. Denison, would,

though powerless as regards public money, exert his influence in favour of

such an object.

  --" Sir, I lose no time in replying to your letter of March 2, received this

day. The self-recording magnetical instruments at Kew have been in action

--nearly two and a half years a sufficient time to test their merits or defects.

I have myself completed the analysis and reduction of the first two years (1858

and 1859) of the Observations of the Declinometer, and can therefore speak, of

my own knowledge of their performance, as far as that element is concerned.

The Photographic Traces, recording both the zero line and the actual move-

ments of the magnet, can be measured with tolerable confidence to the third

place of decimals of an inch, the inch in the Kew instrument being equiva-

lent to 22 minutes of arc. The reading is consequently made to the 1000th

part of 22 minutes of declination. The record is of course continuous ; but,
for the purpose of computing the results, hourly readings have been tabulated.

In the first year the trace failed in 107 out of 8760 hours, chiefly from

failure in the supply of gas, which is brought by pipes from Richmond, a

considerable distance off. This inconvenience has been remedied by the

construction at the Observatory itself, at a small expense, of a water regu-

lator, through which the supply from Richmond passes, and there is now no
reason why the trace should ever fail. I have now in course of analysis and

reduction the same years of the observations of the horizontal and vertical

force magnetographs, and have no reason hitherto to believe that the record

of those two elements will be inferior to that of the declination. The three

instruments, with the clock which keeps the registering papers in revolution,

together with reading telescopes placed for eye observation, either to accom-

pany or to be independent of self-registry, occupy an interior space of about

16 feet by 12, including a passage round for the observer. The cost of such

a set of instruments, complete in every respect, is £250 ; and four months

must be allowed for making them from the date of the order, as well as an

additional month for their careful verification at Kew (should that be de-

sired), where a detached building has been erected for this particular pur-

pose, in which they may be kept in work in comparison with the Kew instru-

Aments.  detailed description of these instruments is now in the press, and

will be published in June in the volume of Reports of the British Association.

The results of the first two years of the Declinometer observations, showing

what are deemed at present to be the most useful modes of eliciting the re-

sults, will be printed in the · Proceedings of the Royal Society' in the present

summer, and the first two years of the horizontal and vertical force magneto-

Agraphs in the same publication later in the year.  small adjoining room is

requisite, opening if possible into the instrument-room, which should contain

suitable troughs for the preparation of the paper to receive the traces, and

to fix them. It is important to diminish as much as possible the changes of

temperature in the Observatory itself, exclusive of the effect of the instrument

cases, which have adaptations for that purpose. So far in regard to differential

instruments. For absolute determinations and secular changes a small de-

tached house is required, say 12 feet by 8, in which equality of temperature

need not be regarded, but which must be at a sufficient distance from other

                                                                                  c2

buildings containing iron, and have copper fittings. The instruments required

for these purposes are an inclinometer and a unifilar, the latter having pro-

vision for the experiments of deflection and vibration, as well as lor the abso-

lute declination : the cost of the first is £30, and of the second £15 ; both may
be verified, if desired, at Kew. The little work which is sent to you by the

same post as this letter contains a full description of these instruments, and

directions for their use. In addition to the charges named above, making iu

all £325, the cost of packing, freight, and insurance will have to be taken

into the account.

" One assistant will suifice, as you suggest, for keeping the magnetometers

in action, and for tabulation. The absolute values, and the calculation of the

results of all the instruments, would be, I presume, the work of the Director

of the Observatory himself. Provision must also be made for a supply of

chemicals, stationery, and gas. Should it be thought desirable that the instru-

ments should be prepared and verified under the superintendence of the Com-
mittee of the Kew Observatory, a request to that effect, transmitted by your-

self through the Governor of the Colony to the Chairman of the Committee

of the Kew Observatory, Richmond Park, London, S.W., would, I am sure,

meet immediate attention. That such an institution at the head-quarters of

our Australian dominions would be as honourable to those who should be

instrumental in its establishment as it would be beneficial to magnetical

science, must be a matter of general recognition, and it would, I am per-

suaded, find a warm supporter in your present most excellent Governor.

   From the following correspondence which has taken place between Her
Majesty's Government and the President of the Royal Society, it will be

seen that the establishment of a Magnetical Observatory at Vancouver
Island is postponed, in consequence of the war with China precluding the
establishment at present of a corresponding observatory at Pekin :

                                                                        " Treasury Chambers, 16th May, 18G0.

--" Sir, I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's

MyTreasury to acquaint you that  Lords have had under their further con-

sideration the establishment of an Observatory at Vancouver Island, and

the insertion in the Estimates of this year of a vote for that service.

  My" Lords are fully sensible of the importance of obtaining a series of

accurate Magnetical Observations at the stations recommended by the Council

of the British Association, and it would give them great pleasure to assist

without further delay in forwarding objects so interesting for the cause of

science.

" The numerous and pressing claims, however, on the public finances in

Mythe present year make it imperative upon  Lords to submit no fresh esti-

mate to Parliament which is not of a very urgent character, and where the

total limit of expense to be incurred has not been accurately ascertained.

My" In the present instance  Lords must observe that you appear to be

under some misapprehension iu supposing that any engagement was entered

into by the late Government to establish a Magnetic Observatory at Pekin or

elsewhere. On the contrary, the letter of this Board of 6th December, 1858,
to Lord YVrottesley states that, ' whatever may be the public advantages to

be derived from the proposed new establishments, the object Mould not,
             KErORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                      XXXYU

it appears, be sacrificed by postponement, and, looking to tne extent of

Mythe other claims upon the public finances already existing,  Lords

have thought it right to defer the consideration of the question until next

year.'

   " The letter then further states, that the three Magnetical Observatories
at the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and Toronto, which were originally
sanctioned in an estimate of about £3000 for three years, had in fact cost

£11,000 for that period, and, in all, had put the country to an expense of

nearly £50,000. This consideration alone suffices to show the necessity for
very careful investigation by the Government before any step is taken which
might commit the country to further expense. The circumstances referred

to in the letter in question continue in full force; and an important further

argument against undertaking the proposed Observatory at Vancouver
Island at the present moment is furnished by the political events which have

since occurred in China. In General Sabine's able letter of the 1st January,

1859, it is stated that, ' without entering into the comparative scientific value

--of Vancouver Island and Pekin as magnetic stations, both being highly
--important, this much is certain, that, whatever might be the value of either,
-- --that value would be greatly enhanced far more than doubled by there

being a simultaneous and continuous record at both stations; and Sir John

Herschel remarks that the importance of a five years' series of observations

at one of the proposed stations without the others would be grievously dimi-

nished, and the general scope of the project defeated.'

   "As the present state of things in China precludes the establishment of a

Magnetic Observatory at Pekin, or any point in the Chinese Empire suffi-
ciently to the north to correspond with a station at Vancouver Island

(though there is reason to hope that this state of things may be of short

duration), it would appear desirable even in the interests of science to postpone
the consideration until something more certain can be ascertained as to the
possibility of meeting what Sir John Herschel and General Sabine consider
such an essential requisite, viz. the commencement and continuance of simul-
taneous observations at Vancouver Island and at a point in China nearly in the
same parallel of latitude. The interval which must elapse until the political

state of affairs in China may render such an establishment possible may be

usefully employed in obtaining the most accurate estimate possible of the
actual cost of founding and maintaining each station for the period requisite

for the complete attainment of the scientific objects in view, so as to enable

Her Majesty's Government, when the proper time shall arrive, if they shall

decide on doing so, to submit a vote to Parliament with confidence as to the

amount of expense which they may ask the nation to defray in the interests

of science.

   " dear Sir, In Mr. Hamilton's letter (returned herewith) he has

referred to Sir Charles Trevelyan's communication to Lord Wrottesley of the
6th December, 1858, expressing the desire of the Lords Commissioners of
the Treasury to postpone to the following year the consideration of the esta-
blishment of the Colonial Magnetic Observatories which had been recom-
mended by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advance-
XXXV111           --REPORT 1860.

ment of Science ; but Mr. Hamilton has omitted altogether to refer to the

interview which took place between the President of the British Association

and Sir Charles Trevelyan subsequent to that communication, viz. on the

18th of December, 1858, when Sir Charles Trevelyan stated that ' if a single

station for magnetical and meteorological observations were applied for [in-

timating Pekin as its locality] by the Joint Committee of the Royal Society

Myand the British Association,  Lords would be disposed to comply with

such application.' (See Report of the Council of the British Association,

September 1859.)

"Political events which became known shortly after that interview made

it manifestly unadvisable to apply for a station in China ; but the scientific

importance of procuring systematic magnetical researches at other stations

which had been named in the original application from two Societies, in parts

of the globe which were conveniently accessible and under British dominion,

remained as before. In these respects Vancouver Island was unobjectionable,

and was therefore substituted for 'a station in China' in the application,

which, consistently with Sir Charles Trevelyan's communication of the 18th

December, 1858, was made by the Joint Committee of the two Societies. The

confident expectations thus founded being known in the United States by

the publications of the Reports of the Joint Committee of the Royal Society

and British Association, the Government of the United States authorized the

establishment of Magnetical Observatories at a station on the east side of the

United States, and at another on the south coast, both designed to cooperate

with the British Observatory to be established on Vancouver Island ; the three

stations being obviously remarkably well selected for systematic researches

over that large portion of the globe. The two observatories of the United

States' Government have been established, and commenced their work at

the beginning of the present year.

" In reference to the aggregate amount of expenditure incurred by the

magnetical researches recommended to Government by the Royal Society

and British Association in the last twenty years, it may be remarked that, the

researches being altogether of a novel character, the continuance of the

Observatories, when first asked for in 1839, was for a very limited period.

It was, in fact, an experiment, and their longer continuance would not have

been recommended had not the experiment proved eminently successful, and

such as to justify the prosecution of the researches. The subject was there-

fore brought afresh under the consideration of Government in 1845 and again

in 1849, and the further expenditure to be incurred received the sanction of

the Treasury on both occasions, as have also, on other occasions, the magnetie

surveys connected with the Observatories. It is possible that the aggregate

amount of expenditure thus sanctioned and incurred may not be overstated

at £50,000. It is an average amount not exceeding £2500 a year for this

great branch of physical science.

   " I am not myself the proper authority to say whether the gain to science,

and to the estimation in scientific respects in which this country is held by

other nations, be, or be not, an equivalent for this expenditure; but I may be

permitted to refer to the opinion expressed by the Joint Committee of the

two Societies, consisting, as is well known, of persons holding high places in

public estimation for their general knowledge and good judgment, as well

--as possessing the highest scientific eminence: ' Your Committee, looking at

this long catalogue of distinct and positive conclusions already obtained, feel

themselves fully borne out in considering that the operation, in a scientific

point of view, has proved, so far, eminently remunerative and successful, and

that its results have fully equalled in importance and value, as real accessions

General Sabine relative to the establishment of Colonial Magnetic Observa-

tories, I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury

to state that, without entering into the question what verbal assurances may

have been given in December 1858 by the then Assistant Secretary, Sir Charles

Trevelyan, of which no record was made, their Lordships observe that the

main ground of their letter of the 16th May, 1860, remains unaffected, viz.

that, in the opinion of the highest scientific authorities, whatever might be

the value of observations at Vancouver Island, that value would be greatly

increased by simultaneous observations at some station in the North of China,

and, on the other hand, would be ' grievously diminished ' if no station in

China was established. Under these circumstances, their Lordships thought

it desirable to postpone for a short time the consideration of the question, in

the hope that it might be considered under a different state of things in China,

rendering possible the attainment of the greatest amount of scientific advan-

tage from the expenditure of public money, in case that expenditure should

be decided upon.

   General Sabine has written the following letter to Dr. Bache, who had
intimated to him that, in the event of Her Majesty's Government declining to

establish a magnetical observatory at Vancouver Island, it was the wish of
the United States' Government to establish one in Washington Territory, in
the vicinity of Vancouver Island:

                                                                                             " May 22, 1860.

 --" Dear Bache, I waited to reply to yours of April 13th until we should

have received the reply of our Government regarding the Vancouver Island
Observatory. Mr. Gladstone has availed himself of some expressions in
Sir John Herschel's letters and mine (to the effect of the far greater import-
ance of having observations on the Chinese as well as on the American side

of the Pacific to having either separately) to postpone a decision regarding
Vancouver Island until our relations with China shall enable our Govern-

ment to consider the question of establishing both simultaneously. Our pro-

position, therefore, has fallen to the ground, and it is quite open to your
Government to occupy the field which you were willing to concede to us in
consideration of the forward part which our Government has hitherto taken
in magnetic researches.

  "Now in regard to the instruments, which, as you are probably aware,
have been prepared at my own risk, in order that, should our Government

accede to the recommendation made by the Royal Society and British Asso-
xl REPORT 1860.

ciation, the time might be saved which must otherwise have been lost in their

preparation. They have been made on the model of those which have been

in use at the Kcw Observatory since January 18.58. An account of these is in

the press, and will be published in the volume of Reports of the British Asso-

ciation for 18.59-1860, which must be in circulation next month. I have

thoroughly examined and computed the declination results for 1858 and 1859,

by means of tabulated hourly values, and am now engaged in the same cal-

culation of the Bifilar and Vertical Force Magnetometers. The Declination

Report will be presented to the Royal Society, and printed in the ' Proceed-

ings ' in the course of the summer, as well as the results of the Force Mag-
netometers for the same two years, as soon as I am able to draw up the report

in due form and order. But I am able to say, regarding all the three elements,

that the instruments are eminently successful. Independent of the continuity

of the record (which is of course a great thing in itself), the hourly tabula-

tions are far more consistent and satisfactory than were the eye-observations

at any of our observatories.

" In preparing a second set of instruments, therefore (which we have done

for the proposed Netherlands Observatory in Java), we have had very few

--improvements to introduce, except the addition of reading-telescopes for each

instrument so that we may always retain the power of eye-observation,

either in addition to or substitution for photographic records. Dr. Bergsma,

the Director of the Java Observatory, is now at Kew, observing with his in-

struments, in comparison with those in our own Observatory (as Ave have a

separate building for the instruments on trial), and will take them away

towards the end of June. These of course will be paid for by the Netherlands

Government, having been ordered expressly for them. There will then be the

third set, which have been prepared for Vancouver, and which are ready to

Asucceed the Java instruments in the experimental house.  few very trifling
--improvements have been introduced in these none worthy of being noticed

here. They at present stand as mine, and I shall be indebted £250 for them.

The decision of Government, as communicated to the President of the Royal

Society, makes no reference to my responsibility on their account. I am,

therefore, to say the least, quite free to dispose of them as I may please.

Now I am not rich enough to offer them as a loan to your ' Washington

Territory' Observatory ; but if you desire to have differential determinations

there in addition to absolute determinations, I am persuaded that you could

not have better instruments than these would be; and I consider myself as

quite free to offer you the refusal of them, asking only in return that you

will give me as early a reply as may be convenient, because I have some

reason to expect that I may receive an application from the Sydney Obser-

vatory to obtain a duplicate of the Kew instruments; in which case, if you

had not claimed them in the meantime, I should direct these to be sent to

Sydney.                                      " Sincerely yours,

                              (Signed)       " Edward Sabine."

" Dr. Bache, F.R.S., Director of the
        Coast Survey of the United States."

   The reply to this letter has not yet been received; but in the meantime

the following application has come for a set of magnetical instruments for

absolute determinations from Dr. Smalhvood, Professor of Meteorology at

M cGill College in Montreal, Canada:--

                                                                  " St. Martin, Isle Jesus, May 2], 1800.

 --" Sir, I duly received yours of the 16th of July last, in reference to the
                REPORT OF THE KEW COMMITTEE.                                               xli

establishment of a Magnetic Observatory here, in connexion with observa-

tions on meteorology and atmospheric electricity, and deferred writing until

I was in a position to acquire the instruments necessary.

   " You said in your communication that '£80 or thereabouts was required;'

and you were kind enough to add, with a spirit of generosity I could not

expect, 'that every care should be taken to superintend the construction of

such instruments, to verify them, and to determine their constants, and have

them carefully packed and sent out.'

   " The object of the present letter is to ascertain, 1st, the exact cost (if pos-

sible); 2nd, to whom the amount shall be forwarded; 3rd, when the instru-

ments would probably be ready ; 4th, a short list of what are to be sent.

"I  feel  that  I am  asking  too much  from you                                           but a knowledge of your

devotion to a science which you have so much extended, makes me feel less

diffident, and I have thrown myself upon your kindness.

" I have also to acknowledge the receipt of a Book of Instructions, &c,

with thanks.

" So soon as I get a reply from you, I will at once transmit the amount

with the order, and submit a plan of the building.

    " Believe me to remain, with great consideration and respect,

                                      " Yours faithfully,

                              (Signed)                                                     " C. Smallwood."

" General Sabine, London."

    Instruments to meet this request are in preparation.

   The Committee have thought that it might not prove uninteresting to the
members of the British Association, if, in this Report, a short description

were given of the Kew Observatory, and of the nature and amount of work

which is accomplished therein.

   The Observatory is situated in the middle of the old Deer-park, Richmond,
Surrey, and is about three-quarters of a mile from the Richmond Railway

Station. Its longitude is 0° 18' 47" W., and its latitude is 51° 28' 6" N. It

is built north and south. The repose produced by its complete isolation is

eminently favourable to scientific research. In one of the lower rooms a set
of self-recording magnetographs, described in the Report of the last meeting
of this Association, is constantly at work. These instruments, by the aid of
photography, furnish a continuous record of the changes which take place in
the three magnetic elements, viz. the declination, the horizontal force, and the
vertical force. The light used is that of gas, in order to obtain which, pipes
have been carried across the Park to the Observatory, at an expense of ^250,
which sum was generously defrayed by a grant from the Royal Society.

   Attached to this room is another, of a smaller size, in which the necessary
photographic operations connected with magnetography are conducted.

   In the story above the basement, the room by which the visitor enters the

Observatory is filled with apparatus. Much of this is the property of the

Royal Society, and some of the instruments possess a historical value ; for
instance, the air-pump used by Boyle; and the convertible pendulum designed
by Captain Kater, and employed by him, and subsequently by General Sabine,
in determining the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds.

   An inner room, which opens from this one, is used as a library and sitting-

room, and in it the calculations connected with the work of the Observatory
are performed. In this room dipping-needles and magnets, which it is neces-

sary to preserve from rust, are stored. Here also the MS. of the British

Association Catalogue of Stars is preserved.

  A room to the east of this contains the standard barometers, and the appa-
--xlii REPORT 1860.

ratus (described by Mr. Welsh in the ' Transactions' of the Royal Society,

vol. 146. p. 507) for verifying and comparing marine barometers with the
standard. This room has also accommodation for the marine barometers

sent for verification. In the middle of the room is a solid block of masonry,

extending through the floor to the ground below. To this an astronomical

quadrant was formerly attached ; it is now used as a support for the standard
barometers. This room contains also a Photographic Barograph invented

by Mr. Francis Ronalds, which, though not at present in operation, may
serve as a model for any one who wishes to have an instrument of this

description. It is described by Mr. Ronalds in the Report of the British

Association for 1851.

In a room to the west of the Library, thermometers for the Board of Trade,

the Admiralty, and opticians, are compared with a standard thermometer by

means of a very simple apparatus devised by the late Mr. Welsh.

The Observatory also possesses a dividing-engine by Perreaux, by means of

which standard thermometers are graduated. It was purchased by a grant

from the Royal Society.

In this room the pure water required for photographic processes is obtained

by distillation; and here also a small transit telescope is placed for ascertain-

ing time. The transit instrument is erected in a line between two meridian

--marks one to the north and the other to the south of the Observatory ; so

that, by means of suitable openings, either of these marks may be viewed by

the telescope.

In a higher story is the workshop, containing, among other things, a slide-

lathe by Whitworth, and a planing machine by Armstead, both of which were

presented to the Kew Observatory by tiie Royal Society.

In the dome is placed the Photoheliograph for obtaining pictures of the

sun's disk ; attached to the dome there is a small chamber in which the

photographic processes connected with the photoheliograph are conducted.

AThis chambe ns supplied with water by means of a force-pump.       self-

recording Robinson s anemometer j.«also attached to the dome.

In addition to the rooms now specified, there are the private apartments

attached to the Observatory.

   On the north side of the Observatory there is an apparatus similar to that

used at the Toronto Observatory for containing the wet- and dry-bulb, the

maximum and the minimum thermometers.

The model magnetic house, elsewhere alluded to in this Report, stands at a

distance of about 60 yards from the Observatory ; and the small wooden

house in which the absolute magnetic observations are made, at a distance

of about 110 yards. These houses are within a wooden paling, which fences

them off from the remainder of the Park, and encloses about one acre of
ground attached to the Observatory.

The work done may now be briefly specified. In the first place, the self-

recording magnetographs, as already mentioned, are kept in constant opera-

tion, and record the changes continually occurring in the magnetic elements.

   The photographs are sent to General Sabine's establishment at Woolwich,

to undergo the processes of measurement and tabulation.

   In the model magnetic house there is at present a set of magnetographs

which Dr. Bergsma will take to Java. When this set is removed another will

supply its place, in readiness for any other Observatory, colonial or foreign,

at which it may be required.

In the house for absolute determinations, monthly values of the declination,

dip, and horizontal magnetic force are taken, and magnetic instruments for

foreign or colonial observatories have their constants determined.

xliv REPORT 1860.

   In the meteorological department, all the barometers, thermometers, and
hydrometers required by the Board of Trade and the Admiralty have their

corrections determined; besides which, similar instruments are verified for
opticians. Standard thermometers also are graduated, and daily meteoro-
logical observations are made, an abstract of which is published in the

' Illustrated London News.'
   Instruction is also given in the use of instruments to officers in the army

or navy, or other scientific men who obtain permission from the Committee.
   All this amount of work, it is believed, can be executed by the present

staff, consisting of the superintendi nt, three assistants (magnetical, mecha-
nical, and meteorological), and a boy; but the expense attending it is greater
than the present income of the Observatory, furnished by the British Asso-

ciation, will support.

    In the resolution of the British Association of the 14th September, 1859,

it was recommended to Government, at the instance of the joint committee of
the Royal Society and British Association, that the sum of £350 per annum
should be placed at the disposal of the general superintendent of the mag-
netical observations ; this sum was intended to have defrayed the expenses
attending the magnetical department of the Observatory and the observa-
tions of the sun's spots. It will be seen, however, from the correspondence
contained in an earlier part of this Report, that this source of income is not

yet available.

Report of the Parliamentary Committee to the Meeting of the British
                         Association at Oxford in June 1860.

   The Parliamentary Committee have the honour to report as follows:
   No subject of sufficient importance to require any especial notice has occu-

pied their attention during the past year, nor indeed was there any matter
referred to them at the last Meeting of the Association.

   There are now either two or three vacancies in that portion of the Com-
mittee which represents the House of Commons, according as it shall be de-
termined whether the vacancy caused in that Section by Lord de Grey's
taking his seat in the House of Lords is or is not to be filled up,

                            ADDRESS

                                                        BY

   THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD WROTTESLEY.

--Gentlemen, If, on taking this Chair for the first time as your President,

I do not enlarge upon my deficiencies for adequately filling the responsible
office to which you have done me the honour to elect me, I hope you will
believe that I am not the less sensible of them.

   Your last Meeting was held under the Presidency of one not more distin-
guished by his high rank and exalted station than by his many excellent
qualities, and the discriminating interest which he has ever manifested in the
promotion of Art and Science. It was one of the most successful Meetings on

record.

   We are now once more assembled in this ancient and venerable seat of

learning ; and the first topic of interest which presents itself to me, who owe

to Oxford what academic training I have received, is the contrast presented
by the state of Science and the teaching of Science in this University in the

Autumn of the year 1814, when my residence here commenced, and for five
years afterwards, with its present condition. As the private pupil of the late
Dr. Kidd, and within a few yards of the spot from which I have now the honour

to inaugurate the Meeting of this distinguished Association, I first imbibed

that love of Science from which some of the purest pleasures of my life have
been derived ; and I cannot mention the name of my former Tutor without

acknowledging the deep debt of gratitude I owe to the memory of that able,
conscientious and single-hearted man.

   It was at this period that a small knot of Geologists, headed by Broderip,
Buckland, the two Conybeares and Kidd, had begun to stimulate the curiosity
of the Students and resident Graduates by Lectures and Geological excur-
sions in the neighbourhood of this town. The lively illustrations of Buck-
land, combined with genuine talent, by degrees attracted crowds to his
teaching, and the foundations of that interesting science, already advancing
under the illustrious Cuvier in France, anddestinedsoon to spread over Europe,

were at this time fairly laid in England within these classical Halls. Many
a time in those days have my studies been agreeably interrupted by the
 lvi REPORT-- 1860.

 cheerful laugh which invariably accompanied the quaint and witty terms in
 which Buckland usually announced to his brother Geologist some new dis-
 covery, or illustrated the facts and principles of his favourite science. At
 the time, however, to which I refer, the study of physical science was chiefly
 confined to a somewhat scanty attendance on the Chemical Lectures of Dr.
 Kidd, and on those on Experimental Philosophy by Rigaud ; and in pure
 mathematics the fluxional notation still kept its ground. In the year 1818
 Vince's Astronomy, and in the following year theDifferential Notation, was first
 introduced in the mathematical examinations for honours. At that time

 that fine foundation the Radcliffe Observatory was wholly inactive ; the
 observer was in declining health, and the establishment was neither useful to
astronomical students, nor did it contribute in any way to the advancement
 of Astronomical Science. Even from the commencement of the present
 century, and in proportion as the standard of acquirement in classical learning
 was gradually raised by the emulation excited by the examinations for
honours, the attendance on the above-mentioned Lectures gradually declined :
but a similar cause enhanced the acquirements of students in pure and

applied Mathematics, and the University began to number among its
Graduates and Professors men of great eminence in those departments of
knowledge. Nor were the other sciences neglected ; and as Chairs became
vacant or new Professorships were established, men of European reputation

were appointed to fill them. In proof of all this I need only direct atten-
tion to the names on the roll of Secretaries, Vice-Presidents and Presidents

of Sections, to convince you that Oxford now contains among her resident
Graduates, men amply qualified to establish and advance the scientific fame

of that University, of which they are the distinguished ornaments.

   On the progress of Astronomy I will, as becomes me, enter into more
detail. And it is not without pain that I allude to this subject, because I am
reminded that one has been removed from among us by the hand of death,
whom I had looked forward to meeting again on this occasion with peculiar
pleasure. I never knew anyone who had the interests of science more truly

at heart, or laboured more diligently to advance them, than the late Radcliffe

Observer, Mr. Manuel Johnson. . By his exertions and indefatigable zeal
the Radcliffe Observatory was enabled to take its proper place among the
Scientific Institutions of the world. By the liberality of the Trustees and
by the exertion of his influence, new instruments were purchased, and an
extensive series of valuable astronomical observations was made; and, what

is quite as important, they were regularly reduced and published. In addi-
tion to all this, a noble array of self-recording meteorological instruments was
brought into action, and their records duly reduced and co-ordinated. I was
myself a candidate in 18:iy for that office to which Mr. Johnson was then
appointed, and I have often rejoiced that I was not successful, as it would

have retarded for a time the promotion of one, to whom Astronomy owes a

deep debt of gratitude. Mr. Johnson was suddenly taken from us at a time
ADDRESS.  Ivii

when he was in the full career of his useful labours, and there are few
labourers in science whose loss has been more deplored. The University has
very lately lost another learned Professor, and myself another valued friend,
whose contributions to science are well known and duly esteemed. The
great tragic Poet of Greece introduces his hero accusing his heathen gods
of rescuing from the grave the vile and worthless, and sending thither the
good and useful :

                                                  rd dk Siicaia. /cat rd \pi]ard

Our purer faith in meek resignation trusts that they are removed from evil

--to come, and that there at least they rest from their labours rest from

earthly toil and trouble, but awake, may be, to higher aims and aspirations,

and with nobler faculties and duties.

   Although a successor may be appointed to Mr. Johnson, who will, I doubt

not, admirably discharge the duties of Radcliffe Observer, I fear that the

Observatory may not continue to maintain its high reputation, unless a suffi-

cient staff of Assistants be appointed to aid the Observer in his labours.
There is no mistake more fatal in Astronomy than that of multiplying in-
strumental means without providing an adequate supply of hands to employ
them.

   I have already alluded to some particulars in which this great University
has advanced in the career of scientific improvement, but everything else has
been somewhat thrown into the shade by the important event of this year,
the opening of the new Museum. The University could have given no more

substantial proof of a sincere interest in the diffusion of science than the

foundation of this noble Institution, and I am sure that among the distin-
guished cultivators of science here assembled, there is not one who does not
entertain a hearty desire for the success of the various efforts now in progress

for the purpose of stimulating our University Students to a closer contempla-
tion and more diligent study of the glorious works of Nature; a study, which,

if prosecuted earnestly, raises us in the scale of human beings and improves
every moral and intellectual faculty. Towards the attainment of a result so
much to be desired the Museum will most powerfully contribute, and those
who frequent it will owe deep obligations to Mr. Hope and the other bene-
factors who have generously added to its stores. But there are other causes
in operation which tend to the same end; and among them, in addition to

such improvements as arise out of the changes consequent on the recent

Act of Parliament, may be mentioned the alteration in the distribution of

University Honours.

   The institution of the School of Physical Science forms a most important
feature in the recent changes, and will doubtless be productive of good results,
provided that sufficient encouragement by way of reward be held out to
those whose tastes lead them to devote themselves to those departments of
knowledge, and that the compulsory arrangements in respct of other studies
--lviii

allow sufficient time to the student to accomplish his object. The great
majority of physical students must necessarily belong to that class who have
their subsistence to earn ; and however earnest may be their zeal for mental

improvement, there will be few candidates for the honours of the Physical
School unless due encouragement be given to excellence in that department.
It was therefore with sincere pleasure that I learnt that three Fellowships
had been founded at Magdalen College as prizes for proficiency in Natural
Science ; and that at the same College, and at Christ Church and Queen's,

Scholarships and Exhibitions had been provided for students who evince

during their examinations the greatest aptitude for such studies. Moreover,

the acquisition of a RadclifFe travelling Fellowship has been made to depend
upon obtaining distinction in the School of Natural Science. In addition to
all this, that beneficent and enlightened lady, Miss Burdett Coutts, has founded
two Scholarships with the view of extending among the Clergy educated at

the University a knowledge of Geology. Great hopes are justly excited in
the minds of all well-wishers to the University by these events, and by reflec-
tion on the great change of opinion which must have taken place since the
period when Dr. Kidd, with the aid of Dr. Daubeny, Mr. Greswell and others,

in vain attempted to raise a small sum by private subscription for building a

modest receptacle for the various collections of Natural History. How little

could these public-spirited individuals have foreseen, that within a few short

years a sum approaching to £100,000 would be appropriated to the building
and furnishing that splendid monument of Oxford's good will to science, the

New Museum

    It would not be right, however, if, while speaking in just and sincere terms

of praise of all that excites my admiration in the late proceedings at Oxford,
I were to withhold the honest expression of my opinion on points on which

 I feel compelled to differ from the course pursued. I will therefore refer to
 two measures, one of which especially I cannot but regard as a mistake.

The first is the repeal of the statute which enforced attendance on two courses
of Professorial lectures ; a requirement, which may have had no small influ-
ence in creating a taste for natural science among that large class of students,
whose only object it is to obtain, in a creditable manner if possible, but at all
events to obtain, the distinction of an Academical degree. At the same time
I cannot but be sensible that the amount of instruction imparted in this way,
even if the attendance were much more than nominal, must necessarily have
 been small, not from any want of competency in the teachers, but from the
 inherent defect of the system of lectures unaccompanied by examinations;

 and on this account I the less regret the change.

    The second, and more serious mistake, in my humble opinion, is the re-

jection by the Congregation in 1857 of the proposal of the Hebdomadal
 Council, that the Undergraduate, after passing his first two classical exami-
 nations, should be permitted to select his own line of study, and submit

  himself at his option to a final examination in any one of the four Schools,
ADDRESS.  lix

that is, the Classical, the Mathematical, History and Law, or Natural Science.
The Hebdomadal Council were I think right in believing that such mental

--discipline as classical study can impart and far be it from me to undervalue
--it in the least would be sufficiently secured by the classical requirements of

the two first examinations ; and that the study of Mathematics and the Natural

Sciences, besides imparting much valuable information, which might be exten-
sively utilized in after-life, might equally be viewed as an important means

of improving the intellectual faculties. There is another consideration which
must not be lost sight of in deciding on the policy of the course then pursued.

I think that it cannot in fairness be expected that a young man of the average
abilities of those who contend for honours, and who is called upon to pass

two classical examinations, and prepare for a third, before he is allowed to
follow the bent of his genius and apply himself to his favourite study, can

find time to attain a sufficient proficiency in it to pass a really creditable
examination; accordingly the necessary result will be that the Examiners will
be obliged to lower the standard of honour, the rather that most of the students

now come to the University without having acquiredeventheelements of scien-
tific knowledge, and thus the first class may almost cease to be a distinction

worth attainment.

    I cannot take leave of recent University changes without adverting to that
great, that noble step, the institution of the Middle Class Examinations,
whereby Oxford has furnished substantial aid to those more humble aspirants

to knowledge, by whom a University education, however much desired, is

quite unattainable. Whether this movement be viewed in its moral effect, as
showing a kindly sympathy of the higher intellectual class with the struggling

but deserving children of a lower sphere, or as the best expedient for bringing
about a complete reform in our educational establishments, and therefore a

--great engine for advancing popular education whether this grand and

 liberal step be viewed in one or both these aspects, it has given the most

unmixed and heartfelt satisfaction to all who have the moral and mental

 improvement of the nation sincerely at heart ; and greatly do I rejoice that

such a satisfactory proof should have been given of a desire to make Uni-

 versity Institutions a general national blessing.

    Oxford, then, has shown herself fully equal to her glorious mission, and it
 was only a fitting sequel to such enlightened conduct, that she should be
 entrusted with the grateful task of educating the Heir apparent to the Throne
 of the most popular Sovereign who ever swayed the sceptre of this vast

 Empire.

    I shall perhaps be forgiven if my former connexion with Oxford, and the
 interest which I must ever take in everything appertaining to my own Uni-
 versity, have induced me to dwell somewhat at length on the above matters.
 It is now time that I should direct my attention to the general domain of
 science ; but more particularly to that department to which my own labours,

--humble though they be, have been more especially devoted, I mean the
--IX REPORT 1860.

 science of Astronomy, a science, which, whether we consider the surpassing
 interest of the subjects with which it is conversant, or the lofty nature of the
 speculations to which its inquiries lead, must ever occupy a most distinguished,
 if not the first place among all others.

    In a discourse addressed in May 18.59 to the Imperial Academy of

 Sciences of Vienna, by the distinguished Astronomer Littrow, a very full ac-
 count is given of the voluntary contributions of the private observers of
 all nations to the extension of the science of Astronomy ; and this discourse

 concludes with a remarkable sentence, of which our English Amateurs may

 well be proud : he expresses a hope that on the next occasion in which he
shall be called upon to dilate on the same theme, he shall not as then have
to inpntion English names in such preponderating numbers.

    At the beginning of the year 1820, when the Astronomical Society was
founded, the private Observatories in this country were very few in number.
The establishment of that Society gave a most remarkable stimulus to the
cultivation of the science which it was intended to promote. 1 can give no
better proof of this than the fact that the Nautical Almanac now contains a
list of no less than twelve private Observatories in the United Kingdom, at
nearly all of which some good work has been done; and in addition to this,
some Observatories, which have been since discontinued, have performed most

--important services I may instance that of the two Herschels at Slough, and

that of Admiral Smyth at Bedford.
   It may not be uninteresting if I describe the nature and utility of some

of the results which these several establishments have furnished to the world :

I say the world advisedly, for scientific facts are the common inheritance of

all mankind.
    But first a word as to the peculiar province of the observatories which are

properly called " public," such as the far-famed Institution at Greenwich.

Their task is now more peculiarly to establish with the last degree of accu-
racy the places of the principal heavenly bodies of our own system, and of

the brighter or fundamental fixed stars, which are about 100 in number.
But in the early stages of Astronomy, we were necessarily indebted to public

Observatories for all the data of the science. On the other hand, their vo-

luntary rivals occupy that portion of the great astronomical field which is

untitled by the professional observer; roving over it according to their own

free will and pleasure, and cultivating with industrious hand such plants as
the more continuous and severe labours of the public Astronomer leave no
time or opportunity to bring to maturity.

   The observations of our private observers have been chiefly devoted to

seven important objects:

    First. The observing and mapping of the smaller stars, under which term
1 include all those which do not form the peculiar province of the public

observer.

    Secondly. The observations of the positions and distances of double stars.
ADDRESS.                                                             xi

Thirdly. Observations, delineations, and Catalogues of the Nebulae.

Fourthly. Observations of the minor planets.

Fifthly. Cometary observations.

   Sixthly. Observations of the solar spots, and other phenomena on the

Sun's disc.

Seventhly. Occultations of stars by the Moon, eclipses of the heavenly

bodies, and other occasional extra-meridional observations.

And first as to cataloguing and mapping the smaller stars. This means,

as you know, the accurate determination by astronomical observation of the

places of those objects, as referred to certain assumed fixed points in the

heavens. The first Star Catalogue worthy to be so called, is that which goes

by the name of Flamsteed's, or the British Catalogue. It contains above

3000 stars, and is the produce of the labours of the first Astronomer Royal

of Greenwich, labours prosecuted under circumstances of great difficulty,

and the results of which were not given to the world in a complete form till

many years had elapsed from the time the observations were made, which

was during the latter half of the seventeenth century. About the middle

of the eighteenth century, the celebrated Dr. Bradley, who also filled the post

of Astronomer Royal, observed an almost equally extensive Catalogue

of Stars, and the beginning of the nineteenth century gave birth to that of

Piazzi of Palermo. These three are the most celebrated of what mav be
now termed the ancient Catalogues. About the year 1830 the attention of
modern astronomers was more particularly directed to the expediency of re-

observing the stars in these three Catalogues, a task which was much faci-

litated by the publication of a very valuable work of the Astronomical

Society, which rendered the calculations of the observations to be made com-

paratively easy, and accordingly observations were commenced and com-

pleted in several public and private Observatories, from which some curious
results were deduced, as e.g., sundry stars were found to be missing, and

others to have what is called proper motion. And now a word as to the

utility of this course of observation. It is well observed by Sir John

Herschel, " that the stars are the landmarks of the Universe; every well-deter-

mined star is a point of departure which can never deceive the astronomer,

Wegeographer, navigator, or surveyor."  must have these fixed points in

order to refer to them all the observations of the wandering heavenly bodies,

the planets and the comets. By these fixed marks we determine the situation

of places on the earth's surface, and of ships on the ocean. When the places of

the stars have been registered, celestial charts are constructed ; and by com-

paring these with the heavens, we at once discover whether any new body

be present in the particular locality under observation : and thus have most

of the fifty-seven small or minor planets between Mars and Jupiter been
discovered. The observations, however, of these smaller stars, and the re-

gistry of their places in Catalogues, and the comparisons of the results ob-

tained at different and distant periods, have revealed another extraordinary
--Ixii REPORT 1860.

fact, no less than that our own Sun is not fixed in space, but that it is con-

stantly moving forward towards a point in the constellation Hercules, at the

rate, as it is supposed, of about 18,000 miles an hour, carrying with it the

whole planetary and cometary system ; and if our Sun moves, probably all

the other stars or suns move also, and the whole universe is in a perpetual

state of motion through space.

The second subject, to which the attention of private observers has been

more particularly directed, is that of double or multiple stars, or those which,

being situated very close to one another, appear single to the naked eye, but

when viewed through powerful telescopes are seen to consist of two or more

stars. The measuring the angles and distances from one another of the two

or more component stars of these systems, has led to the discovery that many

of these very close stars are in fact acting as suns to one another, and revol-

ving round their common centre of gravity, each of them probably carrying

with it a whole system of planets and comets, and perhaps each carried for-

ward through space like our own sun. It became then a point of great in-

terest to determine, whether bodies so far removed from us as these systems,

observed Newton's law of gravityr, and to this end it was necessary to observe
the angles and distances of a great number of these double stars scattered

everywhere through the heavens, for the purpose of obtaining data to com-

pute their orbits. This has been done, and chiefly by private observers; and

the result is that these distant bodies are found to be obedient to the same

laws that prevail in our own system.

The Nebula? are, as it were, systems or rings of stars scattered through space

at incredible distances from our star system, and perhaps from one another;

and there are many of these mysterious clouds of light, and there may be

Nowendless invisible regions of space similarly tenanted.  the nearest fixed

star of our star system whose distance has been measured, is the brightest in the

constellation Centaur, one of the Southern constellations, and this nearest is

yet so far removed, that it takes light, travelling at the rate of about 192,000

miles per second, three years to arrive at the earth from that star. When

we gaze at it, therefore, we see it only as it existed three years ago ; some
great convulsion of nature may have since destroyed it. But there are many

bright stars in our own system, whose distance is so much greater than this,

as a Cygni, for example, that astronomers have not succeeded in measuring it.

What, then, must be the distance of these nebulae, with which so much space

is filled; every component star in which may be a sun, with its own system

of planets and comets revolving round it, each planet inhabited by myriads

of inhabitants I What an overpowering view does this give us of the extent

of creation ! The component stars of these nebulas are so faint and appa-

rently so close together, that it is necessary to use telescopes of great power,

and with apertures so large as to admit a great amount of light, for their ob-

Weservation.  owe it more especially to four individuals, that telescopes

have been constructed, at a great cost and with great mechanical skill, suf-

ficicntly powerful to penetrate these depths of space. Those four indivi-

duals are the Herschefs, father and son, Lord Rosse, and Mr. Wm. Lassell.

That praiseworthy nobleman, Lord Rosse, began his meritorious career by

obtaining a First Class at this University, and has, as you know, spent large

sums of money and displayed considerable mechanical genius in erecting,

near his own Castle in Ireland, an instrument of far greater power than any

other in the world ; and with it he has observed these nebulae, and employed
skilful artists to delineate their forms : and he has moreover made the very

curious discovery, that some of them are arranged in a spiral form, a fact

which gives rise to much interesting speculation on the kind of forces by
which their parts are held together. It were much to be wished that obser-

vations similar to these, and with instruments of nearly the same power,

should be made of the Southern nebulas also; that this generation might
be able to leave to posterity a record of their present configurations. The

distinguished Astronomer, Mr. Wm. Lassell, the discoverer of Neptune's

satellite, has just finished at his own cost an instrument equal to the task,

mounted equatorially ; and I am not without hope that it may, at perhaps

Ano very distant period, be devoted to its accomplishment.  recent com-

munication from him to the Astronomical Society expresses satisfaction with

the mounting of his instrument, and after many trials its great speculum has

at last come forth nearly perfect from his laboratory.

I am, however, warned by the lapse of time, that it will not be possible for

me to exhaust the whole field, the limits of which I have sketched, in which

private enterprise has been assiduously at work to enlarge the bounds of

astronomical knowledge. I will therefore pass at once to the two most in-

teresting subjects which remain, the observations of Comets, and of peculiar

appearances on the Sun's disc.

Of all the phenomena of the heavens, there are none which excite more

general interest than comets, those vagrant strangers, the gipsies as they

have been termed of our solar system, which often come we know not whence,

and at periods when we least expect them : and such is the effect produced

by the strangeness and suddenness of their appearance, and the mysterious

nature of some of the facts connected with them, that while in ignorant times

they excited alarm, they now sometimes seduce men to leave other employ-

ments and become Astronomers. Now, though the larger and brighter

comets naturally excite most general public interest, and are really valuable

to astronomers, as exhibiting appearances which tend to throw light on the

internal structure of these bodies, and the nature of the forces which must

be in operation to produce the extraordinary phenomena observed, yet some

of the smaller telescopic comets are, perhaps, more interesting in a physical

point of view. Thus the six periodical comets, the orbits of which have been

determined with tolerable accuracy, and which return at stated intervals, are

extremely useful as being likely to disclose facts, of which but for them we

should possibly have ever remained ignorant. Thus, for example, when the
lxiv                   REPORT 1860.

comet of Encke, which performs its revolution in a period of a little more than
three years, was observed at each return, it disclosed the important and unex-
pected fact, that its motion was continually accelerated. At each successive
approach to the Sun it arrives at its perihelion sooner and sooner; and there
is no way of accounting for this so satisfactory as that of supposing that the
space, in which the planetary and cometary motions are performed, is every-

where pervaded by a very rarefied atmosphere or ether, so thin as to exercise

no perceptible effect on the movements of massive solid bodies like the planets,
but substantial enough to exert a very important influence on more attenuated
substances moving with great velocity. The effect of the resistance of the

ether is to retard the tangential motion, and allow the attractive force of
gravity to draw the body nearer to the Sun, by which the dimensions of the
orbit are continually contracted and the velocity in it augmented. The final
result will be that after the lapse of ages this comet will fall into the Sun;

this body, a mere hazy cloud, continually flickering as it were like a celestial

moth round the great luminary, is at some distant period destined to be mer-

Nowcilessly consumed.  the discovery of this ether is deeply interesting as

bearing on other important physical questions, such as the undulatory theory
of light; and the probability of the future absorption of comets by the Sun

is important as connected with a very interesting speculation by Professor

William Thomson, who has suggested that the heat and light of the Sun may

be from time to time replenished by the falling in and absorption of count-

less meteors which circulate round him; and here we have a cause revealed

which may accelerate or produce such an event.

In the progress of science it often happens that a particular class of obser-

vations, all at once, and owing to some peculiar circumstance, attracts very

general attention and becomes deeply interesting. This has been the case

within the last few years in reference to observations of the Sun's disc, which

were at one time made by very few individuals, and were indeed very much

neglected both by professional and amateur Astronomers. During this sea-

son of comparative neglect, there were not, however, wanting some enthusiastic

individuals, who were in silence and seclusion obtaining data of great import-

ance.

  On the 1st of September last, at ll h 18m a.m., a distinguished Astronomer,

Mr. Carrington, had directed his telescope to the Sun, and was engaged in

observing his spots, when suddenly two intensely luminous bodies burst into

view on its surface. They moved side by side through a space of about

35,000 miles, first increasing in brightness, then fading away; in 5 minutes

they had vanished. They did not alter the shape of a group of large black

spots which lay directly in their paths. Momentary as this remarkable phe-

nomenon was, it was fortunately witnessed and confirmed, as to one of the
bright lights, by another observer, Mr. Hodgson at Highgate, who by a

happy coincidence had also his telescope directed to the great luminary at

the same instant. It may be, therefore, that these two gentlemen have
ADDRESS.  lxv

actually witnessed the process of feeding the Sun, by the fall of meteoric

matter ; but however this may be, it is a remarkable circumstance, that the

observations at Kew show that on the very day, and at the very hour and

minute of this unexpected and curious phenomenon, a moderate but marked
magnetic disturbance took place; and a storm or great disturbance of the
magnetic elements occurred four hours after midnight, extending to the
southern hemisphere. Thus is exhibited a seeming connexion between mag-

--netic phenomena and certain actions taking place on the Sun's disc a con-

nexion, which the observations of Schwabe, compared with the magnetical
records of our Colonial Observatories, had already rendered nearly certain.
The remarkable results derived from the comparison of the magnetical
observations of Captain Maguire on the shores of the Polar Sea, with the

contemporaneous records of these observatories, have been described by me
on a former occasion. The delay of the Government in re-establishing the

Colonial Observatories has hitherto retarded that further development of the
magnetic laws, which would doubtless have resulted from the prosecution of
such researches.

  We may derive an important lesson from the facts above alluded to.

Here are striking instances in which independent observations of natural
phenomena have been strangely and quite unexpectedly connected together
this tends powerfully to prove, if proof were necessary, that if we are really
ever to attain to a satisfactory knowledge of Nature's laws, it must be accom-
plished by an assiduous watching of all her phenomena, in every department
into which Natural Science is divided. Experience shows that such obser-
vations, if made with all those precautions which long practice combined
with natural acuteness teaches, often lead to discoveries, which cannot be at
all foreseen by the observers, though many years may elapse before the
whole harvest is reaped.

    I cannot allude to the subject of Arctic voyages without congratulating
the Association on the safe return of Sir Leopold M'Clintock and his gallant
band, after accomplishing safely and satisfactorily the object of their inter-

esting mission. The great results accomplished with such small means, and
chiefly by the display of those qualities of indomitable courage, energy and
perseverance which never fail the British seaman in the hour of need, are the
theme of general admiration ; but I may be permitted in passing to express
some regret, that it was left to the devoted affection of a widowed lady,
slightly aided by private contributions, to achieve a victory in which the

--honour of the nation was so largely involved, the rather that the danger of
-- --the enterprise, the pretext for non-interference was much enhanced

thereby, and the accessions to our scientific and geographical knowledge

proportionably curtailed.

   The instances to which I have alluded are only a few of many which

could be adduced of an insufficient appreciation of certain objects of
scientific research. Large sums are expended on matters connected

                                                                                                                                        e

 with science, but this is done on no certain and uniform system ; and

 there is no proper security that those who are most competent to give good

 advice on such questions, should be the actual persons consulted. It was
 partly with the hope of remedying thpse defects and of generally improving
 the position of science in the country in its relation to the Government, that
 the Parliamentary Committee of this Association was established ; and it
 was partly with the same hope that I was induced to accept the honourable
 office of President of the Royal Society, though conscious at the time that

 there were very many far better qualified than myself to hold it. Many of
 those whom I am now addressing are aware of the steps which were adopted

 by the Parliamentary Committee, and subsequently by the Committee of
 Recommendations of this Association, for the purpose of collecting the

--opinions of the cultivators of science on the question, Whether any measures

could be adopted by Government or Parliament that would improve our
position ? The question was afterwards referred to and discussed by the
Council of the Royal Society, who, on the 15th of January, 1857, agreed
upon twelve resolutions in reply thereto. These resolutions recommend,
among other things, that Government grants in aid of local funds should be

applied towards the teaching of science in schools, the formation of Provincial

Museums and Libraries, and the delivery of lectures by competent persons,
accompanied by examinations; and finally, that some existing scientific body,
or some Board to be created for the purpose, should be formally recognized,
which might advise the Government on all matters connected with science,

and especially on the prosecution, reduction, and publication of scientific
researches, and the amount of Parliamentary or other grants in aid thereof;
also on the general principles to be adopted in reference to public scientific
appointments, and on the measures necessary for the more general diffusion

of a knowledge of physical science among the nation at large ; and which
might also be consulted by the Government on the grants of pensions to the
cultivators of science. I' was requested to transmit these resolutions to Lord
Palmerston, and also to the Parliamentary Committee of this Association.
Since that period these resolutions have been discussed by that Committee
but partly because some of its most influential members have expressed

grave doubts as to the expediency of urging their adoption at all, and partly
from the want of a favourable opportunity for bringing them forward, nothing
further has as yet been done. I thought, however, that the time was arrived
at which it was only proper that I should explain the steps which had been

already taken, and the actual position in which the question now stands. If
it be true, as some of our friends imagine, that the recognition of such a body

as has been above described, however useful it might prove if the public
were disposed to put confidence in its suggestions, would only augment that
feeling of jealousy which is disposed to view every application for aid to
scientific research in the light of a request for some personal boon, to be
bestowed on some favoured individual, then indeed its institution would not
ADDRESS.                                           lxvii

be expedient. I only wish that persons who entertain such views, would pay

some attention to the working of the Government Grant Committee of the
Royal Society, a body composed of forty-two persons selected from among

the most eminent cultivators of science, and which is entrusted with the

distribution of an annual sum of £1000, placed by Parliament at the disposal

of the Royal Society at the suggestion of Lord John Russell, in aid of
scientific inquiries. One of the rules of that Committee is, that no sum

whatever shall be given to defray the merely personal expenses of the

experimenters ; all is spent on materials and the construction or purchase of

instruments, except in a very few and rare instances in which travelling ex-

Apenses form the essential feature of the outlay.  list of the objects to which

the grants are devoted has been published by Parliament; among them are

interesting investigations into the laws of heat, the strength of materials used

in building, the best form of boilers, from the bursting of which so many

fatal accidents are continually occurring, the electric conductivity of metals,

so important for telegraphic communication, and into many other questions,
in the solution of which the public generally have the deepest interest. The
cost of these researches has been defrayed by these valuable grants. They

have provided also for the construction of better and standard meteorological

and rnagnetical instruments, for the execution of valuable drawings of scarce

fossils and zoological specimens collected with great labour by distinguished

naturalists, for the reduction and publication of astronomical observations by

some of our most highly esteemed Astronomers, and for physiological re-

searches which have an important bearing on our knowledge of the human

frame. Time indeed would fail me were I to attempt to describe all the good

done and perhaps evil prevented by the distribution of these grants; and

yet no portion of the money can be said to be really received by those to

whom it is appropriated, inasmuch as it is all spent in the various means and

appliances of research ; in short, to quote from a letter addressed to the
Secretary of the Treasury, at a time when the grant was temporarily withheld,

" by the aid of this contribution, the Government has, in fact, obtained for

the advancement of science and the national character, tlie personal and

gratuitous services of men of first-rate eminence, which, without this

comparatively small assistance, would not have been so applied." I think

that we were justified in terming this assistance small; for it is really so

in comparison with the amount of other sums which are applied to analogous

objects, but without that wholesome control of intelligent distributors,

thoroughly and intimately conversant with the characters and competency of

those who apply for the grants. The recognition of such a Board as has

been sketched out by the Council of the Royal Society, may not lead to

a greater expenditure of public money, indeed it is much more likely to

curtail it ; as some who now apply for aid through the interest of persons
having influence with those in authority, who are generally but ill-informed

on the subject-matter of the application, would hesitate long before they

                                                                            e2
lxviii  --report 1860.

made a similar request to those who are thoroughly conversant with it ; and it

is on this account that comparatively few of the applications to the Govern-
ment Grant Committee are rejected. Moreover, inasmuch as every grant
passed by the proposed Board would afterwards receive the jealous scrutiny

of Parliament, whose sanction must of course be obtained, I am disposed to

think that were I to support the establishment of such a scientific Council, or
the formal recognition by the State of some existing scientific body in that
capacity, I should be advocating that which would prove a valuable addition

to the Institutions of my country.
   Before I finally conclude my observations on the important question I

have introduced to your notice, and on which perhaps I have already said

too much at the risk of wearying you, I must guard myself against one
misapprehension, and that is, that we are anxious to obtain a large augmenta-
tion of the 36IOOO now voted by Parliament. This is by no means our wish ;
that annual sum is in ordinary years sufficient, and sometimes more than
sufficient, and there is nothing that would be more deprecated than any
large increase ; but there is a very general feeling among those most
competent to form an opinion on these matters, that when the well-con-
sidered interests of science and the national good demand an extraordinary

outlay, such as cannot be defrayed out of the proceeds of the ordinary yearly

--grant, as, for example, for surveying and exploring expeditions, for the

establishment and maintenance of magnetic observatories, for the purchase

of costly astronomical instruments, for expensive astronomical excursions,

--such as that to Teneriffe, that the expediency of the grant is more likely to

 be properly investigated and tested, if referred to those whose avocations have
 given them the requisite knowledge, than if the concession or rejection of the
 proposal be permitted to depend on such accidents, as, whether this or that

 individual apply, or this or that statesman fill the office of Chancellor of the
 Exchequer.

    I trust that I may be pardoned the long digression in which I have

 indulged, in consideration of the importance of the subject.
     Having detailed some of the valuable services of our amateur Astronomers,

 let me not be accused of being unjust to the professional contributors to the

 data of that noble science. Most valuable Star Catalogues have resulted from
 the labours of our public Observatories, and from Greenwich in particular.
 There are also two Observatories which have, as it were, a quasi public
 character, viz. the Radcliffe Observatory and that of Armagh, which have
 contributed much to this department of Astronomy. Your former President,
 the accomplished and learned Dr. Robinson of Armagh, has lately presented
 to the astronomical world a Catalogue of the places of more than 5000 stars,
  and in so doing has conferred a most important benefit on his favourite

  science.

      But it would be an unpardonable omission were I to neglect to express our
  gratitude to our great National Institution at Greenwich, for the manner in
                         ADDRESS.                                       lxix

which it has consistently discharged the task imposed upon it by its founder

and those who inaugurated its first proceedings. The duty assigned to it

was " to rectify the tables of the motions of the heavens and the places of

the fixed stars, in order to find out the so much desired longitude at sea, for

perfecting the art of navigation ;" and gloriously has it executed its task.

For two centuries it has been at work, endeavouring to give to the determi-

nations of the places of the principal fixed stars and of the heavenly bodies

of our own solar system, and more especially of the Moon, the utmost degree

of precision ; and during the same period, the master minds of Europe have
been engaged in perfecting the analytical theory, by which the many and

most perplexing inequalities of the Moon's motion must be accounted for

and represented, before Tables can be constructed giving the place of our

satellite with that accuracy that the modern state of science demands.

The very important task of calculating such Tables has just been finished.

Our able and accomplished Director of the National Observatory, Mr. Airy,

had caused all the observations of the Moon made at Greenwich, from 1750

to 1830, to be reduced upon one uniform system, employing constants

derived from the best modern researches ; and a distinguished Danish Pro-

fessor, who had been for some time engaged in calculating new Tables of the

Moon, availed himself of the data so furnished. Professor Hansen happily

brought to his task all the accomplishments of a practised observer, and of

one of the most able analysts of modern times, combined with the most

determined industry and perseverance. In the completion of it he was

liberally assisted by our Government, at a time when an unhappy war had

deprived the Danish Government of the means of further aiding their Pro-

fessor, and a great astronomical work had been suspended for want of £300,

a sum which many do not hesitate to spend on the purchase of some, useless

luxury. Professor Hansen's Tables are now finished and published. They

agree admirably with the Greenwich Observations with which they have

been compared, and the mode of their execution has been approved by those

competent to express an opinion on such a subject. They have been

rewarded also with the Gold Medal of the Astronomical Society, a distinction

never lightly bestowed.

In paying this tribute to the merit of Professor Hansen, I must not be

understood as wishing to ignore, far less depreciate, that of three very emi-

--nent geometers Plana, Lubbock, and Pontecoulant, who have devoted

years of anxious and perhaps ill-requited labour to the investigation of the

Lunar inequalities, but who have never yet embodied the results in the only

form useful to Navigation, that of Tables.

  A curious controversy has lately arisen on the subject of the acceleration

of the Moon's motion, which is now exciting great interest among mathe-

maticians and physical astronomers. Professor Adams and M. Delaunay

MM.take one view of the question ;  Plana, Pontecoulant, and Hansen the

other. Mr. Airy, Mr. Main the President of theAstronomical Society, and
1XX REPORT-- 1860.

 Sir John Lubbock support the conclusions at which Professor Adams has
 arrived. The question in dispute is strictly mathematical ; and it is a very
 remarkable circumstance in the history of Astronomy, that such great names

 should be ranged on opposite sides, seeing that the point involved is really
no other than whether certain analytical operations have been conducted on
right principles ; and it is a proof therefore, if any were wanting, of the extra-

ordinary complexity and difficulty of these transcendental inquiries. The

--controversy is of the following nature : The Moon's motion round the Earth,

which would be otherwise uniform, is disturbed by the Sun's attraction ; any
cause therefore which affects the amount of that attraction affects also the
Moon's motion : now, as the excentricity of the Earth's orbit is gradually
decreasing, the average distance of the Sun is slightly increasing every year,

and his disturbing force becomes less ; hence the Moon is brought nearer the

Earth, but at the rate of less than one inch yearly ; her gravitation towards the
Earth is greater, and her motion is proportionably accelerated. It is on the

secular acceleration of the Moon's mean motion, arising from this minute

yearly approach, that the dispute has arisen; so infinitesimally small are the

quantities within the reach of modern analysis. Mr. Adams asserts that his

predecessors have improperly omitted the consideration of the effect produced
by the action of that part of the Sun's disturbing force which acts in the
direction of a tangent to the Moon's orbit, and which increases the velocity

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

his opponents deny that it is necessary to take this into account at all. Had
not M. Delaunay, an able French analyst, by a perfectly independent pro-
cess, confirmed the results of Professor Adams, we should have had the

English and Continental Astronomers waging war on an algebraical question.

On the other hand, however, the computations of the ancient Lunar Eclipses

support the views of the Continent ; but if Mr. Adams's mathematics are
correct, this only shows that there must be other causes in operation as yet
undiscovered, which influence the result; and it is not at all unlikely that
this most curious and interesting controversy will eventually lead to some
important discovery in Physical Astronomy.

   You are aware that at the suggestion of Sir John Herschel an instrument

was constructed for the Kew Observatory, to which the name of Photohelio-

graph has been given, because it is adapted solely to the purpose of obtaining

photographic representations of the appearances on the Sun's disc. Many

difficulties have been encountered in the use of this instrument, but by the

zealous exertions of the late Mr. Welsh, Mr. Beckley, and Mr. De la Rue,

they have been overcome. It is to the last-named gentleman, so distinguished
for his successful prosecution of celestial photography, that the Royal Society

have entrusted a grant of money to enable him to transport the Photohelio-
graph to Spain, to observe the total eclipse of the Sun, which is now
approaching, and great interest will attach to records of the phenomena of

the eclipse thus obtaiued.

   In Chemistry I am informed that great activity has been displayed, espe-
ADDRESS.  lxxi

   cially in the organic department of the science. For several years past pro-

  cesses of substitution (or displacement of one element or organic group by
  another element or group more or less analogous) have been the main agents
  employed in investigation, and the results to which they have led have been
  truly wonderful ; enabling the chemist to group together separate compounds

  of comparatively simple constitution into others much more complex, and
  thus to imitate, up to a certain point, the phenomena which take place within

  the growing plant or animal. It is not indeed to be anticipated that the
  chemist should ever be able to produce by the operations of the laboratory
  the arrangement of the elements in the forms of the vegetable cell or the

 animal fibre; but he may hope to succeed in preparing some of the complex

  results of secretion or of chemical changes produced within the living

--organism, changes, which furnish definite crystallizable compounds, such

 as the formiates and the acetates, and which he has actually obtained by
  operations independent of the plant or the animal.

     Hofmann, in pursuing the chemical investigation of the remarkable com-
 pound which he has termed Triethylphosphine, has obtained some very
 singular compound ammonias. Triethylphosphine is a body which takes fire
 spontaneously when its vapour is mixed with oxygen, at a temperature a little
 above that of the body. It may be regarded as ammonia in which an atom
 of phosphorus has taken the place of nitrogen, and in which the place of each
 of the three atoms of hydrogen in ammonia is supplied by ethyl, the peculiar
 hydrocarbon of ordinary alcohol. From this singular base Hofmann has
 succeeded in procuring other coupled bases, which though they do not cor-
 respond to any of the natural alkalies of the vegetable kingdom, such as
 morphia, quinia, or strychnia, yet throw some light upon the mode in which
 complex bodies more or less resembling them have been formed.

    The power which nitrogen possesses of forming a connecting link between

the groups of substances of comparatively simple constitution, has been

remarkably exemplified by the discovery of a new class of amide acids by
Griess, in which he has pointed out a new method, which admits of very
general application, of producing complex bodies related to the group of
acids, in some measure analogous to the Poly-ammonias of Hofmann.

   Turning to the practical applications of Chemistry, we may refer to the
beautiful dyes now extracted from aniline, an organic base formerly obtained

as a chemical curiosity from the products of the distillation of coal-tar, but

now manufactured by the hundred- weight in consequence of the extensive
demand for the beautiful colours known as Mauve, Magenta, and Solferino,

which are prepared by the action of oxidizing agents, such as bichromate of
potash, corrosive sublimate, and iodide of mercury upon aniline.

   Nor has the Inorganic department of Chemistry been deprived of its due
share of important advances. Schbnbein has continued his investigations
upon ozone, and has added many new facts to our knowledge of this
interesting substance; and Andrews and Tait, by their elaborate investigations,
lxxii  --REPORT 1860.

have shown that ozone, whether admitted to be an allotropic modification of

oxygen or not, is certainly much more dense than oxygen in its ordinary

condition.

   In Metallurgy we may point to the investigations of Deville upon the

platinum group of metals, which are especially worthy of remark on account
of the practical manner in which he has turned to account the resources of
the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, as an agent which must soon be very generally
adopted for the finer description of metallurgic operations at high tempera-

tures. By using lime as the material of his crucibles and as the support for

the metals upon which he is operating, several very important practical
advantages have been obtained. The material is sufficiently infusible to
resist the intense heat employed ; it is a sufficiently bad conductor of heat
to economize very perfectly the high temperature which is generated ; and

it may be had sufficiently free from foreign admixture to prevent it from

contaminating the metals upon which the operator is employed.
   The bearing of some recent geological discoveries on the great question

of the high antiquity of Man was brought before your notice at your last

Meeting at Aberdeen by Sir Charles Lyell in his opening address to the
Geological Section. Since that time many French and English naturalists
have visited the valley of the Sorame in Picardy, and confirmed the opinion

originally published by M. Boucher de Perthes in 184*7, and afterwards con-

firmed by Mr. Prestwich, Sir C. Lyell, and other geologists from personal
examination of that region. It appears that the position of the rude flint-
implements, which are unequivocally of human workmanship, is such, at
Abbeville and Amiens, as to show that they are as ancient as a great mass of
gravel which fills the lower parts of the valley between those two cities, ex-
tending above and below them. This gravel is an ancient fluviatile alluvium
 by no means confined to the lowest depressions (where extensive and deep
 peat-mosses now exist), but is sometimes also seen covering the slopes of the
 boundary hills of chalk, at elevations of 80 or 100 feet above the level of the
 Somme. Changes therefore in the physical geography of the country, com-
 prising both the filling up with sediment and drift and the partial re-excava-
 tion of the valley, have happened since old river-beds were at some former
period the receptacles of the worked flints. The number of these last, already
 computed at above 1400 in an area of fourteen miles in length and half a
 mile in breadth, has afforded to a succession of visitors abundant opportunities

 of verifying the true geological position of the implements.

    The old alluvium, whether at higher or lower levels, consists not only of
 the coarse gravel with worked flints above mentioned, but also of superim-
 posed beds of sand and loam, in which are many freshwater and land shells,
 for the most part entire, and of species now living in the same part of France.

 With the shells are found bones of the Mammoth and an extinct Rhinoceros,

  R. lichorhinus, an extinct species of deer, and fossil remains of the Horse, Ox,
  and other animals. These are met with in the overlying beds, and sometimes
ADDRESS.  Ixxiii

 also in the gravel where the implements occur. At Menchecourt, in the sub-

 urbs of Abbeville, a nearly entire skeleton of the Siberian Rhinoceros is said
 to have been taken out about forty years ago, a fact affording an answer to the

question often raised, as to whether the bones of the extinct mammalia could
have been washed out of an older alluvium into a newer one, and so rcdepo-
sited and mingled with the relics of human workmanship. Far-fetched as was

this hypothesis, I am informed that it would not, if granted, have seriously
shaken the proof of the high antiquity of the human productions, for that

proof is independent of organic evidence or fossil remains, and is based on

physical data. As was stated to us last year by Sir C. Lyell, we should still

have to allow time for great denudation of the chalk, and the removal from
place to place, and the spreading out over the length and breadth of a large
valley of heaps of chalk flints in beds from 10 to 15 feet in thickness, covered
by loams and sands of equal thickness, these last often tranquilly deposited,
all of which operations would require the supposition of a great lapse of time.

    That the mammalian fauna preserved under such circumstances should be
found to diverge from the type now established in the same region, is con-
sistent with experience ; but the fact of a foreign and extinct fauna was not
needed to indicate the great age of the gravel containing the worked flints.

    Another independent proof of the age of the same gravel and its asso-
ciated fossiliferous loam is derived from the large deposits of peat above
alluded to in the valley of the Somme, which contain not only monuments
of the Roman, but also those of an older Stone Period, usually called Celtic.
Bones also of the Bear, of the species still inhabiting the Pyrenees, and of
the Beaver, and many large stumps of trees, not yet well examined by bota-
nists, are found in the same peat, the oldest portion of which belongs to
times far beyond those of tradition; yet distinguished geologists are of opi-
nion that the growth of all the vegetable matter, and even the original scoop-
ing out of the hollows containing it, are events long posterior in date to the
gravel with flint implements, nay, posterior even to the formation of the up-
permost of the layers of loam with freshwater shells overlying the gravel.

   The exploration of caverns, both in the British Isles and other parts of
Europe, has in the last few years been prosecuted with renewed ardour and
success, although the theoretical explanation of many of the phenomena

brought to light seems as yet to baffle the skill of the ablest geologists.
Dr. Falconer has given us an account of the remains of several hundred
Hippopotami obtained from one cavern near Palermo, in a locality where

there is now no running water. The same palaeontologist, aided by Col.
Wood of Glamorganshire, has recently extracted from a single cave in the
Gower peninsula of South Wales, a vast quantity of the antlers of a reindeer

(perhaps of two species of reindeer), both allied to the living one. These
fossils are most of them shed horns ; and there have been already no less

than 1100 of them dug out of the mud filling one cave.

   In the cave of Brixham in Devonshire, and in another near Palermo in
lxxiv  --REPORT 1860.

Sicily, flint implements were observed by Dr. Falconer, associated in such a

manner with the bones of extinct mammalia, as to lead him to infer that Man

must have coexisted with several lost species of quadrupeds; and M.deVibraye
has also this spring called attention to analogous conclusions at which he
has arrived, by studying the position of a human jaw with teeth, accom-
panied by the remains of a mammoth, under the stalagmite of the Grotto
d'Arcis near Troyes in France.

   In the recent progress of Physiology, I am informed that the feature per-

haps most deserving of note on this occasion is the more extended and suc-
cessful application of Chemistry, Physics, and the other collateral sciences
to the study of the Animal and Vegetable Economy. In proof I refer to
the great and steady advances which have, within the last few years, been
made in the chemical history of Nutrition, the statics and dynamics of the
blood, the investigation of the physical phenomena of the senses, and the
electricity of nerves and muscles. Even the velocity of the nerve-force

itself has been submitted to measurement. Moreover, when it is now de-
sired to apply the resources of Geometry or Analysis to the elucidation of
the phenomena of life, or to obtain a mathematical expression of a physiolo-

gical law, the first care of the investigator is to acquire precise experimental

data on which to proceed, instead of setting out with vague assumptions and
ending with a parade of misdirected skill, such as brought discredit on the
school of the mathematical physicians of the Newtonian period.

   But I cannot take leave of this department of knowledge without likewise
alluding to the progress made in scrutinizing the animal and vegetable

--structure by means of the microscope more particularly the intimate or-

ganization of the brain, spinal cord, and organs of the senses ; also to the
extension, through means of well-directed experiment, of our knowledge of
the functions of the nervous system, the course followed by sensorial im-
pressions and motorial excitement in the spinal cord, and the influence
exerted by or through the nervous centres on the movements of the heart,
blood-vessels and viscera, and on the activity of the secreting organs;

subjects of inquiry, which, it may be observed, are closely related to the
question of the organic mechanism whereby our corporeal frame is influ-

enced by various mental conditions.

   And now, in conclusion, I may perhaps be permitted to express the hope

that the examples I have given of some of the researches and discoveries
which occupy the attention of the cultivators of science, may have tended to
illustrate the sublime nature, engrossing interest and paramount utility of
such pursuits, from which their beneficial influence in promoting the intel-
lectual progress and the happiness and well-being of mankind may well be
inferred. But let us assume that to any of the classical writers of antiquity,
sacred or profane, a sudden revelation had been made of all the wonders
involved in Creation accessible to man ; that to them had been disclosed not
only what we now know, but what we are to know hereafter, in some future
                                                                           ABDRESS.                               lxXV

                                                                        ;

marvels of the Creator's power ? They would have described the secret

forces by which the wandering orbs of light are retained in their destined

paths ; the boundless extent of the celestial spaces in which worlds on
worlds are heaped ; the wonderful mechanism by which light and heat are

conveyed through distances which to mortal minds seem quite unfathom-

able ; the mysterious agency of electricity, destined at one time to awaken

men's minds to an awful sense of a present Providence, but in after-times

to become a patient minister of man's will, and convey his thoughts with

the speed of light across the inhabited globe ; the beauties and prodigies

of contrivance which the animal and vegetable world display, from man-

kind downwards to the lowest zoophyte, from the stately oak of the pri-

meval forest to the humblest plant which the microscope unfolds to view;

the history of every stone on the mountain brow, of every gay-coloured

--insect which nutters in the sun-beam; all would have been described, and

all which the discoveries of our more fortunate posterity will in due time

disclose, and in language such as none but they could command. It is re-

set ved for future ages to sing such a glorious hymn to the Creator's praise.

But is there not enough now seen and heard to make indifference to the

wonders around us a deep reproach, nay, almost a crime ? If we have neither

leisure nor inclination to track the course of the planet and comet through

boundless space ; to follow the wanderings of the subtle fluid in the galvanic

coil or the nicely poised magnet ; to read the world's history written on her

ancient rocks, the sepulchres of stony relics of ages long gone past, to analyse

with curious eye the wonderful combinations of the primitive elements and

the secret mysteries of form and being in animal and plant; discovering

everywhere connecting links and startling analogies and proofs of adaptation

--of means to ends ; all tending to charm the senses, to teach, to reclaim a

being, who seems but a creeping worm in the presence of this great Creation

--What, I repeat, if we will not or cannot do these things, or any of these

things, is that any reason why these speaking marvels should be to us almost

as though they were not ? Marvels indeed they are, but they are also myste-

ries, the unravelling of some of which tasks to the utmost the highest order
of human intelligence. Let us ever apply ourselves seriously to the task,
feeling assured that the more we thus exercise, and by exercising improve
our intellectual faculties, the more worthy shall we be, the better shall we
be fitted to come nearer to our God.

                                    ON

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Report on Observations of Luminous Meteors, 1859-60. By a Com-
   mittee, consisting of James Glaisher, Esq., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.,
   Secretary to the British Meteorological Society, fyc. ; J. H. Glad-

   stone, Esq., Ph.D., F.R.S. %c; R. P. Greg, Esq., F.G.S. fyc.

   and E. J. Lowe, Esq., F.R.A.S., M.B.M.S. $c.

In presenting a continuation of the Reports on the Observation of Luminous
Meteors, it will be seen that the work is now placed in the hands of a Com-

mittee, and it is with sincere regret that in presenting their first report,

they have to announce the loss of Professor Powell, who died on the 11th
of June, 1860. The preceding twelve reports were carried on solely by

Professor Powell, but from the further prosecution of this labour he felt

compelled to retire some little time since on account of failing health, having

made arrangements for the continuation of the reports. Within the past

year there does not seem to have been any unusual exhibition of meteors,

either in August or in November; and there is little to be added to the ob-

servations themselves ; in one instance only was the same meteor seen by two
different persons, viz. that observed at Wrottesley Observatory and at Baldoyle

(county Dublin), on March 10, 1860: this meteor was remarkable for its
form and for its variation in colour, as noticed by both observers. It is much

to be regretted that the observations of this meteor yet collected are insuf-

ficient to trace its path, velocity, &c. ; it is scarcely possible that so re-

markable a meteor, visible from points so distant, can have passed unnoticed,

and it is very desirable that if any observations may have been taken of it,

that they should be forwarded to the Committee, for the purpose of being

submitted to calculation.

   M. Julius Schmidt, now of the Royal Athens Observatory, in a communi-

cation to M. W. Haidinger of Vienna, read by the latter at Vienna the 6th

of October, 1859, before the Imperial Academy, has made some valuable

observations upon some phenomena relative to the luminous tails of meteors,

of which a resume is given in the Appendix. An interesting paper has
appeared in the Philosophical Magazine, April I860, "On Luminosity of

Meteors from Solar Reflexion," by R. P. Greg, Esq. ; a brief analysis is given

in the Appendix. In the Journal of the Franklin Institute there is a very
interesting account of a large meteor seen over a large extent of country by

daylight, on November 15, 1859; an abstract of this paper also appears in the

Appendix.

 --No. 1. In the Journal of the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, February

1860, is a collection of observations of a very remarkable meteor seen by

daylight, on November 15, 1859, by Benjamin P. Marsh, Esq.
   This meteor made its appearance at about half-past 9 o'clock a.m. (New

York time), the weather being perfectly clear, and the sun shining brightly/

   It was seen at Salem, Boston, and New Bedford, Massachusetts ; Provi-
dence, Rhode Island ; New Haven, and many other places in Connecticut
New York City ; Paterson, Medford, and Tuckerton, New Jersey ; Dover,

and other places in Delaware ; Washington City ; Alexandria, Fredericks-

burg, and Petersburg, Virginia.

   It was heard at Medford, New Jersey, and at all places in that State, south

of a line joining Tuckerton and Bridgeton, and throughout nearly the whole

of Delaware.

   With perhaps two or three exceptions, it wa3 not seen by any one in New

Jersey, south of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad ; that is to say, through-

out the very region xohere the report ivas loudest.

   Many persons there saw a momentary flash of light "like the reflexion of
the sun from a looking-glass," but could not tell where it came from. The
appearance of the meteor as seen at many places is described, and the results

from their discussion are as follows:

   1. The inclination of the meteor's point to the vertical was probably about
35°, and the direction of its motion nearly west. The observations at Med-
ford and Petersburg indicate a much more southerly movement, but those of

Washington, Alexandria, and Dover, require it to have been almost due west.

   2. The column of smoke was near 1000 feet in diameter, and its base was
                                                                                                                                                                                                .;

vertical about four miles north of Dennisville, at a height of near eight miles,

which may be assumed to be the approximate position of one point in the

meteor's path. The height is inferred not merely from the angular elevations

of the smoke as seen from different points, but from the interval between the

flash and the report, as observed at Beasley's Point. This position assigned

to the base of the cloud, from local reports, coincides pretty nearly with that

indicated by distant observations.

       At New Haven, latitude 40° 18' 18", longitude 72° 55' 10", at an eleva-

tion of 6°, the bearing was S. 35° 34' W. ; and at Alexandria, latitude 38° 49',

longitude 77° 4', at an elevation of 10^°, it was N. 76i° E. These directions

meet half a mile west of Dennisville in latitude 39° 1 V, longitude 74° 50^'
                                                                                                                                                                                                             1

the line from New Haven having a vertical height at this point of 2V|

miles, and that from Alexandria 24| miles. Continuing the path, as ob-

served at Alexandria, down to 9^° elevation, we have corresponding azimuth

76^°, and the lines then meet half a mile north-west of Dennisville at a

height of 22^ miles; but this makes the nearest point in the meteor's path

twenty-four miles from Beasley's Point, and consequently the interval there

between the flash and the report two minutes instead of one, as observed.

Besides, the observations on the smoke show pretty clearly that the minimum

Weheight at Dennisville could not have exceeded ten miles.                     must there-

fore conclude the meteor's actual position to have been several miles east of

that indicated by these distant observations.

       3. On the above supposition, the meteor's path would reach the earth near

Hughesville, on the north-western boundary of Cape May County, in which

vicinity, or perhaps still further west, it is probable that the meteor or some

of its fragments will yet be found.

       4. Some observers must have seen the meteor at a height of more than
--14 REPORT 1860.

100 miles ; and, to have completed its path within their estimates of time, it

must have had a velocity of from thirty to fifty miles per second.

The extreme shortness of the time occupied in its flight, is proved not

merely by the estimates of several observers, but by the failure of people in

the vicinity of the explosion to distinguish the source of the sudden flash of

light seen by them, and by the impression of even the most distant observers

that it fell very near them.

5. The sound was explosive, and not caused by the falling in of the air

after the meteor. In the latter case it must have been continuous and un-

interrupted, but the testimony of Dr. Beasley and others shows that it ceased

entirely and then began again.

Supposing the meteor to have been a stony mass, we may, perhaps, con-

sider the explosion to have consisted of a series of decrepitations caused by

the sudden expansion of the surface, the whole time of flight not being suffi-

cient to allow the heat to penetrate the mass. At the forward end these ex-

plosions would take place under great pressure, which may account for the

loudness of the sound.

6. The estimated duration of the sound at Beasley's Point was not less

than one minute, indicating that the most distant point of the explosion was

not less than twelve miles further from that place than its nearest point.

Comparing this with the position of the assumed path, we find that, during

the explosion, the meteor must have travelled fifteen or twenty miles, occu-

pying about a second of time.

7. The explosions were very numerous, arranged in two series, the whole

occupying only half a second of time, but the individual sounds were distin-

guishable, because of the different distances they had to travel to reach the

ear. The velocity of the meteor being more than 100 times that of sound,

the reports must have come in the order of distance and not in the order of

their occurrence, causing the end of the explosion to be heard before the

beginning. The faint rushing sounds first heard by Mr. Ashmead must

have had their origin below the explosion, and been caused by the flight of

the fragments towards the earth. If the direction of the first faint sound
could be indicated by persons further west, it might serve to point to the

place where the fragments fell.

   8. The meteor lost its luminosity with the explosion or shortly after, and

hence was not seen by persons in Cape May County and vicinity, it being
too much overhead to come within the ordinary range of vision, and the time

of flight being too short to allow them to direct their eyes to it after seeing

the flash.

If the heat be due to the resistance of the air, it must be principally deve-

loped at the surface of the forward half of the meteor. Consequently

most of the explosions must occur then, and the force of each be directed

backward, tending to check the velocity of the mass. In fact, we may per-

haps consider the series of explosions to be merely one of the forms of the

atmospheric resistance. This must increase rapidly with the density, although

it may be insufficient to account for so great a reduction of speed as would

entirely destroy the luminosity of the meteor before it reached the earth.

   9. From the tremendous force of the explosion, and from the fact that this
meteor was seen by persons who were not within 200 miles of any part of

its path, as at Salem, Massachusetts, and Petersburg, Virginia, we must cer-

tainly conclude  that it was of very considerable size                                                                                                                                                     but we  seem  to  have

 series, in which he found that a piece of lime, less than half an inch in dia-
 meter, in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, had, when viewed in a clear
 evening, at the distance of half a mile, an apparent diameter twice that of the
Full moon, show conclusively that no reliance can be placed upon calculations
founded upon the apparent diameter of bodies in a state of incandescence.

    10. The apparent form of the meteor, that of a cone moving base fore-
most, may have been due to its great angular velocity, combined with the
effect of irradiation above referred to. The impression made upon the eye
by the incandescent body itself, would doubtless be greater than that made
by the sphere of light surrounding it. Consequently we should continue to
see the body itself after the impression of the mere glare had faded awav
so that the apparent diameter of the end of the tail may represent the actual

angular diameter of the body.

    11. The invisibility of the meteor to persons at Philadelphia and vicinity,

was no doubt due to the position of the sun, the direction of which then
coincided with that of the meteor.

a theory partially supported by Sir J. Lubbock and others. He observes

that the very sudden appearance and disappearance of shooting-stars and
small meteors, and their general resemblance on a small scale to comets which
shine by solar reflexion, certainly favour the idea, either that suddenly enter-
ing the cone of the earth's shadow they are instantly eclipsed, or conversely,
become visible as they emerge from it; or secondly, previously self-luminous

in planetary space, they may become suddenly extinguished on entering the
denser atmosphere of the earth ; or thirdly, they may suddenly become visi-

ble and luminous only on entering the earth's atmosphere by friction and
compression, by rapid absorption of oxygen and sudden chemical action, or
by electrical excitation.

   The author then refers to Sir J. Lubbock's paper in the Philosophical
Magazine for February 1848, and shows by a different treatment how un-

likely, if not impossible, it is that ordinary shooting-stars (those not show-
ing symptoms of active ignition within the lower limits of the earth's atmo-
sphere) can ever shine by reflected solar light ; and this simply from the fact
that they would be too far off for us to observe such small bodies, at even

the minimum distance at which (at certain times and places on the earth's
surface when and where we know they are very frequently seen) they

actually could be so visible ; and concludes his paper by remarking that, if
his calculations, &c. be correct, the majority of shooting-stars do not shine
by reflected light.

  --No. 3. M. Schmidt on the Luminous Trains left by Meteors, &c.

   M. Schmidt repeats an observation of M. Faye's in the ' Comptes Rendus,'

vol. xxxii. p. 667, relative to the small amount of moveability in the tails or
luminous trains not unfrequently left by meteors, which seems to prove that
the former must be found in the atmosphere belonging to and surrounding
the earth, and not in the firmament which lies beyond it. M. Faye observed
one of these tails through the telescope, and he saw it " lingering for more

--than three minutes, without changing its place very perceptibly. Other

observers have observed them to remain for more than seven minutes." M.
 1G REPORT 1860.

 Schmidt remarks on the strangeness of this stationary condition of the lumi-
 nous trains of meteors, likewise on the cloud-like appearances generally left

 by detonating meteors even in the day-time, when we come to consider the
 enormous velocity of the meteors themselves through the higher regions of
 the atmosphere ; but he says, " we must recollect an easy and interesting ex-
 periment, by which we may obtain a similar result. If you take a common
 lucifer match, still burning, or when it is just about to become extinguished,

 and throw it from you in any direction, either quickly or slowly, you will

 in many cases perceive, either a straight immoveable line, or an undulating

 or curling line of white-grey smoke, standing still in the air, if the air is calm
 and not in motion."

    M. Schmidt observes how important observations, whether telescopic or

--otherwise, are respecting the tails of meteors, 1st, as regards their proper

 motion ; 2nd, the downward curvature sometimes exhibited by them, and
 the way in which they break up and disperse; and 3rd, the means they may
 afford of ascertaining by parallax their height above the earth, a matter of
 very great importance for ascertaining at what heights the atmosphere ceases
 to have any influence.

    M. Schmidt then proceeds to cite a number of instances from his own

catalogue of meteors, where tails have been observed of long duration, or as

offering very peculiar appearances: e.g.

   AI66i. Aug. 3. very large meteor with curved tail, seen at Papa, Hun-

 gary.

    1791. Nov. 11. At Gottingen and Lilienthal, a meteor left an undulating
tail of a shining white colour, in parts alternately showing the prismatic
colours ; then became more curved, and turned into vapour of a pale yellow-

 ish colour before finally disappearing.

    1798. Oct. 9. Brandes witnessed at Gottineren how the tail of a bright

shooting-star bent itself within 15 seconds like a bow.

    1840. July 30. Ditto at Vienna, in 15 seconds also.

    1815. Oct. 24-. Schmidt observed at Bonn the change in the form of the
tail of a meteor in 4 minutes; it became severed and bent, and dissolved
into small grey clouds. The whole mass moved 1° from its original place at

final disappearance.

   A1853. Oct. 26. large meteor seen in Pomerania, left behind it a spiral

tail 3° long, which contracted soon into a ball, and again passed into a spiral
curve, finally assuming the shape of a capital Z.

   185k Aug. 1. At Gottingen, a fine meteor left behind a bright tail 3'

wide and 2° in length, lasted 8 or 9 minutes after dividing itself into three
oval balls, and showing at first uneven undulations or knots, while the tail itself

shortened and became more like a W. Whilst these changes took place in the

tail, the whole mist-like mass moved along the sky in a nearly opposite direc-
tion to the motion of the fireball itself; the tail had thus moved 9° in 8 minutes.

   1859. Aug. 9, 10, 11. During these three nights, M. Schmidt at Athens

succeeded in observing, on four different occasions, the curving of meteor-

tails through the telescope. The whole time, in three cases of visibility, was
170", 140", and 220" respectively ; in one case only 10" or 12". The curva-

ture of the tail began to be perceptible almost directly after the meteor
vanished, and the proper motion in one direction very decided. In one of
these cases, viz. on Aug. 11, a bright orange-coloured shooting-star left a tail
visible to the naked eye 4-" or 5", but through the telescope 220"; the direc-
tion about from E.N.E. to»W.S.W. The following figure shows the real mo-
tion of the tail, compared with the apparent motion of the shooting-star.

   The tail finally broke up into a number of small fragments.

       fit I

   M. Schmidt states that credible cases, where the tails of meteors and shoot-
ing-stars remain visible longer than 5 seconds, are very rare and isolated. He
cites thirty-nine instances from his own catalogue, of which we select seven

instances of longest duration.

1751. May 26.    3" 30m     Kraschina (Agram meteoric iron fall).

                    30m

   Among the thirty-nine instances given by M. Schmidt, there were more

than one instance of the tail winding or doubling itself up, nay, of even
vanishing and then re-appearing.

                                           Duration of Meteors.

   M. Schmidt also offers further remarks on the duration of meteors, and he
observes how rarely they are visible for more than 1 second; that 0' 2" to

1' 5" is the usual time of visibility; the practised observer knows that the

majority in fact of shooting-stars only shine during the fraction of a second.

   In all probability the short moment during which the light shines is at the
same time the moment of its partial and final extinction.

   The time during which a shooting-star is visible is a subject for the art of
more refined observation, and M. Schmidt hopes that much attention will be

directed "towards determining the duration with regard to colours and any
anomalous motions of meteors." In his treatise on Meteors, p. 15, M. Schmidt
states how long the tails or luminous trains of meteors remain visible, with

regard to colour, viz. as follows :

                            sec.                       Mean error.

   If we consider the time during which the light of the meteor itself lasted
without regard to any other phenomena, we find in his catalogue the follow-
ing instances which show that in the case of many thousand observations
it is very rare that a shooting-star or meteor remains visible for more than 5

seconds.

indirectly opposed to that hypothesis: since it is a difficult matter thoroughly

to refute old objections, however untenable, I may perhaps be permitted here

to refer to them, and to refer to numbers instead of to opinions.

  We" all know that the intensity of the light of shooting-stars is estimated

according to the brightness of the stars, and we therefore, e. g., say that a
meteor is of the first magnitude when its light equals that of Arcturus or
Vega. If it shines brighter than Jupiter or Venus, we designate it a small
fireball. If we put such numerical values for the shooting-stars so as to
express the intensity of their light, and if we call /* the mean height of the
shining portion of the luminous track above the surface of the earth, we

obtain the following mean proportional values, which, in the year 1851, I

deduced from the observations then made (see my work, p. Ill) :

Meteor of 1st magnitude, h=16'2 geographical miles, for 14 observations.

Meteor of 2nd magnitude, h=\5'9 geographical miles, for 20 observations.

=Meteor of 3rd magnitude, h l0'8 geographical miles, for 24 observations.

h=Meteor of 4th magnitude,  8*5 geographical miles, for 21 observations.

Hence, therefore, it follows that the large meteors belong to the highest
regions of the earth, where, as we generally suppose, there exists scarcely any
air at all ; that, however, the small meteors which have a feeble light are seen
nearest to the earth, and occupy the limits of the atmosphere, where the latter
still exists in a greater and more perceptible degree, and that they descend
still lower. It is therefore not the oxygen of the air which is in the main the
chief cause and origin of the burning or glowing of the meteors."

 --Note by Mr. Greg. That the smaller shooting-stars are frequently nearer

than the larger meteors, may possibly be still further supposed to be true,
from the fact that usually they are seen to move more rapidly than the larger
ones. Still exceptions may exist, as in the case of very large, and probably
aerolitic fireballs moving horizontally and parallel to the horizon.

   The height at which meteors are not merely luminous, but can leave nearly
stationary trains of light, is truly surprising ; one would almost have
imagined, at that distance from the surface of the earth, some retardation in
space of the attenuated and upper stratum of air, as compared with the rapid
movement of the earth on its own axis.

    It is to be regretted that the extreme limits of the auroral regions are not
yet more precisely ascertained ; but it is not improbable that shooting-stars

are commonly visible, or luminous, precisely in that very region, and that
their luminosity may to some extent be owing to electrical excitation.

    In the 'Comptes Rendus,' vol. xlv. for 1857, p. 257, M. Coulvier-Gravier
 remarks, in a series of observations on the August periodical meteors during
a period of twelve years, that the maximum number per hour, from 9 p.m. to
 10 p.m., are seen between the N.E. and E.N.E. to 2° 5' of N.E. From 2 to
 3 a.m., between E.S.E. and S.E., 3° of E.S.E. From 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. the
maximum has advanced 65° towards the South (or 11° per hour); so that
one would conclude that at 6 a.m. the maximum would be between the S.

and S.S.E., 7° of S.S.E.

    The above is also confirmed by the general result for other months of the
year, i.e. the maximum for August being in the morning between the S. and

S.S.E., the general average for the year, of shooting-stars, being E.S.E.

    Mr. G. C. Bompas's valuable generalizations on this fact of the number
of meteors increasing regularly from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., as that the number
appearing in the East is double the number originating in the West, are given
in a resume at p. 131 of the volume of the British Association Reports for

1857, held at Dublin.

 --No. 5. Mr. R. P. Greg gives the following results, taken from a catalogue

he has constructed of the most remarkable meteors on record, as regards
their general observed direction ; without reference, however, to the precise
hours of observation, a matter probably of less consequence in very large
meteors moving near the earth's surface, than in the case of ordinary sporadic

shooting-stars.

                            Observations on the preceding Tables, fyc.

   1. While the number of bolides is considerably larger for December and
January than for June and July, the number of aerolitic falls is about as

large again for the latter as for the former period ; the earth in her orbit
in the first case being at her perihelion, in the latter at her aphelion.

   2. The distribution of the larger class of meteors is not so unequal
throughout the year, if we make allowance for the immense number usually
periodically observed ill August and November, when meteors as large in
apparent size as Jupiter, or even Venus, are not uncommon. March, May,
June, and July furnish out of the total number generally observed of meteors

of all sizes, the largest proportion of bolides, and especially of aerolites.
   3. There is a remarkable equality in the numbers of aerolitic falls for the

first half of the year as compared with the second half, viz. 103 and 101 re-
spectively. There does not appear to be any very remarkable preponderance
in this class of meteoric phenomena during the periodic epochs for shooting-
stars, i.e. about the 9th of August and 10th of November. In the analysis of
Table II. these epochs are more fully pointed out. There appear to be
aerolitic epochs entirely distinct in themselves ; and it is worthy of remark
that these epochs are apparently most distinctly marked, with regard to shoot-
ing-stars and boiides only, during the first six months of the year ; whilst all

the epochs possibly common to both classes are seen to occur in the second

six months of the year, with the single exception of one in February.
    4. Analyses of several catalogues are concisely given in Table I. for the

purpose of convenient comparison. They vary more or less from each other,
though not very materially; necessarily in constructing such catalogues,
some latitude and difference of opinion may exist respecting what constitutes
a proper bolide; and recorded observations may not always be very definite.
If meteors of the size of Venus or Jupiter were included without discrimina-
tion, the list of fireballs for August and November might be swelled out in-
definitely ; e. g. hundreds of meteors of that size were seen on one night
alone, November 13, 1833, in America. The practice of late years of look-
ing out more particularly for shooting- stars at the usual August and Novem-

ber periods, probably tends to increase disproportionately in all catalogues

of bolides, the number of observations for those two months, though the
November period appears for the present to have become very much less

remarkable for meteoric displays than formerly.

    In constructing his own catalogue, Mr. Greg has endeavoured merely to
insert such observations as might with most certainty be assumed to be

remarkable for size and brilliancy.

26 REPORT 1860.

The catalogue itself may possibly appear in a future volume of the Reports

of the British Association.

   An attempt has been made to separate (as aerolitic) the class of detonating

meteors,  of  which  more   than  100 are  separately given                                                                      great  care  having
                                                                                                                              ;

been taken to obtain the fullest and mo3t accurate list of that class of me-

teoric phenomena, as being most interesting and most important, but which

has hitherto either been statistically too much neglected, or not sufficiently

separated and distinguished from the class of fireballs without detonation

large fireballs being frequently said to explode or burst, though when so ex-

pressed only, it must be construed as without noise. It has likewise been

the custom with some writers and observers to rank as aerolitic, all the larger

class of fireballs, whether observed to burst with or without detonation.

Probably one-third of the larger fireballs, i. e. having an apparent diameter of

15' and upwards, burst with an audible explosion, this for those observed at

night; of those similarly observed during daytime the proportion (according

to Mr. Greg's calculations) is greater, probably about one-half. It is a sin-

gular fact, that out of 72 stonefalls, whose precise hour of fall has been

recorded, only 13 occurred before noon, and no less than 58 fell between

Whynoon and 9 p.m.   so few should have fallen at night and before noon, in

the morning, it is not easy to say, supposing it not to be the result of chance.

If true that more aerolitic falls occur during daytime than during the night,

it would seem that there is a greater tendency to encounter those bodies in

their orbits, as they recede from the sun ; that side of the earth most directly
opposite to the sun being naturally most likely to come into actual contact

with them. The above observations are taken for average of latitude, say

48° north, and 10° west longitude.

Dr. D. P. Thomson, in his · Introduction to Meteorology,' p. 302, states

that meteors are of comparative rare occurrence in the Arctic Regions: this,

if true, is curious and important, and deserves corroboration from some of

the great arctic navigators now living in this country, and to whom applica-

tion for any additional information might readily be made; the long winter

nights in those parts being admirably adapted for observations (especially

horary) of shooting-stars.

The time of maximum meteor visibility being stated by M. Coulvier-

Gravier and M. Bompas to be about 6 a.m., it is rather singular that the
times of maximum occurrence for aerolites and detonating meteors should

be about the same hour p.m.

   5. Of the Chinese observations given by Biot, 900 were made in a period

--of only 79 years, viz. from a.d. 1023 1102; they include meteors of every

apparent size  from Jupiter to the  Moon                              likewise a certain                                         number of aero-
                                                                   ;

lites, detonating meteors, meteoric showers, and doubtless some few auroral

displays. The larger proportion were observed in that portion of the sky

included between the S.W. and S.E.

M. Abel Remusat, in 1819, has published other particulars, viz. of 100

falls of stones and detonating meteors, which have been recorded likewise in

Chinese annals, between the sixth century B.C. to 1223 a.d. In Biot's list

the 23rd of October presented the maximum number of observations.

6. Further observations are to be desired respecting the zodiacal light, and

every possible connexion between that phenomenon and that of shooting-stars

cr meteors. Likewise further information concerning the heights at which

meteors begin to be visible, and cease being visible. The question concern-

ing the cause of luminosity in meteors is a highly interesting one, and still

an open one. The phenomena displayed by the luminous trains or tails of
shooting-stars and meteors is also a subject requiring much attention. The

theory that they shine by reflected solar light, has been refuted by Mr. R. P.

Greg in the April Number of the Philosophical Magazine.

   7. It is desirable to distinguish, if possible, between ordinary shooting-
stars and aerolites ; Olmsted, Dr. Lawrence Smith, and Mr. Greg are strongly

of opinion that a distinction may frequently exist, both orbital and physical.

   8. In a paper by Prof. W. Thomson in the ' Philosophical Magazine' for
December 1854, " On the Mechanical Energies of the Solar System," is deve-

loped more fully the idea of Mr. Waterston, that the solar heat can only be
maintained, on any known principle, by immense numbers of meteorites
constantly striking the surface or atmosphere of the sun, and thus producing
by their enormous velocity and friction a never-failing source of heat. The
chief objection to this theory arises from the fact that, as far as we prac-
tically know anything of meteors, so far from the probability of their being
swallowed up in the sun goes, we see the majority of them apparently re-
curring without waste at periodical times, and that for a long term of years:
this simple circumstance goes much against the probability of Mr. Waterston's
and Prof Thomson's theory.

    Considering that the sun's heat, as an effect of its light, must have been

maintained for millions of years (as proved geologically) pretty much at its
present value, it is not improbable that future calculations, and a more accu-
rate knowledge of the phenomena exhibited by solar light, may enable us to
reduce considerably the supposed absolute heat of the sun, as now measured

by an imaginary thermometer, and thus spare us the necessity of supposing
that its heat is so great as to require myriads of meteors to be always rush-

ing into it to create a fresh supply of it. If the majority of meteors should
be, as they probably are, merely minute and gaseous comets, not possessing
a solid or stony nature, it would still more increase the chances against
Mr. Waterston's theory.

   9. M. Haidinger has recently published at Vienna some valuable

papers on the crust and external forms of meteoric stones, in relation to the
circumstances accompanying their fall and probable condition prior to, or at
the moment of, entering the earth's atmosphere.

Report of the Committee appointed to dredge Dublin Bay. By J. R.
   Kinahan, M.D., F.L.S., Professor of Zoology, Government School

   of Science applied to Mining and the Arts.

During the autumn and winter months (1859) the author made several ex-

cursions to the bays lo the north of Dublin, the results of which will be em-
bodied in the final Report. In the spring of 1860, finding that, owing to
circumstances beyond their control, there was no prospect of systematic
assistance from the other members of the Committee, the author determined
to fix on a district to be worked systematically, and selected the series
of bays between the Poolbeg Lighthouse and Bray as being the most likely
to yield a good return as regards number of species and variety of grounds.
Accordingly, since the beginning of March, a series of systematic dredgings
have been carried out in this district, the results of which are now communi-

cated. The district may be conveniently divided into three sub-districts:

1st. That between the Lighthouse wall and Kingstown east pier, including
Kingstown Harbour. 2nd. The district between Kingstown east pier and
the south end of Dalkey Sound, including the whole sound. 3rd. The bay
                                                                                                            --                          --
                                                                                                                                                :

--28 REPORT 1860.

between the latter point and Bray Head, in each case including the banks for

seven miles off shore.

   Of these the following call for notice :

 --Bank 1. The North Scallop bed lying about three miles off in district I.

It consists of pure sand. Ophiuridcc are very common ; Ophiocomidaz not

uncommon; Comatulidce scarce; Asteriada: not uncommon: one specimen

of Asterias rosea, Miiller (Cribella rosea, Forbes), occurred here. Other
Echinoderms rare ; Molluscs are rare ; Polyzoa and Tunicata are very com-

mon ; Crustacea, Decapoda, not uncommon, species few ; Amphipoda rare;
Cirrhipeda common ; Annelida are scarce ; and Polypifera very common.
It may be generally noted, however, as unprofitable ground.

2. Within this a bank of Pleistocene fine sand of considerable extent, but

generally narrow in width : this contains very few living shells, but myriads

of dead shells, from which all their organic constituents have been absorbed,

and which are easily distinguished from the shells found in the next.

   3. The Shell Bank.--This, which I have only partially succeeded in tracing

out, is a curious belt of broken and living shells, the dead shells being easily

distinguished from those of the Pleistocene (Teleocene) beds. Many spe-

cies of Crustacea are here found ; Zoophytes are abundant in certain parts
of it ; Echinodermata are also common, chiefly Ophiocomida . Echinidce,
SipunculidcB, and Holothuriadce occur more rarely, at least to the dredge, as

the oval tentacles of the latter are frequently brought up. This bank is

most interesting, as it bears a close resemblance to the Turbot Bank of the
Belfast Dredging Committee, many of the shells being identical ; and one

remarkable coral, as yet only found in the north seas of Ireland, has been

detected in it by Mr. E. Waller (Sj)he?iotrochusWrightii). I have traced it
nearly the whole way across districts 2 and 3, though in some parts its

breadth is narrowed to a few yards; and it bears a constant l'elation to
Bank 2, which in district 3 is called the " Back."

   4. Shanganagh Bank, a shingly, muddy, sand oyster-bed, formed from the

influx of the river of the same name lying inside the Back in Killiney Bay.

Here Eupagurus Icevis first occurred to me ; Asterias rosea, two specimens

Holothuriada are not                            uncommon                                                    Zoophytes and Polyzoa  not  uncommon.
                                                                                                         ;

--Of Mollusca some rare species occur here.
   5. Sorrento Bay. This consists of dense gravelly sand. Here living

Molluscs are rare ;                             Nucida radiata occurs                                           in  some  number, and   very fine
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

--and Annelids are not uncommon ; Crustacea, except Hyada, are rare.
   6. Dalkey Sound. This district requires almo^ a special description

for itself, though not half a mile long, and barely a quarter of a mile broad,

and the depth of water in no place, according to the Chart, exceeding at

lowest spring tides 12 fathoms; yet species of every group are met with in

it, which are ordinarily reputed to be deep-sea species. I have taken in it,

and in it only, Ophidion imberbe, Pirimela denticulata, Hyas coarctatus,
Inachus dorynchus, Ebalia Pennantii, and many other species which else-
where have only occurred to me in 20-fathom water. In fact, the only spe-
cies wanting here are those for which I would propose the name of broad

sea species, such as Spatungus purpiireus, Eupagurus Icevis, Inachus Dor-
settensis, and Crangon Allmanni, none of which have ever occurred plenti-

fully except outside the " Back." I defer a full description of this district

until my final report, which I hope to present to the Association at their

next meeting.

direction. This consists of fine sand and large shells: Zoophytes are very

Crustacea, which are rare elsewhere, Eupagurus lecvis, Inachns Dorsetfensis,
Pinnotheres pisum, Tetromatus JBellianns, &c. The bank is not easy of
attainment, as it requires smooth water for its proper working, and the past
season in Dublin has been a succession of easterly and westerly gales.

   From all these grounds a number of species have been obtained ; of these,

the Annelida and Zoophytes are yet undetermined, but the author hopes to

put in a list of them at the next meeting of the Association. Of other

--groups, the following number of species have been determined : Fishes, 10,

one, Ophidion imberbe, new to Ireland : Mollusca, 188, exclusive of Polyzoa ;
of these none are new to Ireland : Crustacea, 7-3 ; of these 5 are hitherto un-
recorded in Ireland, 8 new to the east coast: Arachnida, 2: Echinodermata,
30, one, Asterias rosea, new to Dublin, &C. Sponges are omitted for the
present. In the present immature condition of these researches, it were pre-

mature to attempt any general conclusions; but the results as yet obtained
go strongly to confirm an opinion advanced by the author some years since,
regarding the absence of southern types on the Dublin coast, which occur
further north, and which led him to the adoption of an eastern Irish or

Dublin district, extending from Dundrum Bay to Carnsole Point. For the

identification of most of the species the writer is responsible, with the ex-
ception of the minute Molluscs; these Edward Waller, Esq., kindly took in

--hand frequent recurrence of his initials in the accompanying list will show

with what success. Great quantities of the fine sand obtained in these

researches is yet un worked, so that it is probable that ere our next report

other species may be added to those here given.
   To complete the work, the Committee would ask that the Committee may

--be appointed, with the addition of Edward Waller, Esq., as follows : Pro-

fessor J. It. Kinahan, Dublin ; Dr. W. Carte ; Professor J. Reay Greene ; Dr.

E. P. Wright, and Edward Waller, Esq.; and that a further sum, not exceed-

ing £15, be placed at their disposal for this purpose, to enable them to
complete this investigation.

summer of 1860, the Committee laid open several large sections of super-

incumbent boulder clay and of the underlying yellow sandstone, but were
unsuccessful in obtaining any of the Pamphractean or Pterichthyan forms
sousiht after. None of the workmen eiiirasred in the excavations in 1837,
when these organisms were found in great numbers, were living in the di-
strict ; and the Committee, proceeding on the information of others, failed to
detect the precise fossiliferous bed in question. Their labours brought them,
however, to a point which cannot be far distant from these crustacean trea-
sures, and they are hopeful that, on resuming their researches, they shall
meet with the desired success. They proceeded to other sections of the rock,
in the bottom of the ravine, and there they were richly rewarded with an
abundance of the fossil remains of fishes, chiefly of the genus Holoptychius
and other Cozlacanths.

   The yellow sandstone deposit, as described in the 'Course of Creation'

in former papers of Dr. Anderson, consists of an alternating series of grits,

shales, marls, and fine-grained sandstone, of various shades of colour. The
fossil fishes are confined to one particular bed, which, when laid open, easily
splits up, the organic materials determining the point of separation, and

exhibiting often on a single flag from fifty to a hundred closely-packed and

well-defined figures with scales, fins, and cranial plates quite entire. On the

present occasion your Committee were surrounded by an intelligent group of
lovers of the science, male and female, from Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Forfar,
Dundee, and Cupar, and succeeded, after a few hours' labour, in displaying to
their eager gaze some of the largest and most beautiful specimens of these
older denizens of our seas.

   It will not be necessary to describe in detail any of the well-known forms
and characteristics of Holoptychius, the most abundant of the genera found in
this deposit. But having submitted some of the most perfect of the spe-
cimens to Professor Huxley, and as he thereby was enabled to detect some

new particulars connected with the structure and figure of the genus, it will
not be deemed out of place to give an abstract of his interesting descrip-
tion, contained at length in Dr. Anderson's ' Monograph of Dura Den*.'

   "In studying," says Professor Huxley, " the new forms of Devonian fish
which have been described, I found it desirable to obtain a more definite
conception than was deducible from extant materials, of the characters of
Holoptychius. To this end I examined a considerable number of specimens

of Holoptychius Andersoni, contained partly in the collection of the British

Museum, partly in that of the Museum of Practical Geology, and I have

arrived at the following conclusions. Holoptychius Andersoni has very nearly
the proportions of a carp, but its body is thicker and its snout is more rounded

from side to side. The greatest depth of the body is in front of its middle;
the length of the whole body is to that of the head nearly as five to one.
The orbit is nearly circular, about one- fourth the length of the head. The
cranial bones all exhibit a peculiar granular structure. The two parietals
occupy a large extent of the upper wall of the cranium, and have the form

of pentagons with their elongated bases turned inwards and applied to one

another. The occipital region is covered by three bones, one median, and
two lateral; the lateral bones having radiating stria? on the posterior halves

or their outer surfaces. The operculum is a broad bone, larger behind,
where it is convex, than in front, where it is concave, and much longer than

it is deep.

   " The rami of the lower jaw are stout and strong, and form a very broad,
almost semicircular arch. The characters of the scales are well known.

The fins are lobate, and the dorsal fin is small and triangular. Sir Philip

Egerton, in a valuable memoir recently read before the Geological Society,

expresses his belief that Holoptychius has two dorsal fins. I am very loath

to controvert the opinion of so experienced and skilful an observer, the more

particularly as specimens of Holoptychius with perfect tails are very rare,

but one or two complete examples I have seen, leave no room in my mind

for any other conclusion than that stated above."

Numerous perfect specimens of this remarkable fish have been obtained

in our recent excavations, which show the lobate character of the fins as de-

scribed by the learned Professor, as well as the unity of the dorsal organ.

The entire form of the body of Holoptychius is likewise beautifully deve-

loped in some of the specimens, where the caudal end appears gradually
tapering to a point, and not at all bent up as represented in all former de-
scriptions ; while the ventral lobe of the caudal fin, though rather shorter than
the dorsal lobe, has nearly the same depth, and not in the ordinary sense

of the heterocercal structure.

In the course of our explorations we also succeeded in obtaining several

perfect specimens of two new and hitherto undescribed genera of Ccelacanths,

namely, Glyptolcemus Kinnairdii and Phaneropleuron Andersoni.

   The specific distinction of Glyptolcemus Kinnairdii was proposed and
adopted at the Meeting of the London Geological Society in honour of

Lord Kinnaird, whose zeal in promoting the interests of geology is only

equalled by his enlightened endeavours to advance the interests of anything

connected with our social and industrial well-being as a statesman. The
generic term of Glyptolcemus was suggested on account of the marked
sculpture of the jugular plates in one of the specimens. As described in the

"Monograph" of Dura Den, the scales and fins likewise form strongly

marked characteristics of this new genus.

   The scales are rhomboidal, and have an average short diameter of one-
sixth of an inch. Twenty-four series are visible, and diverge from the me-

dian line in the ordinary way ; they are larger on the anterior part of the
ventral surface than on the posterior part, and at the side of the body than

on the belly. They are pitted and ridged almost as in Glyptopomus, although
somewhat thinner and less bony than in that fish. There are two dorsal fins

which are situated very far back, the anterior edge of the root of the first
being nine inches distant from the end of the snout in one of the specimens : it

is remarkably slender, and of a semi-oval outline. The second dorsal fin is
considerably larger than the first, being two inches on its longest axis, and

its breadth about an inch in depth. The entire length of the body, in several

of the specimens, varies from a foot and a half to nearly two feet.

   The other new genus discovered in the course of our explorations is the
Phaneropleuron Andersoni, and from some very imperfect fragments named

by Professor Agassiz as a Glypticus, but without describing or defining the

genus. The generic appellation, now bestowed by Professor Huxley, ex-

--presses the most striking character of the fish the curious development and

obtrusiveness of its ribs, arising from their complete ossification as well as

the thinness of the scales. The affinity of Phaneropleuron with the typical

ccelacanths is indicated not only by its singular tail, but by its persistent

notochord, by its lobate pectoral and ventral fins, and by its well-ossified

superior and inferior vertebral elements. The scales remind one of Holo-
ptychius, but are much thinner and differently sculptured. The fins are more

nearly of the structure of this genus in theirgeneral facies, though they differ in

details. They are lobate iu the lateral pairs, a character now regarded by one

of our most eminent ichthyologic authorities, Sir Philip Egerton, as belonging
to the entire family of Ccelacanths, and which Agassiz has also described
in his elaborate account of the Glyptolepis of Clashbennie in the ' Poissons

Fossiles.'

    This locality, so richly stored with these and other forms of fossil remains,

has now contributed largely to our stock of palaeontological knowledge.

Should the researches be continued, your Committee are sanguine, not only
in the recovery of the long-lost bed of the disputed Pamphractus, but like-
wise of new genera and new species still sealed up in the yellow sandstone

museum of Dura Den*. Trilobites of a small type, Productse and Spirifers,

are very numerous in the carboniferous shales of Ladeddie, which are in
immediate superposition and stretch along the southern opening of the Den.
About three miles to the eastward, in the ironstone deposits of Denbrae

and Mount Melville, large jaws, teeth, bones, and scales of the genus

Rhizodus are in the greatest abundance and the most beautiful preservation.

Thus the geologist may here study successively the upper beds of the Old
Red Sandstone, the Mountain Limestone, Ironstone shales, and the Coal-mea-

sures on the most northern limits of the Carboniferous system. Trap-rocks
everywhere penetrate the series of sedimentary deposits, indurating the sand-
stone, fusing the limestone, roasting the coal, and exhibiting proofs of those
destructive agencies and deleterious impregnations by which the fishes of

Dura Den were suddenly overtaken, silted up, and preserved in such num-

bers and perfect forms in their stony matrix.

Report on the Experimental Plots in the Botanical Garden of the

   Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. By James Buckman,

   F.L.S., F.S.A., F.G.S. fyc, Professor of Botany and Geology, Royal

   Agricultural College.

In presenting our Report for 1860, it will be necessary to remark, that on
account of the peculiarities of the season, particularly its lateness, and the
fact of the unusual period of the Oxford Meeting, the Report before the
Section at Oxford was made verbally, permission having been obtained to
make a more full and written report when the experiments had attained to
something like completion. It was reported before the Section that 200
plots were in operation, which were classified as follows:

Agricultural Plants         Plots.
Medicinal Plants
Esculent Vegetables          50
                             30
Grasses, old and new plots   20
                             60
Miscellaneous Plants         40

                            Total 200

   Of these, at the Oxford Meeting it was reported that more than half were
either new seeds only just germinated, while for the others they had made

         ON THE GROWTH OP PLANTS.  35

so little progress, that we almost despaired of any substantial results under
such untoward circumstances. Still, however, we now offer remarks upon
some of the more striking experiments, which it may be said are so far com-
plete up to November.

                                                  Grasses.

   Sorghum saccharatum (Holcus saccharatus), Chinese Sugar-cane.--The
fine summer of 1859 enabled us to grow this plant to a height of as much

as 7 feet, as also to perfect its saccharine matter, at least in a very high
degree. This success, which was pretty general all over England, had caused
very flattering encomiums to be passed on the merits of this plant for agricul-

tural purposes, especially as a green soiling food. The total failure, however,

of our experiments for this season is not only instructive as to the great
diversity of seasons, but should also teach us caution in recommending the

extensive adoption of any new plant in our uncertain climate from only a
single year's growth. Our best plants did not attain 6 inches, and indeed our
failure this year was more signal than our success the previous one.

 --JEgilops ovata. Although our specimens are far later in coming to matu-

rity than in any former season, yet the results are more striking than we have
before observed. Even at the time of our writing (November), little of our
crop for 1860 has ripened ; but the spikes are longer than usual, whilst the
stalks (culms) are taller; and added to this is the important result of a show
of more and larger grain, of the shape of the wheat grain, so that we have

scarcely a doubt left as to this being the parent of the cereal or corn wheat.

Again, as another evidence of the results and effects of cultivation, we have

the crop of this year affected with all the epiphytical fungi to which wheat
is liable, and the more so the more it is manured.

  --Gyneria argentea, Pampas Grass. Our specimens, one of which flowered

most beautifully last year, are all dead, so that however highly this plant

may be recommended for naturalization in other parts of England, where the
climate is milder, we cannot think it will ever be safe to trust to it on the

" Stony Cotteswolds."

   Of British Grasses, we have to report that we have had in operation during
the present season as many as sixty plots ; several of these are only our usual
common English species, many of which are condemned to be resown on
account of their inevitable admixture. Among the experiments of interest,
we have to report the complete production of Festuca elatior from a plot of

F. loliacea, in which the changes were as follows :
    2nd year. Festuca loliacea the rule, with exceptional cases of F.pratensis.
    3rd year. Festuca pratensis the rule, with exceptional cases of F. elatior.
    4th year. F. elatior increased.

    5th year, 1860. Festuca elatior has complete possession.

    In reference to this, it will be remembered that we noted in a former
Report the occurrence of F. elatior in Earl Bathurst's Park, which we then
conjectured had been derived from the sowing of the seed of F. pratensis.
Tli is year we have further to remark that here the elatior form is the rule,

 and scarcely a vestige of the F. pratensis remains; and very coarse and un-

 sightly it is as a glade in a park.

   We have now performed this experiment twice with the same result, and

 our views seem confirmed by the accidental case just referred to; we have
 then no doubt that the three forms just adverted to are but varieties of a
single species ; and we have much pleasure in observing that our views in
this and other cases of a like kiud, derived from actual experiment, and
 reported upon to the Association in 1847, should be confirmed by the

                                                                       83

Specific Botanist as thus : under the head of " Meadow Fescue, Festuca
elatior," see Bentham's ' Handbook of the British Flora,' p. 602, we have the

following :

   "a. Spiked Meadow Fescue (F. loliacea, Eng. Bot. t. 1821). Spikelets
almost sessile, in a simple spike. Grows with the common form, always

passing gradually into it.

   "b. Common Meadow Fescue (F. pratensis, Eng. Bot. t. 1592). Panicle

slightly branched but close. In meadows and pastures.

"c. Tall Meadow Fescue (F.elatior, Eng. Bot. t. 1593 ; F. arundinacea,

ABab. Man.).  taller, often reed-like plant, with broader leaves, the panicle

more branched and spreading. On banks of rivers, and in wet places, espe-

cially near the sea."

Now, though well aware that these views are not generally shared by col-

lecting botanists, we are yearly more and more persuaded that even greater

innovations than now contended for v. ill be admitted ; and we cannot help

expressing pride and pleasure that we should for the last fourteen years

have been conducting a series of experiments, many of which practically

prove the truth of several of the theoretical views, with regard to what has

been termed the "lumping" of species, of the author of the Handbook;

and we cannot here omit expressing our best thanks to the British Association

for their assistance in prosecuting these interesting inquiries.

 --Poa (Gli/ceria) aquatica. Our plot with this experiment still continues

to exhibit in its entire space, without the slightest intermixture, the induced

form we have before reported upon, which indeed is so different from the

original grass, that at a first glance most observers would pronounce it to be

large examples of Poa trivialis; the differences, however, in all parts are as

great between our induced form and that grass, as exists on comparing the

induced form with the Poa aquatica. There can be no doubt that in

this case the cultivation of the seed of a water grass in an upland situation

has led to great changes, not, as has been supposed, brought about by cross-

breeding or hybridizing, but the seed of the P. aquatica has at once been

changed in the growth of the plants that came up from it ; and it now remains

to see if the change be a permanent one, to which end we hope to be able

to sow a plot of the seed of the induced grass next spring; but in the mean-

time it may be well to remark, that although it has frequently seeded, yet

that the bed is still free both from innovations from seedlings of its own kind,

--as also from those of other species.
   Poa (Gli/ceria) Jluitans. At the same time that the plot was sown with

the seed of P. aquatica, another plot was occupied with seeds of the Poa

Jluitans; and we should remark that in both cases the seeds were drilled, and

Nowthe drills remain intact to the present hour.  the result is, that both

plots were indistinguishable at the first time of flowering, and have so re-

mained to the present hour ; and with reference to the last form, it may be

well to point out that, having been favoured by Messrs. Sutton of Reading

with specimens of the collection of grasses which they keep in cultivation, a
bundle marked " Gli/ceria Jluitans" is identical with our induced forms from

both P. aquatica and P. jluitans.
--WePoa aquatica and P. Jluitans.
                                   offer no explanation of these ; being

well acquainted with these two species, we can truly say that our induced form

is widely different ; nor is it at all identical with any other British species. It

is, however, still a matter of regret that we have not been able to procure

ripe seed of these species from the district, as, so far as we can discover, none

of the P. aquatica at least has ripened in the district. It may be well to

mention, that even this shyness in the ripening of the seed of this now so
           --

emphatically a water grass, is not without value as affording something like
evidence that this species is perhaps after all out of place, and this may-
point to the fact that our induced form is the right one ; at all events, it quite

determines the fact that the name Glyceria is inapplicable, as it is a decided
Poa in cultivation.

                                      Crop Plants.

--Pastinaca sativa, Parsnip. Our ennobled examples of these were con-

sidered so perfect, that it was thought advisable to consign the whole of the
seed of 1859 to the Messrs. Sutton of Reading, as new varieties of any cul-

tivated crop plant is always desirable, and more especially when, as in the

present case, the new form has been directly derived, not from a variety, but

from the original wild stock. In reference to the continued success of this

experiment, Mr. Sutton reports in a letter of October 17th of this year as

follows :

" The Student Parsnip in our trial ground is the nicest shape of any, more

free from fibres, and as large as the ' hollow crown,' which is a good medium

size. The flavour seems to be very nice."

This is the more important, as of late this useful garden esculent has much

fallen into disuse, its want of flavour being the assigned cause.

   We must not omit to remark, that one of the most malformed specimens

of parsnip, and also a highly digitated Swedish Turnip, were set aside for

seeding, with a view to sowing next spring in the same kind of plots, as there

seems reason to expect that such degenerate forms could only beget a

degenerate progeny : with a view then to ascertain how far this degeneracy,
or otherwise, may proceed, we first took careful portraits of the seeded roots,

--the seed of which is now put by for experiment.
   Brassica oleracea. Having gathered some seeds of this wild cabbage

from Llandudno, N. Wales, in August 1859, we sowed it in the summer of
the present year in our private garden, from whence we removed some plants
for a plot in our College garden. These, and our own examples, are already
highly curious, as showing the tendency to run into so many of the cabbage
varieties, e. g. long petioles ; the types known as " kale, greens," &c, both
with broad, more or less undivided leaves, and with a tendency to deep lobes

and divisions. Others with short petioles, offer the true cabbage type ; while

these even now show tendencies for the production of sorts, as flat heads,

sugar-loaf, green, red, and white varieties. These of course are what one
would expect, but still it is curious to mark its progress.

In speaking of the Brassica family, we cannot help expressing our convic-

tion of the justice of including the genus Sinapis with Brassica ; for just as

our experiments incline us to the opinion that all our so-called species of

this genus are after all only derivatives, so we believe that the Charlock

i>i7iapis arvensis, L. is also an agrarian form of Brassica. Upon this, however,

we want the experiments of a lifetime ; still these would be replete with

interest, and more especially as we find cabbage, rape, turnips, radishes,

and mustard almost wholly attendant upon cultivation, and that not only

Howwith us, but in every variation of climate.  wild the thickets of Sinapis

nigra, some 6 feet high, look on the banks of the Ohio! and yet we have the

authority of Beck in favour of its introduction from Europe ; and so we have

evidence of the crops in India being smothered with wild rapes, which our

--experiments show are principally bulbless varieties of the turnip.
   Mangel Wurzel. The inquiry connected with the growth of this crop

is one which may be considered of interest in a physiological as well as an

agricultural point of view, and hence we give its results in this place.
          --. ;

--38 REPORT 1860.

   It is tolerably well known that this valuable crop was introduced into

cultivation with the hope that it would yield a valuable supply of food in the
shape of leaves, whilst at the same time it was supposed to be capable of
fully developing its growth of roots, the leaves then being employed for

summer and autumn food, whilst the roots were to be stored for winter use
however, we were early struck with the fact, that using the leaves to any
extent, would prejudice the crop of the roots, and we therefore twice before
the last year instituted experiments upon this matter with a result that may

be generally stated as follows.

    The Mangel Wurzel, stripped of its outer leaves from two to three times

during their period of growth, do not produce half the iveight of root of those

left intact.

    And herein we thought that we had established the law, that as long as a

leaf of Mangel was sufficiently sound to be useful as food for any animal, so
long was it of use in aiding the proper development of the plant; but this
statement has been controverted by the result of some experiments made at
the Albert Agricultural Model Farm, Ireland, where it is stated that the
result of taking the enormous quantity of 5 to?is of leaves from the acre of a
growing Mangel crop, was to increase the xceight of roots at the rate of nearly
5k tons. Now, under these circumstances we determined upon repeating the
experiments upon a larger variety of Mangels this year.

   A1st. set of experiments made with nine sorts of Mangel Wurzel planted

with burnt ashes, duly thinned and tended as usual; the plots being 2^

yards square.

   2nd. Nine plots of the same sorts transplanted.
   The outer leaves of all these plots were taken off on the two following
dates, September 4 and September 21.

   On the 12th of November the whole crops topped and tailed, consisting of

twenty-four roots to each bed, half of which had been stripped of their outer
leaves ; thus twelve roots each, stripped and uustripped, gave the following
results for both the untransplanted and the transplanted plots :

   Here then we take these results from so many sorts as conclusive evidence
upon this point, only remarking that, in all probability, had the season been

one of an ordinary kind, the discrepancy would have been even greater, as
this year the tendency of growth has been in favour of leaf development.

   The same experiments were tried with Kohl Rabbi, and with the like results
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and it should be mentioned, with regard to all of them, that the seed was
obtained from the Messrs. Sutton of Reading, and that it was true to sort.

   ON THE GROWTH OF PLANTS.                                                                                                                                     39

   It s not a little remarkable that in both the Mangel and Kohl Rabbi the

results have been greater in the transplanted than in the untransplanted plots,

the former yielding a larger crop; this too has probably been favoured by

the moist season, but as it is a subject of great farming interest, we shall

renew our experiments upon this matter.

 --Dipsacus fullonum et sylveslris. Our plot of this year fully confirmed our

view of last year, as to the specific identity of these two forms of this plant;

for without being able to assert that we had decided D. fullonum from the

seeds of D. sylveslris, or the opposite, yet the specimens glided so imperceptibly

into either form, that, distinct as are decided examples, we were much puzzled

in deciding as to the paternity of some of our specimens.

   To quote from English Botany, 2nd edition : " Hudson mentions this plant

as growing about hedges. In the clothing countries, where it is cultivated

for use, it may escape from the fields. There is much doubt concerning the
value of its specific difference from the D. sylveslris."

   Bentham is of the same opinion, so that our experiments in this only lay

claim to a simple and practical method of confirming these views. Our

notion at the same time is that it would be exceedingly difficult to find a

wild example of the true D. fullonum ; that is, one which from its hard re-

Weflexed bracts would be worth anything for fulling purposes.                                                                                have hunted

long in the districts where the economic form of the Teasel is grown, and we

have always been of opinion that where its seed has been scattered and allowed

to grow wild, it lost its stiff hooked characters ; and, to say the least, even the
best of them merged into D. sylvestris ; the fullonum being indeed a difficult

plant to keep perfect, unless under constant change of seed and soil.

                                                                                                           Weeds, &c.

   Thistles have formed the subject of several experiments during the past

year, which will be referred to under the following names: Carduus

arvensis, C. acaulis, vars., C. tuberosus.

  --Carduus arvensis. Our experiments upon the growth of this plant were

undertaken in order to explain their method of reproduction, as it had been

disputed by the farmer that thistles were produced from seed.

   On September 2nd, 1859, were sown ten seeds which had been collected

a  few days previously                                                                                     by the 21st of the  month  these  had all come  up,  and
                                                                                                        ;

some began to show the secondary leaves, as in Diagram, fig. 1. By the time

the prickly foliage became manifest, the cold weather had set in and all the

plants apparently died. However, in February 1860 we noticed a bud just

emerging through the soil, which induced us to take up a couple of the speci-
mens and make drawings of them, of which copies will be seen at 2 a and 2 b.

   Here then at a and b are buds by which the continuance of the plant is

secured, the buds a, b forming whilst b, b are sending up leaves for the second

year, so that by June the plants had advanced to the condition of fig. 3, in
which, while a strong shoot is progressing above ground, a most, extraordinary

rhizomation is taking place below fig. 3, fully explaining how in the next
season we may meet with a thicket of Thistles derived from a single plant.

   Here then it is obvious that the conclusions with respect to the Thistle not

seeding, were the result of the small and inconspicuous plant which it makes

the first year, and this apparently dying, confirmed this view ; however, we

see from this experiment that thistle seed is as fecundate as that of other

plants, and as we have counted as many as 150 seeds from a single head of
flowers, and as we may have an average of ten heads of flowers to a single

flowering stem, the eight tertiary buds at fig. 3 a, a may each represent a
                -- --" ;;

--40 REPORT 1860.

flowering head in the following season, which would thus give us the following

sum as the seeding capabilities of a single Thistle plant, namely

                          8=150 x 10 X         12000.

These figures then will account for the " Plague of Thistles " which one

sometimes hears of, and points out most forcibly the importance of not

allowing these plants to perfect their seed, and hence waste places and

neglected waysides should carefully be watched in this respect ; but as this
cannot adequately be done without compulsory enactments, it is interesting
to find that some of our colonies have already instituted state laws with
reference to this subject, and during the last Session of Parliament an attempt

was made to get an act applicable for this object for Ireland. The destroying
of such thickets of Thistles as we have described has ever been an object of
interest with the farmer ; and it is not a little curious to remark that the
operations connected therewith have so much been regulated by rhyming

directions, as follows :

                          " Thistles cut in April,
                             Come up in a little while
                             If in May,
                             They grow the next day;

                             If in June,

                             They '11 grow again soon

                          If in July,

                          They '11 hardly die;

                          If in August,
                          Die they must."

   These words, uncouth as they are, are still meant to express some important
facts in the natural history of the plant. It may be observed that, with the
preparation we have described of underground buds, there can be no wonder

at the quick reappearance of the plant on early cutting ; at the same time,
if we consider that the whole of the aboveground parts of the plants
would naturally die at the first approach of cold, we may conclude that the

decree of

                          " If cut in August,
                             Die they must

is more apparent than real. For while the tertiary buds are advancing to
flower, they are also active in providing a still newer growth of rhizomata and

buds to perpetuate the continuance of the plant; and hence we have no hesi-

tation in saying that never can this thistle be destroyed by late cutting off its

aboveground stems. However, even at this time much good may be done
in keeping down the reproduction of the plant; for by the August mowing
seeding is prevented, though even for this object we should prefer an earlier

Carduus acaulis.          last year reported upon our experiments with the

true acauline form and the slightly cauline examples of this species ; we have

now to remark that the acauline examples maintain their normal condition,

whilst the cauline ones, from being only about 3 inches high when selected

for the experiment, have this year advanced to a complete thicket of stems

nearly a yard high, some of which have as many as a dozen heads of flowers,

--and is a very showy and handsome plant.
    Carduus tuberosus. The specimens originally discovered by us at Ave-
bury Druidical Circle have now advanced to immense masses, both as regards
their summer development of flowers and their tuberous rootstocks ; the
flowers are above 3 feet high, much branched and very showy, very different

from the single, or at most two-headed flower-stems of the ' English Flora,'

pi. 2562, which, however, is a faithful representation of the plant we trans-
ported to our garden. The tubers with us are as large as those of Dahlias.

    ON THE GROWTH OP PLANTS.  41

  We should remark that this year we have a number of seedling plants which

have come up wildly in different parts of our experimental garden, which we
shall be curious to know if they become like their parents. With us it seeds
so enormously, that it can hardly fail to be a matter of interest as to how this
plant, originally noticed as from Great Ridge between Boyton House and
Fonthill, Wilts, should have been for so many years lost to our flora, whilst its

present natural habitat on artificial earthworks, though truly ancient enough,

would seem to point to its having been introduced to its present locality.

   Bentham, in his description of the position of this plant, has the following
remarks :

   " In moist, rich meadows, and marshy, open woods, in western and south-
central Europe, extending eastwards to Transylvania."

   Its position at Avebury is so very different from this, that we cannot for-
bear to describe it. Avebury Circles (of stones) are placed on an elevated
plain of chalk, around which are elevated mounds or earthworks, the whole
surrounded by a broad deep vallum, which is at all times perfectly dry, and it

--42 REPORT 1860.

is on the driest and most exposed part of the mounds that the plant occurs.

Its change from such a poor position to our garden, which though only un-

manured forest marble-clay, is yet moist and stiff, will doubtless account for

its wonderful growth.

  --Cuscuta epilinum. Our last year's report on experiments in the growth

of this Dodder excited so much attention, that we determined upon following

out some additional ones in the present season, to which end we sowed two

plots with flax-seed, as follows :

  --Plot 1. Flax-seed perfectly pure. The result was a very fine crop, per-

fectly clean.

 --Plot 2. Dirty Flax-seed with some seeds of Cuscuta epilinum intermixed.

This was scarcely half a crop, and the fine specimens of Dodder bearing
down the partial crop, is at once an evidence of the mischief this parasite

can do to the crop in question, as also of the perfect ease with which we can

grow it ; so also how easy to prevent its presence in the flax-crop if we take

care to sow pure seed.

As regards the Clover Dodder, though this pest is yearly becoming more

and more prevalent, yet this season has been especially bad for ripening its

seed, and we are still in want of seed for special experiments upon it.

Seeds of Orobanche minor have been collected this year with a view to a

series of experiments upon it, as the Broomrape, like the Dodder, is yearly

becoming more and more troublesome ; and it would seem that Clovers are

liable to attacks from both forms of the parasite, and in all probability of

more than a single species of either; for, as regards Broomrape, we have col-

lected the two forms O. minor and O. elatior from different Clover crops ; we
still want to know whether the Cuscuta europcea and C. Trifolii are specific-

    Myosotis.

the cultivation of M. sylvatica, in which we gave it as an opinion that the

M. palustris of authors was subject to great variations, giving rise to annual

as well as perennial forms, the former introducing us to the M. sylvatica aud

others, as offsprings of M. palustris. Our present stock still bears out this
view, as we have as derivatives from M. sylvatica a still decreasing flowered

form and annual and perennial conditions of our varieties.

This year we introduced into the garden the very bright blue Forget-me-

not of our ditches ; this in cultivation (the same plant) has become the small

flowered light blue form which we take to be the M. repens of Don, as de-

scribed by Mr. Babington.

While upon this subject we must not omit to mention that, having been

favoured with a packet of seed from the eminent firm of J. Carter and Co. of

Holborn, under the name of Myosotis azurea major, we were much inter-

ested in observing what kind of bedding plant it might make, particularly as

in the Seed Catalogue for February 1860 we find the following remarks

appended to the Myosotis species :

" Forget-me-not. These beautiful flowers are too well known to need

recommendation : will grow around fountains, over damp rockeries, or in any

moist situation. 31. azorica and azurea major are the finest."

   Of course, from this announcement we expected something rather choice;
but our disappointment may be guessed when we found the result to be a
very poor small light-coloured variety of M. palustris.

   Now, we are far from blaming the Messrs. Carter for this, as it will at once

be seen that this was an induced form, and no one can at all answer for its

permanency ; and it may be that our position or some new circumstances of

cultivation induced the change from an expected fine flower to a very insig-

nificant one. Still this affords another curious instance of the effects of cul-

tivation upon this genus, which seem to tell us that we must not be too posi-

tive in the specific distinctions adopted by authors for these plants.

   The effects of the season of 1860 have been remarkable in several particu-

--lars ; we would, however, only refer to a few plants under experiment.
   Dioscorea Batatas, Potato Yam. Smaller than ever; cannot be at all de-
pended upon, even to make its seed in the Cotteswold district.

to be the most hardy of any kind.

  --Gyneria argentea. Killed entirely, both in the College and our own

private garden.

 --Sorghum saccharatum. Scarcely attained 6 inches in height against 7 feet

of the previous year.

  --Zea Mays. Indian corn not 2 feet high, and died as soon as flowered.

    Roots of all kinds smaller than usual.

   Potatoes small in quantity and much diseased.

   Fruits have not attained their usual size, have not ripened, and are

flavourless.

   Forest trees have made little wood, and their new shoots are not ripened.
   Garden flowers made little growth, shabby both in leaves and flowers.

    Plants perfected for less seed than usual.

   Philosophy in the University of Oxford.

In presenting their Report, the Committee would observe at the outset that

the main object for which the former Committee (in 1858) was appointed

remains yet unaccomplished                                                                                                                       and this is the verification of that  remarkable

result derived from the observations of Mr. Welsh in his four ascents in

1852, viz. " the sudden arrest of the decrease in the temperature of the

atmosphere at an elevation varying on different days, and this to such an

extent, that for the space of 2000 or 3000 feet the temperature remains nearly

constant or even increases to a small amount." It is obviously important to

determine whether this arrest represents the normal condition of the atmo-

sphere at all seasons of the year. The ascents of Mr. Welsh were made

between the 17th of August and the 10th of November. The question

remains, whether this " arrest " would be observed before the summer solstice

as well as after, and whether there were any variations at different seasons.

The changes in the temperature of the dew-point, consequent upon this in-

terruption in the law of decrease of temperature, would extend our know-

ledge of the condition of the atmosphere at such altitudes. To accomplish

thus much would not require ascents to very great altitudes, although there
are many objects to be attained by ascending as high as possible. The

liberal offers that have been made by Mr. Coxwell and Mr. Langley, of New-

castle, would enable observations to be made at a very moderate cost, and

Mr. Langley appears fully competent to accomplish the task. There are

also many other observations which may be made in balloon ascents which
--44 REPORT 1860.

may prove of very great value. Prof. W. Thomson is anxious that obser-
vations should be made on the electrical condition of the atmosphere. He

has described in the article on the Electricity of the Atmosphere ill Nichols
'Cyclopaedia,' a portable electrometer, and also a mode of collecting electricity
by that which he styles the water-dropping system, which would, in his
opinion, be easily applicable. The observations might be carried on, first,
by ascending to very moderate heights, and then going as high as possible.
Dr. Lloyd desires that observations should be made for "the determination
of the decrease of the earth's magnetic force with the distance from the sur-
face." The failure of Gay-Lussac to detect any sensible change ought not
to deter future observers. His methods were wholly inadequate ; but Dr.
Lloyd is of opinion that if attention be confined to the determination of the
total force or its vertical component (instead of the horizontal), it would be
easy to arrive at satisfactory conclusions. Sir David Brewster suggests that
further information may be obtained as to the polarization of the atmosphere
and the height of the neutral point. And, lastly, Dr. Edward Smith and
Prof. Sharpey are desirous that experiments should be made as to "the
quantitative determination of the products of respiration at different high
elevations." Dr. Smith has, as it is well known, been for the last two or
three years engaged in experimental inquiries on inspiration, and he is so
satisfied of the value and importance of the investigation, that he is not only
willing, but desirous to make the requisite experiments himself. Dr. Smith
has furnished directions as to the points to be observed and the mode of ob-

servation.

Report of Committee appointed to prepare a Self-Recording Atmo-

   spheric Electrometer for Keiv, and Portable Apparatus for observing

  Atmospheric Electricity. By Professor W. Thomson, F.R.S.

Your Committee, acting according to your instructions, applied to the .Royal

Society for £100 out of the Government grant for scientific investigation, to

be applied to the above-mentioned objects. This application was acceded

to, and the construction of the apparatus was proceeded with. The progress

was necessarily slow, in consequence of the numerous experiments required

to find convenient plans for the different instruments and arrangements to

be made. An improved portable electrometer was first completed, and is

now in a form which it is confidently hoped will be found convenient for

Ageneral use by travellers, and for electrical observation from balloons.

house electrometer, on a similar plan, but of greater sensibility and accuracy,

was also constructed. Three instruments of this kind have been made, one

of which (imperfect, but sufficiently convenient and exact for ordinary work)

is now in constant use for atmospheric observation in the laboratory of the

Natural Philosophy Class in the University of Glasgow. The two others are

considerably improved, and promise great ease, accuracy, and sensibility

for atmospheric observation, and for a large variety of electrometric re-

searches. Many trials of the water-dropping collector, described at the last

Meeting of the Association, were also made, and convenient practical forms

Aof the different parts of the apparatus have been planned and executed.

with a water-dropping collector and one of the improved common house

work, supplied by the Kew Committee, completes the apparatus required

 for establishing the self-recording system, with the exception of the merely
 photographic part. It is hoped that this will be completed, under the

direction of Mr. Stewart, and the observations of atmospheric electricity com-
menced, in little more than a month from the present time. In the mean
time preparations for observing the solar eclipse, and the construction of
magnetic instruments for the Dutch Government, necessarily occupy the staff

of the Observatory, to the exclusion of other undertakings. It is intended
that the remaining one of the ordinary house electrometers, with a water-
dropping collector, and the portable electrometer referred to above, will be

used during the summer months for observation of atmospheric electricity in
the Island of Arran. Your Committee were desirous of supplying portable
apparatus to Prof. Everett, of Windsor, Nova Scotia, and to Mr. Sandiman,

of the Colonial Observatory of Demerara, for the observation of atmospheric

electricity in those localities ; but it is not known whether the money which

has been granted will suffice, after the expenses yet to be incurred in esta-

blishing the apparatus at Kew shall have been defrayed. In conclusion, it is

recommended to you for your consideration by your Committee, whether
you will not immediately take steps to secure careful and extensive obser-
vations in this most important and hitherto imperfectly investigated branch

--of meteorological science. For this purpose it is suggested, 1. that, if

possible, funds should be provided to supply competent observers in different
parts of the world with the apparatus necessary for making precise and com-
parable observations in absolute measure ; and 2. that before the con-

clusion of the present summer a commencement of electrical observation

from balloons should be made.

Experiments to determine the Effect of Vibratory Action and long-

  continued Changes of Load upon Wrought-iron Girders. By
  William Fairbairn, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S.

Amongst engineers opinions are still much divided upon the question, whe-

ther the continuous changes of load which many wrought-iron constructions

undergo, has any permanent effect upon their ultimate powers of resistance
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

that is, whether a beam or other construction subjected to a perpetual change

of load, would suffer such an alteration in the structure of the iron or the

tenacity of the joints, that it would in time break with a much less force than

its original breaking weight. But few facts are known, and few experiments

Wehave been made bearing on the solution of this question.  know that in

some cases wrought iron subjected to continuous vibration assumes a crystal-

line structure, and is then deteriorated in its cohesive powers ; but we are yet

very ignorant of the causes of this change, and of the precise conditions

under which it occurs.

  A few experiments were made by the Commission appointed to inquire

into the application of iron to railway structures, to ascertain the effect of

changes of load upon homogeneous bars of wrought and cast iron. They

found with cast iron that no bar would stand 4000 impacts, bending them

through one-half of their ultimate deflection, but that sound bars would
                                       --

--46 REPORT 1860.

sustain at least 4000 impacts, bending them through one-third of their ulti-

mate statical deflection. They ascertained also, that when the load was

placed upon the bars without impact, if the deflection did not exceed one-

third of the ultimate deflection, the bar was not weakened ; but that if the
deflection amounted to one-half the ultimate deflection, the bars were broken

with not more than 900 changes of load. With wrought iron bars they

found no perceptible effect from 10,000 changes of load, when the deflections

were produced by a weight equal to half the statical breaking weight.

These experiments are interesting so far as they go, but they are very in-

complete as regards wrought iron. For wrought-iron bars they were not

continued long enough, nor do they apply to those larger constructions in

which the homogeneous bar is replaced by riveted plates. The influence

of change of load on riveted constructions possesses a special importance,

from its bearing on the question of the proper proportion of strength in

plate and tubular bridges. Do these constructions gradually become weak-

ened from the continual passage of trains? and is it requisite to make allow-

ance for such a deterioration by increased sectional area of material in their

original construction? These questions I have sought to solve by the fol-

lowing experiments.

As the load is brought upon bridges in a gradual manner, the apparatus

Ais designed to imitate as far as possible this condition.  riveted beam is

fixed on brickwork supports, 20 feet apart. Beneath this is placed a lever

grasping the lower web of the beam, and fastened upon a pivot at the ful-

crum. At the other extremity it carries the scale and weights. This lever

is lifted clear of the beam, and again lowered upon it by means of a connect-

ing rod attached to one of the arms of a spur-wheel placed at a considerable

distance overhead. In this way any required part of the breaking weight

can be lifted off and replaced upon the beam alternately by the revolution of

the spur-wheel. The apparatus is worked night and day by a water-wheel,

and the number of changes of load is registered by a counter.

The girder subjected to vibration in these experiments is a plate girder of

20 feet clear span, and of the following dimensions :

Gicssen, 1859; Lithologia meteorica del Profesor Joaquin Balcells, Barce-

lona, 1854 ; Report on Meteorites, by Prof. Shepard ; Reports of the Smith-
sonian Institution, United States ; Silliman's American Journal ; as well as

various private notices and public journals. I have likewise to acknowledge

the kind assistance and valuable information received from Herr P. A. Kessel-

meyer, Dr. Buchner, Herr VV. von Haidinger, and Professor Heis.

3. The few abbreviations used in this Catalogue speak for themselves, and

hardly need explanation. Where weights of meteorites are stated, it is gene-

rally intended to denominate lbs. Troy, English, though sometimes the Vienna

or Prussian pound has unavoidably been given. Tables of analysis are added

at the end of the catalogues. Genuine cases of stone- or iron-falls and de-

tonating meteors, are marked with an asterisk (*), and in the Tables count

for 1 ; doubtful cases are marked in the Catalogue with a (?), and count as \

in the Tables.

The numbers in some of the Tables, it will be found, do not quite agree

with those in the corresponding Tables given in the Report on Luminous

Meteors, in the Volume of the British Association Reports for 1860, owing

to the circumstance that when that Report was presented at the Oxford Meet-

ing the present Catalogue was not then quite completed.

  A4. few remarks are added to the Tables, which do not call for much

comment in this place, as they have mostly already been alluded to in the

aforesaid Report. With regard to the November period for shooting stars,

E. C. Herrick, of the United States, considers it to be advancing into the

year; in a.d. 1202, it occurred about the 26th October; in 1366 on October

30th ; so that the motion of the node of the zone or ring which furnishes

these shooting stars, is at the rate of 3 or 4 days a century ; the period itself

being a recurrent one probably of about 33 years. (See Silliman's Journal,

No. 91, p. 137, for January 1861.;

5. In the Catalogue itself great care has been taken in separating the dif-

ferent kinds ol fireballs and aerolites; hitherto this has not been clone with

sufficient care, and large meteors have not unfrequently been called aerolitic,

when not even any detonation has been reported ; examples of this not

unfrequently occur in the catalogues of Baumhauer, Kamtz, and Arago.

Dr. Buchner of Giessen, and P. A. Kesselmeyer of Frankfort-on-Maine, will,

I understand, shortly bring out catalogues of aerolitic falls, where details

in matters concerning original authorities and geographical distribution, &c.

will be given very fully.

  AIn the Tables at the end of this Catalogue, Class includes only cases

where stones or irons have really fallen ; Class B, meteors accompanied by

detonation ; Class C, first-class meteors not accompanied by detonation ; this
class includes all fireballs given in the catalogues up to the year 1820; after

that time, only the most remarkable ones, as in consequence of the subsequent

greatly increased number of observations from about that time, it is evident

the described fireballs would probably be of smaller size than for older ob-

Dservations ; Class includes all fireballs mentioned in the catalogues and

supplements, large or small, where no detonation was reported, and of course

includes the C class. The Tables are so constructed, that a glance will suffice

to show the results as regards numbers and dates, and the proportion which

one class bears to another ; some of them will be found to be not without

some interest.

--Note. Wherever the words ·' Stone-fall " or " Iron-fall " occur, it may be

understood, as a rule, that such phenomenon was also accompanied by a

detonating fireball, or at least by a detonation.

                                                                                                           119

                                                        REMARKS.

   1. While there appear to be eight yearly maximum and minimum aerolitic

periods for the years generally, there are likewise some indications of other

periods for some of the months taken separately.
   Some months may have major or longer periods of maximum, as Novem-

ber, which perhaps has one of about 70 years (though for the sporadic
showers, according to Herrick, one of 33 years, in which case the numbers

of shooting stars should now be again on the increase, so as to culminate in

1 866). January has also probably a long or irregular period, as regards

Aclasses and B. Of late years the numbers for December and January

have evidently been on the increase, and especially as regards the former

month, and this as regards all classes ; and the eighth to the seventeenth days
appears to embrace a time favourable to a considerable increase over the

average for the month. Tables I., II., III., and IV.

2. The proportionate numbers of each class appear to have varied at dif-

ferent times for the different months. Table VIII.

3. There appear to be aerolitic and meteor epochs both distinct from and

Acommon to each other.                                  proximate attempt has been made to show some

of these in  Table V.                                   perhaps some  of these  are  more  apparent  than  real
                                                     ;

but the subject is worth consideration.

A4. While the aerolitic class, and B, in its total is under the average for

August, which is the principal and most constant month for an abundance of

sporadic meteors, it is over the average for November, likewise a month

noted for an abundant display of meteors and shooting stars ; and while there

is an increase over the average of detonating meteors (though not of recorded

Stone-falls), from the 9th to the 13th of November, i. e. precisely during the

regular periodical appearance, it is not a little singular that the August aero-

litic period, if it may be so called, precedes by several days the usual period

of greatest abundance of the shooting stars ; one being August 4 to 7, both

inclusive, and the other August 9 to 12. See Table III.

5. The decided preponderance of aerolitic phenomena, alluded to in the

Report as occurring in the afternoon, as compared with the forenoon, will

be seen clearly given in Table IX.

6. As regards the observed direction of aerolitic and first-class meteors,

there would seem not to be any very great tendency one way or the other

it would have been natural to have expected a much more decided leaning to

a Westerly direction. The sudden change from an Easterly direction in Sep-

tember and October (about the time of the autumnal equinox), to a Westerly

direction in November, is remarkable, and calls for especial notice.

7. The considerable increase of aerolitic falls and meteors for the months

of June and July over those of December and January has been previously

alluded to in the Report itself. That more detonating meteors in proportion

to Stone-falls should be recorded during the winter months than during the

summer months, is precisely what might have been expected, and the reverse

holds equally good. Tables VI. and VII.

8. Taking the entire year, there is a much greater tendency towards equality

of distribution in the aerolitic class than is the case with sporadic shooting stars

and the smaller meteors; indeed, were it not for the excess in November (an

excess common to every class apparently), the numbers of the former (A and

B) would be about equal for the first as for the second half of the year.

--39. Residues of the Higher Powers. Researches of Jacobi. The principles

which have sufficed for the determination of the laws of reciprocity affecting

quadratic, cubic, biquadratic, and sextic residues, are found to be inadequate

when we come to residues of the 5th, 7th, or higher powers. This was early-

observed by Jacobi, when, after his investigations of the cubic and biqua-

dratic theorems, he turned his attention to residues of the 5th, 8th, and 12th

powers*. It was evident, from a comparison of the cubic and biquadratic

theories, that in the investigation of the laws of reciprocity the ordinary

prime numbers of arithmetic must be replaced by certain factors of those

prime numbers composed of roots of unity ; and Jacobi, in the note just re-

ferred to, has indicated very clearly the nature of those factors in the case

of the 5th, 8th, and 12th powers respectively. He ascertained that the two

complex factors composed of 5th roots of unity into which ever)' prime

number of the form 5n+l is resoluble by virtue of Theorem IV. of art. SO

of tbis Report, are not prime numbers, i. e. are each capable of decomposi-

tion into the product of two similar complex numbers; so that every (real)

prime number of the form 5n-\-] is to be regarded as the product of four

conjugate complex factors ; and these factors are precisely the complex primes

which we have to consider in the theory of ;quintic residues, in the place of

the real primes they divide. To this we may add that primes of the forms

+ --5?i 2 continue primes in the complex theory ; while those of the form 5n

resolve themselves into two complex prime factors. Thus

where a is an imaginary 5th root of unity. Precisely similar remarks apply

--to the theories of residues of 8tli and 12th powers, real primes of the forms

+8«+l, 12« 1> resolving themselves into four factors composed of Sth and

12th roots of unity respectively. By considerations similar to those pre-

viously employed by him in the case of biquadratic and cubic residues,

Jacobi succeeded in demonstrating (though he has not enunciated) the for-

mulae of reciprocity affecting those powers for the particular case in which

one of the two primes compared is a real number. But it would seem that

he never obtained the law of reciprocity for the general case of any two
complex primes; and indeed, for a reason which will afterwards appear, it

was hardly possible that he should do so, so long as he confined himself to

the consideration of those complex numbers which present themselves in the

theory of the division of the circle. No less unsuccessful were the efforts of

Eisenstein to obtain the formulae relating to 8th powers, by an extension of

the elliptical properties employed by him in his later proofs of the biqua-
dratic theorem*. It does not appear that any subsequent writer has occu-

pied himself with these special theories ; while, on the other hand, the theory
of complex numbers composed with roots of unity of which the exponent is
any prime, has been the subject of an important series of investigations by

MM. Diriehlet and Kummer, and has led the latter eminent mathematician

to the discovery and demonstration of the law of reciprocity, which holds for
all powers of which the exponent is a prime number not included in a cer-

tain exceptional class.

 --40. Necessity fur the Introduction of Ideal Primes. The fundamental pro-

position of ordinary arithmetic, that if two numbers have each of them no

common divisor with a third number, their product has no common divisor
with that third number, is, as we have seen, applicable to complex num-

bers formed with 3rd or 4th roots of unity, because it is demonstrable that

Euclid's theory of the greatest common divisor is applicable in each of those
cases. With complex numbers of higher orders this is no longer the case;

and it is accordingly found that the arithmetical consequences of Euclid's
process, which are of so much importance in the simpler cases, cease to exist

in the general theory. In particular, the elementary theorem, that a number
can be decomposed into prime factors in one way only, ceases to exist for

--complex numbers composed of 23rd f or higher roots of unity if, at least

(iu the case of complex as of real numbers), we understand by a prime fac-
tor, a factor which cannot itself be decomposed into simpler factors %. It
appears, therefore, that in the higher complex theories, a number is not
necessarily a prime number simply because it cannot be resolved into com-

--plex factors. But by the introduction of a new arithmetical conception

that of ideal prime factors M. Kummer has shown that the analogy with
the arithmetic of common numbers is completely restored. Some prelimi-

nary observations are, however, necessary to explain clearly in what this con-

ception consists.

gral number. To this form every rational and integral function of a can

always be reduced ; and it follows, from the irreducibility of the equation

ax --
  -- t-=0, that the same complex number cannot be expressed in this

  a. 1

reduced form in two different ways. The norm of F(a) is the real integer

--obtained by forming the product of all the X 1 values of F(a), so that

N = N =N. F(«)                           . F(a»-1 )=F(a) . F(«") . F(aa ) . . . T(**- 1 ).

The operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication present no pecu-
liarity in the case of these complex numbers ; by the introduction of the
norm, the division of one complex number by another is reduced to the case
in which the divisor is a real integer. Thus

and /(a.) is said to be divisible by F(a) when every coefficient in the pro-
duct /(a)F(a2 )F(a3 ) ... F(ax_1 ), developed and reduced to the form (A),

is divisible by N.F(a). When /(a) is not divisible by F(a), it is not, in

general, possible to render the norm of the remainder less than the norm of

the divisor; and it is owing to this circumstance that the common rule for

finding the greatest common divisor is not generally applicable to complex

numbers.      If,  in  the  expression   (A),     we    consider  the  numbers   a  ,  o ...ax_2

--as indeterminate*, the norm is a certain homogeneous function of order X 1,

identical with the inquiry whether it is or is not capable of representation by

a certain homogeneous form, which is, in fact, the resultant of the two forms

The problem is considered in the former aspect by M. Kummer, in the latter
by Dirichlet. The methods of Dirichlet appear to have been of extreme

generality, and are as applicable to complex numbers, composed with the
powers of a root of any irreducible equation having integral coefficients, as
to the complex numbers which we have to consider here. Nevertheless, in
the outline of this theory which we propose to give, we prefer to follow the

course taken by M. Kummer: for Dirichlet' s results have been indicated
by him, for the most part, only in a very summary manner *; nor is it in any
case difficult to assign to them their proper place in M. Kummer's theory

while, on the other hand, it would, perhaps, be impossible to express ade-

quately, in any other form than that which M. Kummer has adopted, the

numerous and important results (including the law of reciprocity itself) con-

^--systems of  1 units may be established by means of a general proposition

due to Dirichlet and relating to any irreducible equation having unity for

its first coefficient, and all its coefficients integral. If, in such an equation,

R be the number of real, and 2 I of imaginary roots, there always exist

+ --systems of R I 1 fundamental units, by means of which all other units

can be expressed; or, in other words, the indeterminate equation "Norm

= 1" is always resoluble in an infinite number of ways, and all its solutions

+can be expressed by means of R I-- 1 fundamental solutions*. The demon-

stration of the actuai existence, in every case, of these systems of fundamental

units (a theorem which is, as Jacobi has said f, " un des plus important?,
mais aussi un des plus epineux de la science des nombres") is of essential im-

portance in the theory of complex numbers, and has the same relation to

But for higher primes the actual calculation of a system of fundamental units

involves great labour ; and a method practically available for the purpose

has not yet been given. It is remarkable that every unit can be rendered

real (*. e. a function     of  the  binary sums  or               periods                   x1    &c.)  by  multi-

the analytical modulus of every one of the quantities ^(*i)' vi/(«2), . . . </<(*,,) be unity, the
system of units is an isolated or singular system. The number of singular systems (if any

such exist) is always finite, whence it is easy to infer that the units they comprise are

simply roots of unity. For if i^(«) be a singular unit, its powers are evidently also singular

units, and therefore cannot be all different from one another; i. e. 4>{ct.) is a root of unity.
If f(x) be of an uneven order, there are no singular units; if/(.r) be of an even order, --1
=is a singular unit; and if f(x)
                                    have any real roots, it is the only singular unit; whereas

=if all the roots of /(a-)     be imaginary, other singular units may iu special cases exist.

                   ---- --=x*~-- 1r
Thus the equation              has 2(\ 1) singular units included in the formula +«*. Ad-

mitting this definition of siugular units, -we may enunciate Dirichlet's theorem as follows :

= I+R--a system of A units [A       1], e^a), e2(a), . . . e*(«)> composed with any root «, can

always be assigned such that every unit composed with the same root can be represented

(and in one way only) by the formula

                            « e.M"· 'i («)"' · <*(«)"»·  3        ·  ·  ·  «*(«)"*.

                                                               -

where n,, « nh2 , · · · are positive or negative integral numbers and w is unity, or some one of
the singular units composed with «.

   The principles on which the demonstration of this theorem depends are very briefly indi-
cated in the notes presented by Dirichlet to the Berlin Academy in 1841, 18-12, and 1846.

and if the determinant 2±(1, 1)(2, 2)                              (ju-- 1, jx-- 1) be equal to unity.

And conversely, every system of fundamental units will be represented by

all systems of integral values in succession consistent with the condition

-- ++2 (l,l)(2,2)(3, 3)...(/i l,/i-- 1)= 1; so that a single system of fun-

damental units represents to us all possible systems.

  We Ashall also have occasion to allude to independent systems of units.

whatever integral values are assigned to the indices «j, n n2 , 3 , ... w^-i.
The equations (A.) will represent all possible systems of independent units,

if we suppose that in them the indices (1,1), (2, 2), (3, 3) . . . receive all

positive and negative integral values, subject only to the condition that the

= +determinant A 2 (l, 1) (2, 2) . . . (/*-- 1, ft-- I) must not vanish. Every

system of fundamental units is also independent; but not conversely. Every

unit can be represented as a product of the powers of the units of an inde-

pendent system ; but if the system be not also fundamental, the indices of the

powers are not in general integral, but are fractions having denominators

which divide A. Lastly, if c^a), c (a), .... c^^a) be a system of inde-

have nevertheless given them here, in order to facilitate arithmetical verifi-

mod q. This relation is expressed in the following theorem :

" Every equation which subsists between any two functions of the periods,

will subsist as a congruence for the modulus q when we substitute for the

periods the roots of the congruence F(y)=0 taken in a certain order."

It is immaterial which root of the congruence we take to correspond to any

given root of the equation. But when this correspondence has once been esta-

blished in a single case, we must attend to the sequence which exists among

the roots of the congruence corresponding to the sequence of the periods.

When u , u lf . . . ue-\ are all incongruous, their order of sequence is deter-

mined by the congruences

the number of incongruous solutions of the congruence is not equal to the

number of the periods. (See a paper by M. Kummer in Crelle's Journal,

M. Kummer has demonstrated the two following theorems:
   (i.) "The necessary and sufficient condition that \p(i]) should be divisible

sible by q) is that the e congruences

should be simultaneously satisfied."

(ii.) " The necessary and sufficient condition that the norm of vp(V), taken

with respect to the periods, i. e. the number ^(ijJiKih)                                            ^(ve~\)> should

should be satisfied."

   These results may be extended to any complex number /(a), by first

reducing it to the form

/This is always possible ; for, since the roots which compose any one

)=0period, e. g. y , are the roots of an equation x (ct                            of order/, the coeffi-

cients of which are complex integers involving the periods onlyf, we may

simply divide/(a) by x( a )> and the remainder will give us the expression
of /(«) in the required form. Further, let q now denote a prime apper-

ftaining to the exponent (not merely satisfying the congruence y/=J,mod A,

but also satisfying no congruence of lower index and of the same form).
The two preceding theorems are then replaced by the two following, which

are analogous to them, and include them.

       The outline of the theory of complex numbers contained in this and the subsequent
arttiiccllees is chiefly derived from M. Rummer's memoire in Liouville, vol. xvi. p. 411.

same/ congruences are comprehended in the single formula

                       ¥(»;e-i)/(a)=0, mod q.

The utility of this latter mode of expressing the/ congruences will appear in
the sequel: the formula F(wi)=0, mod q, is of importance, because it

supplies an immediate demonstration of the important proposition, that "if

a product of two factors be congruous to zero for the substitution ?j =w;t,

--one or other of the factors must be congruous to zero for that substitution."
   46. Definition of Ideal Prime Factors. To develope the consequences of
the preceding theorems, let us consider a prime number q appertaining to

the exponent/; and let us first suppose that it is capable of being expressed
as the norm (taken with respect to the periods) of a complex number 4>(r) ),
which contains the periods of/ terms only; so that

                       9=^( rlo) «K>h)           ^(Ve-i)'

If the substitution of u in \p render ^(11^=0, mod q, we may distinguish

the e factors of q by meaus of the substitutions which respectively render

them congruous to zero; so that, for example, --vi(?/e ft) is the factor apper-

taining to the substitution j/ =wj..

We thus obtain the theorem that if/(a) be congruous to zero, mod q, for

=uany substitution ri   /(a)  is divisible       by the  factor of q appertaining  to

                       ,

                                ON THE THEORY OF NUMBERS.                                                                 131

   Again, it may be shown that these complex factors of q are primes in the
most proper sense of the word : i. e., first, that they are incapable of reso-

lution into any two complex factors, unless one of those factors be a complex

unit; and secondly, that if any one of them divide the product of two factors,

it necessarily divides one or other of the two factors separately. That \p(r) )
possesses the first property is evident, because its norm is a real prime, and

that it possesses the second is a consequence of the last theorem of Art. 45.

For  if iK»/  )  divide/j(a) x/ (a),                                    either f(a)   or/ (a),        by virtue  of that  theo-

either/ (a)      or/ (a)        is  divisible      by                   ^(>?  ).

Now, if every prime q which appertains to the exponent/ were actually

capable of resolution into e complex factors composed of the e periods of

/roots, these factors would represent to us all the true primes to be con-

sidered in the theory of the residues of Xth powers. And for values of X infe-

rior to 11, perhaps to 23, this is, in fact, the case. But for higher values of

X, the real primes appertaining to the exponent /divide themselves into two

different groups, according as they are or are not susceptible of resolution

into e conjugate factors. Let, then, q represent any prime appertaining to the

exponent/, whether susceptible or not of this resolution, and let /(a) still

denote a complex number which is rendered congruous to zero by the sub-

it is verified, as we have just seen, when q is actually resoluble into e con-

jugate factors; and its introduction is justified, as M. Kummer observes, by

its utility. To obtain a definition of the multiplicity of an ideal factor, we

may employ a complex number ^(r/) possessing the property indicated in

the last article. If of the two congruences

positions are partly restatements (in conformity with the definitions now

introduced) of results to which we have already referred, and partly simple

corollaries from them. They will serve to show that the elementary proper-

ties of ordinary integers may now be transferred to complex numbers.

A(1.)         complex number is divisible by q when it contains all the ideal

factors of q. If it contain all of those factors n times, but not all of them

+«   l  times,   it  is  divisible      by      n                       but  not  by    n+1

                                              q,

(2.) The norm of a complex number is divisible by q when the complex

number contains one of the ideal factors of q. If (counting multiple factors)

it contain, in all, h of the ideal factors of q, the norm is divisible by q lf, but
by no higher power of q (/denoting the exponent to which q appertains).

  A(3.) product of two or more factors contains the same ideal divisors as

its factors taken together.

(4.) The necessary and sufficient condition that one complex number

should be divisible by another is, that the dividend should contain all the

ideal factors of the divisor at least as often as the divisor.

   (5.) Two complex number-s which contain the same ideal factors are

identical, or else differ only by a unit factor.

   (6.) Every complex number contains a finite number of ideal prime fac-
tors. These ideal prime factors (as well as the multiplicity of each of them)

are perfectly determinate.

                                                                                                                 k2

The prime number \ is the only real prime excluded from the preceding

X=(l--considerations. Since  a)(l--  2   ..  ..(1-- aX- 1 ),  it  appears  that  the

i_by H } 3 that the sum of the coefficients of the complex number should

be congruous to zero for the modulus X, and because the sum of the coeffi-

cients of a product of complex numbers is congruous, for the modulus X, to

the product of the sums of the coefficients of the factors, it appears that if

the norm of a complex number is divisible by X, the complex number is itself

--divisible by 1 a; and also that if the product of two complex numbers be

divisible by 1 --a, one or other of the factors separately must be divisible by

1-- a. Hence 1-- a is a true complex prime, and is the only prime factor of

X; infact,X=(l-a)(l-a2 )...(l-aX-i)= e (,,)(i-n)^- 1 , if e(a) denote

   The theorems which have preceded enable us to give a definition of the

norm of an ideal complex number. If the ideal number contain the factor

-- m1 a times, and if it besides contain k,k',k", .... prime factors of the

primes q, q', q", .... appertaining to the exponents/,/',/", .... respectively,

we are to understand by its norm, the positive integral number

                  \m 9 Vq<k<f'q''k"f"              ;

a definition which, by virtue of the second proposition of this article, is

exact in the case of an actually existing number.

   It will be observed that the number of actual or ideal prime factors (com-
pound of Xth roots of unity) into which a given real prime can be decom-

posed, depends exclusively on the exponent to which the prime appertains

~for the modulus X. If the exponent is /, the number of ideal factors is
        =e. Thus, if q be a primitive root of X, q continues a prime in the
 J X-i

complex theory ; if it be a primitive root of the congruence x 2 =1, mod X,

it is oidy resoluble into two conjugate prime factors. This dependence of
the number of ideal prime factors of a given prime upon the exponent to

which it appertains is a remarkable instance of an intimate and simple con-
nexion between two properties of the same prime number, which appear at

first sight to have no immediate connexion with one another.

   It may be convenient to remark that the word Ideal is sometimes used so

as to include, and sometimes so as to exclude, actually existent complex
numbers; but it is not apprehended that any confusion can arise from this

ambiguity, which it is not worth while to remove at the expense of intro-
ducing a new technical term.

 --48. Classification of Ideal Numbers. An ideal number (using the term

in its restricted sense) is incapable of being exhibited in an isolated form
as a complex integer; as far as has yet appeared, it has no quantitative

existence; and the assertion that a given complex number contains an ideal
factor, is only a convenient mode of expressing a certain set of congruential
conditions which are satisfied by the coefficients of the complex number.
Nevertheless we may, without fear of error, represent ideal numbers by the
same symbols, /(a), F(a), ^(a) ... , which we have employed to denote
actually existing complex numbers, if we are only careful to remember that
these symbols, when the numbers which they represent are ideal, admit of
                                                            ON THE THEORY OP NUMBERS,                                                             133

combination by multiplication or division, but not by addition or subtraction.

Thus/(a)x/,(a),/(a)-f-./i(a), [/(a)]"\ are significant symbols, and their

interpretation is contained in what has preceded ; but we have no general
interpretation of a combination such as/(a)+/i(a)j or /(a)--/(a)*. This
symbolic representation of ideal numbers is very convenient, and tends to

abbreviate many demonstrations.

Every ideal number is a divisor of an actual number, and, indeed, of an

infinite number of actual numbers. Also, if the ideal number <p(a) be a

divisor of the actual number F(a), the quotient 0j(a)=F(a)-r^(a) is always

ideal ; for if ^(a) were an actual number, <p(cc), which is the quotient of

F(«) divided by (p^a,), ought also to be an actual number. It appears,

therefore, that there exists an infinite number of different ideal multipliers,
which all render actual the same ideal number. It has, however, been shown

by M. Kummer that a finite number of ideal multipliers are sufficient to

render actual all ideal numbers whatever; so that it is possible (and that in

an infinite number of different ways) to assign a system of ideal multipliers,

such that every ideal number is rendered actual by one of them, and one only.

Ideal numbers are thus distributed into a certain finite number of classes,
a class comprehending those numbers which are rendered actual by the same

multiplier; and this distribution into classes is independent of the particular

system of multipliers by which it is effected, inasmuch as it is found that if

two ideal numbers be rendered actual by the same multiplier, every other

multiplier which renders one of them actual will also render the other actual.

Ideal numbers which belong to the same class are said to be equivalent; so

that two ideal numbers, which are each of them equivalent to a third, are

Weequivalent to one another.                                                may regard actual numbers (which need

no ideal multiplier) as forming the first or principal class in the distribution,

and, consequently, as all equivalent to one another. If/(a) be equivalent to

--/^a), and </>(a) to ^(a),/(a)xf(a) is equivalent to/, (a) X ^(a), a result

which is expressed by saying that "equivalent ideal numbers multiplied by

equivalent numbers, give equivalent products;" and the class of the product

is said to be the class compounded of the classes of the factors.

 --49. Representation of Ideal Numbers as the roots of Actual Numbers.

An important conclusion is deducible from the theorem that the number of

classes of ideal numbers is finite. Let /(a) be any ideal number; and let us

consider  the                                       series  of ideal   numbers /(a),      /(a) 2                      /(a) 3,  .  ..  These numbers
                                                                                                                   ,

cannot all belong to different classes ; we can therefore find two different

powers of/(a), for example [/(«)]'" and [/(a)3'n+n, which are equivalent

to one another. But the equivalence of these numbers implies that [/(a)] n

+is equivalent to the actual number 1 ; i. e. that [/(a)]" is itself an actual

Wenumber.                                           may therefore enunciate the theorem, " Every ideal number,

raised to a certain power, becomes an actual number."

The index of this power is the same for all ideal numbers of the same class,

but may be different for different classes. By reasoning precisely similar

to that employed by Euler in his 2nd proof of Fermat's Theoremf, it may

be proved                                        that  the      index  of the  first  term  in                        the    series f( a),  [/(a)] 2
                                                                                                                                                                          ,

[/(a)] 3 . .                                     ,  which   is  an  actual  number,   is  either                      equal    to     the  whole  number

of classes, or to a submultiple of that number. This least index is said to be

the exponent to which the class of ideal numbers containing /(a) appertains.

   * These symbols are, however, interpretablc when /(n) ancl/j(a) belong to the same

+fclass. Thus, if ip (a.) X/(«) and <p (a) x/, (a) be both actual, /('*) r («) is the ideal quo-
Xftient obtained by dividing ip (a) X/(«) +(p («) x («) by tp (a).

It would seem that for certain values of the prime X, there exist classes of

Hideal numbers appertaining to the exponent H, if denote the number of

classes of ideal numbers*. Such classes (when they exist) possess a property

similar to that of the primitive roots of prime numbers ; i.e., by compounding

such a class continually with itself we obtain all possible classes, just as by
continually multiplying a primitive root by itself we obtain all residues

prime to the prime of which it is a primitive root. It has, however, been

ascertained by M. Kummer that these ·primitive classes do not in all cases,

or even in general, exist.

   The theorem of this article enables us to express ideal numbers as roots

of actually existing complex numbers. Thus, if q be a prime appertaining
to the exponenty for the modulus X, and resoluble into the product of e con-

jugate ideal factors <(>(ri ), <p(vi)> "K^)* · · · (fi^e-i)' these ideal numbers, which

will not in general belong to the same class, will nevertheless appertain to

--50. The Number of Classes of Ideal Numbers. The number of classes of

ideal numbers was first determined by Dirichlet. He effected this determi-

nation by methods which he had previously introduced into the higher

arithmetic, and which had already led him to a demonstration of the cele-

brated theorem, that every arithmetical progression, the terms of which are

prime to their common difference, contains an infinite number of prime
numbers, and to the determination of the number of non-equivalent classes

of quadratic forms of a given determinant f. Dirichlet's investigation of the

problem which we are here considering has never been published ; but that

since given by M. Kummer is probably in all essential lespects the same, as

it reposes on an extension of the principles developed in Dirichlet's earlier

memoirs. Our limits compel us to omit the details of M. Kummer's analysis

for the years 1837 (p. 45) and 1841 (p. 141), or in Liouville, vol. iv. p. 393, ix. p. 255. The

first of these papers relates to progressions of real integers, the second to progressions of

complex numbers of the form a-\-bi. In the memoir " Hecherches sur diverses applications

de l'analyse iunnitesimale a la Theorie des Nombres" (Crelle, vol. xix. p. 24, xxi. pp. 1,

& 134), Dirichlet has applied his method to quadratic forms having real and integral co-

efficients and                                 in a subsequent memoir (Crelle, vol. xxiv. p. 291), he has extended this ap-

tremely laborious, as it requires the preliminary investigation of a system of

presents somewhat less difficulty ; and M. Kummer (though not without great

labour) has assigned its value for all primes inferior to 100. For the

primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, that value is unity; for 23 it is 3, and then
increases with extraordinary rapidity ; so that for 97 it already amounts to

is expressed by the formula

every complex prime is actual. In the absence of any determination of a

=system of fundamental units for X=ll, X=13, X 17, and X=19, it is not

possible to say whether this is or is not the case for these values also. But

 H --51. Criterion of the Divisibility of by X. The number of classes of

ideal numbers, which we have symbolized by H, is not in general divisible

--by X ; but in certain cases it may happen that it is so. The quotient is

------never divisible by X, except when the other factor - p                                                                    is also divisible

by X. And it has been found by M. Kummer that the necessary and sufficient

condition for the divisibility of (7~2-x^y~ i byJ X is that the numerator of one of

the first p.-- 1 fractions of Bernoulli should be divisible by X. The investi-

gation of this singular criterion depends on a transformation of the function

tions of Bernoulli, and which consequently divides the number of classes of

ideal numbers composed with Xth roots of unity, is termed by M. Kummer

an exceptional prime. Such primes have to be excluded from the enunciation
of several important propositions ; and their theory presents difficulties which
have not yet been overcome. Thus the following propositions are true for all

primes other than the exceptional primes, but are not true for the exceptional

primes.

(1.) The exponent to which any class of ideal numbers appertains (see

art. 49) is prime to X.

   (2.) The index of the lowest power of any unit which can be expressed

as a product of integral powers of the trigonometric units is prime to X. For

--that index is a divisor of   (see art. 42).

   (3.) Every complex unit which is congruous to a real integer for the
modulus X is a perfect Xth power. (Whether X be an exceptional prime or
not, the Xth power of any complex number is congruous, for the modulus X,
to a real integer, viz. to the sum of the coefficients of the complex number.)

* In Liouville, vol. i. (New Series) p. 396, M. Kronecker has given a very simple demon-

stration of the congruence

(<t.) If /(a) denote any (actual) complex number prime to X (i. e. not

1--divisible by    a), a complex unit e (a) can always be assigned, such that

the product F(a)=e (a)f(a) shall satisfy the two congruences

                   =F («) F (*-') [F (l)] 2, mod X,

               =F(*) F(1), mod(l-a)2.

A complex number satisfying these two congruential conditions is called a

primary complex number ; the product of two primary numbers is there-

fore itself primary. This definition, in the particular case X=3, includes

the primary numbers of art. 37, taken either positively or negatively.

N actual numbers can always be assigned such that every complex number

shall be congruous to one and only to one of them for the modulus cj> (a).

residues for the modulus $(a) ; and by omitting the term divisible by (j> («),

pertaining to the exponent 1, for the modulus X, i. e. if q be of the linear form

+wiX 1, the real numbers 0, 1, 2, 3...q-- 1 will represent the terms of a

complete system of residues for the modulus <p (a) ; but if <p (a) be a factor
of a prime appertaining to any higher exponent than unity, a complete system

will contain complex as well as real integral residues.

By applying the principle (see art. 10) that a system of residues prime

to the modulus, multiplied by a residue prime to the modulus, produces

a system of residues prime to the modulus, we obtain the theorem, which

=here replaces Fermat's Theorem, that if i^(a) be any actual number prime
to («), [;// (a)] 1*- 1          1, mod</> (a). If we combine with this theorem the
<f)

principle of Lagrange (cited in art. 11) which is valid for complex no less

than for real prime modules, we may extend, mutatis mutandis, to the general

complex theory the elementary propositions relating to the Residues of

Powers, Primitive Roots, and Indices, which, as we have seen, exist in the

case of complex primes formed with cubic or biquadratic roots of unity. In

fact, these propositions are of a character of even greater generality, and may

be extended, not only to complex numbers formed with roots of unity whose

index is a composite number, but also to all complex numbers formed with

the roots of equations having integral coefficients, as soon as the prime fac-

tors of those complex numbers are properly defined.

   It will be seen, therefore, that the exceptional primes of art. 52 are ex*

--eluded from M. Kuinmer's law of reciprocity, for a twofold reason : first,

because if X be one of those numbers, the definition of a primary number is

not in general applicable ; and secondly, because, on the same supposition,

the symbol xA_J may become unmeaning.

which the Xtic characters of these numbers may be determined have been

We56. have already observed (see art. 39) that it is impossible to deduce

a proof of the highest laws of reciprocity from the formulae which pre-

sent themselves in the theory of the division of the circle. It is true (as we

shall presently see) that the formulae IV. and V. of art. 30 determine the

--decomposition of the real prime p (supposed to be of the form k\+l) into its

X 1 complex prime factors ; but it will be perceived that these complex fac-

The inapplicability of the formulae of art. 30 to any general demonstration of

the law of reciprocity is thus apparent. The only equation of reciprocity

that has been elicited from them is the following :

appertaining to the exponent/ for the modulus X. This equation, which, if

we adopt the generalized meaning of the symbol of reciprocity, may be writ-

who inferred it from M. Kummer's investigation of the ideal prime divisors

of \p(a ) ( see a note addressed by Eisenstein to Jacobi, and communicated

by Jacobi to the Berlin Academy, in the Monatsberichte for 1850, May 30,

p. 189). In a later memoir (Crelle's Journal, vol. xxxix. p. 351), Eisenstein

--proposes an ingenious method reposing, however, on an undemonstrated
--principle for the discovery of the higher laws of reciprocity ; but it would

seem that the application of this method failed to lead him to any definite

result; and it is unquestionably to M. Kummer alone that we are indebted

for the enunciation as well as for the demonstration of the theorem.

   57. M. Kummer appears to have waited until he had developed the theory

of complex numbers with a certain approximation to completeness, before

proceeding to apply the principles he had discovered to the purpose which

he had in view throughout, the investigation of the law of reciprocity. He

succeeded in discovering the law which we have enunciated, in the year

184.-7, and, after verifying it by calculated tables of some extent, he commu-

nicated it to Dirichlet and Jacobi in January 1848, and subsequently, in

1850, to the Berlin Academy, in a note which also contained the demonstra-

tion of the complementary theorems relating to the units, and the prime

divisors of X. From the analogy of the cubic theorem, it was natural to

conjecture that the law of reciprocity would assume the simple form

-- = pf J (--2 ) f° r primes p x and 2 reduced, by multiplication with proper

complex units, to a form satisfying certain congruential conditions. But

to determine properly these conditions, i. e. to assign the true definition

of a primary complex prime, was no doubt the principal difficulty that M.

Kummer had to overcome in the discovery of his theorem. If X=3, the

/single congruence  (a) =/(l),  mod  (1-- 2                     characterizes  a

                                             a) , sufficiently

primary number; and since, whatever prime be represented by X, that con-

gruence is satisfied by one, and one only, of the numbers included in the

   k      (a), it was probable that it ought to form one of the con-

a.
fformula

gruential conditions included in the definition of a primary complex prime.

In determining the second condition, M. Kummer appears to have been

guided by a method which depends on the arithmetical properties of

the logarithmic expansion of a complex number. If we develope log "' ^ /

   58. The methods to which M. Kummer at first had recourse in order to

obtain a demonstration of his theorem, consisted in extensions of the theory

of the division of the circle. By such extensions he demonstrated the com-

plementary theorems, and even a particular case of the law of reciprocity

--itself that in which the two complex primes compared are conjugate. But,

after repeated efforts, he found himself compelled to abandon these methods,

and to seek elsewhere for more fertile principles. " I turned my attention,"

he says, " to Gauss's second demonstration of the law of quadratic recipro-

city, which depends on the theory of quadratic forms. Though the method

of this demonstration had never been extended to any other than quadratic

residues, yet its principles appeared to me to be characterized by such

generality as led me to hope that they might be successfully applied to

residues of higher powers ; and in this expectation I was not disappointed t."

M. Rummer's demonstration of the law of reciprocity was communicated

to the Academy of Berlin in the year 1858, ten years after the date of his

first discovery of it. An outline of the demonstration is contained in the

Monatsberichte for that year; and it is exhibited with great clearness and

fulness of detail in a memoir published in the Berlin Transactions for

1859, which contains what is for the present the latest result of science on

a problem which, if we date from the first enunciation of the quadratic

theorem by Euler, has been studied by so many eminent geometers for

nearly a century. It would, however, be impossible, without exceeding the

limits within which this Report is confined, to give an account of its contents,

which should be intelligible to persons not already familiar with the subject

to which it refers. Taken by itself the demonstration of the theorem is, indeed,

sufficiently simple ; but it is based on a long series of preliminary researches

relating to the complex numbers that can be formed with the roots of the

=D Dequation wK
        (z), in which (a) itself denotes a complex number com-

posed of Xth roots of unity. To those researches, and to the demonstration

of the law of reciprocity founded on them, we shall again very briefly refer,

when we come to speak of the corresponding investigations in the theory of

quadratic forms, an acquaintance with which is essential to a comprehension

of the method adopted by M. Kummer in his memoir. We may add that

when n, as in the text, is a product of powers of different primes. This demonstration was
first given by M. Kronecker (Liouville, vol. xiw p. 177), who has been followed by M. De-

that the quotient ^ represents the number of conjugate ideal prime fac-

tors contained in the real prime q, appertaining to the exponent t. If q be a

divisor of n, the definition of its ideal factors requires a certain modification,

which we cannot here particularize. (See sect. 6 of M. Rummer's Memoir.)

The two definitions, corresponding to the cases of q prime to n, and q a
divisor of n, enable us. when taken together, to transfer to the general case

when n is composite, the elementary theorems already shown to exist when

Wen is prime (see art. 47).         may add that it is easy to prove, in the general

as in the special case (see art. 48), that the number of classes of ideal num-

bers is finite.

   J Fermat's enunciation of this celebrated theorem is contained in the first of the MS. notes
placed by him on the margin of his copy of Bachet's edition of Diophantus. It would seem
that this copy is now lost ; but in the year 16/0 an edition of Bachet's Diophantus was pub-
lished at Toulouse, by Samuel de Fermat (the son of the great geometer), in which these
notes are preserved (Diophanti Alexandrini Arithmeticorurn libri sex, et de Numeris Mult-
angulis liber unus, cum commentarris C. G. Bacheti V. C. et observationibus D. P. de Fermat
senatoris Tolosani. Tolosae 1670). The theorems contained in them are, with a few excep-
tions, enunciated without proof; and it may be inferred from the preface of S. Fermat, that

he found no demonstration of thein among his father's papers. Nevertheless, in the case of
several of these propositions, we have the assertion of Fermat himself, that he was in posses-
sion of their demonstration ; and although, when we consider the imperfect state of analysis
in his ti:ne, it is surprising that he should have succeeded in creating methods which sub-
sequent mathematicians have failed to rediscoyer, yet there is no ground for the suspicion

that he was guilty of an untruth, or that he mistook an apparent for a real proof. In fact
these suspicions are refuted, not only by the reputation for honour and veracity which he

enjoyed among his contemporaries, and by the evidence of singular clearness of insight
which his extant writings supply, but also by the facts of the case itself. It would be iuex-

has left us a proof of the impossibility of this equation in the case of n=i;

by a method which Euler has extended to the case of ?*=3, we may suppose,
without loss of generality, that 71 is an uneven prime A greater than 3, and we

plicable, if his conclusions reposed on induction only, that he should never have adopted an
erroneous generalization ; and yet, with the exception of the " Last Theorem " (the demon-
stration of which, after two centuries, is still incomplete), every proposition of Fermat's has

been verified by the labours of his successors. There is, indeed, one other exception to this
statement; but it is an exception which proves the rule. In the letter to Sir Kenelm Digby

which concludes the ' Commercium Epistolieum, etc' edited by Wallis (Oxford, 1658),

+1Fermat enuntiates the proposition that the numbers contained in the formula 2 2                                            are all

primes, acknowledging, however, that, though convinced of its truth, he had not succeeded

in obtaining its demonstration.           This    letter,  which  is  undated,  was  written in  1C58                        but it
                                                                                                                          ;

appears, from a letter of Fermat's to M. de * * *, dated October 18, 1640, that even at that

earlier date he was acquainted with the proposition, and had convinced himself of its trutli

(D. Petri de Fermat Varia Opera Mathematica, Tolosse, 1679, p. 162). It was, however,

subsequently observed by Euler that 22 5 +l=4294967297 = 641x6700417, i. e. that the

undemonstrated proposition is untrue (Op. Arith. collecta, vol. i. p. 356). The error, if it is
an error, is a fortunate one for Fermat; it exemplifies his candour and veracity, and it shows

--that he did not mistake inductive probability for rigorous demonstration : " Mais je vous

advoue tout net," are his words in the letter last referred to, " (car par advance je vous ad-

vertis que comme je ne suis pas capable de m'attribuer plus que je ne scay, je dis avec merne

franchise ce que je ne scay pas) que je n'ay peu encore demonstrer l'exclusion de tous divi-
seurs en cette belle proposition que je vous avois envoyee, et que vous m'avez confermee

touchant les nombres 3, 5, 17, 257, 6553, &c. Car bien que je reduise l'exclusion a la

pluspart des nombres, et que j'aye meme des raisons probables pour le reste, je n'ay peu

encore demonstrer necessairement la verite de cette proposition, de laquelle pourtant je ne
doute non plus a cette heure que je faisois auparavant. Si vous en avez la preuve assuree,

vous m'obligerez de me la communiquer : car aprcs cela rien ne m'arrestera en ces matieres."

   The " Last Theorem " is enunciated by Fermat as follows :
   " Cubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadrato-quadratum in duos quadrato-quadratos, et
generaliter nullam in infinitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos ejusdem nominis fas est
dividere; cujus rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non

caperet." (Fermat's Diophantus, p. 51.)

Fermat has also asserted that neither the sum (ibid. p. 258) nor the difference (ibid. p. 338)

of two biquadrates can be a square. Each of these propositions comprehends the theorem

that the sum of two biquadrates cannot be a biquadrate ; and of the second, we possess

a very remarkable demonstration by Fermat himself (ibid. p. 338 ; and compare Euler,

Elemens d'Algubre, vol. ii. sect. 13; Legendre, Theorie des Nombres, vol. ii. p. 1). The

essential part of this demonstration consists in showing that, from any supposed solution

-- =of the
      Diophantine         equation     4  4 a square, another solution maybe deduced in which
                                    <r

the values of the indeterminates are not equal to zero, and yet are absolutely less than in

the proposed solution, from which it immediately follows that the Diophantine equation

is impossible. This method has been successfully employed by Eider (joe. cit.) to demon-

strate several negative Diophantine propositions, and in particular the theorem that the sum

of two cubes cannot be a cube. The only arithmetical principles (not included in the first

elements of the science) which are employed by Euler and Fermat in their applications of

this  method,     relate  to     certain  simple  properties  of the  quadratic      forms  x"-\-y",  x 2 -\-2y2
                                                                                                                                             ,

employed in these researches are specially adapted to the particular exponents considered,

and do not seem likely to supply a general demonstration. The proof in Barlow's Theory of

Numbers, pp. 160-169, is erroneous, as it reposes (see p. 168) on an elementary proposition

may write the equation in the symmetrical formxK +yK +zK =0. The impos-

sibility of solving this equation has been demonstrated by M. Kummer, first,

for all values of A not included among the exceptional primes* ; and secondly,

for all exceptional primes which satisfy the three following conditions :

   (1.) That the first factor of H, though divisible by X, is not divisible by
X2 (see art. 50).

(2.) That a complex modulus can be assigned, for which a certain definite

complex unit is not congruous to a perfect Xth power.

--number [c< /u 1 ] which is divisible by Xf.

   Three numbers below 100, viz. 37, 59, 67, are, as we have seen, excep-

tional primes. But it has been ascertained by M. Kummer that the three

conditions just given are satisfied in the case of each of those numbers; so

that the impossibility of Fermat's equation has been demonstrated for all

values of the exponent up to 100. Indeed, it would probably be difficult to

find an exceptional prime not satisfying the three conditions, and conse-

quently excluded from M. Kummer's demonstration.

  We must confine ourselves here to an indication of the principles on which

the demonstration rests in the case of the non-exceptional primes J.

demonstrated (Crelle, vol. xvii. p. 203), is nevertheless of great interest for the number of

auxiliary propositions contained in it. Of the same character are the notes by MM. Lebesgue

&and Liouville, in Liouville's Journal, vol. v. pp. 184 360, and a few theorems given with-

out demonstration by Abel, (Euvres, vol. ii. p. 264.

In the year 1847, M. Lame presented to the Academy at Paris a memoir containing a

general demonstration of Fermat's Theorem, based on the properties of complex numbers

&(Comptes Rendus, vol. xxiv. p. 310; Liouville, vol. xii. pp. 137 172). It was, however,

observed by M. Liouville (Comptes Rendus, vol. xxiv. p. 315), that this demonstration is

defective, as it assumes, without proof, the proposition that a complex number can be repre-

--sented, and in one way only, as the product of powers of complex primes a proposition

which, as we have seen, is untrue, unless we admit ideal as well as actual complex primes.

The discussion on M. Lame's memoir attracted Cauchy's attention to Fermat's Theorem; and

the 24th and 25th volumes of the Comptes Rendus contain several communications from

him on the subject of complex numbers [or polynomes radicaux, as he has preferred to term

them]. In the earlier papers of this series, Cauchy attempts to prove a proposition which,

as we have already observed (see art. 41), is untrue for complex numbers considered gene-
rally, viz. that the norm of the remainder in the division of one complex number by another

can be rendered less than the norm of the divisor (see Comptes Rendus, vol. xxiv. pp. 517,

633 & 661). Elsewhere (ibid. p. 579) he assumes the proposition as a hypothesis, and

deduces from it conclusions which are erroneous (pp. 581, 582). But at p. 1029 he recognizes
and demonstrates its inaccuracy. The results at which he arrives iu his subsequent papers
on the same subject are, for the most part, comprehended in M. Kummer's general theory
(Comptes Rendus, vol. xxv. pp. 37, 46, 93, 132, 177). In one place, however (p. 181), he

enunciates, though without demonstrating, the following important result :

   (Compare M. Kummer's memoir in the Berlin Transactions for 1857, p. 64.)

 --The investigation of the Last Theorem of Fermat has been twice proposed as a prize-

question by the Academy of Paris first at some time previous to 1823 (see Legendre's
memoir already cited, in vol. vi. of the Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences, p. 2), and again
in 1850 (Comptes Rendus, vol. xxx. p. 263) : at neither time was the prize adjudged to any
of the memoirs received. On the last occasion, after several postponements of the date
originally fixed for the award, the prize was ultimately, in 1857 \ib. vol. xliv. p. 158), con-
ferred on M. Kummer, who had not been a competitor, for his researches on complex num-

bers.

any common divisor ; each of thein is therefore the product of a perfect \th

power by a unit; so that we may write, x+as y=a? e(a.)v\ e(a) denoting

a real unit. Since vK is an actual number, it follows (remembering that X is

not an exceptional prime) that v is also actual ; hence vK is congruous, mod X,

property of every non-exceptional prime (see art. 52). The equation (2)

therefore assumes the form

If, therefore, the proposed equation (1) be possible, it will follow, by suc-
cessive applications of this reduction, that the equation

                                    xx +yK =E(a)(l-afzK

is also possible. But this equation has been shown to be impossible; the

equation (1) is therefore p.Iso impossible.

 --62. Application to the Theory of Numerical Equations. In the Monats-

berichte for June 20, 1853 (see also the Monatsberichte for 1856, p. 203),

--M. Kronecker has enunciated ihe following theorem:

   " The roots of any Abelian equation, the coefficients of which are integral
numbers, are rational functions of roots of unity." The demonstration of
this theorem (Monatsberichte for 1853, p. 371-373) depends on a compa-
                ON THE THEORY OF NUMBERS,                                                            153

risen of a certain form, of which the resolvent function of any Abelian
equation is susceptible, with M. Kummer's expression for the resolvent func-

tion in the case of the equation of the division of the circle (see art. 60).
It thus involves considerations relating to ideal numbers.

   Two propositions of a more special character, and closely connected with
one another, have also been given by M. Kronecker (Crelle, vol. liii. p. 173).

Their demonstration is immediately deducible from the principles of Dirich-

let's theory of complex units :
    " If unity be the analytical modulus of every root of an equation, of which

the first coefficient is unity and all the coefficients are integral numbers, the

roots of the equation are roots of unity."

"If all the roots of an equation (having its first coefficient unity and all

its coefficients integral) be real and inferior in absolute magnitude to 2, so
that they can be represented by expressions of the form 2 cos a, 2 cos /3,
2 cos y, . . . . the arcs a, /3, y are commensurable with the complete circum-

ference."

   In the following proposition M. Kronecker has extended a theorem of
M. Kummer's (art. 42) relating to complex units composed with roots of

unity of which the index is a prime, to complex units composed with any

roots of unity (Crelle, vol. liii. p. 176) :

   " Every complex unit composed with the roots of the equation wn =],can
be rendered real by multiplication with a 4wth root of unity. If n be even,
a 2«th root will always suffice ; and if n be a power of a prime, an wth root

will suffice."

The demonstration of this proposition is also deducible from Dirichlet's

--principles.
   63. Tables of Complex Primes In M. Kummer's earliest memoir on

complex numbers (Liouville, vol. xii. p. 206) he has given a table of the

complex factors, composed of Xth roots of unity, which are contained in real

+primes of the form w\ l inferior to 1000, X representing one of the primes

5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. This memoir was written before M. Kummer had

considered the complex factors of primes of linear forms other than m\+l,

and before he had introduced the conception of ideal numbers. The com-

plex prime factors of real primes of those other linear forms are, therefore,

not exhibited in the Table; and the five numbers of the form 22m +1, 47,

139, 277, 461, 967, each of which contains 22 ideal factors composed of 23rd

roots of unity, are represented as products of 11 actual factors (each of

which contains two reciprocal ideal factors). The tentative methods by

which the complex factors were discovered are explained in sect. 9 of the

memoir cited. Since the full development of M. Kummer's theory, Dr.

Reuschle has undertaken to complete and extend the Table. He has already

given tables containing the complex prime factors of all real primes less than

J000, composed of 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 29th roots of unity,

together with the complete solution of the congruences corresponding to the

equations of the periods (see the Monatsberichte for 1859, pp. 488 and
694, and for 1860, pp. 150 and 714). For 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, the complex

primes are exhibited in a primary form ; for 19, 23, and 29 they are exhibited

   form  which             the                                                  mod  (1--      2

Reuschle represents by their lowest actual powers ; for 23 this power is the

cube, for 29 it is the square; for 1 1, 13, 17, 19, as well as for 5 and 7, all
complex prime factors of real primes less than 1000 are actual. It appears

from the Table (and it has indeed been proved by M. Kummer), that 29 is

an "irregular determinant" (see art. 49, note) ; for the number of classes is
--154 REPORT 1860.

8, while the square of every ideal number (occurring as a factor of a real
prime inferior to 1000) is actual. The methods employed by Dr. Reuschle

in the calculation of his tables have not yet been published by him. In

some instances, as M. Kummer has observed, they have not led him to the

simplest possible forms of the ideal primes.

  A particular investigation relating to the ideal factors of 47, composed of

23rd roots of unity, has been given by Mr. Cayley (Crelle, vol. lv. p. 192,

and lvi. p. 186).
   64. The investigations relating to Laws of Reciprocity, which have so long

occupied us in this report, have introduced us to considerations apparently

so remote from the theory of the residues of powers of integral numbers, that

it requires a certain effort to bear in mind their connexion with that theory.

It will be remembered that the complex numbers to which our attention has

been directed are not of that general kind to which we have referred in art. 41,
but are exclusively those which are composed of roots of unity. The theory

of complex numbers, in the widest sense of that term, does indeed present to

us an important generalization of the theory of the residues of powers; for

the theorem of Fermat (see art. 53) subsists alike for every species of com-

plex numbers. But the complex numbers of Gauss, of Jacobi, and of M.
Kummer force themselves upon our consideration, not because their proper-

ties are generalizations of the properties of ordinary integers, but because

certain of the properties of integral numbers can only be explained by a
reference to them. The law of quadratic reciprocity does not, as we have

seen, necessarily require for its demonstration any considerations other than

those relating to ordinary integers ; the real prime numbers of arithmetic are

here the ultimate elements that enter into the problem. But when we come

to binomial congruences of higher orders, we find that the true elements of

the question are no longer real primes, but certain complex factors, composed

of roots of unity, which are, or may be conceived to be, contained in real
primes. For we find that the law which expresses the mutual relation (with

respect to the particular kind of congruences considered) of two of these

complex factors is a primary and simple one ; while the corresponding rela-

tions between the real primes themselves are composite and derivative, and, in

consequence, complicated. It thus becomes indispensable, for the investiga-

tion of the properties of real numbers, to construct an arithmetic of complex

integers; and this is what has been accomplished by the researches, of which

an account has been given in the preceding articles.

The higher laws of reciprocity (like that of quadratic residues) may be

considered as furnishing a criterion for the resolubility or irresolubility of

binomial congruences ; and this, though not the only application of which they

are susceptible, is that which most naturally suggests itself. When the bi-

nomial congruence is cubic or biquadratic, it is easy to resolve the real prime

+ +modulus into factors of the {orma bp,or a bi (arts. 37 and 24-), and equally

easy to determine the value of the critical symbol of reciprocity by a uni-

form and elementary process (see art. 36). For these, therefore, as well as

for quadratic congruences, the criterion deducible from the laws of recipro-

city is all that can be desired. But for binomial congruences of higher

orders this criterion is not a satisfactory one, because of the difficulty of

obtaining the resolution of a real prime into its complex factors, and also

because of the impossibility of determining the value of the critical symbol

by the conversion of an ordinary fraction into a continued fraction.
   The only known criterion applicable to such congruences is the following,

-- =A,the demonstration of which is deducible from the elements of the theory of
the residues of powers :  Let    n  mod p, represent the proposed con-

 --We65. Solutio7i of Binomial Congruences.

--the actual solution of binomial congruences

knowledge is confined within very narrow limits.

When a table of indices for the prime p has been constructed, the resolu-

tion of every binomial congruence, if it be resoluble, or, if not, the demon-

stration of its irresolubility, is implicitly contained in it. But to use a table

of indices for the solution of a binomial congruence is, as we have already

observed in a similar case (art. 16), to solve a problem by means of a recorded

=A,solution of it. When the congruence xn        mod p, is resoluble, its solu-

tion may always be made to depend on that of a congruence of the form
--xd ^a, mod p, where d is the greatest common divisor of n and p 1, and
= p--where a                                     We1. may therefore suppose

determination of a single root of that congruence itself, and, secondly, the com-

plete resolution of the congruence x"^^l, mod p. With regard to the first of

Athese requisites, in the important case in which the exponent t to which

=appertains is prime to n, a value ofx satisfying the congruence xn A, mod p,

can be determined by a direct method (Disq. Arith. arts. 66, 67). For, in

Athis case, it will always happen that one value of a; is a certain power k of

=A, where k is determined by the congruence #» 1, mod t. Nor is it

Anecessary, in order to determine k, to know the exponent t to which

appertains; it is sufficient to have ascertained that it is prime to n; for, if

we resolve/*-- 1 into two factors prime to one another, and such that one of

them is divisible by n and contains no prime not contained in n, the other
will be divisible by t, and may be employed as modulus instead of t in the

congruence %n=l, mod t. When this method is inapplicable, we can only

Ainvestigate a root of the congruence .t"=A, mod p (where is different

from 1), by tentative processes, which, however, admit of certain abbreviations

(Disq. Arith. arts. 67, 68). The work of Poinsot (Reflexions sur la Theorie

des Nombres, cap. iv. p. 60) contains a very full and elegant exposition of

the theory of binomial congruences; but neither he nor anv other writer

subsequent to Gauss has been able to add any other direct method to that

which we have just mentioned.
--66. Solution of the Congruence xn =l, mod p. When a single root of the
=Acongruence xn
                 is known, we may, as we have seen, complete its resolu-

tion by obtaining all the roots of the congruence £"=1, mod p. The methods

of Gauss, Lagrange, and Abel for the solution of the binomial equation

a-"-- 1=0 are in a certain sense applicable to binomial congruences of this

special form. It is evident, from a comparison of several passages in the Dis-

of Gauss, and which gives the solution of any Abelian equation, is equally

applicable to any Abelian congruence; i. e. to any completely resoluble con-

mgruence of order m, the roots of which (considered with regard to the

prime modulus p) may be represented by the series of terms

And as we can always express the roots of an Abelian equation by radicals

(i.e. by the roots of equations of two terms), so also the solution of an Abelian
congruence depends ultimately on the solution of binomial congruences.
When, for any prime modulus, an Abelian equation admits of being con-
sidered as an Abelian congruence, so precise is the correspondence of the
equation and the congruence, that (as Poinsot has observed in a memoir

in which he has occupied himself with the comparative analysis of the equa-

tion    n          =l,   and  the  congruence  xn =l,  mod p*)  we    may  consider  the  ana-

      ai

lytical expression of the roots of the equation as also containing an expression

of the roots of the congruence ; and by giving a congruential interpretation f

to the radical signs which occur in that expression, we may elicit from it the

actual values of the roots of the congruence. An example taken from

Poinsot's memoir will render this intelligible j. The six roots of the equation

Thus the complete solution of a congruence of the sixth order is obtained by

means of binomial congruences of the second and third orders only.

An essential limitation to the usefulness of this method arises from the cir-

cumstance that it does not always (or even in general) happen that (as in

the example just given) each surd entering into the expression of the root

becomes separately rational. For that expression may itself acquire a rational

value, while certain surds contained in it continue irrational, precisely as, in

the irreducible case of cubic equations, a real quantity is represented by an

imaginary formula. To illustrate this point by an example, let us consider

where every radical becomes rational of itself. Similarly taking the values

V^7= --putting  14, p=l, we find

mthe complete solution of an Abelian congruence of order requires only

-- -- 1^0,two things, 1st, the complete solution of the congruence xm

mod p, and, 2ndly, the determination of a single root of a certain con-

--gruence of the form xm #=0, mod p, in which a is an ordinary integer;

so that in this case (which is that of the congruence                             =0, mod 43)

we obtain a real, and not only an apparent reduction of the proposed con-

gruence*.

It should also be observed that the primitive roots of the equation

%n J       furnish, when rationalized, the primitive roots of the congruence

-- =x

--%n J =0, mod p. This, the only direct method that has ever been suggested

x

for the determination of a primitive root, appears to be the same as that

referred to by Gauss in the Disq. Arith. (art. 73).
   Poinsot expresses the conviction that this method of rationalization is

applicable to any congruence corresponding to an equation, the roots of

wfaich can be expressed by radicalsf. With regard to equations of the

second, third, and fourth orders this is certainly true. If, for example, the

biquadratic equation F (.t)=0 be completely resoluble when considered as
= -- -- --a                     4

congruence      for       the   modulus p,  so     that   F      (#)  (x «j) (x              2 ) (x       3)

--(or a,), mod p, it is plain that the four roots of F(a')=0, and the four

numbers  o,,    a2,  «3,  a     may  be  obtained  by    substituting,   in  the  general    formula
                             4

which expresses the root of any biquadratic equation as an irrational function

of its coefficients, the values of the coefficients of the functions F(#) and

-- -- --(x--a^)(x 2)(# 3 ) (x 4) respectively. But these two sets of coeffi-

cients  differ  only      by    multiples  of p;   i. e.  the    values  of  ax,  a2,  a3 ,  a       can  be
                                                                                                  t

deduced from the expressions of the roots of F(;r)=0 by adding multiples

pof to the numbers which enter into those expression <. But this reasoning

ceases to be applicable to equations of an order higher than the fourth,

because no general formula exists representing the roots of an equation of

the fifth or any higher order. If, therefore, F(.r)=0 be an equation of the
nth order, the roots of which can be expressed by a radical formula, and

which is also completely resoluble when considered as a congruence for the
-- --modulus p, so that F(a,')=(.r
                                           a )(x       «,,)... (x     an ), mod jo, it will not
                                                t

necessarily follow that the formula which gives the roots of F(#)=0 is also

capable (when we add multiples of p to the numbers contained in it) of
-- -- -- =giving the roots of (x
                                   a )(x   (xa.,) . . .   a,,)        0, i. e. the roots of the con-
                                        1

gruence F(#)=0, mod p; and thus the principle enunciated by M. Poinsot

is, it would seem, not rigorously demonstrated.

67. Cubic and Biquadratic Congruences The reduction of cubic con-

gruences to binomial ones has been treated of by Cauchy (Exercices des

Mathematiques, vol. iv. p. 279), and more completely by M. Oltramare
(Crelle, vol. xlv. p. 314). Some cases of biquadratic congruences are also
considered by Cauchy in the memoir cited, p. 286. The following criteria

for the resolubility or irresolubility of cubic congruences include the results

obtained by M. Oltramare, /. c, and appear sufficiently simple to deserve

is important, because, when the modulus is a very great number, we may not

be able to tell whether it is prime or composite, and, if composite, what the

primes are of which it is composed, although, when the prime divisors of a

composite modulus are known, it is simplest first to solve the congruence for

each of them separately, and afterwards (by a method to which we shall

hereafter refer) to deduce from these solutions the solution for the given

composite modulus. To apply the first of Gauss's methods, the congruence
= D +is
written  in  the  form     2   Py, P denoting the modulus. If in the formula
                        ?-

V=D + Py we substitute for y in succession all integral values which satisfy

-- < P--the inequality ,, y<i  Vtj> and select those values of which are per-

fect squares, their roots (taken positively and negatively) will give us all the

Wesolutions of the congruence.       should thus have I|P or 1 P-f-I \ trials to

make, I denoting the greatest integer contained in the fraction before which it

is placed. If, however, we take any number E, greater than 2, and prime to

P (it is simplest to take for E a prime, or power of a prime), of which the

quadratic non-residues are a, b, c,..., and then determine the values of a, /3, y,
a=D +... in the congruences
                               «P, mod E, 6=D-f/3P, mod E, &c, -we shall

mE +find that every value of y contained in one of the linear forms  a,

Vw*E+/3, &c, gives rise to a value of which is a quadratic non-residue of

E, and which cannot, therefore, be a perfect square ; so that we may at once

Aexclude these values of y from the series of numbers to be tried.  second

excludent E' may then be taken, and by its aid another set of linear forms

may be determined, such that no value of y contained in them can satisfy

the congruence. Thus the number of trials may be diminished as far as

we please. The application of this method is still further facilitated by the

circumstance that it is not necessary actually to solve the congruences

fl=D+aP, mod E, . . . but only the single congruence D + Py=0, mod E

(Disq. Arith. art. 322). Gauss's second method depends on the theory of

quadratic forms; it supposes that the congruence is written in the form

^-(-DssO, mod P. By a tentative process (abbreviated, as in the first

method, by the use of excludents) Gauss obtains all possible prime representa-

--tions of P by the quadratic forms of determinant D; whence the com-

plete solution of the congruence r2 -fD=0, mod P, is immediately deduced.

This method involves the construction of a complete system of quadratic

-- Dforms of determinant D, or, if the prime factors of be known, of one

genus of forms of that system ; it becomes therefore more difficult of appli-

Dcation as increases, whereas the first method is not affected by the increase

of D. The second method, however, especially recommends itself when P is

a very great number ; in fact, if we do not employ any excludent, the number

of trials required by the first method varies (approximately, and when P is

a great number) as P, whereas, on the same j>upposition, the number of trials

VDxrequired by the second method varies as          vP.

M. Desmarest (in his Theorie des Nombres) has proposed a method less

scientific in its character than those of Gauss, but sometimes easily applicable

in the Disquisitiones Arithmeticse, that Gauss intended to give a general

theory of congruences of every order in the 8th section of his work, and

that, at the time of its publication, he was already in possession of the prin-

cipal theorems relating to the subject*. These theorems were, however,

first given by Evariste Galoist, in a note published in the Bulletin de Ferus-

sac for June, 1830 (vol. xiii. p. 438), and reprinted in Liouville's Journal,

vol. xi. p. 398. An account of Galois's method (completed and extended in

some respects) will be found in M. Serret's Cours d'Algebre Superieure,

lecon 25. The theory has also been independently investigated by iVL Schoe-
nemann, who seems to have been unacquainted with the earlier researches of

Galois (see Crelle's Journal, vol. xxxi. p. 269, and vol. xxxii. p. 93). In

several of Cauchy's arithmetical memoirs (see in particular Exercices de

Mathematiques, vol. i. p. 160, vol. iv. p. 217; Comptes Rendus, vol. xxiv.

p. 1117; Exercices d'Analyse et de Physique Mathematique, vol. iv. p. 87)

we find observations and theorems relating to it. Lastly, in a memoir in

Crelle's Journal (vol. liv. p. 1) M. Dedekind has given (with important

accessions) an excellent and lucid resume of the results obtained by his pre-

decessors.

In the following account of the principles of this theory, the functional

symbols F, cp, \p, . . . will represent (as in general throughout this Report)

rational and integral functions having integral coefficients; we shall use j9

to denote a prime modulus, and x an absolutely indeterminate quantity. As
we shall have to consider the functions F(x),f(x), ^(x), etc., only in relation

to the modulus/*, we shall consider two functions F, (x) and F (x), which

the coefficients of which are multiples of p, we shall always suppose that

the coefficient of the highest power of a; in the function is prime top.

be divisors of F(x) for the modulus p, or, more briefly, modular divisors of

F(#), or even simply divisors of F(x) when no ambiguity can arise from this

elliptical mode of expression. If a be a function of order zero, i. e. an integral

number prime to p, a is a divisor, for the modulus/?, of every other modular

p--function ; so that we may consider the  1 terms a av a.2 , 3 , . . . Op_i, of a

system of residues prime to p, as the units of this theory, and, in any set of

p-- 1 associated functions

we may distinguish that one as primary in which the highest coefficient is

congruous to unity (mod p).

   If F(x) be a function which is divisible (mod p) by no other function
(except the units and its own associates), F(x) is said to be a prime or irre-

ducible function for the modulus p. And it is a fundamental proposition in

this theory, that every modular function can be expressed in one way, and

one way only, as the product of a unit by the powers of primary irreducible

modular functions. The demonstration of this theorem depends (precisely

as in the case of ordinary integral numbers) on Euclid's process for finding

the greatest common divisor, which, it is easy to show, is applicable to the

modular functions we are considering here. For, if fa (x) and fa (x) be two

such functions [the degree of fa(x) being not higher than that of fa(x)],

we can always form the series of congruences

fa(x)=q1 (x) i^^ + r^^x), modp,

+fa(x)=q2 (x)fa(x)                r     fa(x),  modp,

in which rv r2, . . . denote integral numbers, q x (x), q2 (x), . . . modular func-
tions, and fa(x), fa^(x), .... primary modular functions, the orders of which

are successively lower and lower, until we arrive at a congruence

in which r£=0, mod p. The function <j>k+\ (x) is then the greatest common

divisor (mod p) of the given functions fa(x) and fa(x); and, in particular,

sufficient condition that these functions should have a common modular

position. From the nature of the process by which the greatest common

divisor is determined, we may infer the fundamental proposition enunciated

above, by precisely the same reasoning which establishes the corresponding

the following useful problem : " Given two relatively prime modular func-

    It implies, in the first place, the existence of a theory of residues of powers

of modular functions, with respect to a compound modulus, precisely similar

to the theory of the residues of the powers of integral numbers with regard

to a common prime modulus. A single example (taken from M. Dedekind's

memoir) will suffice to show the exact correspondence of the two theories.
The modular function 6 is or is not a quadratic residue of f(x), for the
modulus p, according as it is or is not possible to satisfy the quadratic con-

But the equation (A) admits also of an immediate application to the theory

of ordinary congruences with a simple prime modulus.

In that equation let us assign to 6 the particular value x ; Ave conclude that

               --1"-          1, is divisible for the modulus p by/(#), *.«· by every

irreducible modular function of order m. Further, if d be a divisor of m,

-- --xPm - 1 1 is algebraically divisible by xPd~ l 1 ; whence it appears that
--xpm-\ J js divisible, for the modulus p, by every function of which the
--order is a divisor of m. But it is easily shown that xPm ~ l 1 is not divisible

(mod p) by any other modular function, and that it cannot contain any
multiple modular factors. Hence we have the indeterminate congruence

in which f(je) denotes any primary and irreducible function, the order of
which is a divisor of m, and the sign of multiplication II extends to every

value of f{x). This theorem, again, is a generalization of Lagrange's inde-
We mterminate congruence (art. 10).
                                                     may infer from it that, when is >1,

the number of primary functions of order m, which are irreducible for the

modulus^, is

always different from zero, it follows that there exist functions of any given

A =order, which are irreducible for the modulus p.
       congruence F(.r) 0, mod p, may be considered resolved when we
have expressed its left-hand member as a product of irreducible modular

factors. The linear factors (if any) then give the real solutions ; the factors

Weof higher orders may be supposed to represent imaginary solutions.                           have

already observed that even when all the modular factors of F(.r) are linear,

we possess no general and direct method by which they can be assigned ; it

is hardly necessary to add that the problem of the direct determination of

modular factors of higher orders than the first, presents even greater diffi-

culties. Nevertheless the congruence (B) enables us to advance one step

toward the decomposition of F(.r) into its irreducible factors; for, by means

of it, we can separate those divisors of F(.r) which are of the same order,

Wenot, indeed, from one another, but from all its other divisors.                      may first

of all suppose that F(.r) is cleared of its multiple factors, which may be

done, as in algebra, by investigating the greatest common divisor of F(.r)

and F'(.r) for the modulus p. The greatest common divisor (mod p) of

--F(#) and ccP~ l 1 will then give us the product of all the linear modular

factors of F(^); let F(.r) be divided (mod p) by that product, and let the

-- We71. Imaginary Solutions of a Congruence.
                                                                                                                        have said that the non-

linear modular factors of F(.r)=0, mod p, may be considered to represent

imaginary solutions. These imaginary solutions can be actually exhibited,

if we allow ourselves to assign to x certain complex values. The following

proposition, which shows in what manner this may be effected, is due to

Galois :

"If f(x) represent an irreducible modular function of order m, the con-

gruence

                                       F(fl)=0, mod !>/<»].

is completely resoluble when F(x) is an irreducible modular function of

order in, or of any order the index of which is a divisor of in."

m mmodular function having
                                       or a divisor of                                                             for the index of its order.

But the congruence 0Pm- 1 ==l, mod [jo, /(#)], admits of as many roots as

--it has dimensions; therefore also every divisor of flp'"- 1 ], and, in particular,

the function F(0) considered as a congruence for the same compound modu-

lus, admits of as many roots as it has dimensions.

Let the order of the congruence F(0)=O, mod [jo, /(#)], be S, and let

any one of its roots be represented by r ; it may be shown that all its roots

are  represented  by              the  terms               of the series                                      r,   rP,       2      rPs ~ l .  For, if

                                                       ',                                                  ,

that r is a root, mod \_p, /(#)], of some irreducible modular divisor of the

--function Qpk-i 1, i. e. of some irreducible function of an order lower than d,

because k is less than 2; r is therefore a root, mod [£>,/(#)], of two different

irreducible modular functions, which is impossible.

   If, therefore, we suppose x to represent, not an indeterminate quantity,
but a root of the equation f(x)=0, we may enunciate Galois' theorem as

follows :

   " Every irreducible congruence of order in is completely resoluble in com-
plex numbers composed with roots of any equation which is irreducible for

mthe modulus jo, and which has or a multiple of in for the index of its order.

   "Anil all its roots may be expressed as the powers of any one of them."

  --74. Primitive Boots of the Powers of a Prime. All the elementary pro-

perties of the residues of powers, considered with regard to a modulus which

is a power of a prime number, may be deduced from the theorem just proved.

In particular, the demonstration of the existence and number of primitive

--roots (art. 12) is applicable here also; so that we have the theorem:

   "There are pm-* (/j-- 1) \p (j} ~^) residues prime to p m , the successive
powers of any one of which represent all residues prime pto m." These
residues are of course the primitive roots of pm .

If y be a primitive root of p, of the p numbers included in the formula

A double system of indices may thus be used to replace the simple system

supplied by a primitive root when sucli roots exist.

   76. Composite Modules. No general theory has been given of the repre-

sentation of rational and integral functions of an indeterminate quantity as

products of modular functions with regard to a composite modulus divisible

by more than one prime. And it is possible that no advantage would be

gained by considering the theory of congruences with composite modules

Afrom this general point of view.                              few isolated theorems relating to par-

ticular cases have, however, been given by Cauchy (Comptes Rendus,

=vol. xxv. p. 26, 1847). Of these the following may serve as a specimen :
   "If the congruence F (,r) 0, mod M, admit as many roots as it has

dimensions, and if, besides, the differences of these roots Le all relatively

prime to M, we have the indeterminate congruence

         F   (*)=*                 (r-rj          (.v-r2 )     (.r-r                 )  ...   (x-r n ),  mod  M,
                                                                                  3

k denoting the coefficient of the highest power of x in F (.r)."

   But if, instead of considering the modular decomposition of the function
F(.r), we confine ourselves to the determination of the real solutions of the

 --77. Binomial Congruences with Composite Modules. The investigation of

the real solutions of binomial congruences depends (in the manner just stated)

on the investigation of the real solutions of similar congruences the modules

of which are the powers of primes. With regard to the relations by which

these real solutions are connected with one another, little of importance has

been added to the few observations on this subject in the Disquisitiones

    Art. 16. Legendre's investigation of the law of reciprocity (as presented in

the ' Theorie des Nombres,' vol. i. p. 230, or in the ' Essai,' ed. 2, p. 198) is
invalid only because it assumes, without a satisfactory proof, that if a be

+ +a given prime of the form 4ra l, a prime b of the form 4w 3 can always

--be assigned, satisfying the equation j - )= 1 . M. Kummer (in the Memoirs

of the Academy of Berlin for 1859, pp. 19, 20) says that this postulate is

easily deducible from the theorem demonstrated by Dirichlet, that every

arithmetical progression, the terms of which have no common divisor, con-

tains prime numbers. It would follow from this, that the demonstration of

Legendre (which depends on a very elegant criterion for the resolubility or

on the principal investigations relating to laws of reciprocity.

Art. 20. Dirichlet's demonstration of the formulae (A) and (A') first

appeared in Crelle's Journal, vol. xvii. p. 57. Some observations in this

paper on a supposed proof of the same formulae by M. Libri (Crelle, vol. ix.

p. 187) were inserted by M. Liouville in his Journal, vol. iii. p. 3, and gave
MM.rise to a controversy (in the Comptes Rendus, vol. x.) between
                                                                                          Liouville

and Libri. The concluding paragraphs of Dirichlet's paper contain the appli-

cation of the formula? (A) and (A') to the law of reciprocity (Gauss's fourth

demonstration).

Art. 22. From a general theorem of M. Kummer's (see arts. 43, 44 of this

= --Report), it appears that the congruence r2 ( 1) 2 X, mod q, is or is not

                                      A--

the theorem of quadratic reciprocity. This very simple demonstration (which
is, however, only a transformation of Gauss's sixth) appears first to have

occurred to M. Liouville (see a note by M. Lebesgue in the Comptes Rendus,

vol. li. pp. 12, 13).

his memoir in Crelle's Journal, vol. xxiv. (see p. 301), yet, in the memoir

  pArt. 36. In the algorithm given in the text, the remainders^, 3 ... are all

independent of the formula (iii) of art. 28. The algorithm given by Eisen-
stein is, however, preferable, although the rule to which it leads cannot be
expressed with the same conciseness, because the continued fraction equi-

valent to -£-£ terminates more rapidly when the remainders are the least

possible, and not necessarily uneven.

On the Performance of Steam- Vessels, the Functions of the Screiv, and
   the Relations of its Diameter and Pitch to the Form of the Vessel.
   By Vice-Admiral Moorsom.

                     (A communication ordered to be printed among the Reports.)

In this the fourth paper which I now lay before the British Association, it
may be desirable to recapitulate the points I have brought into issue, and for
the determination of which, data, only to be obtained by experiments, are

still wanting, viz.

   1. There is no agreed method by which the resistance of a ship may be

calculated under given conditions of wind and sea.

   2. The known methods are empirical, approximate only, and imply smooth

water and no wind.

   3. The relations in which power and speed stand to form and to size are
comparatively unknown.

   4. The relations in which the direct and resultant thrust stand to each
other in any given screw, and how affected by the resislance of the ship, are

undetermined.
    In order to resolve these questions, specific experiments are needed, and

none have yet been attempted in such manner as to lead to any satisfactory

result.

    The Steam Ship Performance Committee of the British Association have
pressed upon successive First Lords of the Admiralty, the great value to the
public service which must ensue if the following measures were taken, viz.

    1. To determine, by specific experiment, the resistance, under given con-

ditions, of certain vessels, as types; and, at the same time, to measure the

thrust of the screw.

    2. To record the trials of the Queen's ships, so that the performance in
smooth water may be compared with the performance at sea, both being re-

 corded in a tabular form, comprising particulars, to indicate the characteris-
tics of the vessel, of the engine, of the screw, and of the boiler.

    Hitherto nothing has come of these representations.
    In the paper read last year at Aberdeen, I showed, in the case of Lord
Dufferin's yacht 'Erminia,' how the absence of admitted laws of resistance

 interfered with the adjustment of her screw, and how, therefore, as a matter
 of precaution, a screw was provided capable of a thrust beyond what the

 vessel required.

    1 also showed, in the case of the Duke of Sutherland's yacht ' Undine,' how

 her screw, from being too near the surface of the water, lost a large portion
 of the thrust due to its size and proportions. In other words, a screw capa-
 ble of giving out a resultant thrust in sea water of 5022 lbs., at a speed of

vessel of 926 knots an hour, did actually give out only 3805 lbs. That is to

say, the effect produced was the same as if that screw had worked in a
fluid whose weight was about 48 lbs. per cubic foot instead of 64 lbs.

I am now about to exhibit some other examples from among Her Majesty's

ships of war.

The questions now before us are

1. The resistance of the hull below the water-line in passing through the

water, and of the upper works, masts, rigging, &c, passing through the air,

the weather being calm, and the water smooth.

2. The relation in which the thrust of the screw stands to this resistance.

[The Admiral here gave certain results from the ' Marlborough,' the ' Re-

nown,' and the ' Diadem,' and proposed that a specific issue should be tried

by means of the ' Diadem.']

What would I not give, he observed, for some well-conducted experiments

to determine this beautiful problem of the laws which govern the action of

the screw in sea-water 1 It is a problem not only interesting to science, but

fraught with valuable results in the economical and efficient application of

the screw propeller.

After commenting on the performances of the U. S. corvette ' Niagara,' the

Admiral observed, I have no means of forming a very definite opinion as to

how she will stay under low sail in a sea-way, how she will wear, how scud
in a following sea, or how stand up under her sails, or whether her statical
stability be too much or too little, or how the fore and after bodies are

balanced. These are points to be determined, not by the mere opinion of

--seamen for a sailor will vaunt the qualities of his ship even as a lover the
--charms of his mistress but by careful records of performances in smooth

water and at sea, and a comparison of such performances with calculated

--results from drawings beforehand. Let a return of such things be annually

laid before the House of Commons we shall then know whether we are get-

ting money's worth for our money ; and also we should receive all the benefits

Weof public criticism towards improvement.     should not then allow defects

to be stereotyped, till chronic blemishes are turned into beauties, or, if not

so, then defended as things that cannot be remedied.

I have now completed the task which four years ago I imposed on myself.

Beginning with simple elementary principles, and ending with minute prac-

tical details, 1 have, as I conceive, shown the process by which the improve-

ment of steam-ships must be carried on.

More than one hundred years ago scientific men, able mathematicians,

Ashowed the physical laws on which naval architecture must rest.  succes-

sion of able men have shown how those laws affect various forms of floating

bodies. Experiments have been made with models to determine the value

of the resistance practically. With the exception of some experiments of

Mr. Scott Russell, I am not aware that any have been made with vessels ap-

proaching the size of ships to determine the relations of resistance to power,

whether wind or steam.

    Ships have been improved, and modifications of form have been arrived at

by a long painstaking tentative process. The rules so reached for sailing ships
have been superseded by steam, and we are still following the same tedious

process, in order to establish new rules for the application of steam power.
   I think the history of naval architecture shows that it is not an abstract

science, and that its progress must depend on the close observation and cor-
rect record of facts ; on the careful collating, and scientific comparing of such
facts, with a view to the induction of general laws. Now, is there anywhere
such observing, recording, collating, and comparing? and still more, is there
such inducting process ?
174 REPORT 1860.

    I can find no such thing anywhere in such shape that the public can judge

it by its fruits.

   We are now in full career of a competition of expenditure, and England

has no reason to flinch from such an encounter, unless her people should tire

of paying a premium of insurance upon a contingent event that never may

happen ; and if it should happen without our being insured, might not cost

as much as the aggregate premiums. Tire they will, sooner or later, but
they are more likely to continue to pay in faith and hope, if they had some
confidence that their money is not being spent unnecessarily.

    There is now building at Blackwall the ' Warrior,' a ship to be cased with
4^-inch plates of iron, whose length at water-line is 380 feet, breadth 58 feet,
intended draught of water (mean) C15\ feet, area of section 1 190 square feet,
and displacement about 8992 tons, and she is to have engines of 1250 nomi-

nal horse-power.
    Is there any experience respecting the qualities and performance of such

a ship ? Anything to guide us in reasoning from the known to the unknown ?

Do the performances of the 'Diadem,' 'Mersey,' and 'Orlando,' inspire

confidence? Where are the preliminary experiments?

    Before any contract was entered into for the construction of the Britannia
Bridge, a course of experiments was ordered by the Directors, which cost not
far short of £7000, and it was well expended. It saved money, and perhaps

prevented failure. This ship must cost not less than £400,000, and may cost
a good deal more when ready for sea. But there is another of similar, and two
others building, of smaller size. What security is there for their success?

   The conditions which such a ship as the ' Warrior' must fulfil in order to
justify her cost are deserving of some examination. The formidable nature

of her armament, as well as her supposed impregnability to shot, will natu-
rally lead other vessels to avoid an encounter. She must therefore be of

greater speed than other ships of war. To secure this, it is essential that

her draught of water should be the smallest that is compatible both with
stability and steadiness of motion, and that she should not be deeper than the

designer intended. To ensure steadiness it is necessary, among other things,

that in rolling, the solids, emerged and immersed, should find their axis in

the longitudinal axis of the ship. To admit of accurate aim with the guns,
her movement in rolling should be slow and not deep. Every seaman knows
how few ships unite these requisites.

    It is not quite safe to speculate on the ' Warrior's ' speed ; nevertheless I
will venture on an estimate, such as I have stated in the case of the ' Great

Eastern,' whose smooth-water speed I will now assume to be 15f knots, as
before estimated, with 7732 horse-power, when her draught of water is 23

feet, her area of section, say 1650 square feet, and her displacement about
18,588 tons. The speed of the ' Warrior' in smooth water ought not to be

less than 16 knots, in order that she may force to action unwilling enemies
whose speed may be 13 to 14 knots.

    The question I propose is the power to secure a smooth-water speed of

16 knots.
    Reducing the ' Great Eastern ' to the size of the ' Warrior,' and applying

the corrections for the difference of speed of £ knot, and for their respective
coefficients of specific resistance "0564 and -07277, the horse-power for 16

knots is 7543.
    Raising the ' Niagara ' to the size of the · Warrior,' and applying the cor-

rections for the difference of speed between 10*9 and 16 knots, and for their
respective coefficients of specific resistance "0797 and '07277, the horse-power
to give the 'Warrior' a smooth- water speed of 16 knots is 7867, being an
excess over the estimate from the ' Great Eastern ' of 324 horse-power.

If the power required for the * Warrior ' be calculated by adaptation from

the  '  Mersey                                   and  the  «  Diadem,'  it  would  be  8380  horse-power                                                                                                                          and  8287     re-
                                              '
--spectively; from which this inference flows: that unless the mistakes made

in the fore and after sections of the 'Mersey' and 'Diadem' are rectified in the

' Warrior,' she will require above 8000 horse-power for a speed of 16 knots,
notwithstanding her greater size and increased ratio of length to breadth.

   Before investing more than a million and a half of money in an experiment,
commercial men would have probably employed a few thousand pounds in
some sort of test as to the conditions of success. Perhaps such test may have

been resorted to and kept secret for reasons of public policy. Perhaps it is

intended that the ' Warrior's' speed should not be greater than that which is
due to five times her nominal horse-power, which could not exceed 15| knots

with 6250 horse-power, under the most favourable conditions, and may be
much less.

   The British Association, by becoming the medium of collecting facts and
presenting them to the public, has done good service; but that service ought

not to rest there. Collectively, the Association may be able to do little more.

It can only act by affording public opinion a means of expression. But indi-

vidual members may do much. Towards such opinion I am doing my part.

I ask, in the cause of science, what is the system under which the Queen's

ships   are designed and                                      their steam power apportioned                                                                                                                                  the  organization  by
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

which their construction and fitting for sea are carried on ; the supervision

exercised over their proceedings at sea, in the examination of returns of per-

formance and of expenditure?

   During part of 1858 and 1859, two committees appointed by the Admi-

ralty collected evidence and made reports on the Dock Yards and on steam

machinery. I have read both reports with some attention. They are not

conclusive, but they are entitled to respect. I have also read the replies and
objections of the Government officers. There is a clear issue between them
on some of the most essential principles of effective economical management,
and on the application of science.

  A Royal Commission has been appointed to inquire into the system of

control and management in the Dock Yards. This is so far good, but it

does not go far enough. It does not comprise the steam machinery reported
on by Admiral Ramsay's Committee, and it cannot enter upon the questions
I have just enumerated. Yet the efficiency of the fleet depends quite as

much upon the adaptation of the machinery to the ship, and of the ship to
the use she is to be put to, as it does upon the manner in which she is built.
The Commission ought to be enlarged both in objects and in number of
members. It consists of five members only.

Report on the Effects of long-continued Heat, illustrative of Geological

 Phenomena. By the Rev. W. Vernon Harcourt, F.R.S., F.G.S.

The chief occupation of those who during the present century have

employed themselves in investigating the history of the earth, has been to
develope the succession of its strata. In following this pursuit, they have
found their best guide in the study of its organic antiquities, and have not
been led, for the most part, to very precise views of the physical and chemi-
cal changes which it has undergone.

   Yet there are questions in Geology to which no answer can be given with-
out an accurate examination into these. In regard, for example, to the
176 REPORT-- 1860.

chronology of the earth, the observation of organic remains alone can never

supply reliable data for reasoning. If we should attempt to draw inferences

from biological analogies, and measure the duration of beds by the growth of

imbedded skeletons, we should be stopped by the probability that the first

species of every series were successively created in a stale of full-grown

maturity*, and by the intrinsic weakness of all comparisons instituted non

pari materia.

Neither can any precarious mechanical analogies render the inquiry more

Wedefinite, or give a logical value to our conclusions.  are not entitled

to presume that the forces which have operated on the earth's crust have

always been the same. Were we to compare the beds of modern seas and

lakes with the ancient strata, and assume proportionable periods for their

accumulation, we must assume also that chemical and mechanical forces

were never in a state of higher intensity, that water was never more rapidly

evaporated, that greater torrents, fluid or gaseous, never flushed the lakes and

seas, and that more frequent elevations and depressions never gave scope for
quicker successions of animal life. To gain any real insight into these ob-

scure pages of ancient history, we must have recourse to a strict induction

of physical and chemical facts, and thence learn the probable course, and

causes, of the wonderful series of changes which geology unfolds.

   I am not aware that any full and connected statement has been published

of the facts which have been contributed by physical observations, and

chemical experiment, towards elucidating the conditions of those changes,

and propose therefore to preface the account which I have to give of experi-

ments designed to throw light upon them, with a sketch of the progress of

science in that department.

Forty years have elapsed since the author of the ' Mecanique Celeste

drew attention to the fact that multiplied observations in deep mines, wells,

and springs, had proved the existence of a temperature in the interior of the

earth increasing with the depth. He remarked that, by comparing exact

observations of the increase with the theory of heat, the epoch might be

determined at which the gradually cooling globe had been first transported

into space ; he stated the mean increase, collected from actual data, to be a

centesimal degree for every 32 f metres, and added that this is an element
of high importance to geology. " Not only," he said, "does it indicate a very

great heat at the earth's surface in remote times, but if we compare it with
the theory of heat, we see that at the present moment the temperature of

the earth is excessive at the depth of a million of metres, and above all at

the centre ; so that all that part of the globe is probably in a state of fusion,

and would be reduced into vapour, but for the superincumbent beds, the

   * To suppose otherwise with regard to animals which take care of their young would be
absurd ; and hence it is probable also that this is the general system of creation. The most
remarkable fact which modern geology has disclosed is the continual succession of newly-
created species. It has been attempted to account for thes3 according to known laws ofpro-
geniture, by supposing numerous non-apparent links of transitional existence to fill up the
gaps in the chain of derivation by which one species is presumed to have descended from
another. But this is only twistiug a rope of sand ; conjectural interpolations cannot give
coherence to a set of chains which are destitute of all evidence of continuity one with
another, and between which, as far as our experience goes, Nature has interposed a prin-

ciple of disconnexion.

   In using the word creation, we acknowledge an agent, and own our ignorance of the
agency, with regard to which, in this case, we only know that it is systematic ; for we see

successive species accommodated to successive conditions of existence.
   t M. Babinet (Tremblements de Terre, 1856), taking M. Walferdin's measurement from

artesian borings, which gave 31 metres for 1° C. as the most exact, remarks, that the tem-
perature at the depth of 3 kilometres must be above the heat of boiling water, and at that
of 60 kilometres, about 2000° C, sufficing for the fusion of lava, basalt, trachyte, and

porphyry.
       ON THE EFFECT'S OF LONG-CONTINUED HEAtf.     177

pressure of which, at those great depths, is immense." " These considera-
tions," he further added, "will explain a great number of geological phe-
nomena ; " and he instanced those of hot springs, which he accounted for on
the supposition that rain-water in channels communicating from super-

ficial reservoirs with the interior of the earth, thence rises again, heated,

to the surface.

Fourier, at the same time, expounded the methods by which, after extended

observation of the internal temperature, and further experiments on the

conduction of heat, he conceived that mathematic analysis might determine

the epoch at which the process of cooling began, concluding in the mean-

--while from facts already known, 1st, that no sensible diminution of tem-

perature has taken place during the period of historical chronology ; 2ndly,
that at a former era the temperature underwent great and rapid changes.

Thus was a train of graduated causes, physical and chemical, introduced

into Geology on the foundation of inductive reasoning, which is capable of

resolving some of the chief difficulties of the science in our comparison of

the present with the past.

When, for instance, we read in the organic contents of the strata the

history of a period when the climate was apparently uniform in all parts of

the earth, and learn from the imbedded plants that the temperature of Arctio

lands was once equal to that of warm latitudes at the present day, to account

for these circumstances, we need no longer bewilder ourselves with hypo-

theses ; we have a vera causa in the knowledge that the earth has passed
through a state in which its temperature was due, not so much to a sun then

veiled in clouds, as to a heat penetrating equally in all directions from the

centre to the circumference of the globe.

   When, again, we contemplate a mountain range, and view the abrupt pre-

cipices of some alpine chain, with its enormous masses of rock uplifted to

the clouds, and descending as many miles into the bosom of the sea, and
when we compare such abnormal labours of nature with the petty risings

of the earth's surface in the existing state of things, we have a vera causa

for that disparity, in the knowledge that there was a time when the eruptive

forces of the seething mass within were greater, and when a weaker crust

underwent vaster disturbances.

   Or if we examine the general structure of the strata, and see the same stra-

tum contemporaneously solidified over large portions of the earth's circum-

ference, and then observe the absence of consolidation in the actual opera-

tions of nature, whether under the pressure of deep seas, or elsewhere,

except in a few foci of igneous action, we have here also a vera causa

of the difference, in the ancient prevalence of that high temperature which

the laboratory of nature and art shows to be the most capable of lapidifying

stony materials.

   Descending into the details of mineralogy, we find the same departure

from the present order of nature in the constitution of minerals; and in the

sequence of chemical effects of heat increasing with the age of the stratum,

we see a real cause for the distinction.

Thus, for example, to begin with the upper beds, the chemist knows that

solutions of carbonate of lime, at the ordinary temperature, deposit crystals

with the common form of calcareous spar, but near the boiling-point of

water with that of Arragonite. Now in the mineralogical collection of the

Yorkshire Philosophical Society is a specimen of this mineral investing

calcite, from the chalk cliffs of Beachy Head ; and if any one will examine the
caves of calcareous grit on the Yorkshire coast, he will find them in some
places lined, like those of volcanic rocks, or the mouths of hot springs, with

1860.                                            n

Arragonite*. Here then we have proof of a certain modicum of heat existing
in boiling-springs now extinct, which once pervaded these strata · for had the
heat of the water which left this deposit been much more, or less, than about
212° F., no such crystals could have been formed. Not far from the same
locality, in a thin seam of the cornbrash Oolite, I have found nodules en-
closing small Crustacea, the interior of which was filled with crystalline
blende. No other trace of zinc is to be seen in the country around t. The
same singular phenomenon may be observed in the neighbouring Lias-shale,
where the chambers of the Ammonites frequently contain blende\. This is
not a phenomenon peculiar to the district ; it illustrates the general con-
dition of the earth after these shells were deposited, and is best accounted
for by the vera causa of an elevated temperature ; it indicates that the fumes
of zinc, or one of its volatile combinations, must have penetrated the strata,
taking the form of blende in the chambers of the Ammonite, and having

been sealed up in these, escaped decomposition.
   The same account is applicable to the dissemination of carbonate and sul-

phide of lead and copper in the Permian and Triassic strata, and of the

particles of metallic copper in the mountain limestone; as well as to the de-
posits of calamine in the hollows of that rock, on the conditions of which de-

posits light is thrown by an experiment of Delanoue, who found that no pre-
cipitate of carbonate of zinc is produced by limestone at the common tempera-
ture, but that it is perfectly thrown down from a. warm solution of its salts.

   And here also it is worthy of remark, that in the experiments of Forch-
hammer to illustrate the formation of dolomitic strata, when a solution of

carbonate of lime was mixed with sea-water at a boiling heat, the compound
formed contained only 18 per cent, of carbonate of magnesia, but that the

proportion of magnesia increased with an increase of temperature; in the
experiments of Favre and Marignac, the composition of equal atoms, which

is that of many natural beds of magnesian limestone, was attained by raising

the heat to 392° F., and the pressure to 1.5 atmospheres; and in those of
Morlot a mixture of sulphate of magnesia and calcareous spar was com-
pletely converted, in the same circumstances, into a double salt of carbonate

of lime and magnesia, with sulphate of lime.

    The probable history of all the calcareous and magnesian strata, with

their interstratified cherts and flints, and interspersed chalcedonic fossils, is
that they are products of submarine solfataras, whence issued successively,
in basins variously extended, gases and springs capable of dissolving pre-
existent beds, which caused alternate depositions .of silica and carbonated
earths, and intermitting from time to time, allowed intervals for the succession

of organic and animated beings.

    The manner in which materials are furnished for extensive sedimentary
deposits by processes of disintegration dependent on subterraneous ema-
nations, has been observed by Bunsen in the solfataras of Iceland. He

describes the palagonitic rocks, formerly erupted there, as undergoing con-

   * Dr. Murray informs me that this Arragonite is found in a little bay within six miles of
Scarborough, in the seams and crevices of the upper calcareous grit. He describes it as

fibrous, compact, or imperfectly mammillated, wanting the oblique cleavage of calcite,
scratching Iceland spar, and flying into powder in the flame of a taper. Mr. Procter having

myat request taken the specific gravity of a fibrous specimen, finds it 3, and confirms Dr.

 Murray's description of the other characters of this mineral.

    f The only peculiarity is that a basaltic dike traverses the district at a distance of a few

miles from the site of the fossils.

    J The Lias fossils sometimes also contain galena. Blum describes a bivalve from a fer-
ruginous oolitic rock near Semur, the shells of which consist entirely of crystalline lamina;
of specular iron ; and a cardinia from the lower lias, according to Bischof, likewise consists
of the same mineral, which we know elsewhere as a result of volcanic action.

version by these means " into alternate and irregularly penetrating beds of
white ferruginous, and coloured ferruginous, fumerole clay, the deposits
being disclosed to a considerable depth, and exhibiting in the clearest man-

ner the phenomena of alternating colours." " One is astonished," he re-
marks, " at observing the great similarity between the external phenomena

of these metamorphic deposits of clay still in the act of being formed, and
certain structures of the Kenper formation. Thousands of years hence the

geologist who explores these regions when the last traces of the now active
fumeroles have vanished, and the clay formations have become consolidated
into marl-like rocks by the silica with which they are saturated, may suppose,

from the differently stratified petrographic and chemical character of these
beds, that he is looking at flceiz strata formed by deposition from water."
" At the surface, especially, where the deposition is favoured by slow eva-

poration, innumerable crystals of gypsum, often an inch in diameter, may
frequently be observed loosely surrounded by an argillaceous mass. At the
mountain ledge of the Namarfeyall, and at Krisuvik, this gypsum is found

to penetrate the argillaceous masses in connected strata and floor-like depo-
sits, which not unfrequently project as small rocks where the lower soil has
been carried away by the action of the water. These deposits are sometimes
sparry, corresponding in their exterior very perfectly with the strata of gyp-
sum so frequently met with in the marl and clay formations of the Trias."

    The great disturbances and fractures, the trappean rocks, and the frag-

ments of porphyritic,conglomerates, at. the bases of these formations, tend to
confirm the opinion of Bunsen, that they have had a metamorphic origin, an

origin very probably common to other beds, whether consisting of marl, shale,

or sand. AH the sand-beds now forming are clue to the disintegration and

detritus of ancient, sandstones, a process, which continued through a great
lapse of time, has but coated some portions of the sea-side with unconsoli-

dated sand. In the soundings of the Atlantic depths, the microscope.according
to Maury, has failed to detect a single particle of sand or gravel. For the

origin and consolidation of the inferior grits and shales we must look to ac-
tions, mechanical and chemical, more potent than those which the present

tranquil course of nature presents. In examining the carboniferous sand-

stones of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, with their shales and coal-

beds, more than 12,000 feet in thickness, Darwin was "surprised at obser-

ving, that though they were evidently of mechanical origin, all the grains of

quartz in some specimens were so perfectly crystallized that they evidently
had not in their present form been aggregated in a preceding rock ; " and

he quotes Wm. Smith as having long since made the same remark on the

millstone grit of England. If any one, in fact, will observe with a lens the

surfaces of the quartz pebbles included in that grit, he will find on most of
them numerous unabradedfacets, which bear evidence of a quartz-crystalline

action having pervaded the rock whilst its consolidation was going on.
    There can be no better proof of widely-spread chemical action due to

heat than the frequent presence of crystallized silica in every part of the

stratified rocks.

   The deeper we descend in the strata, the more plentiful are the veins and
beds of quartz, and the more manifest the signs of metamorphic action.
Von Buch was the first to explain, on the principle of metamorphism,

the change of calcareous rocks, in contact with pyroxenic porphyries, into
dolomites; and in 1835 the same principle was extended by Fournet to
the metallization of rocks by contact with quartziferous porphyries, and to
their felspathication and silicification by the contact of granite. " Since
the theory of a central fire," he observed, " has been confirmed by modern
researches, all the great questions in the history of the globe appear suscep-

                                                                       n2

tible of a simple solution, and it is astonishing that chemists have not yet

carried their views in this direction. From the moment that we consider the

terrestrial globe as a mass of which the different parts have successively

undergone the action of fire, we must also conceive, as a necessary conse-

quence, a series of chemical phenomena, such as calcination, fusion, cemen-
tation, &c," meaning by this latter term, the mutual molecular inter-
penetration of bodies in contiguity, a process of which I shall presently have
to offer a remarkable example.

   There was one mineralogical chemist, however, of high eminence, who had

long before carried his views in the direction desired by Fournet. In 1823,
Mitscherlich, having examined the forms, and analysed the ingredients, of
forty crystalline products of furnaces*, to which Berthier had contributed
several parallel results of experimental processes, pronounced them identical
with various native minerals, and in particular with peridot, pyroxene, and
mica. In the artificial mica, however, he found lime, of which granitic
mica scarcely contains a trace ; and this led him to speculate on the cause
of the chief chemical distinction between the granite and trap formations,
consisting in the absence of calcareous and magnesian silicates from the
former. Supposing, he argued, that the primary rocks were formed at that
stage of the earth's refrigeration when -|ths of its water were in a state of
vapour, the pressure on every part of its surface, computed according to

Laplace's calculation of the mean depth of the sea, would be 225 atmo-
spheres f ; but under such a weight the affinity of lime for silica would cease ;
hence the crystals of uncombined silica in Carrara marble.

    The surmise has since been brought into evidence by an experiment of

Petzholdt, in which pulverized quartz, heated to whiteness with an equal
weight of carbonate of lime in an open vessel, was found to form a silicate
with the lime, but produced no combination when heated in a strong, close

vessel of iron.

    The crystallization of the primary rocks was supposed by the early Plutonic

theorists to be due to slow cooling; but this principle alone does not satisfy
the phenomena. The crystalline structure of granite is seen, for example in
Glen Tilt, at Shap Fell J, and elsewhere, to be equally uniform in its partial
irruptions into the superior strata, as where it appears to be the foundation
stone of the earth's crust ; it has crystallized in its accustomed manner, where
it has penetrated fissures of the upper beds in plates as thin as the leaves of
a book and threads as fine as a hair, and even where it is involved in the in-

vaded stratum so that no junction with any vein can be observed. How

 could it have been thus injected in a state of fusion, unless of the most liquid

kind ? and how could the heat of such liquidity, in a material of which the
fusing-point is so high, be otherwise than rapidly cooled down?

     Furthermore, the quartz which forms so large a constituent of granite,
 has always the specific gravity of crystalline silica, which exceeds that of any
other species of silica. But Deville and others have shown that fusion

    t In Mitscherlich's Memoire, as printed in the ' Annales de Chimie et de Physique,'
tome xxiv. pp. 372, 373, the atmospheres are stated as 2250, deduced from a mean depth of
sea, 9u,000 feet, with a cipher too much, that is, in both cases.

    \ I understand from Mr. Marshall that the ramified granite of Shap Fell is similarly
crystallized with the rest of the rock, but finer grained.

lowers this specific gravity to a constant amount, and that fused silica does
not recover its density in cooling. Crystalline granite, as Delesse has shown,

passes by fusion from the density of 2G2 to that of 2*32, and Egyptian

porphyry from 2*76 to 248.
    Again, the felspar in granite is encrusted by the quartz, the most fusible

by the least fusible material, contrary to all experience of crystallization
either from solution or fusion.

   Lastly, all the minerals of which granite is composed have been artificially
produced, and their production has in every instance taken place at tempera-
tures far below that of the fusing-point of that rock. The first specimens
of artificial felspar analysed by Karsten, and measured by Mitscherlich,
were found in the lining of a copper furnace amongst a sublimate of zinc.
Mitscherlich tried to obtain the like by fusing several pounds of native felspar
in a porcelain furnace, and subjecting the mass to a process of slow cooling,
but without success*. In the Mulden smelting works, Cotta observed the
walls of the furnace traversed, in the joints of its masonry, and in the cracks
which it had undergone, by beautiful metallic veins, the sides exhibiting the
phenomena of impregnation and alteration as in the boundary walls of
natural veins, and the ores consisting of galena, blende, iron and copper
pyrites, purple copper, Fahl ore, native copper, &c. In like manner pyro-

+morphite (Pb3 3? 3- Pb CI), in well-formed six-sided prisms from the iron

furnace at Asbach, was found attached to the stones of the masonry. There

can be no doubt but that Karsten's crystals of felspar, like these, were

formed by gaseous sublimation ; and an analogous process would account
for the felspar observed by Haidinger in a basaltic cavity, under the form

of Laumonite, and by Bischof in a porphyritic bed, in which a Trilobite

also was found.

  A new view of the production of minerals has been opened by Ebelmtn,

who obtained the most refractory crystals of the granitic rocks, such as

spinel, emerald, cymophane, and corundum, by segregation in the interior

of a fused mass. They were formed at a heat far below that which would

fuse either those crystals or granite, by means of the evaporation of a fusible

and volatile medium. Gaudin also, on the same principle using a similar

alkaline solvent, and substituting sulphuric for boracic and carbonic acids

as the volatile ingredient, obtained the ruby.

   To the same category may be referred an experiment by Precht, who

having added to a transparently fused frit, weighing 1^ cwt., a considerable

quantity of felspar, found, after cooling, that a large portion of this mineral
had separated itself in foliated masses, and in several distinct crystals.

   The most important light, however, on this subject, especially in relation to
metamorphic phenomena, is from the experiments of Daubree on the reaction
of gaseous compounds upon various earthy bases. Conveying the chlorides
of tin and titanium over lime at heats varying from 572° to 1652° Fahr.,
he produced crystals of tinstone and brookite ; by variations of the same

principle, at heats not exceeding redness, he obtained all the following mine-

--rals : wollastonite, staurolite, peridote, ditthene, willemite, idocrase, garnet,

phenakite, emerald, euclase, corundum, zircon, periclase, spinel, augite, di-

opside, gahnite, franklinite, haematite, felspar, and tourmaline in hexagonal

--prisms imbedded within crystals of quartz. The process was of this descrip-

tion : Chloride of aluminium, passed over lime at a red heat, produced

corundum                                               chloride  of silicium, passed  in  like  manner  over seven equiva-
                                                    ;

lents of potash or soda and one of alumina, produced the different species

of felspar : the latter named gas, decomposed by lime at the same heat, or

by magnesia, alumina, or glucina, gave crystallized quartz in the usual form
of the pyramidal hexagon, passing below into a silicate of the associated
bases. " The most remarkable part," as Daubree has remarked, " connected
with these reactions, in a chemical, arid especially a geological point of view,
is that the silicium and the silicates thus produced have an extreme tendency
to crystallize, and that the crystallization takes place at a temperature far
below their points of fusion." " The manner," he adds, " in which quartz and
the silicates are connected with the granite rocks has long been a difficulty

in all the hypotheses on the formation of the rocks called primitive. Now

we find, in our experiments, that quartz crystallizes at the same time with,

or even later than, the silicates at a temperature scarcely exceeding a cherry-
red heat, and consequently infinitely below its point of fusion."

   M. Daubree disclaims the supposition that those rocks themselves were

formed after the formula of his experiments. Nevertheless, considering

the probability that formations at higher temperatures, now obliterated, may

have preceded that of the granitic rocks, observing the uniform crystalliza-
tion of granite in the tenuity of its ramifications, as well as in mass, and
perceiving that Daubree by his process has reproduced almost all the granitic

minerals, and among them not only the felspar, but the crystalline quartz

--of granite, it must be admitted that such a theory is worth attention.

    Durocher has added to Daubree's researches two capital experiments, of

direct geological application, in obtaining the sulphides of the mineral veins

by the reaction of sulphuretted hydrogen on the chlorides of the metals in a
state of vapour, and in having effected the metamorphism of limestone into
dolomite in an atmosphere of the vapour of chloride of magnesium.

   A theory of sublimation, however, may admit of many modifications,

and may be combined with the principle of segregation illustrated in the

experiments of Ebelmen. Deville and Caron, having fused bone phosphate
at a l'ed heat in excess of chloride and fluoride of calcium, found that lime
apatite crystallized out in cooling, and was easily separated by washing from
the soluble salts. In like manner, with different bases and different chlorides,

they obtained the numerous varieties of apatite and wagnerite. And they

observed further, that all these minerals became volatile at a slightly elevated
temperature in the vapour of the chloride amidst which they were formed.

    Senarmont, pursuing another course, had applied a heat somewhat ex-
 ceeding 662° Fahr. to an aqueous solution of hydrochlorate of alumina, con-
fined in a close tube, and thus decomposing it into its volatile and solid
ingredients, obtained corundum, distinctly crystallized and mixed with
diaspore, the same substance under a different form, and with different
 chemical properties, thus repeating in a remarkable manner that process by

which the same minerals are found in nature similarly intermingled. He

 also succeeded in eliminating crystals of quartz from hydrate of silica by
 dissolving the hydrate in water charged with carbonic acid, and gradually
 raising the temperature of the tube which contained it to a heat of from
 400° to 500° Fahr., and by analogous methods he obtained carbonates and
 sulphides identical with native minerals. In some of these experiments the
 process was so varied as to show that the separation of the anhydrous cry-

 stals was due to the gradual withdrawal of the dissolving gas. The hydrated

 sesquioxide of iron, also heated in water of the temperature of 360° Fahr.,
 was dehydrated, becoming magnetic. In an experiment by Wohler, on the
 contrary, apophyllite dissolved in water at the same temperature, returned

 on cooling to its original form, retaining its water of crystallization. To this
 class of discovery Daubree has likewise added some valuable facts, having

 obtained regular crystals of quartz, by decomposing, with the vapour of
 water alone, the interior of a glass tube subjected to a low red heat ; at the

same time silicates were formed, hydrated or anhydrous, according to the

degree of heat ; when fragments of obsidian were inserted, crystals of

Rhyacolite appeared ; and the silicated water of Plombiere being substituted

for plain water, and kaolin for obsidian, crystals of diopside insinuated

themselves into the silicated substance of the tube, and the kaolin was

changed into a substance possessing felspathic characters.

All these experiments are adverse to the idea that the primary rocks have

undergone fusion. The best natural criterion, perhaps, of the temperature

at which they Avere formed, was afforded by the discovery, in 1828, of a

method of manufacturing ultramarine, based on Vauquelin's identification

of a furnace-product with the Lapis lazuli found in granite and in primitive

limestone. In some specimens which I possess of the latter rock, this

beautiful mineral may be seen enamelling with minute specks, and with

perfect distinctness, within and without, all the plates of the calcareous

crystals, which are here and there interspersed with small crystals of sulphate

of lime. The heat at which the artificial ultramarine is made is that of red-

Aness.                 lower temperature will not suffice to produce the colour, and a

higher destroys it.

  We can now better understand how Hunterite, a white felspathic mineral

containing 1 1*6 per cent, of water, can have been formed where it is found ;
a hydrated silicate of alumina in the bosom of molten granite is an anomaly

for which high pressure would scarcely account; but if the rock was at the

temperature only of a low red heat, the formation of this mineral, and of

the hydrated micas, will no longer appear a marvel.

Other notices of ancient degrees of heat have been observed in the

strata. In a cavity within a quartz crystal from Dauphine, Davy found a

viscous inflammable fluid in small quantity, in a perfect vacuum*. In the

cavities of other quartz crystals he found water and rarefied air. Sorby,

having determined the amount of rarefaction in one such from a bed of
mica-slate, in which he detected many others, calculated the temperature of

the crystal at the time of its formation to have been 320° Fahr. In one case

Davy found evidence of pressure which had condensed the elastic fluid in a

crystal of quartz, and Brewster observed the like in crystals of topaz.

   From a general review of the researches now detailed, the following infer-
ences may be drawn :

1. That all the consolidated strata, viewed chemically, bear marks of sub-

jection to an action of heat agreeable to the theory of the earth's refrigera-

tion, in direct proportion to the age of their deposit; and that they show that

action most explicitly in the presence, throughout, but more abundantly as

the series descends, of that peculiar form of silica which is chemically repro-
duced by the action of heated volatile matter.

2. That the igneous minerals were formed by molecular aggregation, at a

heat not exceeding, perhaps, that of an ordinary fire, either as a residuum
from the expiration of fusible and volatile materials, or more generally as a
deposit from volatile forms of matter.

   As there are two classes of eruptive rocks, the quartzose and unguartzose,

so there are two classes of emanation which accompany them, and deposit

earthy minerals, differing for each class, in the neighbouring strata. They

generally mantle round the rock, and but seldom penetrate it ; as if it had
rather made room for them to rise, than as if they made part of its substance.
Yet they bear a resemblance to the character of the rock which they follow.
Thus the crystallized oxide of silicon is the characteristic ingredient of granite

--which has been metamorphosed by rocks of granitic character, still greater

masses of crystalline sesquioxide of iron in similar relation to those rocks,
crystalline peroxide of tin shot through them into the strata above.

    In the eruptive rocks which followed the quartzose, these minerals, with
almost all the quartz, died out, and were succeeded by others of a more

complex nature appropriate to the porphyritic, trachytic, basaltic, and lavic
eruptions. Yet all these, as well as the granitic, are attended by similar
metalliferous veins, which grow very weak in the latest, but still show, at least
as far as the eruption of the more ancient lavas*, a continued communica-

tion with a common reservoir deeper seated than any of them.
   Davy saw the lava of Vesuvius issuing, as if forced up by elastic fluids,

perfectly liquid, and nearly white-hot, its surface in violent agitation, with
large bubbles rising from it, which emitted clouds of white smoke, consisting

of common salt in great excf ss, much chloride of iron, and some sulphate of

lime, accompanied with aqueous vapour, and with hydrochloric and sul-
phurous acids. It contains also realgar and sulphide of copper, due pro-
bably to the reaction of sulphuretted hydrogen on the chloride of the metal.

   In the early time of these eruptive emanations, when they escaped at
many points with little interruption, the land rose only to low levels above
the waters. As the crust of the earth grew more solid and weighty, and
the vent was confined to fewer lines of shrinkage, the elastic elements of
disturbance upheaved the incumbent beds with greater power, and the

   * Though the presence of quartz in lava has been denied, the following account of its
coexistence with schorl in that of the valley of Maria in Lipari by Spallanzani shows that it
does exist in ancient, perhaps basaltic, lavas, and strikingly illustrates the theory of its sub-

limation, as here advanced. " Among the lavas partly decomposed we find pumices and

enamels containing felspars and scales of black schorls, and certain curious and beautiful

objects, which derive their origin, in my opinion, from filtration. The lava is white and friable

--to a certain depth, of a petrosiliceous base, full of small cells and cavities, within which these

objects make their appearance : First, minute crystals of schorl ; from the inside of these

cells project very slender schorls, sometimes resembling minute chestnut bristles, sometimes
a bunch, a plume, or a fan, to be ascribed to filtration after the hardening of the lava, since

though it is common to find schorls in lavas, they are found incorporated within them, not
detached as in this ease. The second filtration has produced small quartzose crystals, and
the manner of their distribution in prodigious numbers renders them a very singular phe-
nomenon among volcanic objects. Wherever the lava is scabrous, wherever it has folds,
sinuosities, cavities, or fissures, it is full of these crystallizations. The larger crystals extend

to 3^ lines, the greater part about \ a line. Tiiey consist of a hexagonal prism, infixed
by the base into the lava, and terminated by a similar pyramid. Three crystals, among those
I examined, were terminated by two pyramids, the prism being attached to the lava by a
few points, and the prisms projecting out. The most regular are in small cavities, but not
a few are on the surface of the lava. The. lava, embellished with these, forms immense
rocks and vast elevations hanging over the sea, which, whenever they are broken to a certain
depth, are found to contain these crystals, with capillary schorls, not \ery numerous. I have

in my possession a group of needle-formed crystals from Mont St. Gotliard, within which

are seven small prisms of black striated schorl. The same may be observed in these minute
crystals. One of these ivas perforated from side to side by a needle of schorl, the two ends
of which projected out. The formation of these capillary schorls must have preceded that
of the cpiartzose crystals ; otherwise it is impossible to conceive how the former should have

penetrated the substance of the latter. In rcmelting the lava in a furnace, the quartz
crystals remained perfectly unaltered."

    Spallanzani also states, that in this lava are garnets and chrysolites more refractory in the
fire than the matrix ; and he adds that since Dolomieu's visit to the adjoining stoves, when
the whole ground on which they stood was saturated with hot vapours issuing everywhere
from small openings an inch or two in diameter, at the time of his own visit these were
reduced to one, exhaling some sulphur and encrusted with soft pyrites.
ON THE EFFECTS OF LONG-CONTINUED HEAT.  185

mountain chains culminated to their utmost height. In the progress of re-
frigeration the compressing and imprisoned forces became nearly balanced,
and the residual predominance of the latter produces the phenomena of
existing earthquakes and volcanoes.

    In the earlier periods, unmutilated skeletons, undisplaced scales, entire
ink-bags, and florescent fronds, indicate conditions of nature which would

now be called unnatural, a history of sudden death and speedy embalment,
common, not to individuals only, but to generations and species. The pre-

servation, in exquisite casts, of the most delicate organizations indicates a
speedy but a tranquil entombment, which it would be difficult to refer

to any other agency than that of gaseous emanation through the waters

in which the plants and animals existed. Alcyonia and sponges, looking

like recent specimens preserved in the places where they grew, point to a

process of silicification, chiefly anhydrous, which anticipated decomposition.

In the decreasing activity of internal heat and insalubrious emanations, we

see the advancement of the physical and chemical conditions essential or

advantageous to life; and with the progress of such conditions, favourable to
the development of higher and higher forms of organization, we find a perfect

correspondence in the natural history of organized fossils, and the increasing
tones of the " Diapason, closing full in Man."

   From the theory of heat and the facts of geology, combined with physio-
logical considerations, we learn that there was a definite era, in which the
earth first became capable of supporting vegetable and animal life ; and we
may account for the late appearance of man, by observing that there were no
conditions adapted to the well-being and progress of human nature, till this

state of things had yielded to a healthy atmosphere, a moderate heat,

differentiated zones of life, stable forces, and a stationary standing ground.
   In the rudimental ages of the earth we behold an ever-changing scene of

new and fitful conditions passing in rapid succession. Through all the stages

of its existence previous to the present uniformity, so favourable to the

exercise of reason and the freedom of will and action, we see force gradually
subsiding, and the time allowed to life expanded into a wider liberality. Our
ideas of its duration, as compared with indefinite ages, are equally limited with
our view of its magnitude, in comparison with space or matter ; we can find in
geological data no chronology but that of priority; the fossil records even of
its unconsolidated beds have not yet supplied us with the key of the cypher
which should connect geology with human history. If ever we come to know
the age of the primary rocks, or of the protozoic strata, it can only be by
combining physical data with the experimental reproduction of granite, and
a knowledge of the heat which the lowest organisms can bear, and live.

    Since Hall first applied chemistry to the service of geology, few attempts

have been made in this country to pursue the path which he opened. In
1833 the British Association entrusted to a commission, consisting of Prof.
Sedgwick,Dr Daubeny.the late Dr. Turner,and myself, the task of illustrating
geological phenomena by experiments which it was hoped might have thrown
light on some of the subjects discussed in this Report. Disappointed of the

greater part of the fruit of these experiments, I yet believe that the few

results which I now lay on the table of the Section will not prove devoid of

interest, especially as evidence of the low temperature at which bodies scarcely
reputed volatile are capable of being sublimed.

   The iron furnaces of Yorkshire having been selected as furnishing the

best field for these experiments, it fell to my lot to conduct them. Every
facility was afforded me by the zeal and liberality of the proprietors and

managers of two furnaces, one of which at Elsicar, belonging to the late Earl
Fitzwilliam, and managed by Mr. H. Hartop, worked for a period of five
--186 REPORT 1860.

years ; the other at Low Moor, belonging to Messrs. Wickhara and Hard)', pro-

longed its unintermitting blast for fifteen years. The materials for the experi-

ments, in addition to those which I was myself able to supply, were provided

partly by a grant from the Association, partly by an extensive donation of

minerals and fossils from the stores of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society.

Professor Phillips also, who was then in charge of that Society's Museum, lent

me his valuable assistance.

The object kept in view, in devising experiments of so long a duration, was

to subject the greatest possible variety of materials to the greatest possible

variety of conditions, such as it might be presumed had formed, or altered,

rocks, minerals, and mineralized organic remains.

These were arranged in numerous crucibles, upright and inverted, and

within two strong tripartite boxes of deal bound with iron thongs ; one

of these was stored with large blocks and copious powders of granite, basalt,

limestone, grit, and shale, with whole and pounded minerals of every kind,

hydrates and anhydrates, the ingredients of a great variety of minerals com-

pounded in proper proportions, all the different salts and elements calculated

to react upon them, with almost every metal adapted to form veins or to re-

gister heat ; the other contained organic substances, fossil and recent plants,
shells, corals, reptiles, and bones, disposed in clay, sand, chalk, marble, gypsum,

fluor, sulphates, muriates and other salts of soda and potash which might dis-

engage volatile elements by their mutual action, to react on fixed constituents.

At the Elsicar furnace I was allowed, whilst it was being built, to insert

crucibles in the back of the masonry in immediate contiguity with the body

of melted iron. At Low Moor it was agreed to place boxes filled with cruci-

bles and materials under the bottom stone, before the furnace was built.

This stone, consisting of millstone grit, 15 inches thick, though it gradually

wears hollow in the centre, retains the iron fused upon it usually for fourteen

or fifteen years, without being materially impaired. In its crevices are often

found the beautiful cubic crystals of nitrocyanide of titanium, first brought

into notice by Dr. Buckland.

In this situation the temperature to which the contents of the boxes would

be exposed could not be exactly foreseen. It was presumed that in the centre

it would be near to the melting-point of cast iron. It will be seen by refer-

ence to Plates IV. and V., which give a section and plan of the furnace, that

the boxes did not occupy the whole space beneath the bottom stone. It oc-

curred to me therefore, when these had been placed in position on a bed of

sand, covered with the same material, and built up with fire brick, to deposit

round them in a similar bed of sand, and enclose in like manner within walls

of brick, lumps of various metals, and of granite, sandstone, fossiliferous

shale, and limestone. From these supplementary experiments are derived

the most interesting of the results which I have to describe.

For when at the expiration of fifteen years the furnace was blown out, I

found nothing left of the boxes but the iron straps with which they were

bound, in a state of oxidation ; a few crucibles and portions of crucibles only

had  survived  the  general wreck of their contents                                                                                                                               granites, basalts,  limestone,
                                                                                                                                                                               ;

choice minerals, measured pieces, weighed powders and compositions, had

disappeared ; all the exactness with which Professor Phillips had arranged for
identifying the altered substances by their position and by comparison with

reserved specimens, was lost labour.

Nor did I find the deposits in the Elsicar furnace, at the end of five years,

to have fared any better. From all these carefully devised experiments I can

produce but two worthy of notice. One of them exhibits the conversion of

river sand into sandstone, with a vacuity in its axis left by the volatilization

crucible, with no adhesion to its sides, a perfect cast ; no salt had been added

to it, nor is any separable from it by boiling. The close cohesion of the
grains of sand by the action of heat may have been facilitated by the inter-
mixture of some impurities, referable to oxide of iron, and possibly to felspar.
The only vestige of the plant is a skin of silica on the surface of the place

which it occupied in the interior of the sand, coating the vacancy, but not
furnishing an impression from which the character of the plant can be re-

covered. The stone showed signs of splitting from shrinkage in an oblique,

or nearly vertical direction, a tendency which might probably have been more
conspicuous had the experiment been on a larger scale.

   The other specimen is a translucent mineral of a pure blue colour. This
colour it does not lose when heated red-hot in the outer flame of a candle.
Melted into a bead with carbonate of soda, it passes into a pure opake white

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

the same also with a small proportion of borax ; when the proportion of the
borax is increased, the bead is transparent and colourless ; dissolved in
hydrochloric acid, the mineral loses its colour. The solution contains much
sulphate of lime, and some silica and alumina, whether potash also, or soda, I

have not determined ; tested with prussiale of potash, it shows no trace of
copper, and none, or scarcely any, of iron. This substance therefore belongs
to the class of minerals of which Lapis lazuli and Haiiyne are varieties. It has
been formed irregularly under a thin crust of sand to which it adheres, is im-
bedded in sulphate, sulphide, and carbonate of lime, and accompanied with
crystallized fluoride of lime. Whether this fluoride is a recomposition, or
part only of the original mixture from which the blue mineral has been

derived, I cannot say. The crucible certainly contained pounded fluor, and
a sulphate, which underwent decomposition, and partially decomposed the

fluoric crystals.

   But the objects to which I have alluded as possessing a new and unexpected

interest, are the metals above mentioned as having been supplementarily

placed, outside the boxes, under the bottom stone of the Low Moor furnace.

The specimens consisted, originally, of pieces, of which chromographic plates
have been appended to this Report, cut from a bar of zinc, a block of tin,
a pig of lead, and a plate of tile-copper. They occupied, severally, the places
marked in the accompanying ground plan of the furnace, 1, 2, 3, 4, as
numbered at the time of the deposit. It will be seen that none of these
pieces have undergone fusion, that of which the melting-point is lowest (the
block tin) preserving perfectly its dimensions, the exact shape into which it
was cut, and the sharp edges of the cutting. The external coat of the

tin, to the depth of from ith to ^th of an inch, is converted into deutoxide,
crystalline, transparent, and of the same specific gravity as the native ore
between this and the metal, intervenes in some parts a space, which, with
the striation of the metallic surface, indicates that a portion of the substance
has been dissipated.

   Of the bar-zinc, more than half has been changed, though it preserves its

original form, into a mass of crystalline oxide, interspersed with globules of
the metal, burrowed in all directions with drusy cells and cavities, and
showing extensive sublimation into the indurated sand which envelopes it.

The nature of the sublimation is manifested by a number of prismatic spicula

of metallic zinc, about £th of an inch long, standing within the cavities.
    But that which is chiefly remarkable is the tile-copper, in respect both to

the temperature at which it has been volatilized, and the combination and
interpenetration which its molecules, in a volatile state, have effected with its
nearest neighbour, the lead. I have caused a drawing to be made of these
specimens in their relative positions, as they lay in proximity to, but not
touching, each other, having a portion of sand interposed.
--188 REPORT 1860.

   It Mill be seen that a very considerable portion of the copper plate has
been dissipated, that the surface has been sweated down, and in some parts
the whole substance has evaporated away. Bright crystals of red oxide of
copper line the wasted surface, which is also covered above with a coat,
|-th of an inch thick, of mixed crystalline oxides of copper and lead ; and
in the hollow which the dissipation of the metal has left between it and the
indurated sand, is a sublimate consisting of fine twisted coherent threads of

metallic copper, like those met with in mines and slags. Where nearest to

the lead, it has so intermixed its exhalations with those proceeding from
that metal as to have spread over the upper leaden surface a coating of green
crystals, consisting of a double oxide of copper and lead. Beneath, and round
the lead, at its contact with the sand (which below has penetrated its sub-
stance without altering its form), runs a pink skin, marking the path of the
red oxide of copper. I cut the lump of lead in half, and found it not only
traversed in the middle by a seam of mixed oxide, but, what was still more

remarkable, dotted with spots of metallic copper, which had found their way

to the very centre of the mass, and even reached the opposite side.
   That it was the metal in this case, as in that of the zinc, which became

volatile, and was subsequently deposited in the form of specks and filaments
of copper in some places, and combining with oxygen, as a crystallized oxide

in others, cannot be doubted. To attribute these effects to thermal electricity

would not be consistent with the facts ; for there was here no contact, and no

circuit. The penetration of the lead by the molecules of copper may be

called Cementation, and be supposed to be due to capillary attraction of pores
distended by heat acting on the volatile particles.

   But the surprising part of the result is, that the sublimation of copper by
heat should have taken place at so Iowa temperature. These four metals, in
close proximity, and all acted upon in the same manner, were their own
mutual thermometers. It was impossible that the heat to which the copper
plate, as a whole, had been subject could have been higher than the melting-
point of the unfused lead and tin. I can attribute this unexpected fact to
no other cause than the continual and protracted passage of hot currents of
air and vapour, mingled perhaps with carbonaceous gas from the neigh-
bouring wooden boxes* ; and it seems probable that if the central portion
of the bottom stone had withstood to the end the action of the furnace, or
if the buried boxes had been protected with a vault of brick, more light
might have been thrown on the transfer of molecules at moderate tempera-
tures by similar effects produced on other materials.

   I owe an apology for having delayed this Report much longer than I

should have done, had the bulk of the experiments been attended with better

success. I have been reminded of them by the design of a member of the
Association to institute some of a similar character with the added conditions
of pressure and steam. Whoever should now undertake such experiments
would conduct them on the vantage ground of the later researches which I

have here noticed, and might obtain results of high interest to geological and

chemical science. It may be doubted whether heat protracted through many
years, or even extraordinary pressure, may be essential elements of such
results. The unintermitted presence of volatile materials, for a considerable
time, passing over and dwelling among those of greater fixity at temperatures
mounting up to a red heat, may be the only needful condition ; and if a fur-

   * If I am right in believing that an oolitic Echinus, Pecten, and Coral, and an Ammonite
from the Lias, which I recovered from the furnace, are those marked in the Plan with the

Nos. 8, 9, 10, then, as these were reduced to alkalinity, though without change of form or
markings, it would follow that the carbonic acid under the same circumstances separates
from lime at an equally low temperature of the mass, under the partial action of hot currents.
ON THE EFFECTS OF LONG-CONTINUED HEAT.  189

nace were appropriated to this object, it is not difficult to conceive a con-
struction and application of it which would fulfil such a requirement.

    If any one could succeed in effecting the synthesis of pseudomorphic

crystals, or of granites and porphyries, he would certainly perform a great

service to chemical geology. In the first of these subjects of experiment
success is scarcely to be looked for, except in the metamorphic action of
heated volatile agents. It is possible that granite also, and porphyry, might
be formed by a process of volatilization ; or they might perhaps be produced
as a residual igneous crystallization out of a mass, of which the flux had been
removed from the denser substances by sublimation, solution, or pressure.

    It should appear that the production of marble is also a problem still un-

determined. Rose has expressed an opinion, founded on his own ex-

periments, that the solid substance which Sir J. Hall obtained, by igniting

chalk under a pressure that prevented the extrication of the carbonic gas,

cannot have been marble. Possibly the presence of an excess of the acid

may be an additional requisite to the production of a perfect specimen.
   Since this Report was drawn up, I have seen a memoir by M. Daubree*

which contains a very able and complete exposition of the progress of
geological chemistry. His observations on the deposit of zeolitic crystals

and other minerals discovered in the interstices of the old Roman brick-

work and concrete at Plombieresf, which have undergone the action of sili-

cated waters springing from the earth at a temperature not, now at least,
exceeding 158° F., seem to have solved the problem of the deposit of such

crystals and minerals in the vesicles of basaltic rocks, and to have proved
them to be due to aqueous infiltration whilst the rock was still hot.

    His views on the formation of another class of minerals, and the origin of

the granitic and other early rocks, seem to be not equally satisfactory. To
these he has been led by his own late experiments on the effect of aqueous
vapour in decomposing obsidian and glass. He propounds, with the diffidence,

however, which belongs to a hypothetical speculation, a theory to the

--following effect that in a primaeval state of the earth, when the heat now

known to exist in its interior extended to the surface, as that surface cooled
down to a certain point, the red-hot obsidian, or silicated glass, of its first
coat was decomposed by water condensed from a state of vapour, under
great pressure, at a red heat ; thus the quartziferous rocks were formed, at
first as a plastic sponge, and when the water had evaporated as granite, the
schist and slates immediately superincumbent upon it being the residuary

product of the mother-waters.

   But this speculation is open to grave objections. What principle of
solidification, it may be asked, capable of compacting granite, is included
in a process of disintegration ? What has become of the silicates involved
in it, to which we might look for such solidification, but which are absent
from granite ? The mother-water* which it supposes are incapable of dif-

fusing the peculiar minerals encysted in the proximity of granitic rocks

even to the distance of thousands of feet. No less unaccountable would be

the absence of all the zeolitic and opaline substances that might have been
expected. Everything tends to show that whatever the power of this process

may be, it must be confined, at least, to the lavas, basalts, and trachytes.
   That heated water has been so universal a solvent as M. Daubree supposes,

is rendered very improbable by a circumstance noticed by Cagniard de
Latour in his celebrated experiments on vapour highly heated and com-

   t The presence of fluorine in the apophyllite of Plombieres is remarkable, the more be-

 pressed. In one of these, the addition of a crystal or two of chlorate of
 potash to water at the temperature of 648° F., proved sufficient to prevent
 any action of the aqueous vapour on the glass ; so easily was it saturated by
 the presence of a more soluble material.

     Neither is it at all probable that any stratum which can be supposed to have
 preceded granite under extraordinary conditions of heat and pressure, can

 have resembled in any degree obsidian or glass. M. Daubree takes the

 vapour expansion of the ocean over the globe as equivalent to a pressure
 of 250 atmospheres, somewhat exceeding Mitscherlich's supposition before

 quoted. On this pressure Mitscherlich, as has been said, sagaciously re-

 marked, that it would probably materially modify the chemical affinities
 of bodies, and prevent the formation of silicate of lime. His anticipation has
 been experimentally verified ; and an equally remarkable instance of the

same principle has been lately observed by Mr. Gore, who has found, on
 immersing some fifty substances in carbonic acid liquefied by pressure, that

in that state it is chemically inert, to such a degree as not to dissolve oxygen
salts. In these cases it should seem that pressure favours homogeneous, or
simple, at the expense of heterogeneous, or complex, attractions ; and there is

all the less reason for admitting M. Daubree's supposition, that obsidian,

 or any vitreous silicates, preceded the granitic rocks.

   We may carry these ideas further ; Ave may extend our speculations from

the heat and weight of a vaporized sea to the gaseous system of Laplace, and
the ultimate atoms of Newton. Then, as the heat by degrees radiated into
space, and as the repulsive force yielded to the forces of attraction, the

--first compounds would be of the simplest order, water, and hydrochloric

--acid, the chlorides of potassium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium, the oxides

of magnesium and calcium, with others of a like class. Here we have both
the materials of the sea, and of the primary crust of the earth ; and at the
same time all the power of consolidation which free crystalline force and
enormous pressure can give to materials indisposed by that pressure to enter

into complicated combination.

    In contemplating the origin of granite, it is not, however, competent to
us to regard it as a fundamental rock only, since it preserves the same
crystalline character under various conditions of heat and pressure. But

we must remember that the gaseous theory which we are imagining implies
a residue, in an internal gasometer, of similar primary compounds confined

in a highly heated, condensed, and elastic state at no great distance under
our feet, from the sudden or gradual evolution of which it is not difficult

to conceive that all the eruptive rocks and veins, and many of the pheno-
mena of consolidation in the sedimentary strata, may be accounted for.

    Every rock of eruption, and every mineral vein, which has shot up into the
strata, indicates such an origin. The porphyries, trachytes, basalts, and lavas
are essentially chemical and crystalline compounds. They differ from the quart-
ziferous rocks only in this, that the chief part of the siliceous ingredients which
characterize the latter having been antecedently used up, the greater fusi-
bility of the former has more or less obliterated their crystalline structure.

   In these speculations it matters not from what source we suppose the

heat of the earth to have been derived. Perhaps, a law of gravity, together
with the other forces of attraction, imposed on the ultimate particles of

matter, may account for all the heat which is, or has been in the world. In

any case, the most probable inductive conclusion from our knowledge of
the earth's heat, and the phenomena of eruption, with the light thrown on
the production of minerals by Daubree's_/w-s£ series of experiments, and
those of Durocher, appears to be, that mineral veins and eruptive rocks

are the result of gaseous combinations and reactions. As regards mineral
ON THE EFFECTS OF LONG-CONTINUED HEAT.  191

veins, this, I believe, is the opinion of most observers. But we see the same

 metamorphic effects which are produced by them, equally produced by the
presence of any eruptive rock. If a stratum of limestone be invaded, and a

portion of it included in the invading substance, that portion is not unfre-

quently impregnated with magnesia and converted into dolomite, equally by

 a mineral vein or a granitic rock.

    The advantages which this theory possesses over any that have yet pre-
sented themselves, are that it accounts for all the following phenomena:

    1. The characteristic structures of granite, and of gneiss and mica-slate,
which may be compared to the deposits of graphite in gas-retorts, solid
where the carburetted gas aggregates its decomposed molecules of carbon in

confinement, hut foliated and quasi-stratified, where the gas chances to escape
through cracks in the retort into the more open chamber of brick-work ;

    2. The perfect uniformity of crystalline texture in granite, whether deep or
superficial, in thin veins or solid masses, showing that neither great pressure

nor slow cooling have been essential conditions of its crystallization ;

    3. The wide diffusion of zones or atmospheres round the eruptive, and
especially the granitic rocks, of mineral substances, and metamorphic effects,
a phenomenon which, together with that of the filling up of mineral veins
from below, is not accounted for hy any other theory ;

   4. The metalliferous and quai'tziferous impregnations of the sedimentary

strata.

   If, with Cordier, we divide the eruptive rocks into the quartzose (which

correspond to the granites and earliest porphyries) ; and the unquartzose,
comprehending the felspathic (which correspond to the later porphyries and
trachytes); with the pyroxenic (which correspond to the basalts and lavas);

--and if we consider all these as originating from gases, accompanied by

aqueous vapour, then the phenomena show the amount of such vapour
present in the quartzose formations to have been almost infinitesimal,
whilst that which attended some parts of the pyroxenic formations was con-
siderable. As regards the sedimentary siliciferous rocks, they show, in the

semiopaline, semiquartzose composition of the siliceous beds, the action of

anhydrous gas, aided by aqueous vapour. Aqueous vapour acts on silicates
only at a heat approaching redness, and conveys no silica. Chloride of silicon
would carry silica, and would diffuse it at a much lower heat, since it boils
at a temperature below 140° F.

   Connected with the preceding speculations the following remarks may

deserve attention. There is a singular resemblance of mineral and crystal-

--line constitution between the pyroxenic rocks and meteoric stones, a re-

semblance, in fact, so close as to indicate a similar mode of production out
of the same materials. The late optico-chemical discoveries of Bunsen and

Kirchhoff have shown, with a great degree of probability, that molecules of
iron, nickel, and magnesium abound in the solar atmosphere ; should the

progress of those discoveries add silicon to this list, we have here again the

chief materials, both of metcorolites and of pyroxenic rocks. In any case,

whether we suppose the meteorite to have been contemporaneous with the
earth, or to be ejected from the moon, or emitted from the sun, our thoughts
are led back to a time when the whole solar system consisted of the same

ultimate atoms, and are confirmed in the opinion that the meteorites and the
fundamental rocks of the earth have undergone similar processes of mole-
cular and crystalline combination, the vitreous coat of the meteorite, and the
vitreous character of the later lavas, being due also to the same causes :
1st, to the fusibility of the material ; 2ndly, to a more intense heat generated
by a nearer proximity to an oxidating atmosphere ; .Srdly, to a more rapid

rate of cooling.
--192 REPORT 1860.

   What our views, however, of the original constitution of matter may be,

is a point of less consequence than what are the conclusions in geology to
which we are conducted by observation and experiment. The general con-
clusions to be drawn from the foregoing researches seem to be these :
That no theory of the earth consists with the phenomena, which does not

--take into account a heat of the surface once amounting to redness; that

the most prominent chemical and crystalline compounds which laid the base-
ment of the earth's crust, and continued to penetrate it, as far as into the

--tertiary strata, have disappeared in the present eruptive system that the

nature, force, and progress of the past conditions of the earth cannot be

--measured by its existing conditions ; that to deduce accurate inferences in

the sciences of observation, the attention requires to be directed less to gene-

ral analogies than to specific and essential distinctions.

Report.

At the Meeting of the British Association, held in Aberdeen in September,

1859, this Committee was re-appointed in these terms :

   " That the following Members be requested to act as a Committee to con-
tinue the inquiry into the performance of steam-vessels, to embodv the facts
in the form now reported to the Association, and to report proceedings to

the next meeting.

   " That the attention of the Committee be also directed to the obtaining of
information respecting the performance of vessels under sail, with a view to
comparing the results of the two powers of wind and steam, in order to their
most effective and economical combination.

   "That the sum of £150 be placed at the disposal of the Committee for

these purposes."

   The following gentlemen were nominated to serve on the Committee :--

       Vice Admiral Moorsom.         William Smith, C.E.
      The Marquis of Stafford, M.P.
      The Earl of Caithness.         MJ. E. c ConnelI, C.E.
      The Lord Dufferin.
                                     Charles Atherton, C.E.
       William Fairbairn, F.R.S.
                                     Professor Rankine, LL.D.
       J. Scott Russell, F.R.S.
       Admiral Paris, C.B.           J. R. Napier, C.E.

194 REFORT 1860.

   Your Committee, having re-elected Admiral Moorsom to be their Chair-

man, beg leave to present the following Report :
   They have held monthly meetings, with intermediate meetings of sub-

Committees appointed to carry out in detail matters referred to them by the
General Committee. The Committee regret that they were deprived of the
services of one of their members, Mr. Charles Atherton, at an early stage of

the present inquiry, his public duties preventing his attending.

   They have been assisted by Corresponding Members ; noblemen and gentle-
men, who, not being members of your Association, were not, by its rules,
eligible as members of your Committee. Some of them, however, being

owners of steam yachts, and others intimately acquainted with all matters
relating to steam shipping, their cooperation was considered very essential,
as introducing to the Committee gentlemen, not only capable of dealing with

the subjects of this inquiry, but who also had it in their power to place in

the hands of the Committee, materials, which, it is confidently hoped, will
eventually lead to a correct and scientific knowledge of the laws governing

economic Steam-Ship Performance.

   The Corresponding Members so elected were:

Lord Clarence Paget, M.P., C.B., &c.  Capt. William Moorsom, R.N. (since
Lord Alfred Paget, M.P.
Lord John Hay, M.P.                       deceased).
The Hon. L. Agar Ellis, M.P.
The Earl of Gifford, M.P.             Mr. John Elder.
The Marquis of Hartington, M.P.       Mr. David Rowan.
                                      Mr. J. E. Churchward.
Viscount Hill.                        Mr. Thomas Steele.

    It will be within the recollection of the Association that the labours of this
Committee last year were almost exclusively devoted to explaining to the

various shipping companies and others with whom they were in correspond-

ence, the objects proposed, and suggesting such forms as, if accurately filled
in, would accomplish the purposes contemplated by the British Association.
Log-books were prepared, and copies furnished to the leading Steam Packet

Companies.

   At their first meeting the Committee took into consideration the manner
in which the grant of money placed at their disposal by the Association could

be most judiciously applied, and after mature consideration it was unani-
mously resolved :

    " That to procure information from shipbuilders and engineers, it is found
to be indispensable to hold personal intercourse with them, without which
little progress is likely to be made."

   The Honorary Secretary was accordingly deputed to wait upon the prin-
cipal Shipbuilders, Engineei"s, and Steam Shipping Companies in London
and its vicinity, to explain the objects of the Committee, and to solicit their
cooperation by furnishing the Committee with authenticated returns of the

sea performances of vessels, as well as of their trial trips.
    In this your Committee are happy to report that (hey have succeeded. All

to whom application was made expressed concurrence in the objects of your

Committee, and their willingness to render every information in their power.
The great difficulty was to make a suitable selection of vessels as examples
of ordinary performance in the mercantile navy. Press of business, and
perhaps want of thoroughly understanding the aims of the Committee, induced
them to throw the whole labour of making these returns upon the Committee.

The log-books for a number of years, and any documents the Committee

desired to see, were freely placed at their service; but the time required to
ON STEAM-SHIP PERFORMANCE.  195

  wade through the masses of logs, together with the fact of the Association

  meeting this year near]}- three months earlier than usual, rendered it imprac-

  ticable for more than a limited amount of work to be got through. It was
  therefore determined to make a selection of certain vessels, and to endeavour,

  as far as possible, to render complete the record of a few.

     Your Committee at the same time communicated with the Admiralty, with

  a view of instituting a similar comparison between the trial trips and ordinary

 performances of Her Majesty's vessels at sea.

    They much regret that they have not been able to obtain the latter. The

 Lords Commissioners, however, very courteously entrusted the Committee
 with the original returns of Her Majesty's vessels during the years 1857,

 1858, and 1859, as furnished by the officers who conducted such trials, with
 permission to copy and make any use they thought fit of the information

 they contained. Diagrams of the engines taken on the trials during the year
 1859 were also furnished.

    Your Committee must remark with regard to these trial performances, that
 they do not appear to be instituted with any other view than as a trial of the
 working of the engines, excepting in a few instances, when experiments have
 been made to test the merits of certain screws. In very numerous cases, the

 officer distinctly reports that the boiler power is insufficient. The speed
 may or may not be taken at the convenience of the officers, but in no case
 is any note taken of the economical efficiency of the engines with regard to

 fuel.

    As your Committee are restricted to a record of facts, it is out of place
 here to suggest changes in the mode of conducting the trials of Her Majesty's
ships. The Committee would, however, fail in their duty if they did not avail

--themselves of this occasion to repeat their conviction, as expressed in their

last Report, " That it would tend to the advancement of science, the im-

provement of both vessels and engines, and to the great advantage of Her
Majesty's service, if the trials of the Queen's ships were conducted on a more

comprehensive plan, directed to definite objects of practical utility on a
scientific basis, and recorded in a uniform manner."

    In addition to the vessels of the British Royal and Mercantile Navies, your
Committee have great pleasure in being enabled to lay before the British

Association a return of forty-nine vessels in the service of the Messageries

Imperiales of France, obligingly furnished by a member of the Committee,
Admiral Paris, and recorded in the form used by that Company; also, of

two vessels belonging to the United States Navy, the particulars of which
have been extracted from the second volume of Mr. Isherwood's recent
publication, entitled " Engineering Precedents." They have been introduced
into the Tables (see Appendix, Table I.).

    While this Report was preparing, the Committee were gratified by receiv-
ing from Mr. Archbold, Engineer-in-Chief, United States Navy, two sets of
tabulated returns of performance of the United States steam sloop of war
1 Wyoming,' under steam alone, and under steam and sail.

    These returns are of peculiar value, as comprising particulars in a form
which the Committee believe has never yet been published. Along with the
data afforded by Mr. Isherwood's book, they give the area of sail spread and
the force of wind by notation, together with other particulars, useful for
calculations of results and for comparisons.

   These Tables are contained in the Appendix, with Mr. Archbold's letter,
and a description of the hull, engines, and boilers of the ' Wyoming.'

   The returns furnished by the British Admiralty embrace 216 vessels and
353 trials, with about 900 diagrams. For the same reason as above stated, in

                                                                            o2
196 REPORT-- 1860.

case of merchant vessels your Committee were obliged to make a selection,

and to endeavour, for the purposes of the present Report, to obtain a complete
record of a few, in the form suggested by the Committee. With this view,
application was again made to the Admiralty, asking for the additional parti-
culars not embraced in the returns of trial performances already furnished,
and stating that their Lordships were, of course, aware that the particulars
given in those documents were of comparatively small value without others

of the vessels, their engines, screws, and boilers. The Committee added
that they were in possession of such full particulars from both companies and

private firms, and they trusted also to be favoured with similar information

from the Admiralty. To this communication, the Lords Commissioners re-

plied that they regretted they could not at present supply the information
desired; but they would be glad to receive a copy of the reports obtained

from companies and private firms. Your Committee thereupon constructed a
Table embracing the particulars of merchant vessels (Appendix I., Table 1),
and also a blank table filled in with the names of Her Majesty's vessels,
selected as before mentioned, and containing the results of the test trials
 already given, and forwarded them to the Admiralty, begging that they
 might be favoured with the return of the table of the ships of war with the

 blanks filled in, adding, that if pressure of public business should prevent
 that being done, your Committee would send a person to copy the particulars
 on receiving the sanction of the Lords Commissioners to such a course.

    As a measure of precaution in case of failure on the part of the Admiralty

 to send the promised particulars in time for printing, your Committee ob-
 tained returns of the machinery of these vessels by application to the manu-
 facturers, personally and by letter. They avail themselves of this opportunity
 to thank Messrs. Boulton and Watt, Maudslay Sons and Field, and John
 Penn and Sons, for having so fully and so promptly responded to the call.
 They are, therefore, now enabled to lay before the Association a table com-
 prising the results of the trials furnished by the Admiralty, together with the
 particulars of engines, &c, furnished by the manufacturers: the figures in
 Clarendon type (see Appendix I. Table 1) denote the Admiralty returns.

     Your Committee regret that there are some particulars of the trials still
 wanting, as, for example, the evaporation of water and the consumption of

 fuel ; but they believe that hitherto those items have not been recorded. It

 is earnestly hoped, now that public attention has been called to the subject,
 that a more exact and careful account may be taken, both on the measured
  mile and on ordinary service at sea.

     In compiling the Table of merchant vessels, a similar course has been
  adopted, viz. of gathering from the best sources the various details necessary

 to complete the Table. The Companies to which the vessels belonged, gave

  every information in their possession, not only of the vessels themselves, but

 also of their actual sea performances, and placed at the disposal of the Com-
  mittee the sea logs for every voyage, with permission to make such extracts
  as they deemed proper. For any additional information, they were referred
  to the constructors of the engines and vessels. Your Committee cannot

  speak in too high terms of the constant readiness to give information,
  although at considerable inconvenience to themselves, which the various

  Companies and private firms have invariably shown. They feel assured that,
  had time permitted, and if the requisite labour could be devoted to it, the
  whole shipping community would willingly contribute their quota of statistics:
  all that is wanted is uniformity of arrangement, and that a form similar to the
  one proposed by the Committee be generally adopted.

     The thanks of the British Association are especially due to the Royal
ON STEAM-SHIP PERFORMANCE.  197

 Mail Steam Packet Company, to the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, to
 the London and North-Western Railway Company, to Messrs. Inglis Bro-

 thers, Messrs. Randolph and Elder, Messrs. Caird and Co., Messrs. R. Na-
 pier and Sons, and to Captain Walker, of the Board of Trade.

          WT

    Captain alker very obligingly placed at the service of the Committee
some of the books in which the vessels registered and surveyed by the Board
of Trade are recorded, and your Committee are in possession of copies of the

entries of 51 vessels, varying from 600 to 2000 tons register and upwards,

registered in the ports of London, Liverpool, Southampton, and Glasgow,
during 1858. These have formed a very useful guide in leading to a selec-

tion of vessels from which to obtain the particulars requisite for comparison.
    Your Committee have been in communication also with the French and

American ambassadors, with a view to obtaining the statistics of perform-
ance of their respective navies; and, after referring the matter to their home
Governments, the Committee have received the assurance of their willingness

to cooperate.

    Your Committee, being precluded by the terms of their appointment from
discussing theories, or attempting to deduce laws, have, nevertheless, thought
it not inconsistent to prepare a table of ratios based on the indicated horse-
power, and showing the ratio between that element, as developed on the
measured mile, and the grate, the tube, and other heating surfaces of the
boilers producing it; also, between the grate and heating surfaces, and be.
tween the indicated horse-power and the coal consumed. The Committee

regret that this important item, the coal, is not more frequently recorded,
very few private trials making any note of it ; and in no instance brought
under the notice of the Committee, have the Admiralty officers made known

this element, so necessary for ascertaining the efficiency of the boilers (for

Table of Ratios, see Appendix IV. Table 1).
   The following is a general summary of the result of the Committee's

labours during the past session. They have obtained :

   1. Returns of 353 trials by 216 of Her Majesty's vessels of war during the
years 1857, 1858, and 1859, with about 900 (898) diagrams taken during
the trials in 1859; also notes, by the officers conducting the trials, of

observed facts.

   Of these trials, fifty-eight made by seventeen of the vessels, have been

Railway Company, are the mean of a number of trips on actual service be-
tween Holyhead and Kingstown. The returns of the ' Erminia,' 'Admiral,'
' Emerald,' aud ' John Perm,' are measured mile performances only ; but the
remaining 12 vessels, with the exception of the 'Undine,' show their sea
performances over distances of about 6000 consecutive nautical miles each,
in addition to the performances on the measured mile.

   From the above list, it will be readily conceived that the time of the Com-

mittee has been fully occupied, as the task of copying and condensing from
log-books is one involving a large amount of labour. Your Committee have
not therefore, as yet, been enabled to conduct experiments on the plan
recommended in their first Report presented to the Association in Aberdeen.
They have, however, kept that branch of their inquiry in view; and through

the courtesy of Mr. A. P. How, of Mark Lane, and of Messrs, Tylor and
Sons, of Warwick Lane, they have been presented with apparatus of the
value of about £60, consisting of salinometers, and an engine counter and

clock ; they have also at their disposal, for use whenever required, a superior
dynamometer, and a compound stop-watch, and are now prepared to pro-
ceed with experiments, should the Association see fit to renew their powers,
and the consent of the Government be obtained.

   The Committee regret that they have not been able to collect any such

information respecting the performance, under sail alone, of steam- vessels,
as was contemplated by the Association, " with a view to comparing the
results of the two powers of wind and steam, in order to their most effective
and economical combination."

    They must, however, draw attention to the synopsis given by Mr. Isher-

wood, of the steam-log of the ' Niagara,' in which her performances, " under
steam alone," " under steam and fore-and-aft sails," and " under steam and
square sails combined," are set forth in such manner that those conversant

with the subject will be enabled, without much difficulty, to assign its approxi-

mate value to the power of the sails alone.
    In Mr. Archbold's Table of the performance of the ' Wyoming,' the addi-

tional particulars of the force of the wind by notation, the area of sail set,
and the indicated horse-power, which are not always stated in Mr. Isher-
wood's synopsis, afford the means of tolerably accurate comparison.

    It is a duty the Committee owe to themselves, to express thus publicly
        ON STEAM-SHIP PERFORMANCE.                                                   199

their sense of the services rendered to the Association by Mr. Henry Wright,
their Honorary Secretary, whose untiring energy, indefatigable labours, judg-
ment, and discretion, have enabled them to lay this information before the

meeting.

   To Mr. Smith, a member of the Committee, their acknowledgements are
due, as well for the use of a room in his offices, as for several sources of

information opened to them by his influence.
   The Marquis of Stafford, by placing a room in his house at the disposal

of the Committee for occasional meetings, has contributed materially to the
personal convenience of the members.

   It was originally intended to institute inquiries, not only in London and its
vicinity, but also in Glasgow, Liverpool, Hull, Bristol, Southampton, New-
castle-on-Tyne, &c, and for this purpose it would have been necessary to

defray the expenses of an agent to conduct the inquiry ; but the shortness

of the session, together with the extended field which London presents, ren-

dered that course impracticable.

   Your Committee feel, that a beginning having thus been made towards the
means of a scientific investigation of the performance of ships under differ-
ing conditions at sea and in smooth water, it would ill become the British
Association for the Advancement of Science to drop the question, although

expense as well as trouble is involved in its successful pursuit.

They recommend the reappointment of a Committee, with a renewal of

the grant, and with power to remunerate a clerk for such services as cannot

be undertaken by any of its members.

                On behalf of the Committee,

                                      C. R. Moorsom, Vice- Admiral,

  --Note. Since the above Report was written, and whilst in the press, infor-

mation was forwarded to the Committee which has enabled them to compile the
Table given in the Supplementary Appendix, showing very interesting com-
parative results of two vessels, the 'Lima' and ' Bogota,' when fitted with
different systems of machinery. The Table shows the results of perform-
ances on trial of these vessels when fitted with single-cylinder engines, and
also at sea on a voyage of upwards of 6000 miles ; also their performances
when fitted with double-cylinder engines.

ance of the U. S. Steam-sloop ' Wyoming,' under steam alone, and under

steam and sail, on the passage from Philadelphia to Valparaiso, Chili, col-

lated from the logs of the engineer department of the ship.

I am unable to give you any account of her performances under sail alone,

as in these logs no note of the sail is made when not under steam, and the

ship's logs are not sent to the Navy Department until the end of the cruise.

No trial of the ship was made in smooth water uninfluenced by sea from

Wewhich any data of value can be obtained.  do not try our ships at the

measured mile, the guarantees required of the contractors of the machinery

being on performances at sea, and for an extended length of time. The re-

sults for each day, as shown by the abstracts, are not assumed to be strictly

correct, as the data from which they are calculated are taken from the ordi-

nary observations of the engine-room, subject to errors and inaccuracies

unavoidable when the observers are so many, on duty for so short a time,
and when attention is necessarily engrossed for the greater portion of the

time in the care of the machinery. But as the errors are as likely to be on

the one side of the truth as the other, the average and means will not be far

from correct.

Indicator diagrams were not found in the logs for each day, which will

account for the omissions in some of the columns, and there was but one set

taken during each twenty-four hours. The horse-power for the day was cal-

culated from these diagrams, correcting for the average revolutions for the

day ; and the horse-power for those days during which no diagrams were
taken, is calculated from those taken on days when the circumstances of wind

and sea were as nearly similar as could be found. The force of wind is

--expressed in our logs by numbers, as follows: 0, for calm ; 1, light air;

2, light breeze ; 3, gentle breeze ; 4, moderate breeze ; 5, fresh topgallant

breeze ; 6, strong single-reefed topsail breeze ; 7, moderate gale, or double-

reefed topsails ; 8, fresh gale, or three-reefed topsails ; 9, strong gale, or

close-reefed topsails and reefed courses ; 10, heavy gale, or close-reefed

maintopsails and reefed trysails; 11, storm trysails, or storm staysails; 12,
hurricane, or when no sail would stand.

   In the column headed " cut-off," the figures indicate the distance in inches

the steam followed the piston.

The apparent discrepancy in the consumption of coal for the days between

October 25 and 31 inclusive, and some of the columns of which the coal

was the dividend, arises from the distilling apparatus having been in use,

making fresh water for ship's use; the amount of fuel due to the water

freshened having been deducted before dividing. It should be remarked, in

justice to our system of surface condensing, that the vacuum shown by these

abstracts is not so good by from 10 to 12 per cent, as has been obtained by

the same engines on former occasions, or by condensers of the same class in

other ships.

I trust you will find in the abstracts everything necessary to the object

you have in view, and you may depend upon the truthfulness of the result

Interim Rejwii on the Gauging of Water by Triangular Notches.

                                                                                                           23rd June, 1860.

  --Dear Sir, With reference to the experiments on the gauging of water

by its flow in triangular notches, authorized by the General Committee at
Abeideen, I have to report, for the information of the Association, that, as
they have to be carried on in the open air in a field adjacent to a waterfall
at several miles distance from home, and as they require the formation of
ponds and the construction of measuring tanks, sluices, &c, and involve

careful and repeated observations continued often through whole days, fine

summer weather free from both rain and wind is almost quite essential, and

winter weather is peculiarly unsuitable. For these reasons, and on account

of my duties at Queen's College here, I could not enter on the construction

of the experimental works until the close of the College Session, which
occurred only on the 9th inst. I have now, however, got the principal parts
of the works constructed, and have got preliminary trials made, but I have
found it impossible to have the final experiments ready for the very early
Meeting of the Association which occurs in the present year. For these

experiments a grant of £10 was placed at my disposal ; and in order to meet

the costs already incurred, of which some, from the nature of the case, are at

present uncertain, I now apply to the Treasurer for the whole amount of the

grant, for which I shall account at next year's Meeting, giving at that meet-

ing my report on the experiments now in progress.

I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully,

                                                   James Thomson.

                                         NOTICE.

The following lists have been prepared in conformity with the desire of the

Committee of the Natural History Section of the British Association for the

Advancement of Science, which, at my suggestion, recommended the appoint-
ment of a general Dredging Committee, with a liberal grant of money for

the carrying out of its objects.

   It is intended to place these lists in the hands of the local Dredging Com-

mittees and naturalists engaged in researches in the most important districts

of the coasts of Great Britain and Ireland, with a request that they may be

returned, with notes on the conditions under which each species of the par-
ticular district has been found, and memoranda of such additional species as

may be obtained. By this means it is hoped to collect local lists of great

interest, and materials for a more complete catalogue of the Invertebrate
Fauna of the British Seas. In the preparation of the present lists, I have
been assisted by Dr. Baird and Mr. S. Woodward and other members of the
Dredging Committee. The catalogue of Mollusca is taken from the work
of Messrs. Forbes and Hanley ; that of Crustacea has been obligingly fur-
nished by Mr. Spcnce Bate; of Radiata by Mr. Stuart, of the KoyafCollege

Dr. Johnston, of Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Address by the Rev. Prof. Price, M.A., F.R.S., President of the Section.

AGentlemen,-- custom has prevailed at our Meetings for some years for the Pre-
sident of each Section to make a short address at the opening. The object of it I
take to be twofold; first, to explain to new members the nature of the business which
we have to transact; and, secondly, to suggest to all the course of procedure, and
the distribution of subject most convenient for the conduct of our business. The
area of scientific research which this Section covers is very large, larger perhaps
than that of any other; and its subjects vary so much, that while to some of

those who frequent this room certain papers may appear dull, yet to others thev
will be full of interest. There are many and very good reasons why these subjects
should be grouped. Some of them possess, probably in the highest degree attain-
able by the human intellect, the characteristics of perfect and necessary science
while                                                                                                                                                      ;
       others  are  at  present  little  more  than  a  conglomeration
                                                                        of observations, made
indeed with infinite skill and perseverance, and of the greatest value ; capable
probably in time of greater perfection, nay, perhaps, of most perfect forms, but as
vet in their infancy, scarcely indicating the process by which that maturity will
Webe arrived at, and containing hardly the barest outline of their ultimate laws"
have indeed sciences intermediate to these two extremes, in which some of the laws
are already capable of mathematical expression, and from which residts have been
derived, and still many phenomena are as yet not brought within their comprehen-
sion. But as all subjects which we regard in this Section are of one type, so are
they rightly combined; and it will be, I venture to think, an evil day for natural
knowledge, when we cease to regard the forms of the sciences of space, number,
Nowand^ motion, as those to which all others ought to assimilate themselves.

           first of all in our Section stand Mathematics, both pure and applied. These,
indeed, require very heavy and arduous study, inasmuch as thev have peculiar
nomenclature, language, and processes, and thus it is only to the few generally who
have made them their particular study that they oiler great interest. Mathematics
have also  now become so large in their grasp
                                                        and so curious in their  details, that I
am, 1 am   sure, only expressing the opinions                                    I say that the

whole of a man's life is not sufficient for more than one branch of it. Indeed

and we are proud to say so, some members of this Association are devotino- whole'
lives, and intellects too of the highest order, to the advancement of our knowledge
in a particular direction. Take, for instance, the theory of homogeneous forms
in the history of science the names of Boole, Cavlev, * Sylvester will always be
recorded, and in scientific treatises their labours will find a place. Or take again
the theory of elliptic functions, or the calculus of probabilities ; the difficulties of
these subjects require the utmost tension of the human mind, and even then thev
transcend its limits. To many of the usual attendants on this Section, these and
kindred subjects may be dry and uninteresting. Well, if they are so to any of you
i must beg you to bear with us for a short time; these things have a deep "and

significant meaning ; and be assured too that they are not uninteresting to all ; to

many they give the purest pleasure ; and I must ask you not to grudge them that
during the few papers on the higher mathematics which we shall probably have.

In passing, too, I would remind you that very frequently our knowledge of natural
phenomena depends on certain integrals, the properties of which can only be

studied with a profound knowledge of the higher mathematics; and thus the pro-
gress of one branch of knowledge depends on another, and is frequently stopped by

 our ignorance of that.

   To most of us, probably, the questions of applied mathematics will have greater

interest ; we are more familiar with the laws of nature, the mathematical interpre-
tation of which, mixed mathematics, as they are called, take cognizance of ; we

 most eagerly catch at the results of those laws. Consider the Newtonian law of
 gravitation in its most general form ; in its highest development in the lunar and

planetary theories, a dry mathematical paper will thin our room; an astronomical

paper will often fill it ; and now too, perhaps, more than heretofore ; for our
interest in the subject has been keenly aroused of late. The lunar disturbances
have been, as you know, calculated with greater precision, and new results have

 been arrived at, which exhibit certain discrepancies relatively to the old. I

need do no more than allude to what has lately taken place at our own Royal
Astronomical Society and at the French Academy ; and express a hope that we
 shall have some communication on this subject from those who are here present, and

 are so well qualified to give it. Mathematicians, however, have been startled by

 an announcement that " what is commonly called mathematical evidence is not so
certain as many persons imagine; and that it ultimately depends on moral evidence ;"
 and moreover we are told that the " results of long and complicated mathematical
 calculations are not more than probably true." This we can hardly believe; it
 takes us quite by surprise, and we hope for further light ; if, however, we must
 wait for light, we must wait patiently; let us not forestal a conclusion which many
 of us venture to think is as yet, not to say more, unproved ; let us wait for the
 new lunar theories, which are as yet unpublished, and for the new lunar tables,

which are the results of these theories. I am told, however, already that Baron

 Plana has corrected his calculations, and that he finds the results arrived at by

Delaunay and Adams to be in accordance with his amended formula?. These new

 lunar calculations have taken us by surprise ; but again I would say let us wait,

 "magna est Veritas et praevalebit."

   We are desirous, so far as is possible consistently with the convenience of con-

 tributors, to take the papers on mathematical subjects on the early days of our

 meeting ; and we shall be glad therefore if members who have papers on these sub-
jects will announce them to the Secretaries without delay. And before I proceed

 further, we have a debt to pay, due by the cultivators of these branches of science,

--to those who have lately contributed reports on particular parts of our science to

 the British Association; to Mr. Cayley for his report on the present state of
 Theoretical Dynamics, and to Mr. Smith for the first part of his report on the

 Theory of Numbers. It is only they who have had to go through the existing

 literature in any one problem, say the Lagrangian equations, or the theory of the
 motion of a material system, that can form an adequate value of such papers a3

 those I refer to: the literature is catalogued, indexed, and analysed; we know

 thereby all that has been done up to a certain point, and in our subsequent inves-

Wetigations our commencement starts from the close of other men's labours.

 are hereby prevented from travelling over other men's ground ; and we avoid that

 most unsatisfactory plagiarism of them, " qui nostra ante nos dixerunt." Vast and

various are the benefits of our Association ; but I am inclined to consider as one of

 the greatest, the series of valuable reports which our published volumes contain
 and those last reports to which I have referred, for their learning, their deep re-
 search, their comprehensive views of the theories explained in them, will maintain

 the character shared by their predecessors. While we lament the loss of Dr. Pea-

 cock and others, to whom we owe the very able reports contained in the early

 volumes of our proceedings, we are proud to have worthy successors in our present

 talented contributors.

   We propose, next in order, to take those papers which treat of subjects within the

 grasp of mathematical symbols, at least partially, if not wholly; those whose laws

are sufficiently general for functional symbols, and from particular forms of which

by mathematical processes other truths may be derived. Such are the subjects of

Light, Heat, Sound, Electricity, Magnetism ; we propose to take these subjects in

Wethe latter days of this week, and the first day of next.                                                                                                         shall, of course, con-

sult the convenience of contributors ; but it will tend, we think, to the orderly

arrangement of our business if this order can be adopted. Vast indeed in their

subjects are these sciences; and as discoveries are being daily made in them,
we have a right to expect some interesting communications, either in the way

of mathematical deduction from received laws, or as mathematical explana-

tions of observed phenomena, or as simple experiments. I cannot help observing

here the advantage of combining these sciences in the same Section with pure

--mathematics ; it seems to indicate that the laws of all are to be brought to the

same test, to the never-failing, to the unerring accuracy of measurement and num-

ber                 we             show                                          hereby                    the     character  of the    knowledge   we     are  in  search  of;  not  for-
                 ;

tuitous observation, but precise laws. The mind will wander in its imagination
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

there is, indeed, no boundary to it ; once, however, bring it back to the severe test
of number and weight and" measurement, and the discovery or the observation

becomes valuable for its precision ; it thus leads to general laws, and sound mathe-

matical reasoning derives from them the results they are pregnant with.
   And, finally, we come to the facts of meteorology and its kindred subjects, many

of which are scarcely yet brought within any law at all ; analogies have been traced,

and concurrent events have been indicated in many cases ; little, however, has been

done towards a satisfactory proof of a connexion between cause and effect. It is

true that curves are traced, which purport to exhibit these effects ; and they do so
most graphically ; but, as mathematicians say, these curves are traced only hyjmints,

and the law is not known, or, in other words, we do not know the equation of the

curve                              so  long                                      as   this                     is the case, our knowledge lacks            precision.   These papers,
                                ;

however, are frequently valuable, because they supply us with accurately observed

facts, which will doubtless hereafter be brought within a law. This, however, I

suppose at present to be the state of the case ; but we must not despise the lesser

light because we have not the greater. I cannot pass over this class of papers (papers

of observed facts) without alluding to the loss which we all feel in the death of the

late able Professor of Geometry, Professor Baden Powell. For some years past

has he continued his reports on the meteors or falling stars, or whatever you call

them                               this year we have his last report, which, indeed, he has not lived to finish,
                              ;

but has been placed in the hands of Mr. Glaisher, and completed by him. In

some of these subjects we shall, I hope, obtain large accessions to our knowledge.

Some few years ago I remember reading a complaint made by an eminent philo-

sopher on the decay of mathematical knowledge in Great Britain, and especially in

that of physico-mathematical knowledge. It is not my duty to make invidious

distinctions                                                                     but I am sure I am repeating the now common opinion of foreigners
                                                                              ;

when I tell you that that complaint was made in quite the infancy of some of

our older philosophers, and before the days of Cayley, Sylvester,' Boole, Mac-
cullagh, Stokes, W. Thomson, and Adams. To this revival of science amongst
us, doubtless, many causes have contributed ; and I believe that the periodical nieet-

ings of this Association have done good service towards that revival ; we have

hereby become acquainted with others who are engaged in the same pursuits as our-

selves, and stores of knowledge are communicated. Let us, however, bear in mind

that our Association is formed for the advancement of science, and that we do not
meet to hear of old things again in the old form; our motto is "progress." Old

things we do not discard, for they may be put before us in new forms : but we meet

especially to promote the advance of the boundaries of natural knowledge, and we ask
mour members and others to lay before us the results of their investigations. And not

only the papers which shall be read, but also in the elucidation of any difficulties
which authors may favour us with, and in the discussions which it is my duty to
invite you to take upon these papers, will additions to our knowledge be made ·
and many remarks will, I venture to think, be made pregnant with matter for
thoughtful meditation hereafter. In all these discussions difference of opinion

--4< REPORT i860.

On some Solutions of the Problem of Tactions of Apollonius of Perga by

        means of Modern Geometry. By Dr. Brennecke, of Posen.

   The author suggested a new solution, depending on a remarkable property of the

centres of similitude of three given circles; e. y. a circle described around an exter-
nal centre of similitude, with a radius equal to the geometrical proportional of its
potential distances from the two circles, intersects all homogeneously touching circles
orthogonally (around an internal centre all heterogeneously touching circles). Such

a circle is called a potential circle. To get the two circles which touch the three
given circles simultaneously internally or externally, take two external centres of
similitude, draw the two potential circles, find their radical axis, which will contain
the centre of similitude of the two circles which cut the three given circles in the
same time externally or internally. By combining the three external centres of
similitude, you find three potential circles and three radical axes, which all three
coincide. Having found this straight line, which contains the centres, it is easy to

find the centres themselves by introducing a fourth circle, the reflected mirror-image
as it were of any of the three given circles, by means of the found radical axis, and
finding out the two circles which touch the two symmetrical circles and anyone of

     On the Relations between Hyperconic Sections and Elliptic Integrals.

                  By the Rev. James Booth, LL.D., F.R.S.

    In this communication the author extended the analogies that the Continental and
English geometers had established between elliptic integrals of the third order under
the circular form, and the arcs of spherical conic sections, to the corresponding rela-
tions between elliptic integrals of the third order and logarithmic form to the arcs of

curves described in the surface of a paraboloid.

On Curves of the Fourth Order having Three Double Points.

                     By A. Cayley, F.R.S.

The paper is a short notice only of researches which the author is engaged in

Awith reference to curves of the fourth order having three double points.  curve

of the kind in question is derived from a conic by the well-known transformation of

substituting for the original trilinear coordinates their reciprocals ; and the species of

the curve of the fourth order depends on the position of the conic with respect to the

fundamental triangle.

On the Roots of Substitutions. By the Rev. T. P. Kirkman, A.M., F.R.S.

To determine the number of roots of a given degree, of a substitution 6 made with

An letters, and of the rth order.  substitution 6 which has not two circular factors

of the same order, has no roots which are not found among the series

of its powers.

  A substitution which has two or more circular factors of the same order, will have

roots of an order superior to its own, and therefore not among its power.
   Thus the substitution of the 3rd order made with 9 elements,

On a new Proof of Pascal's Theorem. By the Rev. T. Rennison, M.A.

             On Systems of Indeterminate Linear Equations.
By H. J. Stephen Smith, M.A., Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford.

The object of this communication was to point out the connexion which exists

between particular solutions of indeterminate linear equations, and their most gene-

ral solution. The principle upon which this connexion depends may be explained in

a very particular case. Let the sytem of indeterminate equations reduce itself to the

single equation

                           Ax+By + Cz=0,                                                                    (1)

in which we may suppose A, B, C to have no common divisor ; let also a, b, c and

a', b', c' be two different solutions of that equation in integral numbers ; then, if the

three numbers

                           -- -- --bc' b'c, ca' ac', ab' a'b                                                (2)

admit of no common divisor, the complete solution of the indeterminate equation is

contained in the formulae

                                     =x at+a'u, 1

                                     y=bt+b'u,\                                                             (3)

                                     +Z=ct c'u,
                                                                                           )

in which t and u are absolutely indeterminate integral numbers ; but if the condi-

tion (2) be not satisfied, the formula? (3) will not represent all, but only some of the

solutions of the equation (1). If, therefore, by any method, as for example that of

Euler, we have arrived at formula of the type of the formulas (3), which demonstra-
bly contain the complete solution of the indeterminate equation, we may be certain

that the three numbers analogous to the numbers (2) admit of no common divisor.

Thus, by applying Euler's method of solution, which is explained in most books of

=algebra, to the indeterminate equation Ax+By-±-Cz 0, we obtain the solution of a

celebrated problem, first considered by Gauss in the 'Disquisitiones Arithmetical,'

of which the following is the enunciation.
   " Given 3 numbers A, B, C, to find six others,

such that                                a, b, c,
                                         a', b', c',
                 =A bc'-b'c,                                                                  C=ab' -a'b."
                                     B=ca'-ac',

Other methods more symmetrical, and perhaps not more tedious than that of Euler,
were also suggested in this paper for the treatment of indeterminate equations, and
for the resolution of an important class of arithmetical problems which depend on
those equations in the manner just explained.

On a Generalization of Poncelot's TJieorems for the Linear Representation

    of Quadratic Radicals. By Professor Sylvester, M.A., F.R.S.

The author explained the application of Poncelet's theorems, to practical ques-

tions of mechanics in the case of forces acting in a single plane as in the theory of

bridges.

   He next referred to the mode of extension of this theorem, suggested by Poncelet,

applicable to the case of forces in space, and pointed out its insufficiency, and, in a

certain sense, its incorrectness.

   The essential preliminary question to be resolved in the first instance (after which
the matter became one of easy calculation), was shown to be that of cutting off by

a plane the smallest possible segment of a sphere that should contain the whole of a

given set of points lying on the sphere's surface. Some years ago Prof. Sylvester

had proposed in the * Quarterly Mathematical Journal,' without any suspicion of

--its having any practical applications, the following question : " Given a set of points

in a plane to draw the smallest possible circle that should contain them all." By a

singular coincidence, Professor Pierce, of Cambridge University, U.S., had studied

this question and obtained a complete solution of it, which he had communicated to

Athe author during the present meeting of the British Association.                                                                       slight con-

sideration served to show that precisely the same solution as Professor Pierce had

found for the problem of points in a plane was applicable with a merely nominal

change to the sphere also ; and thus the solution of a question set almost in sport
was found to supply an essential link for the complete development of a method of

considerable importance in practical mechanics. The author stated that it would

be easy to draw up tables of the values of the constants appearing in the linear

function, representing the resultant of three forces at right angles to one another,

for the principal cases likely to occur in practice, the values of these constants

depending solely upon the condition of relative magnitude to which the component

forces are supposed to be subjected.

On some Optical Illusions connected with the Inversion of Perspective.
                 By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.

The term "Inversion of Perspective" has been applied to a class of optical

illusions, well known and easily explained, in which depressions are turned into

elevations, and elevations into depressions. One of the most remarkable cases of

this kind, which has not yet been explained, presented itself to the late Lady

Gcorgiana Wolf, and has been recorded by her husband Dr. Wolf. When she was

riding on a sand-beach in Egypt, all the footprints of horses appeared as elevations,

in place of depressions, in the sand. No particulars are mentioned, in reference to

the place of the sun, or the nature of the siu'rounding objects, to enable us to form

any conjecture respecting the cause of this phenomenon. Having often tried to see

this illusion, I was some time ago so fortunate as not only to observe it myself, but

to show it to others. In walking along the west sands of St. Andrews, the foot-
prints, both of men and of horses, appeared as elevations. In a short time they

sank into depressions, and subsequently rose into elevations. The sun was at this

time not very far from the horizon,   on the right hand                                                                      and on the  left there  were
                                                                                                                          ;

large waves of the sea breaking into very bright foam. The only explanation which

occurred to me was, that the illusion appeared when the observer supposed that

the footprints were illuminated with the light of the breakers, and not by the sun.

Having, however, more recently observed the phenomenon, when the sun was very

high on the right, and the breakers on the left very distant, and consequently very
8 REPORT 1860.

faint, I could not consider the preceding explanation as well-founded. Upon
attending to the circumstances under which they were now seen, I observed that
the human footprints were all covered with dry sand that had been blown into them,
so that they were much brighter than the surrounding sand, and than the dark side

of the impression next the sun ; and hence it is probable that they appeared to be
nearer the eye than the dark sand in which they were formed, and consequently eleva-

tions. After repeated examinations of them, I found the footprints appeared as
elevations as far as the eye could see them ; and they were equally visible with one

or both eyes. But whenever the eye rested for a little while on the nearest foot-

print, it resumed its natural concavity.
   I have observed other illusions of this kind, which are more easily explained,

though they differ from any hitherto described. In the Church of Saint Agostino
in Rome, there is above each arch a painted festoon suspended on two short pil-
lars; but instead of appearing in relief, as the painter intended, by shading the one

side of them, they appeared concave, like an intaglio. In other positions in the

church they rose into relief. Upon a subsequent visit to the church, I found that
the festoon, or suspended wreath, was concave when it was illuminated, or rather
when the observer saw that it was illuminated, b)' a window beneath it, and in re-
lief when the eye saw that it was illuminated by a window above it, the object
being similarly illuminated in both cases. In the common cases of inverted per-
spective, the eye is deceived by looking at the inversion of the shadow in the
cameo or intaglio itself; but in the present case the eye is deceived by perceiving
that the body painted, supposed to be in relief, is illuminated by a light either above

or below it.

   An optical illusion of a different kind presented itself to me in the Church of

Santa Giustina at Padua. Upon entering the church we see three cupolas. The
one beneath which we stood appeared very shallow ; the next appeared much
deeper, and the third deeper still. They were all, however, of the same depth, as
we ascertained by placing ourselves under each in succession, and observing that it

was always the shallowest.

             On Microscopic Vision, and a Neiv Form of 3Iicroscope.

                    By Sir David Brewster, K.H., F.R.S.

la studying the influence of aperture on the images of bodies as formed in the

camera, by lenses or mirrors, it occurred to me that in microscopic vision it might

exercise a still more injurious influence. Opticians have recently exerted their

skill in producing achromatic object-glasses for the microscope with large angles

of aperture. In 1848 the late distinguished optician, Mr. Andrew Ross, asserted

" that 135° was the largest angular pencil that could be passed through a micro-

scopic object-glass," and yet in 1855 he had increased it to 170° ! while some

observers speak of angular apertures of 175°. In considering the influence of aper-

ture, we shall suppose that an achromatic object-glass with an angle of aperture

of 170° is optically perfect, representing every object without colour and without

Whenspherical aberration.  the microscopic object is a cube, we shall see five of

its faces ; and when it is a sphere or a cylinder, we shall see nine-tenths or more of its

Howcircumference.  then does it happen that large apertures exhibit objects which

are not seen when small apertures with the same focal length are employed ?

This superiority is particularly shown with test-objects marked with grooves or

ridges, and obliquely illuminated. The marginal part of the lens will enlarge the

grooves and ridges, and they will thus be rendered visible, not because they are

seen more distinctly, but because they are expanded by the combination of their in-

--coincident images. Hence we have an explanation of the fact well known to all
--who use the microscope, that objects are seen more distinctly with object-glasses

of small angular aperture. In the one case we have, with the same magnifying

power, not only an enlarged and indistinct image of objects, but a false representa-

tion of them, from which their true structure cannot be discovered ; while in the

other we have a smaller and distinct image, and a more correct representation of

the object.

But these are not the only objections to large angular apertures and short focal

lengths. 1. In the first place, it is extremely difficult to illuminate objects when
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                 9

so close to the object-glass. 2. There is a great loss of light, from its oblique in-

--cidence on the surface "of the first lens. 3. The surface of glass, with the most
--perfect polish, must be covered with minute pores, produced by the attrition of

the polishing powder ; and light, falling upon the sides of these pores with extreme

obliquity, must not only suffer diffraction, but be refracted less perfectly than when

Whenincident at a less angle. 4.  the object is almost in contact with the anterior

lens, the microscope is wholly unfit for researches in which mechanical or che-

mical operations are required, and also for the examination of objects enclosed in

minerals or other transparent bodies. 5. In object-glasses now in use, the rays

of light must pass through a great thickness of glass of doubtful homogeneity. It

is a question yet to be solved whether or not a substance can be truly transparent,

-- --in which the elements are not united in definite proportion, in which the sub-

stances combined have very different refractive and dispersive powers ; and in

which the particles are so loosely united that they separate from one another, as in

the various kinds of decomposition to which glass is liable.

   If the best microscopes are affected by these sources of error, every exertion

should be made to diminish or remove them. 1. The first step, we conceive, is

to abandon large angular apertures, and to use object-glasses of moderate focal

length, effecting at the eye-glass any additional magnifying power that may be re-

quired. 2. In order to obtain a better illumination, either by light incident verti-

cally or obliquely, a new form of the microscope would be advantageous. In place of
directing the microscope to the object itself, placed as it now is almost touching

the object-glass, let it be directed to an image of the object, formed by the thinnest

achromatic lens, of such a focal length that the object may be an inch or more

from the lens, and its image equal to, or greater, or less than the object. In this

way the observer will be able to illuminate the object, whether opake or trans-
parent, and may subject it to any experiments he may desire to make upon it. It
may thus be studied without a covering of glass, and when its parts are developed
by immersion in a fluid. 3. The sources of error arising from the want of perfect

polish and perfect homogeneity of the glass of which the lenses are composed, are,

--to some extent, hypothetical ; but there are reasons for believing,--and these

reasons corroborated by facts, that a body whose ingredients are united by fusion,

and kept in a state of constraint from which they are striving to get free, cannot

possess that homogeneity of structure, or that perfection of polish, which will allow

the rays of light to be refracted and transmitted without injurious modifications. If

glass is to be used for the lenses of microscopes, long and careful annealing should

be adopted, and the polishing process should be continued long after it appears

Weperfect to the optician.  believe, however, that the time is not distant when trans-

parent minerals, in which their elements are united in definite proportions, will be
substituted for glass. Diamond, topaz, and rock-crystal are those which appear

best suited for lenses. The white topaz of New Holland is particularly fitted for
optical purposes, as its double refraction may he removed by cutting it in plates

perpendicular to one of its optical axes. In rock-crystal the structure is, generally

speaking, less perfect along the .axis of double refraction than in any other direc-

tion, but this imperfection does not exist in topaz.

           On the decomposed Glass found at Nmeveh and other places.

                    By Sir David Brewster, K.H., JF.R.S.

   The different kinds of glass which are in common use, consist of sand or silex

combined by fusion with earths or alkalies, or metals which either act as fluxes, or
communicate different colours or different degrees of lustre or refractive power to

the combination.

   In quartz or rock-crystal, which is pure silex, and in other regularly crystallized
bodies, the molecules or atoms unite in virtue of regular laws, the pole of one atom
uniting with the pole of another. Such substances, therefore, do not decompose
under the ordinary action of the elements. The lens of Hock- Crystal, for example,

found bjr Mr. Layard at Nineveh, is as sound as it was many thousand years ago
when in the form of a crystal.

   In the case of glass, however, the silex has been melted and forced into union
10 REPORT 1860.

with other bodies to which it has no natural affinity ; and therefore its atoms,
which have their similar poles lying in every possible direction, have a constant

tendency to recover their crystalline position as when in a state of silex. For the
same reason, the earths, alkalies and metals, with which the atoms of silex have

been constrained by fusion to enter into union, all tend to resume their crystalline

position and separate themselves from the silex.

   Owing to the manner in which melted glass is cooled and annealed, whether it
is made by flashing or blowing, or moulding, the cohesion of its parts is not the
same throughout the nias3 ; and consequently its particles are held together with

Audifferent degrees of force, varying in relation to points, lines, and surfaces.
atom of the flux, or other ingredient, may be less firmly united to an atom of silex

in one place than in another, depending on the degree of heat by which they were

combined, or upon the relative positions of the poles of the atoms themselves when

combined. There are some remarkable cases where flint-glass without any rude

exposure to the elements has become opake, and I have seen specimens iu 'which

the disintegration had commenced a few years after it was made. In general, how-

ever, the process is very slow, excepting in stables, where the prevalence of am-
monia hastens the decomposition and produces all the beautiful colours of the

soap-bubble. It is, however, from among the ruins of ancient buildings that glass

is found in all the stages of decomposition ; and there is perhaps no material body

that ceases to exist with such grace and beauty, when it surrenders itself to time

and not to disease.

   In damp localities, where acids and alkalies prevail in the soil, the glass rots as

it were by a process which, owing to the opacity of the rotten part, it is difficult to

study, it may be broken between the Angers of an infant ; and we often find in the

middle of the fragment a plate of the original glass which has not yielded to the

process of decay.

In dry localities, where Eoman, Greek, and Assyrian glass has been found, the

process of decomposition is exceedingly interesting," and its resvdts singularly beau-

tiful. At one or more points in the surface of the glass the decomposition begins.

Itextends round that point in spherical surfaces so that the first film is a minute

hemispherical cup of exceeding thinness. Film after film is formed in a similar

manner, till perhaps twenty or thirty are crowded into the 50th of an inch. They
now resemble the section of a pearl or of an onion, and as the films are still glass,

the colours of thin plates are seen when we look down through their edges which

form the surface of the glass. These thin edges, however, being exposed to the

elements, suffer decomposition. The particles of silex and the other ingredients
now readily separate, and the decomposition goes on downwards in films parallel

to the surface of the glass, the crystals of silex in one specimen forming a white

ring, and the other ingredients rings of a different colour. ( See the Figure.)

Such is the process round one point, but the decomposition commences at many

points, and generally these points lie in lines, so that the circles of decomposition

meet one another and form sinuous lines. When there are only two points, these

circles, when they meet, surround the two points of decomposition like the rings

round two knots of wood                                                                                                                        and in like  manner, when there are  many points,  and
                                                                                                                                            ;

these points near each other, the curves of decomposition unite as already mentioned,

and form sinuous lines. When the decomposition is uniform and the little hemi-

spheres have nearly the same depth, we can separate the upper film from the one

below it, the convexities of the one falling into the concavities of the other.

This general description was illustrated bv drawings on the table, all of which

were executed by Miss Mary King, of Ballylin, now the Hon. Mrs. Ward.

But beautiful and correct as these drawings are, they convey a very imperfect

idea of the brilliant colours and singular forms which characterize glass in a parti-

cular stage of its decomposition, and of the optical phenomena which it exhibits in
common and polarized light.

When the decomposition has gone regularly on round a single point, and there

is no other change, a division of the glass into a number of hemispherical films

within one another takes place, the group of films exhibiting in the microscope cir-

cular cavities, which under different circumstances become elliptical and polygonal.

In saltwater the decomposition of glass goes on more rapidly, as I have found in
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                11

examining one of the bottles brought up in the wreck of the ' Royal George ;' and the

same effect may be produced by a quicker process. M. Brame*, of Paris, having

seen a notice of the decomposed glass from Nineveh which I read at the xlssociation

some years ago, succeeded in producing, in a very short time, regular and irregular

circles of decomposition, in the centre of which there was always a small cavity or

nucleus. This effect was obtained by immersing fragments of thick glass in a

mixture of fluoride of calcium and concentrated sulphuric acid, or by exposing

them to the action of the vapour of fluorhydrique acid.

Such are some of the general phenomena of decomposed glass when seen by light

reflected from its exposed  surfaces                                  but when we  separate  the films  and  examine
                                                                   ;

--them in the microscope, either by common or polarized light, a series of phenomena

are seen of the most beautiful kind, so various and so singular that it would be a
Avain attempt to describe them.
                                                                      general idea of them, however, may be obtained

from the drawings, and from a description of three varieties of these films.

 --I. The first of these varieties has rough surfaces, the roughness arising from

an almost infinite number of hemispherical cavities on one side of the film, and

Whenhemispherical convexities on the other side.                                   these cavities are separated by

flat portions of the film, they are perfectly circular but when they are crowded
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

together, they are irregularly polygonal, the sides of the polygons forming a sort of

network, the cavities or convexities forming the meshes of the net.

The convex and concave surfaces are not rough but specular, and reflect and

transmit white light, exhibiting none of the colours of thin plates.

In polarized light, each of the cavities, whether circular or polygonal, act as

negative uniaxal crystals, exhibiting by the interference of the refracted and trans-

mitted pencils the black cross, and the white of the jirst order in Newton's scale,

rising sometimes to yellow or falling to the palest blue, or disappearing altogether,

according to the number or curvature of the films which compose it.

II. The second variety of these films has perfectly specidar surfaces, in conse-

quence of having almost no cavities. They exhibit in common light, and in a very

beautifid manner, the colours of thin plates, the transmitted being complementary to

the reflected light. This variety is exceedingly rare. In a specimen on the table

the reflected light is blue and the transmitted yellow. In some of the fragments a

few insulated circular cavities with the black cross occur, the tints which surround

it being modified by the general tint of the film.

III. The third variety of decomposed glass consists of films containing cavities of

all sizes and forms, from the 30th of an inch to such a size that they are hardly

visible by the microscope, giving to the film which they compose a sort of stippled

appearance, or an imperfectly specular surface.

These cavities or combinations of hemispherical films are circular, elliptical, or

irregularlypolygonal. The colours which they reflect and transmitare complementary,

and the tints and rings which in polarized light surround the black cross are curiously

modified by the general tint of the fragment, and the curvature of its component

films,--the black cross itself varying its shape with the form of the cavities. When

the cavities are flat, the black cross disappears as in thin slices of uniaxal crystals

but the tints reappear, rising to higher orders by inclining the plate.

The cavities are often arranged in sinuous curves, and encroach upon one another,

so that the polarized tints appear only at the margin of the line which they form.

They frequently run in perfectly straight lines, and when they are very small and

invisible as cavities, their margins form in polarized light brilliant lines, which are

often grouped in bands like the stripes in a ribbon. Sometimes they are only a few

thousands of an inch in diameter, and might be used as micrometers in the micro-

scope, every trace of the cavities which form them having disappeared. These lines
of polarized light all disappear when they lie in the plane of polarization of the

incident light, or perpendicular to that plane.

   In some specimens a decomposition has taken place on several points of the con-

vex or concave surfaces of the cavities, so as to form new cavities ; and each of these

minute cavities, often ten or twelve in number, exhibit the black cross with its tints,

but disfiguring, of course, those of the cavity upon which they have encroached.

In the three varieties of decomposed glass which I have described, the films are

* Coniptes Eendus, &c, Nov. 2, 1852.
--12 REPORT 1860.

--pure glass, deriving their colour from the individual films of which they are com-

posed. This is obvious from the fact of their becoming colourless by a sufficient
inclination of the plates, and also by the introduction of a drop of water or alcohol.

When the fluid has evaporated, the films recover their original colour; and though

a film of fluid has separated each of the almost infinitesimal layers of the glass, yet
they adhere as firmly as ever after the fluid has evaporated. If an oil or balsam is
introduced, it passes' slowly and unequally between the layers, so that the retreating
colour is bounded by a spectrum of the various tints which the film combines.

   But though the films themselves are glass, yet I have often found between them
beautifid circular crystals of silex, which are finely seen in polarized light, and exhi-
bit many of the regular and irregular forms which I have represented in a paper on
Circular Crystals lately published in the ' Transactions of the lloval Society of Edin-
burgh.' They are sometimes dendritic, and assume, round the black cross, foliated

--shapes like the leaves of plants. At other times, but very rarely, they occur in

circular groups, related to a crystal of silex in their centre. One of these groups
is so remarkable as to merit particular notice. Around a minute speck of silex
there is formed, at a considerable distance from it, a circular band of equally minute
crystalline specks, and at a greater distance a second circular band concentric with
the first, and consisting of still smaller siliceous particles, hardly visible in the mi-

croscope. By what atomic force, or by what other cause, the central crystal has

placed its attendant crystals in regular circles around it, remains to be discovered. I
nave already described a similar phenomenon, as produced during the formation of

circular crystals under constraint, and when crystallizing freely ; but I am not aware

that any other person has either seen the phenomenon or attempted to explain it.
   The films of decomposed glass, as I have long ago shown, absorb definite rays of

the spectrum like coloured media. They change, in the most distinct manner, the
colours of different parts of the spectrum, and frequently insulate bands of purely
white light, in or near its most luminous division.

some of the specimens of decomposed glass were exhibited in the Museum in the cotirse

of the evening.

On his own Perception of Colours. By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

   The author described himself as in an intermediate position between those who
have a normal vision of colours, and those who are termed " colour-blind." These

latter are usually unacquainted with the sensations of either red or green, and it

becomes a desideratum to have good observations on those who are capable of acting
somewhat as interpreters between them, and those who perceive every colour. By
means of Chevreul's chromatic circles and scales, Maxwell's colour-top, coloured
beads, &c, the author was able to determine the following points in respect to his
own vision. He sees red, in all probability, like other people, but it requires a larger

 quantity of the colour to give the sensation than is usually the case ; hence a purple
appears to him more blue, and an orange more yellow, than to the generality of

observers. He is perfectly sensible of green, or rather of two distinct greens, the

one yellowish, the other bluish ; but between them there lies a particular shade of
green, to which his eyes are insensible as a colour. This modifies his perception of
many greens that approximate to what is to him invisible. The shade occurs in
nature on the back of the leaf of the variegated holly, and it may be produced in Max-
 well's top by certain combinations of the coloured disc; the simplest being

  +5 = +94"5 Brunswick Green (Blue Shade) 5- Ultramarine 94 Black 6 White.

   He finds that this shade, though invisible to him as green, is yet capable of neu-
tralizing red when viewed simultaneously, but it does not neutralize so much red

with him as with observers of oidinary vision.
    While able perfectly to distinguish between red and green, the contrast does not

 readily catch his eye, especially at a distance ; in fact, he is somewhat short-sighted

 in respect to these colours. lie has reason to believe that, in his case, there has
 been a gradual improvement in his actual perception of colours, independently of his
 greater knowledge of them, though this is in opposition to the general experience of

those whose vision is in any way abnormal, and no other instance was known to the
late Prof. George Wilson, whose book is the standard one on the subject of colour-

blindness.

On the Chromatic Properties of the Electric Light of Mercury.
             By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.

While examining the brilliant electric light produced in an interrupted current of

mercury in the apparatus contrived by Professor Way, the author was struck by the

strange manner in which it modified the apparent colours of surrounding objects,

and especially with the ghastly purple and green hues which it imparted to the faces

and hands of the spectators. This led him to an investigation of the subject, and a
prismatic analysis of the light itself. Chevreul's " cercles chromatiques " showed

yellow, green, and blue distinctly, but very little red, while the violet became remark-

ably luminous. The modifications of colour in many bodies of known composition

were then related, as for instance the green sulphate of iron which appeared colour-

less, and the scarlet iodide of mercury which assumed a brownish metallic appear-

ance. Substances capable of fluorescing exhibited that phenomenon with remark-

able beauty. On analysing this light by means of a refractive goniometer, the author

found it to consist of a great number of separate rays, and not to present in any

part a continuous band of light. This was exhibited by means of a diagram in

coloured chalks on black paper, by the side of a solar prismatic spectrum. The

position of the different rays had been measured, and their relative intensity deter-

mined. There are red and orange rays, but they are of the most feeble intensity
some yellow rays of great brilliancy ; two bright green rays ; one blue ray of great

luminosity                                           and a number of violet rays.  One of these latter is situated far bej'ond
                                                  ;

the limits of the visible solar spectrum, in fact at about Becquerel's line N, and was

--bright to the eye, although it had passed through several pieces of glass a medium

that does not easily transmit the extra-violet rays. Its colour appeared to differ

considerably according to its intensity, but might be described generally as a red-

--violet. The prismatic analysis explained fully the changes that red substances un-

dergo when exposed to it sometimes to brown, and at other times to purple, green,

or whatever other colour in addition to red is principally reflected by them : it also

explained all the other chromatic phenomena. Professor Wheatstone in 1835 de-

scribed the spectrum of the electric light of mercury as containing seven definite rays
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and Angstrom has recently given a drawing of the lines that coincides closely with

the observations of the author on the more luminous rays, and shows that the Swedish

physicist had not seen the extra violet lines. From his figures also it appears that

the air is excluded from the luminous cone of mercurial vapour in Way's apparatus.

       On a New Instrument for determining the Plane of Polarization.
                         By the Rev. Professor Jellett.

   Professor Jellett described to the Section a new analysing prism, by which the
plane of polarization of polarized light may be determined with great precision.
This instrument consists of a long prism of calc-spar, which is reduced to the form

of a right prism by grinding off its ends, and sliced lengthwise by a plane nearly
but not quite perpendicular to its principal plane. The parts into which the prism
is thus divided are joined in reversed positions, and a diaphragm with a circular
opening is placed at each end. The light which passes through both diaphragms
produces a circular field divided by a diametral slit into two parts, in which the

planes of polarization are slightly inclined to one another. If then light which has
been previously plane polarized be transmitted, it will be extinguished in the two parts
of the field of view in positions which lie close together, and the light will become
uniform in a position midway between these. This position determines the plane in

which the incident light was polarized, with a precision much greater than has been

otherwise attained. Professor Jellett stated that the different observations did not
differ from one another by an angle greater than a minute, and that the instrument

was equally applicable to the case of homogeneous light.

 Note on the Caustics produced by Reflexion.

By L. L. Lindelof, Professor at Helsingfors.

    There are, no doubt, few branches of mathematical physics that have been more
often discussed than the reflexion and refraction of light, and the theory of these
phenomena has consequently been gradually reduced to the greatest simplicity. The

whole doctrine of catoptrics and dioptrics may indeed be said to be implicitly con-

tained in the elegant principle successively developed by Dupin, Quetelet, and Gor-
gonne, namely, that a system of rays that can be cut orthogonally by a particular sur-
face, preserves this property after any number of reflexions and refractions. Never-

theless, it appears to me that the theory of caustics has been somewhat neglected.
Not but what there are many interesting researches on this subject that have been

conducted with abundance of care, but because these, for the most part, refer to cer-

tain very restricted cases, as for example, to reflecting surfaces of a particular kind.
In examining from a somewhat more general point of view the theory of caustics

produced by reflexion, I have arrived at certain results, which appear to me to be

sufficiently curious to deserve a short notice.

    I suppose the reflecting surface to be of any kind whatever, and that it is illumi-
nated by a bundle of parallel rays. Suppose, now, that two of these rays impinge on

Athe surface at two points and A' infinitely near each other. Unless certain par-

ticular conditions are fulfilled, the corresponding reflected rays will not be in the same

plane. In order, therefore, that the two rays may meet after reflexion so as to form

Aa point in a caustic, the points and A' must be related in a certain manner. Now

it will be found that, starting from any point A, there will always be two different
directions in which the consecutive reflected rays intersect, and by following these
directions from point to point, certain curves will be traced on the surface, which play

an important part in the theory of caustics, and which may be called catoptrical lines.

These lines bear some analogy to the lines of greatest and least curvature, with which
they sometimes coincide. Their form and situation depend not only on the nature of
the surface, but also on the direction of the incident rays. Each point of the surface is
the intersection of two catoptrical lines, which possess the remarkable property that
their projections on the plane perpendicular to the incident rays, cut each other at
right angles. To each catoptrical line there is a corresponding caustic formed by the
rays reflected from the catoptric, and these caustic lines themselves form a caustic
surface, which in general consists of two sheets, corresponding to the two systems

of catoptrical lines.

   Let x, y, and z be the coordinates of any point in the reflecting surface, and let the
axis of z be parallel to the incident rays. Calling, as usual, the partial differential
coefficients of z with respect to x and y of the first orders and q, those of the second

r, s, and t, we have for the catoptrical lines the simple equation

                              dp . dy=dq . dr,

which may be put in the form

                              21 +*=-'£-'-.

equation can also be expressed in terms of x and y. If this differential equation can
be integrated, the resulting relation between x and y, together with the equation to
the surface, determine the catoptrical lines.

   The point £, t], and £ of the caustic corresponding to x, y, z of the reflecting sur-
face, is determined by the following equations :

we get the equations to the corresponding caustic line.           On directing my

attention more particularly to surfaces of the second order, I obtained the following

--results :

    (1) In the case of a sphere illuminated by parallel rays, the first system of catop-
trical lines consists of great circles passing through tbe same point, the second of small

circles cutting the former at right angles. The equation to the caustic surface that

corresponds to the first system is

+ _ =^ ^[4 (f +rj 2
                                    ) a 3 2 7a i (f +ij a ),

a being the radius of the sphere, while the second system has for its caustic a straight

line passing through the centre of the sphere.
    (2) If the reflecting surface be an ellipsoid or a hyperboloid, either of one or of

two sheets, and the incident rays are parallel to one of the axes, the projections of the
catoptrical lines on the plane of the other axes are either ellipses or hyperbolas, whose
foci coincide with those of the section of the surface by the same plane.

    (3) In the case of an elliptic paraboloid illuminated by rays parallel to its axis,
the catoptrical lines form parabolas whose planes are parallel to one or the other of
the principal sections of the surface. The caustic surface is reduced to two parabolas
lying in the planes of the principal sections, and having the axis of the paraboloid for

their common axis, but situated in opposite directions. That which lies in the plane
of the greatest of the principal sections is turned in the same way as the paraboloid,
that lying in the perpendicular plane is turned in the opposite direction. Each of

these parabolas has the same focus as the principal section to which it is perpendicu-
lar, and a parameter equal to the difference of the parameters of the principal sections.
Lastly, each of these caustic lines is perpendicular to the corresponding system of

catoptrical lines.

    (4) In the case of a hyperbolic paraboloid illuminated by rays parallel to its axis,
the catoptrical lines also form two systems of parabolas in planes parallel to the planes
of the principal sections, and the caustio is again reduced to two parabolas situated in
the same two planes, and turned in opposite directions, each having a parameter
equal to the sum of the parameters of the two principal sections.

   There would be no difficulty in applying the above formulas to surfaces of revolu-
tion, to cylindrical conical developable surfaces, &c, but the preceding will suffice to

give an idea of the results that may be deduced in certain cases.

On the Results of Bernoulli's Theory of Gases as applied to their Internal

ByFriction, their Diffusion, and their Conductivity for Heat.     Professor

Maxwell, F.R.S.E.

   The substance of this paper is to be found in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for
January and July I860. Assuming that the elasticity of gases can be accounted

for by the impact of their particles against the sides of the containing vessel, the
laws of motion of an immense number of very small elastic particles impinging on

--each other, are deduced from mathematical principles ; and it is shown, 1st, that

the velocities of the particles vary from to oo, but that the number at any instant
having velocities between given limits follows a law similar in its expression to
that of the distribution of errors according to the theory of the " Method of least
squares." 2nd. That the relative velocities of particles of two different systems are
distributed according to a similar law, and that the mean relative velocity is the
square root of the sum of the squares of the two mean velocities. 3rd. That
the pressure is one-third of the density multiplied by the mean square of the
velocity. 4th. That the mean vis viva of a particle is the same in each of two
systems in contact, and that temperature may be represented by the vis viva of a
particle, so that at equal temperatures and pressures, equal volumes of different
gases must contain equal numbers of particles. 5th. That when layers of gas have

a motion of sliding over each other, particles will be projected from one layer into
another, and thus tend to resist the sliding motion. The amount of this will depend

on the average distance described by a particle between successive collisions. From
the coefficient of friction in air, as given by Professor Stokes, it would appear that
--16 REPORT 1860.

this distance is _ inch; the mean velocity being 1505 feet per second, so that
                                            j4

each particle makes 8,077,200,000 collisions per second. 6th. That diffusion of gases
is due partly to the agitation of the particles tending to mix them, and partly to the
existence of opposing currents of the two gases through each other. From experi-
ments of Graham on the diffusion of olefiant gas into air, the value of the distance

described by a particle between successive collisions is found to be 389000 of an

inch, agreeing with the value derived from friction as closely as rough experiments

of this kind will permit. 7th. That conduction of heat consists in the propagation of

the motion of agitation from one part of the system to another, and may be calcu-

^ ^lated when we know the nature of the motion. Taking  of an inch as a pro-

bable value of the distance that a particle moves between successive collisions, it ap-

pears that the quantity of heat transmitted through a stratum of air by conduction

would be luuuouuo of that transmitted by a stratum of copper of equal thick-
ness, the difference of the temperatures of the two sides being the same in both
cases. This shows that the observed low conductivity of air is no objection to the
theory, but a result of it. 8th. That if the collisions produce rotation of the parti-
cles at all, the vis viva of rotation will be equal to that of translation. This relation
would make the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to that at constant volume

to be 1-33, whereas we know that for air it is 1*408. This result of the dynamical

theory, being at variance with experiment, overturns the whole hypothesis, however

satisfactory the other results may be.

On an Instrumentfor Exhibiting any Mixture of the Colours of the
          Spectrum. By Professor Maxwell, F.R.S.E.

This instrument consists of a box about 40 inches long by 1 1 broad and 4 deep.

Light is admitted at one end through a system of three slits, of which the position

and breadth can be altered and accurately measured. This light, near the other end

of the box, falls on two prhyns in succession, and then on a concave mirror, which

reflects it back through the prisms, so as to increase the dispersion of colours. The

light then falls on a plane mirror inclined 45° to the axis of the instrument, and is

reflected on a screen in which is a narrow slit. On this screen are formed three pure

spectra, the position and intensity of each depending on the position and breadth of

the slit through which the light was admitted. The portions of these spectra which

fall on the slit in the screen pass through, and are viewed by the eye placed close

Abehind it.  colour compounded of these three portions of three different spectra

is seen illuminating the prisms, and can be compared with white reflected light seen

past the edge of the prisms. The advantage of the instrument over that described

to the Association in 1859 is, that by the principle of reflexion the rays return in the

same tube, so as not to require two limbs forming an awkward angle ; while at the

same time, by doubling the dispersion, the necessary length of the instrument is

diminished. By means of this instrument many observations of colours have been

taken. Some of these by a colour-blind person are published in the ' Philosophical

Transactions ' for I860.

   In this paper the author has revised, and improved in its details, his method of
expressing the refractive index of a medium as a function of the wave-length.

   He employs X to denote the ratio of any particular wave-length referred to that

                  ,

Thus the formula contains three arbitrary constants, which must be determined

from the results of observation.

  When these constants are properly determined for any medium, the formula, even

in the case of the most highly dispersive media which have been observed, is found

to represent very accurately the observations, the utmost error being only a few units

in the fourth place of decimals.

                     Experiments and Conclusions on Binocular Vision.

                     By Professor William B. Rogers, Boston, U.S.

The following experiments, intended to test the theory of the successive com-

bination of corresponding points in stereoscopic vision, are I believe in part new,

and are in part moditied repetitions of experiments already described by Professor

Wheatstone and Professor Dove.

1. Let two slightly inclined luminous lines, formed by narrow slits in a strip of

black card-board, be combined into a perspective line, either with or without a

stereoscope. Looking at this for a few seconds, so as to induce the reverse ocular

spectrum, and then directing the eyes towards the opposite wall of the apartment,

a single spectrum will be observed having the attitude and relief of the original

binocular resultant.

As a strong illumination of the lines is necessary to bring out the full effect, the

card-board should be held between the eyes and some brilliantly white surface, as

the globe of a solar lamp or a strongly illuminated cloud, care being taken to pre-

vent the entrance of extraneous light.

2. Using the same arrangement, let the luminous lines be regarded in succession

each by the corresponding eye, the other eye being shaded so that no direct bino-

cular combination can be formed. On looking towards the wall, it will be seen that

the two subjective images unite to form a single spectral line, having the same relief <ix

if the lines had been directly combined by simultaneous vision, either with or without

a stereoscope.

While the perspective image continues distinctly visible, let either eye be closed,

the other being still directed towards the wall. The image will instantly lose

its relief and take its position on the plane of the wall as an inclined line, corre-

sponding to the subjective image in the eye that has remained open. When

the subjective impressions have been sufficiently strong, it is easy to alternate

these effects, by projecting first the picture proper to the right eye, then that of

the left, on the plane of the wall, with their respective contrary inclinations ; and

then looking with both eyes, we see the resultant image start forth in its perspec-

tive attitude.

It is hardly necessary to say that to obtain these effects satisfactorily the lines

should be very strongly illuminated, and the observer should have some practice in

experiments on subjective vision. Under these conditions I have found the results

to be perfectly certain and uniform.

In these experiments, according to the theory of Sir David Brewster, the result-

ant spectrum, instead of being a single line in a perspective position, ought to pre-
sent the form of two lines inclined or crossing, situated in the plane of the wall

without projection or relief. The conditions of the experiments are such as to

exclude all opportunity of a shifting of the image on the retina, and such shifting is
obviously essential to the successive combination of pairs of points required by the

theory in the production of perspective effect

In reference to the first experiment, it might perhaps be maintained that, as the

perspeetiveness of the original resultant on which the eyes were converged formed

part of the direct perception in first combining the lines, it would be likely through

association to be included also in the spectral or subjective perception. But this

consideration, which at best appears to me of little weight, is entirely inapplicable

to the conditions of the second experiment. For here the eyes are in the first

place impressed in succession with their respective images, and are not allowed to

see the resultant ; and yet when they are together directed to the wall, the percep-

tion of the single perspective resultant is at once originated.

18 REPORT 1860.

    3. Without resorting to these troublesome efforts of subjective vision, the fol-
lowing experiment furnishes, as I think, conclusive proof that pictures successively
impressed on the respective eyes are sufficient for the stereoscopic effect.

   Let an opake screen be made to vibrate or revolve somewhat rapidly between
the eyes and the twin pictures of a stereoscopic drawing, so as alternately to expose
and cover each, while it completely excludes the simultaneous vision of any parts
of the two. The stereoscopic relief will be as apparent in these conditions as when the
moving screen is withdrawn. Here at each moment the actual impression in the
one eye and the retained impression in the other, form the elements of the per-

spective resultant perceived.

    It seems clearly inferrible from these experiments, that the perception of the
residtant in its proper relief does not require that each pair of corresponding points

should be combined by directing the optic axes to them pair by pair in succession,
as has been maintained. Nor is it necessary for the singleness of the resultant
perception, that the images of corresponding points of the object should fall on
what are called corresponding points of the retinse. The condition of single vision

in such cases seems to be simply this, that the pictures in the two eyes shall be such

and so placed as to be identical with the pictures which the real object would form if
placed at a given distance and in a given attitude before the eyes.

    4. I have of late years frequently repeated Dove's experiments with instantaneous
illumination, leading, as is well known, to similar conclusions. In these I have found
it most convenient to use the momentary bright flash of the Leyden bottle, con-

nected with the Ruhmkorft" coil according to Grove's plan. With a powerful

coil of Ritchie's construction, and a brass disc 8 inches in diameter having the usual

concentric striation, I am able, even with a single flash, to see the luminous line in

perspective, and by a quick succession of flashes, I can have it as steadily before

me as if illuminated by the sun.

  A twin-drawing of a simple geometrical solid, placed in the stereoscope, and

illuminated by the same means, appears single and in just relief in all cases where
the flashes recur at short intervals, and very frequently presents the same appear-
ance even with a single momentary light.

   To be assured that the effect was not due to the recollection of a previous stereo-
scopic impression, I have caused slides to be introduced, of which the form could
not be thus anticipated, and still have had no difficulty in describing the perspec-
tive residtant as exhibited by the instantaneous illumination.

 --5. On the inability of the eyes to determine which retina is impressed. Let a

small disc of white paper be fastened on a slip of black pasteboard of the size
of a stereoscopic slide, and let this be so placed in the instrument as to bring the
disc centrally in front of oue of the glasses, the person who is to view it being kept

in ignorance of the position of the spot. On looking into the instrument he will

think he sees it with both eyes equally, and, without resorting to the expedient of
closing his eyes .alternately, will be entirely unable to determine whether the spot is

before his right eye or his left eye. The spot appears to be placed in the mesial or
binocular direction, and in the same position as that of the resultant image of two
such discs, presented severally to the two eyes.

   It may be concluded from this that the mere retinal impression on either eye is

unaccompanied by any conscious reference to the special surface impressed, and that
the visual perception belongs to that part of the optical apparatus near or within

the brain, which belongs in common to both eyes.

    This experiment is moreover interesting from its bearing on the law of visible
direction. It shows that the sense of direction is just as truly normal to the central
part of the retina that has received no light from the object, as to the part of the
other retina upon which the white spot has been actually painted by the rays. In
truth it is normal to neither, but is felt to be in the middle line between the two,

that is, in the binocular direction. This experiment therefore contradicts the law,
which assumes that the direction in which an object appeal's is always in the normal

to the point of the retina impressed.

Regulateur Automatique de Lumiere Electrique. By M. Serrin.

To form the electric arch of light, it is first necessary to bring the charcoal points

into contact, then gently to separate them by degrees, as they glow, afterwards to

cause them to approach constantly, as they are wasted by use, carefully avoiding

bringing them into contact. In order to keep the point of illumination fixed in space,

each charcoal point must simultaneously approach the other, and that in the pro-

portion in which each is wasted by use. In fine, for rendering the electric light

useful, all these conditions must be self-produced with the utmost regularity, with-

out any intervention of the human hand, that is to say, in a manner completely

automatic ; and this was the object the regulator was invented for. In a simple

and easy manner, this apparatus, which may be compared to an extremely sensible

balance, is composed of two mechanisms connected the one with the other, and yet

--independent ; when one acts the other is in repose, and reciprocally. One of these

consists of an oscillating system, the chief feature of the regulator destined to pro-

duce the separation of the charcoal points, and also to determine their re-approach.

The other mechanism, composed of wheel-work, has for its object to ensure the re-

approach of the charcoal points in the proportion of their waste by use. The two

port-carbons which carry the charcoal pieces are placed vertically one above the

other. The superior is in connexion with the wheel-work, and is the positive elec-

trode of the battery; the inferior depends as well on the wheel-work as on the

oscillating system, and is the negative electrode. The superior port-carbon, by its

weight, causes the inferior to ascend. The oscillating system forms a parallelogram,

of which the angles are jointed, one of the vertical sides of which is suspended by a

spring, and carries at its lower part a soft iron armature, placed over a horizontal

electro-magnet. When the apparatus is in repose, the charcoals are in contact ; on

the contrary, they separate when the circuit is completed and the voltaic arc ap-
pears. As the wasting by use of the charcoals increases the length of the voltaic arc,

the armature increases its distance from the electro-magnet, become less powerful,

and the charcoals re-approach by a quantity frequently less than the one-hundredth

of a millimetre                                                         but according as they re-approach, the electro-magnet recovers its
                                                                     ;

original power, the armature is attracted anew, and the charcoals stop until a new

wasting gives rise to a new re-approach followed by a new stoppage, and so on in

succession. In consequence of its extreme sensibility, it will work either with a

voltaic pile or an electro-magnetic machine.

   On Rings seen in viewing a Light through Fibrous Specimens of Calc-

           spar. By G. Johnstone Stoney, M.A., F.R.A.S. fyc.

   The author mentioned that Sir David Brewster had drawn the attention of the
Association, at the York meeting, to the beautiful display of four rings which may
be seen on looking at a luminous point through fibrous specimens of calc-spar.

    In the present communication the forms of the rings were traced as a consequence
of Huygen's construction, and the points where rings vanish, or where irises pass
into one another, were determined. The state of polarization was also examined, and
the positions, in which two of the rings, which are faint, will be most conspicuous.
The author drew particular attention to the great range of brightness of these faint
rings, and to the circumstances attending the disappearance of one of them, in con-
sequence of a curious case of impossible reflexion, as offering peculiar facilities for
testing rival hypotheses.

surface were easily detached, and submitted to observation. The reflected and trans-
mitted tints were complementary to each other wben held perpendicularly ; they
varied when the position was changed and the path of the rays became oblique. By
examination under the microscope the films were found to be composed of a series of
still thinner films, several of which were required for manifesting colours by trans-
mitted light. In some cases as many as sixteen of these thinner lamina were counted.

The colour is brightened in proportion to the number of laminae. When two films

--overlap, the tint produced is the mixture of the two yellow and blue, for instance,

producing green. In general the layers are flat and the colour uniform, but some-

times undulated over bubbles, and then the colour is varied. Some specimens with
a few bubbles show a difference of colour at the bubble with common light, and with

polarized light the black cross and complementary colours appear.

  On certain Results of Observations in the Observatory of His Highness the

          Rajah of Travancore. By John Allan Broun, F.R.S.

   The following were noticed by the author. 1st. With regard to the mode in
which the diurnal law of magnetic declination varies from place to place, and the
probable position and epoch of the line of least diurnal variation near the equinoxes.

--For this object two stations were chosen one near the magnetic equator, 90 miles

north of Trevandrum, the other about 40 miles south at Cape Comorin, where con-
tinuous hourly observations were made during several months about the periods of
the equinoxes. The most marked of the conclusions arrived at from these observa-
tions were, that the minimum diurnal variation near the March equinox occurred
earlier in the year at Trevandrum than at Shertally 90 miles north, and on the mag-
netic equator ; that the law presented marked differences at the two places, near the
epoch of minimum variation ; and that the difference of the variations at the two
stations occurred almost wholly between midnight, sunrise, and noon, the difference
between noon, sunset, and midnight being comparatively small.

    2nd. Projected observations were exhibited in proof of the results communicated
by the author to the Leeds Meeting of the Association, that the daily mean inten-
 sity of the earth's magnetism increases as a whole or diminishes as a whole ; so that
if at any point on the earth's surface the daily mean intensity increases, it will be
 found that it increases similarly at all other places in proportion to the absolute in-
tensity at each place, allowance being made in cases of great disturbance to the
 greater value of distuibances in high latitudes.

    3rd. Projected observations were also exhibited, showing that the mean daily
 easterly declination of the north end of a magnet followed on the whole the same
 law of variation in both hemispheres, differing from the diurnal variation, where the
 north end moves east in the southern hemisphere, while it moves west in the north-
 ern hemisphere.

    4th. The author had investigated the laws of the diurnal variation of the baro-
meter within the tropics. He had endeavoured to determine whether the chain of the
 Indian Ghats had any influence on the great atmospheric semidiurnal wave moving
westward. Hourly observations had been made for a month in 1857, at a station
 on the eastern base of the Ghats, on the highest peak in Travancore, on the western
 base (all within a few miles), and at Trevandrum 20 miles distant, near the sea shore.
 Similar observations had been made in 1858, at four stations on the western face of
 the Agastier Malley, differing by 1500 to 1700 feet from each other in height, in
 correspondence with the Trevandrum Observatory. In these observations the greatest
 care was taken to have the best instruments, the times of observations were pre-
 cisely simultaneous, and instruments of all kinds were observed likely to give results
 related to the question examined : fifteen observers were employed, and the observa-
 tions continued hourly during a month. From these observations, it appears that

the semidiurnal law of atmospheric pressure is the same at all heights up to 6200
feet (on a sharp peak), from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m., both as regards epoch and range. The
day variation (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) is greatest for the lowest station, depending evidently
on the temperature. The author connected these facts with the hypothesis proposed
by Dr. Lamont and himself, that the semidiurnal variation is due to the inducing
electrical action of the sun on our earth and its atmosphere.

   These and several other results, at present only partly worked out, would be pub-
lished soon in detail. The printing of the observations made in the observatory of
His Highness the Rajah of Travancore was proceeding as rapidly at Trevandrum as
could be expected in Jndia, and the first sheets were in the author's hands.

generally known to the scientific world by General Sabine, in his discussion of the

St. Helena Observations. St. Helena, however, is too far from the magnetic equator

to show the change from one law to the other, otherwise than as a shifting move-

ment of the maxima and minima, which seem to slide in the course of a month or

two from one position to the other ; the whole range of the variation being consider-

able at all seasons. Mr. Broun offered to the Section the results of five years'

observations made at the Trevandrum Observatory, about 90 miles south of the

magnetic equator, which showed perfectly the mode of variation of the diurnal law.

In the months of December, January, and February, the minimum of easterly de-

clination occurs at 7i a.m., in the months from April to September, the maximum

occurs at exactly the same time. In the months of March and October a period of
indifference is attained, when the variation becomes nearly zero, or the variation is

a series of maxima and minima at different hours, and the range or total angular

movement  is reduced  to  about  thirty  seconds          ,-  when  the mean  of  a few  days

                                                  (0 5)

is taken. The epochs at which this change takes place are neither those of the sun's

crossing the equator nor the zenith, and the epoch seems to vary from year to year.
The March epoch is not distant from the vernal equinox, but the other occurs nearly

a month later than the autumnal equinox. So far is the second epoch for the change

from one law to the other from that of the sun's crossing the zenith or equator, that

August and September are the months of greatest diurnal range.
   Although Trevandrum is in 8£s north latitude, it has a magnetic dip of 2£° south

--but the diurnal variations affect the character of the northern hemisphere more than

that of the southern hemisphere, the mean range for the months from May to

September being nearly three minutes (3'), while for the months of December' and

January the range is only about two minutes (2').

Mr. Broun was the first to point out that the diurnal law at any place might be

represented by the superposition of two variations, one resembling that peculiar to

high north latitudes, the other resembling that peculiar to high south,-- the northern

part being always in excess in high magnetic north latitudes, and in excess for places

in low magnetic north latitudes only for the sun north of a given line. It is evident

that we may, by descending towards the magnetic equator, reach a station where for

a given position of the sun the two variations will be equal or nearly equal, in which

case for that position of the sun the complete extinction of the diurnal law may be

expected ; this occurs approximately at Trevandrum.

  When the diurnal range is examined with reference to the decennial period, it is

found that the mean range had a minimum in the year 1856, the exact epoch of
minimum being, perhaps, about January of that year ; but when the ranges for
given months are considered, some curious differences from the law are discovered.

The yearly mean of monthly mean ranges, with the mean ranges for the months of
March and October, are as follows :
--22 REPORT 1860.

                              1-091

   It will be perceived from this Table that the range for the month of March has
gone on increasing from 1854 till 1858, the range for the latter year being more than
double that for the former ; that while the minimum for the whole year occurred in
1856, that for March occurred in 1854, or before that year. In the case of the
month of October, the ranges differ little, that for 1854 being the greatest, and that
for 1857 the least. It is conceived by the author that this curious variation in
March and October is connected with a shift in the epoch of minimum diurnal
variation. If this epoch happen near the middle of the month, the range for the
mean of the month will be least; if it happen earlier or later, the greater range of the
preceding or succeeding periods will preponderate in the monthly mean. Should this
be the cause of the variation of range for March and October, it would follow that
the two superposed variations which produce the total variation may change their

--relative values from year to year for a given place and for a given position of the sun.
   Lunar-diurnal Variation. This variation, which was first remarked by M. Kreil,

and afterwards, though quite independently, by the author, has since been discussed
by General Sabine. The latter gentleman has made it a subject of inquiry, first,
whether the lunar-diurnal variation within the tropics obeyed different laws for the

moon north and south of the equator, like the solar-diurnal law ; and 2nd, whether

the decennial period could be perceived in the former as it is in the latter. His con-
clusions in both cases have been in the negative. Mr. Broun has discussed five
years' observations at Trevandrum, from which he arrives at the following results.

    1st. That the lunar-diurnal law varies with the moon's declination, but not to
the extent of inverting the law. In all cases there are two maxima of easterly de-

clination near the superior and inferior transits, and two minima for the moon near
the horizon. If we consider the period about the solstice of December, we shall find
that the greatest maximum occurs at the inferior transit for the moon furthest north,
and at the superior transit for the moon furthest south. The greatest minimum is
near moonrise for the moon on the equator going north, and near moonset for the
moon on the equator going south, while the minima are equal for the moon furthest
north and furthest south. The epochs also vary slightly.

    2nd. The lunar-diurnal law, which remains nearly constant as regards epochs for
all positions of the moon at any given season of the year, is the inverse in June of
what it is in December ; so that, for the sun farthest north, the lunar-diurnal law has
its maximum where for the sun furthest south it has its minima, the latter occurring
near the epochs of transit in June and July. In this way the lunar-diurnal law de-
fends on the position of the sun relatively to the ecliptic, and not (or little) on that of
the moon.

   The range of the lunar-diurnal variation is greatest near perihelion, which is just
the reverse of the solar-diurnal law ; this appears to depend on the moon's greater
proximity to the sun as the cause of its magnetic action. The range is least near

the epochs of the equinoxes, as for the solar-diurnal law.

   The cause of the great differences found by General Sabine in the laws for dif-
ferent places in the same hemisphere, is attributed by the author partly to the com-
bination of laws which vary considerably at the same place for different seasons.
The author also pointed out that General Sabine's failure to discover the decennial
period in the lunar-diurnal variation may be due to the fact that, before he com-
menced his discussion, he had first cut out all the disturbances beyond a certain

limit, so that a greater proportion were rejected in the years of greatest disturbance.
The decennial law is one affecting the regular diurnal variations, chiefly, through the
disturbance ; so that if the latter be omitted the effect should not appear (or appear
but slightly) in the former. The projected observations were exhibited to the Section.

On a New Induction Dip- Circle. By John Allan Broun, F.R.S.

The idea of determining the earth's magnetic intensity by its inducing action on

soft iron was employed by Dr. Lloyd for the purpose of obtaining the magnetic in-

Aclination.  soft iron bar being placed vertically, so that the induced magnetism of

one end should act on a freely suspended magnet, the deflection thus produced was

observed, and considered proportional to the vertical component of the earth's mag-

netic intensity ; the bar was then placed horizontal, and, the same end acting, the
deflection was observed, which was in the same way considered proportional to the

horizontal component : were there no sources of error, the inclination might be
determined from these two angles. The iron bars employed always possess or
acquire a certain amount of induced magnetism, the effect of which is eliminated by

inverting the bar for the different deflections ; there are, however, still two sources
of error which remain. The most important is that due to the different actions of the

different parts of the bar in the vertical and horizontal positions. If the whole mag-

netism were accumulated in one point at the acting end of the bar, this source of

error would not have existed ; but as the magnetism is distributed over the whole

length, that part whose action is equal on both ends of the suspended magnet when

the bar is in the vertical position, becomes greater on one end of the magnet than
the other when the bar is in the horizontal position. It was probably for this rea-
son that Dr. Lloyd's method has never been put into practice.

Last year, while observing with Dr. Lamont's theodolite magnetometer, Mr. Broun

employed a method for the determination of the absolute magnetic inclination, to
which it is believed there can be no objection in low magnetic latitudes, and which,

with the modifications proposed, may probably be used in all latitudes.

In Dr. Lamont's apparatus the variations of magnetic dip from place to place are

determined by means of two soft iron bars clamped to a horizontal ring, the ring

surrounding a freely suspended magnet, one bar vertically above the ring, the other

vertically below it. By a series of observations of the deflections produced by the

bars in different positions, inverted and exchanged from side to side, the effect of per-
manent magnetism is eliminated, and the deflection due to the earth's force is
obtained ; the sine of this angle, multiplied by a constant, gives the dip for each place;

the constant, however, requires the aid of the usual dip apparatus for its determina-

tion. It is evident, however, that if we can incline the bars moving in the plane of

the magnetic meridian till the observed deflection be zero (should there be no per-
manent magnetism), and observe the angle through which the bars have been moved
from the vertical, this angle will evidently be that of the magnetic inclination, for
the bar will have been moved into the direction at right angles to that of the total

force. This method, as thus stated, requires the determination of the vertical posi-

tion of the bars ; and it is supposed that there is no permanent magnetism : as far as

the latter supposition is concerned, the error is eliminated by reversing the bars ; in
order to render the determination of the vertical position unnecessary, it is only re-

quired to observe the angular inclination of the bars, which (for each position)
diminishes the deflection by an amount equal to the mean deflection previously ob-

tained. It will be observed that for low latitudes, where the bars are moved little
from the vertical, the objection applying to Dr. Lloyd's method exists to so small a

degree as to be negligible.

   This method, which Mr. Broun employed in India, is, however, liable to error in

Ahigh magnetic latitudes ; and the following is proposed for use in all positions.

small magnet, 2 inches long, is suspended by a silk fibre as with the usual declination

magnet ; a small mirror attached to the magnet allows the determination of the

magnetic meridian by means of a telescope having a prism near the wire at the eye-

piece, as in Dr. Lamont's apparatus. When the wire coincides with its image re-

flected by the mirror (no disturbing cause being near), the magnet is in the magnetic
Ameridian.
            vertical circle in the magnetic meridian parallel to the magnet, and

3 inches distant, centre to centre, has a soft iron bar clamped to the alidade, so that

the acting pole of the bar is opposite the centre of the circle and the middle of the
magnet. The reading of the circle is first obtained for the bar vertical : the ver-

tically of the axis of the bar may be determined in different manners ; the best,
24 REPORT 1860.
                                                                                                                                     ,

perhaps, is to have the bar hollow, and to employ reflexion of a cross wire from a
surface of mercury. The bar is then moved in the magnetic meridian from the ver-
tical position till the deflection of the magnet is zero ; if the permanent magnetism
acts with the induced magnetism, the movement of the bar will be greater than the
inclination by a given angle ; in turning the bar in the opposite direction (so as to
invert it), the angle from the vertical will be less by the same amount.

    Since in the position at right angles to the magnetic force the induced magnetism
is zero, the objection applying to Dr. Lloyd's method does not exist ; there is, how-
ever, still a source of error remaining that applies to both : as the magnetic inclina-
tion increases, the position at right angles to the force can only be attained by moving
the bar nearer and nearer to the horizontal, and as it approaches the horizontal, a
certain amount of magnetism is induced in the bar by the small suspended magnet.
Different methods have been imagined by the author to destroy or balance this
action ; but the best method he thinks will be to make observations with the bar at
two different distances. The magnetism induced by the small magnet in the bar

may be represented by a weak magnet, whose force will vary inversely as the cube of

the distance : as the action of this weak magnet will also vary inversely as the cube
of the distance, the effect may be determined and eliminated by observations at two
or more distances.

   Any error of the observation for the vertical position of the bar due to the non-
coincidence of the axis of magnetism and of figure may be eliminated by turning the

bar on its vertical axis of figure through 180°.
   The author remarked that the error due to the inducing action of the small

suspended magnet might be rendered as small as we please, by employing a modi-
fication of the method used by him in India. If the total deflection due to the bar
vertical (direct and inverted) be determined, and we then observe the change of de-
flection due to a given angular movement of the bar from the vertical, we may com-
pute the movement necessary to render the deflection zero : the angular movement
may be taken of such magnitude as to render the effect of the inducing action negli-

gible. This modification requires, however, the determination of the angles of

deflection, and therefore is far from the simplicity of the first method. The author
pointed out, that, since when the bar is at right angles to the direction of the total
force any small movement of the bar will produce induced magnetism in proportion
to the sine of the small angle of movement, this position is that best fitted to give

the true position of the magnetic meridian with the least error of inclination.

   The author concluded by stating that he had learned since his return to Europe
that Dr. Lamont had also proposed a method differing from that of Dr. Lloyd. Dr.
Lamont employed an astatic needle, and turned the bars into different azimuths by
movement on a vertical axis, so as to produce different amounts of induced magnet-

ism without changing the position of the bars relatively to the vertical. This

method, Dr. Lamont informed the author, had failed on account of the bars receiving
different amounts of permanent magnetism in changing from azimuth to azimuth.
This difficulty does not exist in Mr. Broun's method, as the bar is always kept in the
meridian, and is always brought to the position where the inducing action is zero.

  On Magnetic Rocks in South India. By John Allan Broun, F.R.S.

   The Moocoonoomalley is a granite hill rising about 800 feet above the sea, 5 miles
south-east of Trevandrum, and about 35 miles north-west of Cape Comorin. General
Cullen, the late British Minister at Travancore, had observed several anomalies in the
magnetic dip in ascending this hill. The dip near Trevandrum and about the base
of the hill was from 2° 30' to 2° 40' S. ; on the top he found the dip to be from
5° 52' to 11° 23' in different years, in which he probably slightly varied the position

of observation.

    In December 1855 I examined the rock masses constituting the hill. The plain
around the base is formed of a stratified rock known to Indian geologists by the
name of laterite. The first rocks in the ascent are dark syenites, containing a con-
siderable proportion of hornblende (in some cases the appearance is more like a
greenstone) ; towards the middle of the ascent light-grey syenites become common,
         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.             25

and at the top the rocks are pegmatites or granites. I first examined a small frag-

ment of the rock presented to me by General Cullen, of a greyish-red tint, composed

chiefly of felspar and quartz with particles of magnetic iron ore disseminated ; these

^ Aparticles were of about to inch in diameter, and without any regular form or

smooth face (as far as my examination went), when a magnet was presented to one

of these particles, detached from the specimen, it showed its polarity by tumbling
over, if the homonymous pole was at first nearest the magnet. The specimen
alluded to was about 5 inches long, 2| inches broad, and 1^ inch thick, tapering

and thinning off to one end (A). On presenting the different extremities to a freely

suspended magnet (the declination magnet of the Trevandrum Observatory), the

following results were obtained :

where the negative sign signifies repulsion of the north end of the magnet, and
the positive sign attraction of the same pole. The changes of magnetic declination

occurring during the experiments were observed by another instrument, and have
been subducted. As the line of the magnetic axis of the specimen was evidently

Atowards the direction of its greatest length, the northern end being towards and C,

it was desired to determine whether the same relation would hold true for any
fragment ; for this purpose, two ends of the specimen were knocked off, leaving a

fragment in the middle with a distance of a (towards A) to b (towards B) of nearly

D2 inches, while the breadth from C to was nearly 3 inches ; so that the longest

dimension was now nearly at right angles to that of the whole specimen. The cen-
tral fragment being placed at the same distance from the suspended magnet as in the

previous experiment, the following were the results :

   The ends and sides show the same polarities as in the whole specimen, but with

the north end of the magnetic axis turned more to the side D, for which the deflec-

Ation has increased. Upon presenting the small fragment constituting the end of

the specimen, the results were as follows :

Here it will be observed that the broken fragments of the specimen acted exactly as
the broken parts of a magnet ; thus the end a in the central fragment gave a repul-
sive effect of 0*79 scale divisions, while the end a', the opposite face of the fracture,
gave an attractive action of 0'36.

    Several questions of interest presented themselves in connexion with these rocks.
Whether the hill as a whole would give results similar to those obtained from this
specimen? Whether the lines of magnetic force in it had any relation to the lines
of crystallization, or to those of the earth's poles ? Whether any particular direction
was most favoured ? or whether the magnetic axes vary from spot to spot, and the

magneticules, possessing their present magnetism when tossed up in the liquid mass,

had their positions determined by chance ?

   The bearing of the Trevandrum Observatory was observed approximately by a

Ahand compass at the stations and B. At 4^ feet above the rock the error was small

but when placed on the rock A, the decliuation was found 10° west, while on B
(9 feet W.N.W. of A) it was 35° east, the true declination over laterite being about

|° east.

The pegmatite and granite on the top of the hill seemed to form kinds of dykes

running parallel to each other nearly north and south, and crossed by lines nearly at

right angles to the direction, so as to form large blocks, between which the decaying

rock has allowed the accumulation of soil to some depth. Blocks of about 9 inches

Adiameter were cut out of the rock at and B, having previously marked the direc-

tion of the true north and south upon the upper surface, which was nearly horizontal.

AWith these specimens I made the following observations.                              specimen was placed

with its centre at about 2 feet from the centre of the freely suspended magnet, and

in the line at right angles to the direction of the magnet ; the points of the compass
marked on the upper surface, when the specimen was in situ, were successively pre-

senled to the centre of the magnet, and the scale readings of the instrument were

observed. The direction of the plane of greatest force being found, the specimen was

inclined at different angles to the horizontal, till the direction of the line of greatest

force was determined.

The direction of the plane containing the magnetic axis is in this case nearly

north and south. On raising the point S. presented to the magnet, it was found

that the north end of the magnetic axis dipped from 10° to 20° below the south

horizon ; the exact position could not be determined, from the difficulty of keeping the

centre of the specimen always at the same distance from the magnet. The result

agrees with the fact that the dip observed on A was diminished, since the rock mag-

net having here its south end uppermost, would necessarily attract the north end of

the dipping needle.

Specimen B : cylinder 10 inches diameter, 9 inches deep ; upper surface red and

weathered, interior bluish grey; contains besides the bluish felspar and quartz a

large quantity of hornblende. The observations for B were made only for the north

end of the axis.

   The north end of the magnetic axis was here evidently nearly in the direction

N. by E. £ E. Upon raising this point of the stone, presented to the centre of the

magnet, the deflection diminished ; on lowering it, the deflection increased to 10° ; so

that the north end of the axis here inclined 10° above the horizon to N. by E. A E.

This result also agrees with the increase of dip found at B.

   In a third specimen examined, which was weakly magnetic, the north end of the

axis made an angle of 80° above the N. W. by W. point of the horizon.

   From these results it is evident that though the direction of the magnetic axis

may not vary much in small specimens, it does so in parts of the rock separated by

a  few  feet  only from  each  other                            and  it  appears  probable  that                                                                                                                                                                                                                     it  may  be  considerable

for smaller distances than those under experiment. Neither do the directions of the

axis seem to have any relation to the lines of crystallization.

   Another question was examined by me, namely, whether the magnetic intensity of

the rock varied with the temperature. For this question I chose a specimen of

about 6 inches long by 4 broad and 3 thick, taken from near the middle of the ascent

of the hill. The observations were made in the same manner as for the temperature

coefficient of a magnet. The specimen was placed in a wooden trough, into which

water of different temperatures was poured : the deflections of the declination mag-

net by the specimen at different temperatures were noted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             the variations of declina-

core, for the purpose, in the first instance, of determining the exact position of the mag-
netic equator (which passes through his territory) and the variations of intensity about
the line of no inclination. This part of the survey was performed with considerable
care, stations being chosen along the line of coast, at distances of from 10 to 15 miles,
generally far from the chain of the Ghats, and in a flat country, covered in many
places by backwaters or lagoons. The instrument employed was the excellent theo-
dolite magnetometer of Dr. Laraont. The results were, that the magnetic south in-
clination, instead of diminishing regularly from Cape Comorin northwards to the line
of no dip, diminished through a space of 30 miles, increased through a similar space,
and again diminished in the most capricious manner. The same irregularities were
observed north of the estimated position of the equator. Some irregularities had
been already observed by Mr. Caldecott, Mr. Taylor, and General Cullen; but the
author had confirmed his results by observations at many different stations, and had
come to the conclusion that a belt of disturbance for this element existed near the
line of no dip. This disturbance could not be attributed to the influence of hills or
of rocks, as no ground of greater elevation than 30 to 40 feet existed within several
miles of those stations showing the greatest irregularities, no rocks were reached by
borings of 30 to 50 feet deep, and none appeared upon the surface above the sandy

soil near these stations.

   The survey was extended by the author on his way to Europe by observations at

stations further north than those in Travancore, as Kodungalur, Kalikut, Mangalur,
Goa, Rutnagherri, Bombay, and Aden. From this and the first part of the survey,
the author found that the horizontal intensity was nearly the same from Cape
Comorin to Bombay, showing, as the author conceived, that the lines of equal inten-
sity followed (somewhat like the isothermal lines) the line of the Indian coast. This
result agrees with that obtained by the Messrs. von Schlagintweit, whose previous
observations iudicate a great bend of the isodynamic lines from the Himalayas and
towards Cape Comorin. The whole question, the author conceived, required careful
examination by means of observations at more numerous stations, as the theory of
the causes of the earth's magnetic intensity, and the arrangement of the magnetic

lines, were evidently involved in results which differed so much from what had been
found elsewhere, especially from the results obtained by Dr. Lamont from his admi-

rable magnetic survey of the greater part of the European Continent.

           On Electrical Force. By Sir W. Snow Harris, F.R.S.

   The author adverted to the assumed existence in nature of an electric fluid or
fluids, an idea entertained by philosophers from the earliest periods of the history of
electricity. Many thought that all bodies expire or inhale this fluid. In modern
times less ambiguous views have been resorted to, and the doctrine of an electric
fluid or fluids has been employed principally as aiding to link the phenomena into
an intelligible and connected chain. The author thinks the time is fast approaching
when it may be found desirable to abandon all idea of electrical fluids as the agency
concerned in the development of electrical force, and treat this species of force as
Newton did gravity, without any care as to its occult quality. For although it may
be convenient and perhaps useful to employ analogical expressions in interpreting
the phenomena and to facilitate description, as when we speak of the quantity of
electric matter, of its tension, density, or thickness of stratum, &c, yet it must
ever be remembered that, in using this figurative language, it is force and the laws
of force with which we are dealing, and not with electrical fluids or other assump-

tions as to its occult nature or quality.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                  29

The author proceeded to say that the foundation of all exact science is number,

weight, and measure ; and that, as observed by an eminent writer, no branch of phy-

sical knowledge could be held as being out of its infancy which did not in some way

or the other frame its theory, or correct its practice with reference to these elements.

He here described and explained the nature of a series of very beautiful instruments,

by which the quantity of the electrical agency, its attractive force, its explosive

power, and the effects produced, could be accurately measured. Having thus en-

deavoured to bring the unknown agency we term electricity under the dominion of

number, weight, and measure, the leading characteristics of electricity as a force

were next brought under consideration. And first, we observe electrical power

exhibits itself under two forms, usually termed vitreous and resinous electricity, or

positive and negative electricity. These have been usually considered as arising

out of two distinct and separate fluids, or of a single elementary fluid in a greater or

less state of condensation. They are, however, one and the same force, and have

the same relation to each other as the forces of compression and extension in the

Wecase of a bent bow or spring.                                                                                                                             cannot have one without the other ; and as in

the latter instance we should gain but little by assuming the existence of elastic

fluid or fluids as the source of elasticity, so in the case of electrical force we may as

well look at once upon positive and negative electricity as elementary facts of which

we have no adequate explanation.

Secondly, we observe that whatever be the nature of electricity as a physical

agency, it cannot exert itself equally in all directions at the same moment. In the

case of gravity, the sun does not attract the earth with less force because it is

exerting its gravitating power on the other planets. Such is not the case in the

development of electrical force. The author here introduced a striking experiment

in illustration of this ; showing that a delicate electroscope, attracted toward an

electrified circular plate placed vertically, became less forcibly drawn toward the

plate from a distance when a second body was brought to share in the action. This

is the result of a third characteristic of electrical force, termed electrical induction

or influence, the laws and operation of which were now further explained and illus-

trated. It is solely upon this species of electrical action, apparently of a sympa-

thetic kind, operating at a distance, probably by propagation through the intervening

medium, that electrical attractive force altogether depends: without it no exertion

of power is possible. In electrical force bodies are first rendered attractable before

they become attracted, and for the regular and full exertion of the attraction, both

the bodies must be susceptible of unlimited electrical change. When this is the case

the development of force is easily traced ; and the force will be found to vary as the

square of the quantity of electricity in operation directly, and as the squares of the

distances inversely : of this some striking and very interesting experimental illustra-

tions were given through the instrumentality of the electrical balance, delicately set

up with complete means of adjustment for distance and force; and it was with re-

markable precision the beam descended when under the influence of two attracting

surfaces ; the quantity of electricity and the weights being given, the force of in-

duction, upon which the resulting force depends, varies in the simple inverse ratio of

the distance between the attracting surfaces, and depends, first, upon the direct in-

fluence of the electrified surfaces, secondly, upon a reflected induction thrown back

upon the excited body. The total force is in a compound ratio of these forces, and
it is in this way we obtain a force in the inverse duplicate ratio of the distances. If

from any cause either or both of the previous elementary actions be interfered with,

then we have no longer this law                                                                                                                         so  that any law of electrical  force  is possible, as
                                                                                                                                                     ;
--found in the experiments of many eminent philosophers of past days Muschenbroek,

Brook, Taylor, Whiston, Martin, and others. The author thinks that the results of

the experiments of these eminent men have been called unjustly in question ; every

result they arrived at is producible by careful manipulation.

The author now brought under consideration the question of electrical force be-

tween spheres, one charged with electricity, the other neutral and in a free state.

This question had been often elaborately treated, and had been hitherto considered

a physico-mathematical question of great intricacy. An analysis of the elements of
this question was here entered upon. Upon the proved facts that the force varies

with the quantity of electricity and is in the duplicate inverse ratio of the distance,
30 REPORT 1860.

two points may be found within the opposed hemispheres in which we may con-

ceive the whole force to be collected, and to be the same as if proceeding from every

point of the opposed hemispheres. These points approach the surface, and become

the touching points when the spheres touch ; as the spheres separate they approach

the centre, and reach the centre when the distance is infinite. If we call a the

?--distance between the points of contact, and        the radius of sphere, we have,

of force=qq', we have distance qq'=the tangent from either of the touching points

= --to the opposite sphere; or if distance qq' D, we have Yet =p«r ct

Several very remarkable experiments were now adduced in evidence of the truth of

these formulae. Spheres of variable diameters were put in opposition in the balance,

the quantity of electricity measured, and weights placed in the scale-pan, as deter-
mined by calculation ; the distances being regulated accordingly, the scale beam
bowed in obedience to the given law of force with extreme and wonderful exactitude :

the experiments elicited much commendation.

   The author thinks that every observed operation of electrical action is reducible
to simple and elementary laws free of complication, and may be investigated and ex-

pressed by an easy mathematical analysis and forms of expression. He thinks that

all the laws of nature are of the most simple kind, and only involve a simple rela-

tion of cause and effect ; if we double the cause we double the effect. To suppose

an effect to be as the square or cube of its cause, is to suppose the effect to depend

partly on the cause and partly on nothing. There is probably, taken as a simple

elementary law, no such a law in nature as that of a force being in the inverse

duplicate ratio of the distance. Take, for example, the case of gravity as central

force, and assumed to be a species of emanation from a centre, it is true that

at twice the distance we have only one-fourth the force ; but this is because the areas

of the concave spherical surfaces, which we may imagine the emanation to fall upon

at these distances, are  to each  other as  41 :  ;  so that in  any one point of the outer

sphere there is only one-fourth the agency upon which the force depends, conse-

quently only one-fourth the attraction; but this is a simple relation of cause and
effect. Taking light as an emanation from a centre, the same result ensues. If
there be only one-fourth the quantity of the emanation in any point, we can only

have one-fourth the light, and thus light or gravity may be said to be in the inverse

duplicate ratio of the distance.

   On the different Motions of Electric Fluid. By the Rev. T. Rankin.

   The author, from several very striking and vividly-described thunder-storms and
their permanent effects, concludes that sometimes the electric fluid moves downward,

sometimes upward, and sometimes horizontally. On one occasion, some years since,

about two o'clock, on a night on which it had thundered almost incessantly, a loud
whizzing sound was heard to pass over the rectory-house, which he judged to bean
aerolite ; a tree in the direction it had passed was struck; and from the nature of the
injury inflicted, the conclusion was drawn that the motion of either the aerolite or
of the electric fluid had been nearly horizontal.

 On the Phenomena of Electrical Vacuum Tubes, in a letter to Mr. Gassiot.

                   By Professor W. B. Rogers, Boston, U.S.

   I send you, by my brother, a printed abstract of remarks made some months ago

on the phenomena of the vacuum tubes, and a hypothesis as to the condition and

cause of the stratifications.

   You will see that, with the aid of Mr. Ritchie and our skilful photographer, Mr.

Black, I have been experimenting on the actinism of these electrical discharges.
   In some more recent trials I have obtained beautiful photographs of the stratifica-

tion, of which I send you a specimen. The tube, as you will see, is a straight one, of

by Geissler as containing phos. hydrogen. As you have

perhaps observed, it gives the strata with extraordinary di-

stinctness                                        and after  the  action  has  been  continued  a  little
                                               ;

while, the strata near the blank end arrange themselves in

pairs, consisting each of a bluish and a more reddish layer,

separated by a blank interval from the next, as seen very

plainly in the photograph.

By a steady, rapid motion of the ratchet-wheel of Mr.

Ritchie's coil, it was easy to keep the strata almost perfectly

stationary. The picture was obtained with eighteen turns of

the wheel, each giving twelve sparks. With six turns a
tolerably clear picture was secured.

You see that the unilluminated space at one end made no

impression, and that the intervals between the strata are also

as devoid of actinic as they are of luminous rays.

   The picture of the winding tube, with bulbs, shows how

superior is the actinism of the faint blue light of the negative

end compared with the brighter and less refrangible rays of

the opposite bulb.

General Abstract of the Results of Messrs. de Schlagintweit's Magnetic Sur-

    vey of India, with three Charts. By M. H. von Schlagintweit.

M. Hermann de Schlagintweit gave a general report on the results obtained

MM.during  de Schlagintweit's magnetic survey of India and High Asia, from 1854

to 1857-

He presented three charts, showing the lines of equal declination, dip, and inten-

sity, from Ceylon up to Turkistan. Also the details of their observations as con-

tained in the first volume of their work, ' Results of a Scientific Mission to India

and High Asia,' undertaken by order of the Hon. East India Company, was laid

upon the table.

The magnetic results were preceded by a communication of those latitudes and

longitudes, particularly to the north of the Himalayas, which were either new as to

localities or found to differ from previous determinations.

For the construction of their charts, they most carefully compared also the previous

observations ; such as, for the intensity in Northern India, Taylor's and Caldecott's,

and particularly those recently made by Mr. Broun ; for the declination along the
coasts, the determination of the Indian Navy ; but Capt. Elliot, their predecessor,

having died before he could extend his survey from the Indian Archipelago to India,

and the only detailed observations in the outer Himalaya (General Boileau's, at

Simla) being destroyed in the last mutiny, their observations must be considered as

made in a territory novel for this branch of science ; and a great part of them was

besides made under circumstances so difficult, that unhappily one of the three

brothers was killed in Turkistan.

The following results are particularly to be mentioned :

-- AI. Declination. 1.  zone of too little easterly declination, of considerable ex-

tent, was found in Assam. 2. In the north-western part of India the declination was

found to vary more rapidly than in the surrounding territories. 3. In the region of

the Kuerluen the declination was found more easterly than given by the approximate

form of the isogonic lines as provisionally laid down till now for these regions.

  --II. The Dip. This was found, of the three elements, the most regular in its

general forms ; though local deviations are not unfrequent, they are small and very

limited.
-- -- AIII. Total Intensity. Two unexpected results presented themselves: 1.
                                                                              de-

cided inflection of the isodynamic lines in the central and southern parts of India.

2. A zone of depression all along the outer ranges and the base of the Himalaya.

In reference to the first, M. de Schlagintweit pointed out, as particularly import-

ant, that the very careful observations of Mr. Broun all along the western coast of

India, made quite independent of, and subsequent to, their own, perfectly coincided

with the lines based on their observations.

The magnetic influence of a large surface of soil exposed to the physical action of

a tropical insulation, and the non-existence of such an influence in the rainy and

much more clouded regions of the outer Himalayas, were named as perhaps not un-

connected with this phenomenon, so particularly characteristic in India.

Outline of the Principles and Practice involved in dealing toith the Elec-

  trical Conditions of Submarine Electric Telegraphs. By M. Werner
  and C. W. Siemens.

   The authors, who have had very extensive experience in dealing with submarine

and other electric telegraphs, state that the failures of the more extensive submarine
lines commence generally by a gradual decrease of insulation. The cause of this

failure has been found, in repairing these lines, to consist in a disintegration of the

gutta percha by the electrolytical action of the currents employed in working the

line in such places where the insulating covering was much below the average thick-

ness, owing to excentricities, cavities, &c. In other places, where the gutta percha
had been of uniform and sufficient thickness, not the slightest destruction took place

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but it might be laid down as an axiom, that " so long as there are any thin places

allowed to remain in the gutta percha coverings of a submarine conductor, so long will

their insulation fail by slow degrees."

Great improvements have of late been effected, which may be estimated by the

fact that the covering of the Rangoon and Singapore cable, now in process of manu-

facture, insulates ten times better if reduced to the same thickness of coating than

the covering of the Red Sea and India cable did before it was laid ; and these

marked improvements are due to the greater care used by the Gutta Percha Com-

pany, assisted by stringent electrical tests which the authors are charged by the

British Government to apply.

The chief characteristic of these tests is, that the conductivity of both the con-

ducting wires and the surrounding coating, which is regarded in the light of an in-

ferior conductor, is expressed in numerical units, capable of direct comparison. The

unit of resistance adopted is that of a column of mercury, I metre in length and of

one square millimetre sectional area, taken at the freezing-point of water (as de-
scribed by Werner Siemens in Poggendorff's ' Annalen,' vol. ex.). In expressing

the degrees of conductivity of both the wire and the insulating medium in definite

units of resistance, not only the advantage of a more accurate comparison between

the results of different indication is obtained, but subsequently, when the separate

coils are united together to a single cable, it affords an admirable means of judging

its electrical condition in comparing the total resistances of both the conductor and

insulating medium with the sum of the resistance previously obtained in testing each

coil separately ; but the principal advantage derived from this system of measuring,

consists in the facilities it affords in determining the position of a fault in a cable

while it is being laid and after submersion. In carrying this system into practice,

MM. Siemens constructed coils of definite resistance variable from 1 to 50,000 units

of resistance.

The cables to be tested are placed for twenty-four hours in water regulated to

75° F. ; they are then removed into the testing tank of the same temperature, which

is hermetically closed, and hydraulic pressure of at least 600 lbs. per square inch

applied, in order to force the water into the cavities or fissures that may present

themselves.

It is a remarkable fact, which is also borne out by observation upon cables in

process of submersion, that the application of hydrostatic pressure sensibly decreases

the conductivity of gutta percha ; which, however, increases again slightly beyond

the former rate when the pressure is relieved.

For a full description of the methods of testing employed, we must refer our

readers to the paper itself.

The authors give a description of a new instrument by means of which they test

the inductive capacity of cables, which has also to be accurately ascertained for the

purpose of detecting faults ; and have affixed a Table containing many satisfactory

results, and proving the correctness of a formula for calculating the specific induc-

tion of cables, which was obtained by Professor Thomson and M. Werner Siemens

by different scientific deductions.

The specific inductive capacity of all gutta percha is shown to be nearly the same,

and to be entirely independent of the specific conductivity of the gutta percha ; while
India-rubber and Wray's mixture are far inferior in specific inductive capacity, being

=equal to 07 and0 - 8 respectively, gutta percha being taken 1.

   In this way the cable is examined repeatedly at the earliest stages of its manu-

facture, in lengths of one knot, during the joining and covering of the cable, and

finally during the paying out.

The paper next gives a full description of the electrical tests to be applied during

the paying out, and numerous formulae by means of which faults in the cable are

ascertained under various circumstances. By these means Messrs. Siemens were

enabled to determine with great accuracy faults in the Indian cable, both during the

paying out and afterwards, which enabled the contractors, Messrs. Newall and Co.,

to effect the necessary repairs with a certainty which could not formerly be obtained.

Respecting the prospects of success of new lines of submarine cables, the paper

states that, owing to the great care used, the conductor of the Rangoon and Singa-

pore cable is fully ten times more perfectly insulated than the best cable hitherto

submerged j and that it mav confidently be expected that the result in practice will

also greatly exceed that of previous experience ; still the insulating material em-
ployed remains the same, and is therefore liable to be affected by the same causes of

failure.

   The frequent failure of gutta percha has given rise lately to several projects ot
substituting India-rubber and its compounds for the same, which, owing to the
higher insulating properties and lesser inductive capacity of India-rubber, and

above all, owing to its greater homogeneity and resisting power to effects of heat,

give promise of valuable results in making electric telegraphs less liable to failure.

The chief difficulty consisted hitherto in working India-rubber in such a way as to

obtain uniform and perfect coatings upon the conductor without injury to the con-

ductor itself. The authors have endeavoured to remove this difficulty in construct-
Ging a covering machine, which they brought before Section of the Association.
-- WeThey conclude, *'
                            do not wish, however, to rest upon our individual efforts

for the further development of this important new branch of applied science. Our

object ill writing this communication has been to show that, although submarine

electric telegraphs have often failed, the experience gained has not been lost ; and

that in bringing the present stock of knowledge to bear upon the subject more com-

plete success may be ensured."

On the Forms of certain Lunar Craters indicative of the Operation of a
        peculiar degrading Force. By W. R. Birt, F.R.A.S.

There are on the surface of our satellite three well-marked classes of lunar craters,

those that are more or less complete in the outlines of the mountainous rings by

which they are surrounded, having in many cases a somewhat deep interior, and
appearing as excavations on the surface of the moon. Cleomedes, Geminus, and
Weothers in their neighbourhood are examples.
                                                          have also among the perfectly

surrounded craters those that have their rings somewhat considerably elevated above

the general level of the lunar surface. Tycho may be cited as the most perfect

instance of the raised craters. Both these kinds agree in a very important particu-

lar ; the surrounding ring (whatever may be the varying altitudes of different peaks,
or however certain portions may rise higher than ochers) is in this class complete ;

there is no evidence of the operation of the peculiar degrading force-, to which 1 shall

presently allude--certainly not to any very great extent-- in breaking down any por-

tion of the surrounding annulus.

A second class of lunar crater consists of those that, having the surrounding ring

complete, do not exhibit the depth of such craters above specified, or the gradual rising

from the  general  surface  as  seen  so  distinctly  in  Tycho                                        they stand out as it were
                                                                                                    ;

above those portions of the surfaces of the moon where they occur-- generally the

Maria--as if the smooth undulating plains had come quite up to the rings which rise

abruptly from them.  Most of these craters have smooth level                                           interiors                                        and there
                                                                                                                                                     ;

are instances of the first class situated in rugged mountainous districts possessing

also a smooth interior. Plato may be quoted as an example. Many instances of

this class occur in which the ring is but slightly raised above the interior and exte-

rior surfaces.

   The third class, to which I am particularly desirous of referring, consists of such

craters as having apparently at some previous period of their history possessed a

perfect ring ; a degrading force, not such as may have produced the terraces and
ravines which we notice in Copernicus, but something of a different character, has
invaded them from without, breaking down certain portions of the annulus, and

leaving only a portion of the walls standing : these craters mostly occur on the bor-

ders of the Maria ; and it is not a little significant that the broken portions are in-

variably, so far as my observations extend, on the side next the Maria, the parts of

the annuli opposite the Maria being more or less in their earlier state.
   The two undermentioned craters appear to be interesting examples of this class--

Fracastorius, situated on the border of the Mare Nectaris, and Hippalus on the
                                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                    35

border of the Mare Humorum. The ring of Fracastorius is so much broken down

towards the Mare Nectar is as to give the crater the appearance of a small bay, un-

-- --less viewed under a suitable illumination a very early one when the edge of the

crater towards the Mare is seen as a series of low points or peaks casting very short

shadows. The floor of the interior appears to be somewhat different from the sur-

face of the Mare, and seems to be slightly depressed below its level. The crater

Hippalus is highly interesting; seen under a very early illumination: the western

half of the floor is rugged, having a number of hillocks scattered over it and two

minute craters ; the eastern half is smooth, very like in appearance to the surfaces of

the Maria; but the most remarkable feature is the line separating the crater from

the Mare, just as though the Mare had come up to and swept away half the ring of

the crater and a portion of its floor, the two extremities of the semicircular range of

mountains being very distinct, especially the north-eastern, which terminates ab-

ruptly                            not the vestige of a shadow is  observed  between the  two,  the light passing

between them unobstructedly.

On the Possibility of Studying the Earth's Internal Structure from Pheno-

      mena observed at its Surface. By Professor Hennessy, F.R.S.

   This the author showed to follow as a result from the comparison of the level
surface, usually called the earth's surface by astronomers and mathematicians, with
the geological surface which would be presented if the earth were stripped of its

fluid coating. He had made several comparisons of the arcs of meridian measured

in different countries, and had been thus led to the conclusion that the surfaces in

question were not only dissimilar, but that the former derived many of the irregular-
ities which it is known to present from the influence of the obvious irregularities of

the latter. In the absence of precise knowledge of the true figure of the surface of
the solidified crust of the earth, as well as of the assumed level surface perpendicular
to gravity, theory was necessarily somewhat in advance of observation upon this

particular question. At present the number of unknown quantities involved in
an inquiry as to the earth's internal structure was greater than the number of condi-
tions ; but by knowing the true surface, and adopting the results of established
physical and hydrostatical laws relative to the supposed internal fluid mass*, we
should be able to form as many equations as we have unknown quantities, and thus

ultimately obtain a solution.

On some Recorded Observations of the Planet Venus in the Seventh Century

  before Christ. By the Rev. Edward Hincks, D.D., of Killyleagh,

Ireland.

   There is a tablet of baked clay in the British Museum, the inscription on which,

if I interpret it aright, contains a series of observations of the planet Venus, and a
series of predictions grounded on the observations. The latter are of no value ; but
the former may in great measure, if not altogether, determine the law by which the
AssyrioBahyionian lunar year was regulated in respect to its intercalary months.

The knowledge of this law, again, will either establish or disprove the view which I
have long entertained, and repeatedly expressed, that the era of Nabonassar was
an astronomical, and not a political one ; and I may add, it is not impossible that it
may furnish a test of the genuineness of the works attributed to Quthami and other

supposed ancient Babylonian writers. For these reasons I am desirous that the

observations which I suppose to be recorded should be submitted to astronomers.

I now offer two, which will suffice to test the correctness of my interpretation of the

records. If any astronomer will take the trouble to calculate whether what is here
stated to have happened would have actually happened, and will communicate the
result to me, I will, if he desire it, communicate to him other records of observations,
as to the interpretation of which I feel less confidence than I do as to these. I observe
that the Babylonian months are expressed by monograms, for which I substitute
Hebrew names of months. The Babylonian day began at noon ; and that day in
the evening of which the new moon was first seen was considered to be the first day

of the month. I suppose, but am not very confident, that the year of the first obser-

                                  * See Reports for 1859, Trans. Sect. p. 5.

--vation was 685. The month of Thamuz would begin in the spring. The second

observation was some years later. " On the 25th of Thamuz, Venus ceased to appear
in the west, was unseen for seven days, and on the 2nd of Ab was seen in the east."
"On the 26th of Eiul, Venus ceased to appear in the west, was unseen for eleven

days, and on the 7th of the second Elul was seen in the east." This being an em-
boiismatic year, the day last mentioned was necessarily its 184th day, and was 200
days before the first day of the new year. If, then, this day can be determined from
what is recorded of Venus, the commencement of two Babylonian years out of a
cycle of eight will be determined. The foregoing had been communicated to the
Royal Astronomical Society, but is not yet published. Dr. Hincks now added his
conviction, that by combining those observations with that of the equinox, recorded
on another tablet, a translation of which was given by him in the Transactions of
the Royal Irish Academy, the determination of the year in which any of those obser-
vations took place would determine tbe commencement of every Babylonian year.
The Babylonians were acquainted with the approximate equality of eight tropical
years, five synodic revolutions of Venus, and ninety-nine synodic revolutions of the
moon. The first observation, if in the seventh century before Christ (which is pro-

--bable, though not quite certain later than this it could not be), must have been

     On the brilliant Eruption on the Suns Surface, 1st September 1859.
                            By R. Hodgson, F.R.A.S.

   While observing a group of solar spots on the 1st of September, I was suddenly
surprised at the appearance of a very brilliant star of light, much brighter than the
sun's surface, most dazzling to^the protected eye, illuminating with its light the
upper edges of the adjacent spots, not unlike in effect the edging of the clouds at
sunset : the rays extended in all directions, and the centre might be compared to the
dazzling brilliancy of the bright star a. Lyrre, when seen in a large telescope
with a low power. It lasted five minutes, and disappeared instantaneously
about ll h 25 m a.m. Telescope used an equatorial refractor, Q\ inches aperture,
carried by clockwork. Power single convex lens 100, with pale neutral tint sun-
glass. The whole aperture was used with a diagonal reflector. The phenomenon
was of too short a duration to admit of a micrometrical drawing, but an eye-sketch
was taken from which the enlarged diagram was made.

   The only other observer was Mr. Carrington at the Red Hill Observatory, but a
drawing was made of the spot by the Rev. William Howlett of Hurst Green, at

noon, within half an hour of the occurrence. From a photograph taken at Kew

the previous day, the size (length) of the entire group appears to have been about
2 minutes 8 seconds, or say 60,000 miles.

   The magnetic instruments at Kew and Greenwich were simultaneously disturbed

at the same instant to a considerable extent.

 Prospectus of the Hartwell Variable Star Atlas, with six Specimen Proofs.

                              By John Lee, LL.D.

   The work announced is to form one of a series of quarto volumes, of which
Admiral Smyth's well-known 'iEdes Hartwellianse ' and ' Speculum Hartwellianum'
may be regarded as the commencement. It is to comprise maps of the vicinity of

--all stars of established variability, at the present moment 102 in number. The

light ratio or magnitude scale employed was explained, and six specimen proofs ex-
hibited to the meeting. The scale of projection is unusually large and clear ; 3
inches to one degree, to avoid crowding and confusion. After dwelling at some
length upon the unsatisfactory state of our knowledge of the variable stars, and
making allusion to the most recent researches and discoveries, especially to those of
Professor Argelander, Sir John Herschel, Mr. Hind, and Mr. Pogson, and to the
annual ephemeris of the variable stars published by the last named astronomer for
four years past, Dr. Lee remarked,

  A" variable star usually remains unchanged for several nights, sometimes even

for weeks, when either at maximum or minimum ; and yet, owing to the difficulty

of estimating absolute magnitudes correctly, and still more to the prevalence of haze

and other uncertain atmospheric fluctuations, the most practised eye would fail to

fix at all satisfactorily, either the time or amount of greatest or least brilliancy. By

comparing the variable with neighbouring stars, which are of course similarly affected

by atmospheric influences, most of this uncertainty is however avoided ; and by

careful consideration of the rapidity of increase and of decrease, the time of maximum

or minimum is very closely and easily limited. In order to make such comparisons,

it is requisite to know the absolute magnitudes of the stars of reference pretty cor-

Arectly.    convenient number of stars in each map will therefore have the magni-

tudes annexed in plain figures, omitting the decimal points to prevent their being

mistaken for faint stars ; and it is to render this aid to future observers of variable

stars that the 'Hartwell Atlas' is now being constructed."

On a Plan for Systematic Observations of Temperature in Mountain

                Countries. By John Ball, M.R.I.A.

Several members of the Alpine Club have agreed to unite in a plan of systematic

observations of temperature in the Alps, and such other mountain countries as they

may visit. It is possible that the plan of combined action may eventually be

extended to other objects, but for the present it embraces only such observations as

may be made with thermometers. As the intention of the present paper is merely

to invite the suggestions, and if possible the cooperation, of members of the Physical

Section, it seems unnecessary to state in detail the arrangements which are proposed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and it will be sufficient to indicate generally the points to which it is believed that

the observations about to be commenced may most usefully be directed.

1st. The condition of the upper parts of high mountains in regard to temperature

is most imperfectly known. It may not be possible to learn much by direct con-

tinued observations, but it is thought that by means of self-registering instruments

we may add considerably to the little which is now known. It is proposed to place
such instruments, and especially minimum thermometers, on as many of the higher

peaks of the Alps as possible, and to register their indications in succeeding seasons.

The chief practical difficulty in carrying out this branch of the proposed plan is to

find positions at great heights that are free from winter snow. It will be necessary

to select vertical or nearly vertical rocks in order to attach the instruments thereto,

and these are not always to be found very near to the highest summits of great

mountains.

2nd. It is a matter of much interest, but of considerable difficulty, to obtain

measures of the effect of the lower strata of the atmosphere upon the radiant heat of

the sun. The general opinion of mountain travellers is adverse to the use of the

actinometer in any of the forms in which that instrument has yet been devised, and

the same may be said in regard to other instruments proposed for the same purpose.

The objections to observations with the black bulb thermometers are obvious and

well known, but it is thought that observations made on a uniform plan, and with

instruments of exactly the same dimensions and construction, would give compara-

tive measures which would have some positive value. If it should be possible to
obtain series of such observations made at two stations very different in elevation,'

and exactly simultaneous, they could scarcely fail to give valuable results.

We3rd.      are very ignorant at present as to the mode in which disturbances of
--38 REPORT 1860.

temperature are propagated from one place to another in mountain countries. Con-
siderable variations of temperature are not unfrequent, and sometimes occur very

rapidly, usually if not always in connexion with changes of wind ; but we know very
little of the way in which a disturbance of this kind is transmitted either in the

horizontal or the vertical direction. It is conceived that a network of observations

made by a considerable number of observers scattered over a district, such as Swit-
zerland and Piedmont, would lead to some increase of our knowledge in this respect.

    4th. Observations on the temperature of the surface and upper layers of the soil

have a considerable bearing on many questions connected with the distribution of
plants. One difficulty in investigating these questions arises from the difficulty of
comparing observations not made upon a uniform plan. It is thought that the

adoption of uniform instruments, and a plan of observations previously agreed upon

by all the members of the party, will much increase the value of their results. All

the instruments used in these observations are exactly of uniform construction, and
made by Mr. Casella with the utmost practicable regard to lightness and convenience.
Each instrument is numbered for purposes of future reference.

On Atmospheric Waves. By W. R. Birt, F.R.A.S.

   The object of this communication is rather elucidatory than otherwise. It is now
twelve years since I had the honour to lay before this A>sociation the last of my

reports on the subject. During the interval it has doubtless occupied the attention

of other minds, and some degree of misconception may have arisen which may call

myfor some elucidatory remarks on  part, especially as the series or reports in our

annual volumes has been referred to on the Continent, as establishing a priority of

investigation into these phenomena on the part of the British Association for the

Advancement of Science.

It is now several years since Professor Dove announced as his conviction that the

equilibrium of the atmosphere was maintained in the extra-tropical zones, more by

parallel than superposed currents, that these currents had a shifting transverse or

lateral motion, and in consequence, so to speak, they advanced " sideways." I am

not aware that Professor Dove connected these shifting parallel currents with baro-

metric phenomena, although he did with thermometric. In the course of my inves-

tigations into those phenomena termed atmospheric waves, I ascertained, by carefully
discussing the records of the wind for the greater portion of November 1842, that

not only such parallel compensating currents existed as stated by the Professor, but

that during the period under inquiry, a similar system of parallel and compensating

-- --winds were blowing and moving at right angles to them. The arrangement of these

cross winds was N.E. S.W. and N.W. S.E. I also found that these winds were

intimately connected with barometric pressure, so that when the barometric curve

·was projected and presented the wave form, the mind was led to group under the
general term " atmospheric wave," at least two if not three distinct classes of phe-

nomena. First, the winds succeeding one another, as we know they do with more or

less regularity. Second, the pressure, a more or less continuous fall of the barometer

generally succeeding a gradual and continuous rise : both these phenomena are

capable of being represented by curves, the rising barometer mostly coinciding with

the decreasing force of wind, and the falling barometer with its increase, so that a

rising and falling curve will with more or less fidelity represent the passage over a

station or a tract of country of the two compensating currents of Dove. It is not

the mere rise and fall of the barometer, as such, that constitutes an atmospheric

wave ; the barometric curve itself is doubtless the complex result of two or more

distinct variations of pressure connected with variations of wind as above. When

these are disentangled, the mind is able to grasp the onward march of the two par-

allel winds, accompanied by their respective pressures ; so that true waves of press-

ure really, I apprehend, sweep over a country ; and applying the wave nomenclature,

low pressures have been characterized as troughs and high pressures as crests.

   As illustrative of these remarks, I beg to exhibit on this occasion the most com-

plete instance of opposite pressures that has come under my notice ; it is the opposite

barometric curves at Alten and Lougan during the early part of November 1842 : the

curves will be found on page 39, ' Report,' 1848. I am indebted to Dr. Lee for the

observations furnishing the curve at Alten.

   Observations on the Meteorological Phenomena of the Vernal Equinoctial

                           Week. By M. Du Boulay.

   The author has been engaged for the long period of thirty years in endeavouring
to ascertain whether there could be traced in the winds or weather prevailing about
the equinox, in any given locality, a connexion with, or resemblance to, the winds
and weather generally prevailing during the ensuing summer in the same locality.

He infers from his observations that such is the case, and that the probable character
of the summer in England may be predicated about the 25th of March, by noting
the weather to the equinoctial week then just ended. He gave examples in support

of his views.

       On the Effect of a Rapid Current of Air. By R. Dowden.

       On British Storms, illustrated with Diagrams and Charts.

                       By Admiral FitzRoy, F.R.S.

It is well known that no year passes in which the British islands are not visited by

storms, and that they vary in degree of force from what seamen call a gale to a

hurricane irresistible in violence. Only of late years, however, has it been supposed,

and but recently proved, that nearly all, if not indeed the whole, of these remarkable

tempests, by which a very notable amount of injury has been done, have been so
much alike in character, and have been preceded by such similar warnings, as to

warrant our reasoning inductively from the well-ascertained facts, and thence inferring

laws. Every one looks back to some extraordinary storm as exceeding all others in

--his lifetime; but a tempest that is severely felt in one part of the country is not

always extensive, but usually the reverse, more or less limited in area, varying in

range, direction, and force. It would be tedious to advert to some of even the most
devastating tempests in much detail, therefore I propose to take three only as types,

and glance summarily over their most marked features, hoping that the diagrams

suspended around or lying on the table will supply enough additional facts. The

first storm to which I would ask attention in passing is that so well and so fully

described by De Foe, in 1703. He calls it (page 11) "the greatest, the longest in

duration, the widest in extent of all the tempests and storms that history gives any

account of since the beginning of time       Our barometers," he continues, " in-

formed us that the night would be very tempestuous; the mercury sank lower than
ever I had observed it on any occasion " (page 25) ; it fell to 28 - 47 (page 30). This

storm began at south and veered through the west towards north, round to the south,

and then continued between south-west and north-west, with more or less strength,

for a  whole  week                           Very remarkable it is that not only did De Foe suppose this
                                          !

storm began near the southern coast of North America, but that it traversed England,

France, and the Baltic, to lose itself in the Arctic regions. He recurs afterwards

to its shifting from south-west to north-west, and coming from the west like other

storms in the south of England, but does not advert to any corresponding north-

easterly wind, nor had he evidently any idea of a rotitory or circulating atmospheric

current. Probably accounts from the north of England were much less attainable

then ; but it is noted that the north of England escaped the violence of that storm.

I cannot now take more from De Foe, but venture to say that his graphic accounts
of many storms, and the more comprehensive views of Dampier, are well worth the

notice of even scientific meteorologists. To Franklin, Capper, Redfield, Reid, and

Dove, besides other authorities, seamen may well be grateful ; for their works, and

those compiled from them, are facts and inferences at present trusted because demon-

strated to be indisputably true.

It is now necessary that other storms should be noticed, and in a much more

precise manner; but two alone will probably suffice as types. The 'Royal Charter'

gale, so recent in our recollection, so remarkable in its features, and so complete in its

illustrations, I may say, from the fact of its having been noted at so many parts of

our coast, and because the storm passed over the middle of the country, is one of

the easiest to deal with which has occurred for some length of time. I would

therefore ask for a few minutes' attention to this particular instance. There are

four diagrams among those on the wall which refer particularly to the 25th and the
--40 REPORT 1860.

26th of October last. Referring to the charts and the diagrams, it will be seen that
the lowest barometer and a corresponding or simultaneous lull prevailed over ten,
fifteen, or twenty miles successively in the direction I have pointed out. But at the
 time that this comparative lull existed, there was around this central space what by
 some is called a vortex, but can hardly be appropriately termed a vortex, because
 there was no central disturbance : there were only variable winds or calm for a short
time in the middle of this space, which was about ten or fifteen miles across. The
wind obtained a maximum velocity of from sixty to one hundred miles an hour, at a
 distance of twenty to fifty miles from this comparatively quiet space, and in suc-
 cessive meteoric eddyings crossed England towards the north-north-east, the wind
 blowing from all points of the compass around the lull, so that while at Anglesea
 the storm came from the north-north-east, in the Straits of Dover it was from the
 south-west; on the east coast it was easterly ; in the Irish Channel it was northerly,
 and on the coast of Ireland it was from the north-west. The charts show that there
 was a similar circulation, or cyclonic commotion, going or passing northwards from
 the 25th to the 27th, being two complete days from the time of its first appearance
 in (what is called) " the chops of the Channel," while outside of this circulation the
 wind became less and less violent; and it is very remarkable that, even so near
 as on the west coast of Ireland, they had fine weather, with light winds, while in the
 British Channel it blew a northerly and westerly gale. At Galway and at Limerick
 on that occasion there were light winds only, I repeat, while over England the wind
 was passing in a tempest, blowing from all parts of the compass around a central
 similar " lull." The next storm that occurred was similar in its features, though it

 came from a slightly different direction. This storm was on the 1st and 2nd of No-
 vember, and its character was in all respects like that just described, now usually
 called the " Charter Gale." It came more from the westward, passed across the
 north of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the north of England, and then went off across
 the North Sea towards Denmark. Further than that distance facts have not yet
 been gathered ; but, no doubt, in the course of a few months they will be.

    The general effect of these storms fell unequally on our islands, and less inland than
 on the coasts. Lord Wrottesley has shown, by the observations made at his Observa-
 tory in Staffordshire, that the wind is diminished or checked by its passages over
 land ; and looking to the mountain ranges of Wales and Scotland, rising 2000, 3000,
 or 4000 feet above the level of the sea, we see they must have great power to alter the
 direction, and probably the velocity of wind, independently of the alterations caused
 by the changes of temperature. The very remarkable similarities of this storm of the
 1st and 2nd of November and that of the 25th and 26th of October, the series of storms
 investigated by Dr. Lloyd during ten years, and the investigations of Mr. William
  Stevenson in Berwickshire, require especial notice on this occasion. There is no
  discrepancy between the results of the ten years' investigations published by Dr. Lloyd
 in the Transactions of the Irish Academy, the three years' investigations published

 by Mr. W. Stevenson, and all the investigations which have been brought together

 during the last four years. They all tell the same story. Dr. Lloyd only found in

 ten years one instance even of a partial storm which differed ; namely, one storm

 that came from the north in the first instance. Storms from the south-west are
 followed by sudden and dangerous storms from the north and east ; and these storms
 from the north and east do much damage on our coasts. Upon tracing the facts, it
 is proved that the storms which come from the west and south come on gradually,

  but that storms from the north and east begin suddenly, and often with extraordinary

 force. The barometer, with these north-eastern storms, does not give so much warn-
  ing upon this coast, because it ranges higher than with the wind from the opposite
 quarter. But though the barometer does not give much indication of a north-east
  storm, the thermometer does; and the known average temperature of every week in
 the year affords the means at once, from the temperature being much above or below

  the mean of the time of the year, of showing whether the wind will be northerly or

  southerly (thanks to Mr. Glaisher's Greenwich observations).

    Now to revert to a few of the signs which preceded the ' Charter gale.' For a

 few days before that storm came on, the thermometer was exceedingly low in a

  great part of the country ; there were north winds in some places, and a good deal

  of snow ; but nothing else extraordinary. There had been a great deal of exceed-

  ingly dry and hot weather previously. These facts, of course, require consider-
               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                    41

ation, but not now. I may just mention, that over our islands, and especially' in

the north of Ireland, at that time, on the 22nd and 23rd of October, barometers

were very low. Many days preceding the ' Charter storm,' an extraordinary clear-

--ness in the atmosphere was noticed in the north of Ireland the mountains of

Scotland were never seen so prominently as they were in the few days preceding

those on which the great storm took place. Every one is aware that last summer

Was remarkable for its warmth : it was exceedingly dry and hot. All over the

world, not only in the Arctic, but in the Antarctic regions, in Australia, South

America, in the West Indies, Bermudas, and elsewhere, auroras and meteors were

more or less prevalent, and they were more remarkable in their features and appear-

ances than had been noticed for many years. There was also an extraordinary dis-

turbance of the current along the telegraph wires. They were so disturbed at times,

that it was evident there were great electric or magnetic storms in the atmosphere

which could be traced to no apparent cause. Lord Wrottesley, in his Address, adverted

to some extraordinary facts respecting various circulating substances apparently

absorbed by the sun. Perhaps these electric disturbances were connected with the

peculiar action of the sun upon our atmosphere. Electrical wires above ground, as

well as submarine wires, were unusually disturbed, and these disturbances were

followed within two or three days by great commotions in the atmosphere, or by

some remarkable change.

  --I will now refer to another subject the question of areas or lines of barometric

pressure. Professor Espy, of the United States, contends for a long line from north

to south, or from one direction straight to another, and not only Espy but also
some among our own countrymen. The principal object of making these sections,

as it were soundings, of the atmosphere, shown in the diagrams, was to prove

whether lines of pressure, or whether areas of pressure prevailed ; and I think,
when they are all closely looked into, they go to prove that while the atmosphere

in the British islands varied in its pressure from time to time, such variation was

not on a particular line, but extended over a large area. Before I leave this part of

the subject, I may say, as some of the remarkable exceptions to the force of these

particular storms, that at some places there was little or no wind ; the barometer

fell much, but there was no storm, for the wind circulating around these districts

did not affect them, while at other places the storm was tremendous. It has been

-- --often asked whether the ship that was lost the ' Royal Charter ' might have been

saved ; and I will give an instance of what another ship did which took ordinary pre-

cautions on that night. Whether the ' Royal Charter ' did take the right course it

is not for me to say, but I hold in my hand the details of another kind of manage-

ment within ten miles of the ' Royal Charter ' that night. The commander of this
vessel, a sailing-ship and not a steam-ship (the 'Royal Charter' had the double advan-

tage), was guided by the instructions laid down by Capt. Maury, who has treated

the subject of winds in a practical manner, and has brought together a large amount

of useful information ; and although, as I am aware, he occasionally theorises when

he has not facts enough for philosophy, as a practical man he has been guided by

plain principles, intelligible to seamen generally. Unquestionably, Maury has

brought together a great deal of valuable information, and made it generally avail-

able. The following paper has come into my hands within the last few days very

opportunely :

"Having had many threatenings of bad weather for several days past, I began to

apply your views as to storms                                                                                                                   and not having much sea-room, I considered them
                                                                                                                                             ;

more closely. For three or four days before the 26th of October, we had very

squally weather, with frequent sharp flashes of lightning from east to north-east.

During the night of the 24th, I stood to the northward, and till noon of the 25th,
with the wind strong from east-north-east. At noon I tacked, thinking that if the
gale should come on, I might take the off-shore tack in the night, and have the

vortex of the gale to the south-eastward. I stood on, therefore, till half-past five p.m.,

and then wore ship under short sail, when in a line with Holyhead and Bardsey,

about ten miles or so distant from Holyhead, as near as I could judge, being thick
and dark. At eight p.m., gale increasing, I took in close-reefed main topsail, and
fore topmast stay-sail, having nothing then set but the main spencer and a small

storm-mizen. It blew a complete West-India hurricane, but I drove off-shore, and

I thought the force of the storm did not increase. I now think, from what other
--42 REPORT 1860.

ships suffered which were to the northward of me at the same time, that further

from nie it blew harder. I did not suffer any damage, whatever more than usual in
ordinary blows; only a little chafe and some spray. The lightning alluded to above
was very unnatural in its appearance, being of such a sharp flashing glare, without
leaving off. Unless looking at the exact place of its flash, you could not tell from

where the light actually came.

                                   (Signed) "William J. Johns, Commanding the Ship."

   " William Camming, U. S."

These two instances are important ; one of a ship managed in accordance with

instructions published for seamen, being saved, while the other, which adopted a

different course, was lost. There is one special instance on which not only private

but public interests were at stake, and where the ship to which I allude was seriously

injured. There was one of Her Majesty's ships, a 90-gun ship, fitted up with steam-

engine and other appliances, in the Atlantic, in the early part of October last. That

Aship had very bad weather near the edge of the Gulf-stream.  succession of circling

storms occurred, and in every instance the ship was managed in direct opposition

to the known laws of storms, was considerably damaged, and obliged to return.

Now, that is a fact which ought not to have occurred in the British Navy at the

present day. It might have been that there was some reason for such usually in-

correct proceeding in one instance; but that there should have been any reason in

three successive instances is more than we can conceive : any one can estimate the

amount of expense caused by a ship so brought back to England from tier destination.

The simple rule of seamanship is when facing the wind the centre of the storm will be to

the right or on the rigid hand, therefore you should go to the left. In the southern

hemisphere the centre is on the left hand, and you must go to the right, supposing

that sea-room and circumstances enable you to choose. But these, simple results

are the consequence of very great consideration on the part of scientific persons,

--particularly Sir W. Reid, Redfield, Capper, Espy, Dr. Lloyd, and others, especially

those in India, who have done so much, viz. Piddington and Thorn. In this
country no one has effected more than Sir W. Reid, who collected together all that
had been done for many years, and published in a clear manner the results of his
accumulated investigations. A very remarkable srorm has been lately traced by

Mr. Rowell, of Oxford, and his description published within the last few days. This
storm occurred near Calne in Wiltshire, cutting through fields and trees, and in one
place actually lifted a broad-wheeled waggon from the road over a hedge into the next
fieldl The violence of the wind was confined to a limited line. The downward and

onward pressure of the wind was so great in that locality, that it acquired such
elasticity as to lift opposing weights and carry them on. I have known such things

Wemyself. I have known the wind lift a boat into the air and shake it to pieces.

have all heard of houses being unroofed, of trees torn up by the force of the wind ;

but this is the first time I have heard of a heavy waggon being lifted up and hurled

over a hedge.

I will only venture to make one or two observations in reference to the theory

of these subjects. Dove, in his work, shows how currents of wind, parallel cur-

Arents, as he calls them, co-exist.  great polar current coming from the north

and east is passing in one direction, while a current from the tropical regions is

going in the other direction, nearly opposite ; but to follow the theoretical consider-

ations of how these great currents move from the Arctic regions towards the tropics

and return to the Arctic regions, is a subject too large for the present limited time.
Dove has shown most clearly in his work (which is translated into English), that
circulation of the atmosphere in great polar and equatorial or tropical currents, pre-
vail not only in our hemisphere, but everywhere. I can bear witness that his
reasonings and particular views can be corroborated in every part of the world.

   The British Association has made application to Her Majesty's Government to
authorize arrangements for communicating warning of storms from one part of the

country to the other; and, in conclusion, I will read the details of that arrange-

ment which promises to be so beneficial. Arrangements have been authorized
by the Board of Trade (under a minute from the President, dated June 6), in conse-

quence of which a daily and mutual interchange of certain Unfiled meteorological

information will be transmitted between London and Paris, the results of five
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              43

subsidiary communications to the central stations of Paris and London. Authority

being thus given to collect and communicate, by the telegraph, particular meteoro-

logical intelligence, a commencement may be made on the 1st of September, as the

plan proposed is simple, and the machinery is ready. Once a day, at about nine

a.m., barometer and thermometer heights, state of weather, and direction of wind

will be telegraphed to London, from the most distant ends of our longest wires,

namely, Aberdeen, Berwick, Hull, Yarmouth, Dover, Portsmouth, Jersey, Plymouth,

Penzance, Cork, Galway, Londonderry, and Greenock. Facts sent thus from five of

these places, will be put into one telegram, and sent to Paris immediately, when a

corresponding communication will be made from the southward Atlantic coasts.

When threatening signs are not apparent, no further notice will be transmitted to

or from London on that day, respecting weather. But when indications are such

--as to warrant some cautionary signal at a certain part of, or along all our coasts,

the words "Caution, North" (or "South") will be sent to some of the thirteen

places specified, or to all of them, on the receipt of which a cone (or triangle) will

be hoisted at a staff (point up for north, down for south), indicating the side whence

wind may be expected. This signal will be repeated along part of the coast by the

Coast Guard, at such of their stations as may be authorized (at most of their stations

flagstaff's are visible to coasters). Danger will be implied by a drum (or square), a

cone, and perhaps, in addition, very great danger by a cone, a drum, and a second

cone. [The cones and drums may be made with hoops and black canvas, to collapse,

without top or bottom. They will be the same in shape from all points of view,

and unlike any other signal, such as a time-ball, used ordinarily.] As the Coast

Guard extends all along the frequented parts of our shores, and as the telegraph

companies are liberally willing to have instruments and signals placed at their ex-

treme stations, in charge of and used by their officials, only the necessary materials

and instructions will be required, all of which are ready or in progress. By vigilance

at the central station, and by taking great care to avoid signalling too frequently,

much may be done towards diminishing the losses of life on our increasingly crowded

coasts. Property alone may be duly insured, but every wise precaution for the safety

of life should, of course, be used. As an auxiliary measure, a concise Manual of

Instructions for the Barometer will be circulated among maritime communities;
who, though they may have frequent access to " weather-glasses " of various kinds,

do not generally know how to use them most advantageously. The following details
may be useful, as well as interesting, to those who wish to investigate these subjects

--and examine the diagrams more critically : The probable limits of error of the

barometric curves on the synoptic sheets, 21st of October-- 2nd of November 1859.

The observations at the regular observatories, such as Greenwich, Oxford, Cam-

bridge, Highfield House, Kew, &c, have had all corrections applied, and have been

reduced to sea-level, and the temperature of 32°. The returns from members of the

British and Scottish Meteorological Societies (neatly ninety in number) have nearly

all been corrected for the exact height above sea-level, all within a few feet. The

corrections due to instrumental errors and reduction to 32° have (in most cases I

believe) been applied by the observers. The Continental observations have been

collected partly from the Dutch papers and partly from the ' Moniteur.' Those from

the former have been reduced to 32°, and, it may be presumed, have also been cor-

rections due to those heights have been applied, and others are known to be little, if

at all, above the sea-level. Any error in laying down a curve from such data can

scaicely exceed two or three hundredths of an inch. The observations obtained

from the ' Moniteur ' it is assumed are given duly corrected. The heights of the stations

of ordinary observers are known for the most part pretty nearly, and corrections for

such heights have been applied to the returns. Other corrections have only been

being deemed worthy of any further correction. Those returns, however, of which

the barometrical observations are evidently erroneous (from comparison with other

more reliable neighbouring and contemporaneous obsevations), have been rejected

altogether. On the whole, we may safely assume that even these observations,

as laid down, are less than a tenth in error. The heights of the lantern above the

sea-level and of the tower, from the base to the vane, being known, the probable

height of the barometer can be ascertained. The proper correction for the height

On the Similarity of the Lunar Curves of Minimum Temperature at Green-

    tvich and Utrecht in the Year 1859. By J. Park Harrison, M.A.

   The author showed that, on the mean of twelve lunations, in 1859 the greatest
amount of cold displayed itself at both the above-named stations between full and
new moon : the difference between the mean minimum temperatures of the first and
second halves of the lunation at Greenwich being 20- 4 ; at Utrecht 2°"0. There were
two minima for night temperature both at Greenwich and Utrecht ; they followed on
full moon and last quarter. The least amount of cold was at first quarter. The
difference between the minimum temperatures at first quarter and shortly after last
quarter, on a mean of twelve observations taken at both stations, was nearly 7°. The
difference in the means of the mean temperature of the day for forty-three years for
the two periods of fourteen days, at the former place had been previously found to

be l°-l.

   Mr. Harrison expressed increased conviction that effects so contrary to expectation
must be due to the presence or absence of cloud, or to its height above the earth,

to whatever cause this phenomenon may ultimately be assigned.

    On the Principles of Meteorology. By Professor Hennessy, F.R.S.

   The author contended that the principal object of meteorology was the prediction of
the weather within certain probable limits. The great complication of atmospherical
phenomena, and the influence of remote causes of disturbance, would undoubtedly
render this extremely difficult. Although the atmosphere is itself one of the best
examples of an unorganized body to which we could refer, yet its complicated and
fluctuating phenomena suggest to us the mode in which such phenomena should be
investigated. Any success could be expected only by treating the atmosphere very
nearly as an organized body, and studying its abnormal conditions with the same
continuity and generality of observation as is usually employed in physiology. Ob-
servations made at stated hours have been found by themselves rarely capable of
affording means to foretell the future conditions of the weather for even short

periods of time. A careful study of the appearances of the sky, such as has been

so long familiar to mariners and others interested in the conditions of our atmo-

sphere, would, when made by men well prepared with preliminary knowledge of

the principles of physical science, throw far more light upon the chief object of our
search. Mr. Hennessy illustrated this remark by referring to some such observations
which he had made during the month of June. Although he had at first consi-
derable scepticism as to the possibility of obtaining correct results from the continuous
photographical registration of atmospherical conditions, Mr. Hennessy was satisfied,
from what he had witnessed during 1856 in the Radcliffe Observatory, that such a
system was not only possible, but that it sometimes disclosed important changes

which would have escaped the method of observation at stated hours. He instanced

the connexion between the phenomena of thunder-storms and sudden barometric
depressions, as pointed out by the late Radcliffe Observer at the Glasgow Meeting,
and the connexion between days of great solar irradiation and minute vertical

atmospheric currents, as pointed out by himself*. He concluded by pointing out
the manner in which, from the increasing knowledge we possess of the influence of

the ocean upon climate, the greater stability of its currents, compared to those of the

atmosphere, may under the peculiar conditions of the British islands enable us to
foresee many important changes within comparatively extended periods of timet.

the least chance of success, I shall urge the sending from this country an exploring

expedition to the eight millions of unknown square miles about the South Pole. I

hope that my letter to you upon the subject was sufficiently clear to satisfy your

mind, and conclusive to enlist your influence with Her Majesty's Government and

the English people in the cause of Antarctic exploration. It is an enterprise in which

the British nation may well take the lead, for it is nearer to them than to the rest of the

world. There is Melbourne, your great commercial mart, that is already, in amount

of shipping, a rival of Liverpool. It is within less than two weeks' run by steamer

from the borders of this unknown region. So, you observe that these eight millions

of unknown square miles lie at your door, and the responsibility of permitting them

so to lie longer will lie there loo. " You go ; we'll come." An expedition might

be sent from Australia with little or no risk. Two propellers, or even two vessels

with auxiliary steam-power, might be sent out, so as to spend our three winter

months in looking for a suitable point along the Antarctic Continent to serve as a

point of departure for over-land, or over-ice parties. Having found one or more

such places, vessels, properly equipped for land and ice and boat expeditions, might

be sent the next season, there to remain, seeking to penetrate the barrier, whether

of mountain or of ice, or both, until the next season, when they might be relieved by

a fresh party, or return home to compare notes, and be governed accordingly. You
know the barometer at all those places which have a rainy and a dry season, stands

highest in the dry, lowest in the wet. Now, I do not find any indications that the

Antarctic barometer has months of high range : it is low all the year. Therefore

if I be right in ascribing the apparent tenuity of the air there to the heat that is

liberated during the condensation of vapour, from the heavy precipitation that is con-

--stantly taking place along the sea front of those " barriers " we should be correct

in inferring that the difference in temperature between the Antarctic summer and

winter is not very marked. If, in a case like this, we might be permitted to indulge

the imagination, we might fancy the " barrier" to be a circular range of mountains,

and that beyond these lies the great Antarctic basin. Beyond this range, as beyond
the Andes, we may fancy a rainless region, as in Peru,-- a region of clear skies and

mild climates. Though the air in passing this range might be reduced below the

utmost degree of Arctic cold, yet being robbed of its vapour, it would receive as

sensible the latent heat thereof. Passing off to the Polar slope of these mountains,

this air then would be dry air ; descending into the valleys, and coming under the

barometric pressure at the surface, it would be warm air. Leslie has explained how,

by bringing the attenuated air down from the snow-line, even of the tropics/and

subjecting it to the barometric weight of the superincumbent mass, we may raise its

temperature to intertropical heat by the mere pressure. In like manner, this Ant-

arctic air, though cold and rare while crossing the "barrier," yet receiving heat

from its vapours as they are condensed, passing over into the valleys beyond, and

Webeing again subjected to normal pressure, may become warm.  have abundant

illustrations of the modifying influences upon climate which winds exercise after

having passed mountains and precipitated their vapour. The winds which drop the

waters of the Columbia river, &c. on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains,
make a warm climate about their base on this side, so much so that we find in Pied-

mont Nebraska the lizards and reptiles of Northern Texas. Indeed, trappers tell me
that the Upper Missouri is open in fall long after the Lower is frozen up, and in

spring long before-- several weeks--the ice in the more southern parts has broken
up. The eastern slopes of Patagonia afford even a more striking illustration of

climates being tempered by winds that descend from the mountains, bearing with them

the heat that their vapour has set free. Thus you observe, that an exploring party

after passing the barrier might, as they approach the pole, find the Antarctic climate

to grow milder instead of colder. It would be rash in the present state of our in-

formation to assert that such is the case j but that such may be the case should not
be ignored by the projectors and leaders of any new expedition to those regions.
The existence of an open sea in the Arctic ocean has, with a great degree of proba-

bility, been theoretically established. But the circumstances, as strong as they are,
which favour the existence of an open water there, are not so strong and direct as
are the proofs and indications of a mild polar climate in the Antarctic regions. I

have examined the immense library of log-books here for the lines of Antarctic ice-

 drift. There appear to be two, both setting to the north-east, one passing by the

 Falkland Islands, the other having its northern terminus in the regions about the

 Cape of Good Hope. Further south, icebergs are found all around; but in these
 lines of drift thry are found nearest the equator. The space between the Falkland
drift and the Good Hope drift is an unfrequented part of the ocean. It may there-
 fore be one broad drift, the edges of which only I have pointed out. The most active
 currents from the south do not run with this ice. Humboldt's current is the most
active, but it does not get its icebergs as far north as they come by these lices.
This circumstance has suggested the conjecture that one part of the Antarctic Con-
tinent must be peculiarly well situated for the formation of glaciers and the launching

myof icebergs. These lines of drift point to such a place. The facts stated in

former letter will, I trust, when considered in connexion with these views, impress
you with the importance of the subject. So, trusting, and hoping that you will juin

with me in the cry, " Ho for the South Pole!"

On the Climates of the Antarctic Regions, as indicated by Observations upon

   the Height of the Barometer and Direction of the Winds at Sea. By

    Captain Maury, U.S. Navy.

   In the course of my labours connected with the wind and current charts, I had

caused to be grouped 1,213,933 observations upon the direction of the wind at sea.
 Each one of these observations embraces a period of eight hours, and aims to give

the prevailing direction of the wind during that time. Thus each individual of my

group is, in fact, itself the mean of many. The result of the whole is presented
diagrametrically in Plate I., in which the mean direction of the wind in each belt,
and for the four quarters, is represented by the arrows correctly, both as to mean

direction and average duration.

    From the labours of Lieut. Andrau and his colleagues at the Meteorological In-
stitute of the Netherlands*, I obtained 83,332 observations upon the barometer be-
tween the parallels of 50° N. and 36° S. at sea. This fine series was enriched by the
observations at Greenwich, St. Petersburg, and HobartTown on shore, and by Dr.
Kane, Sir James Clark Ross, and Lieut. Wilkes at sea, du;ing their Arctic and Ant-
arctic explorations. From these the barometric profile of the atmosphere (Plate I.)
was constructed.

    The barometric observations on shore were not found in all cases to accord with
those at sea. Moreover, those of Wilkes and Ross were the means of observations

for only a few days.

   Our ' Marine Magazine,' as the precious store of abstract logs may be called, con-
tained many more, and which, by their great numbers, and in consequence of their
having been made at all seasons of the year, would afford better mean results. In

ex'ension of Andrau's series, I therefore added 6915, between the parallels of 40°
and 6i)° south, from the log-books of this office. These, Andrau's, and Dr. Kane's
in the ice, form the elements of the Barometric Curve, Plate II.

    Proceeding upon the supposition that, with regard to the general movements and
the mean status of the atmosphere, we should have at sea the rule, on land the ex-
ceptions, I commenced to group these observations for discussion.

   As the North Indian Ocean, the China and West India seas, where the monsoons
blow, are known to present exceptional cases to the general movements of the winds
at sea, the observations for them were excluded from the general summing up.

   Thus premising, the winds were taken from the pilot charts and grouped in belts
5° of latitude broad. As a rule, the vessels that are cooperating with us seldom go
on the Polar side of 6CP north or south ; for our fleet of observers consists for the

most part of merchantmen, whom the channels of trade do not carry beyond these

parallels ; consequently the observations of the winds were arranged in 24 belts
(12 on each side of the Equator); all the observations between the Equator and
5° north, for example, being in one belt ; and so on for every 5° of latitude.

   Now, considering that the general movements of the atmosphere, as exhibited by

the winds at sea, are to and fro between the Equator and the Poles, all these obser-
vations were arranged in two groups for each belt, and classed either as winds with
northing, or as winds with southing, in them, as per Table, showing the average

--48 REPORT 1860.

sea to be remarkably accordant, that the atmosphere is much more attenuated in

austral than in boreal regions ; and that the high barometer, with the light airs
and baffling winds of the tropical calm belts, is the dividing atmospherical ridge, so

to speak, between the low barometer about the Pole on one side and near the Equator

on the other ; and that the position of this ridge is determined by the degree of
polar in contrast with the degree of equatorial rarefaction. The trade-winds rushing

--in on one side, and the couuter trades on the other as the polar- bound winds may
--be called supply the indraught for these places of attenuated air and low baro-

meter.

It thus appears that the equatorial calm belt is a sort of thermal adjustment be-

tween the calms of Cancer and Capricorn ; which in turn are in adjustment to the
dynamical power of the ascending columns of air in the equatorial and polar calm

places.

   The low barometer off Cape Horn has long attracted the attention of navigators.
The low barometer in other longitudes south caused Wilkes, Ross, and others, to

remark upon the diminished pressure in high southern latitudes, and upon the ap-

parent inequality in the distribution of the atmosphere north and south of the

Equator.

   The barometric observations between 40° and 60° South, and which are quoted

--in the preceding Table, were collected in three groups first, from the logs between

the Cape of Good Hope and Australia, next from Australia to 80° West, and then

about Cape Horn. The result showed that a low barometer is not peculiar to Cape

Horn regions, but that it is general and circumferential in austral latitudes, dimi-
nishing rapidly as we approach the Pole.

   The great extent of the austral water surface, with the vapour with which it
keeps the " brave west winds" of these regions loaded, and the heat which with the

condensation of these vapours is liberated there, suggests the cause of this low

barometer.

    If it be the vapour and the liberation of its latent heat that cause the permanent

expulsion from Antarctic regions of so much of the atmosphere as this curve and
these observations indicate, then should we not follow the argument up, and infer

that the extreme cold of the Antarctic climate is by no means so severe as that of the

north ?

   The unexplored regions of the south embrace an area of more than eight million

square miles, or about one-sixth of the whole extent of the dry land surface that is

contained on our planet.

   Since the attempts to penetrate those unknown regions, steam has been intro-
duced upon the ocean, and the modern explorer has at his command a power which

enables him to defy wind and tide. Hygiene on board ship has been so improved,

that the sailor may now keep the sea for almost an indefinite period of time. The

invention, the discoveries, and the improvements of the age, place in our hands the

means of fitting out Antarctic expeditions, and of endowing them with powers that
would have made any previous expedition there doubly effective.

   Under these circumstances, would it not be a reproach upon the Christian nations,

and especially upon those great governments who have agreed to unite in a common

plan of physical research at sea, if so large a portion of the earth's surface were

permitted to remain unexplored ?

   Plate III. shows the furthest reach of Antarctic exploration. The tracks of Ant-
arctic explorers, from Cook down to the present day, go to make up these limits.

It is not the object of this paper to elaborate the views suggested by the observations

offered with this paper ; but rather to present the observations themselves, with

such explanation as seemed necessary to enable others to understand them.

If I have succeeded in doing this, all who will take the trouble to study them will

find them very suggestive.                M. F. Maury.

variations in its temperature, first observed in the descent of the lead which covers

the south side of the choir of Bristol Cathedral, and communicated by me to the

Royal Society in the year 1855, I have since confirmed by the following experi-

myment. I fixed a deal board, 9 feet long and 5 inches broad, to the south side of

house, so as to form an inclined plane, and upon it placed a sheet of lead, turning
its edges down over the edges of the board, and taking care that it should not bind
upon it, but be free to move with no other obstruction than that which arose from

its friction. The inclination of the board was 18° 32', the thickness of the lead was

one-eighth of an inch, and its weight 28 lbs. The lower end of the board was

brought opposite to an upper window, and a "vernier" was constructed which

could be read from within, and by wrhich the position of the lead upon the board

could be determined to the 100th of an inch. I began to measure the descent of the

lead on the 1 6th of February, 1858, and recorded it every morning between seven

and eight o'clock, and every evening between six and seven until the 28th of June.

The lead had descended between the 1 6th of February and the 30th of April (a

period of seventy-four days) 10'Gl inches, being an average daily descent of "1433

inch. On the 4th of May it was drawn up the board again to its first position.

Between that date and the 28th of June (a period of fifty-five days) it had descended

11*97 inches, being an average daily descent of *217o" inch. Its descent was far

from uniform, being on some days scarcely (if at all) perceptible, and on others

amounting to nearly half an inch. The average daily descents in successive months

from February to June were in

                                             inch.

   Every variation in the temperature of the lead contributed to its descent. The

extreme temperatures of the day and the night could not therefore determine its

daily motion ; for with the same extremes of day and night temperature, there may

be great differences in the number and amount of the intervening variations of tem-

perature. It is the effect of these daily variations of temperature, up and down, by
which the descent of the lead totalizes. Although, therefore, we are to look for the

influence of the extremes of day and night temperature upon the daily descent, we

are also to look for that of the variations between each two extremes. I accordingly
remarked that it was on days when a thermometer in the sun varied its height

rapidly and often, that the lead descended most. On the contrary, when the sky

was open and the heat advanced and receded uniformly, the descent was less, although
the difference of the extreme temperatures might be greater. It was least of all
when there was continuous rain. During the night the descent of the lead was

often imperceptible. I have explained the descent of the lead in a paper published
in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society ' for April 1855.

   If we suppose the sheet of lead to become ice, and its dimensions to be increased
20,000 times, and if for the board on which it rests we substitute a mountain side lying

Hat a slope of 18*°, we shall have a glacier mile broad, 200 feet deep and 34 miles

long, and which in no other respect than as it regards its length will be an exaggera-
tion. By converting the lead into ice, its physical properties will, however, have been
in some important particulars changed. It will have become twice as dilatable as lead

is, that is, it will dilate twice as much by a given variation of temperature when un-

opposed as lead does*. It will have become a more elastic substance than lead is, that
is, it will be capable of overcoming a greater force opposed to its dilatation under a
given change of temperature. It will have lost its ductility and have become friable,
that is, its parts will have become more liable to separation from one another and
its mass to disintegration. But, together with the last-mentioned quality, it will
have acquired the property (called regelation) of easily, and under a moderate press-
ure, returning from a state of disintegration to one of solidity ; which qualities of

friability and regelation have been shown by the experiments of Professor Tyndall

to be sufficient (the requisite force " a tergo " being supposed) to account for its

crushing its way through contractions in its channel, and reconstructing itself at the

Nowbottom of ice-cataracts.  such a glacier, if it be supposed penetrable to external

heat as lead is, could not but descend as lead does. In its descent portions of it

would be thrust forward and compressed, and others would be dragged behind and

crevassed. The melting of the lower part of such a glacier would favour its descent

as compared with the lead whose mass remains unchanged. All these conditions

might, however, be influenced by variations in the form of its channel and the incli-

nation of its bed. Its motion would be like that of a snail clinging, but descending.

   The whole question, however, depends upon the penetrability of the glacier to

external heat. On this point we have the high authority of Professor Forbes,

founded on three series of observations on the motions of the Mer de Glace and the

Glaciers des Bossons and des Bois. Of these observations, made in the summers of

1842 and 1844, he has recorded the results in his 'Travels in Savoy' (2nd ed.

p. 141), and in his recent work entitled ' On the Theory of Glaciers ' (p. 131) ; and

he has compared them with the mean daily temperatures of the air as recorded at
Geneva and the Great St. Bernard. He has, moreover, represented the relation

between the average daily motions of these glaciers, and the average daily tempera-

tures of the air at the corresponding periods by means of diagrams, which it is im-

possible to look at, however cursorily, without being struck with the fact (not to be

better expressed than in the words of Mr. Forbes himself), that they establish a
" close relation between the mean temperature of any portion of the year, and the

velocity of the glacier corresponding to it*." Moreover, it is not only on the sur-
face of the glacier that this relation may be considered to have been observed. The

glacier moves with different velocities at different depths ; but all are related to its

surface motion, so that the influence of variations of temperature, if felt on its sur-

face, must penetrate throughout its depth. Being dilatable as lead is (but in a

higher degree), and being thus shown to be sensible to variations of temperature

throughout its mass, it cannot but descend as lead uuder the like circumstances does.

Every variation of temperature, however slight, cannot but produce a corresponding

descent, and such small variations, often enough repeated, might produce a descent,

however great, even although at each change the glacier returned to the same tem-

perature. The oscillation of the heat backwards and forwards is all that is required.

For the purpose of this argument, the fact that a relation exists between the motion

of a glacier and the external temperature is all that is required. It is not necessary

to enter on a discussion of the causes out of which that relation arises.

     On Thermo -barometers, compared with Barometers at great Heights.

                          By M. R. de Schlagintweit.

   M. Robert de Schlagintweit communicated some of the results which he had de-

duced from comparisons of the boiling-point with direct barometric readings. These
observations, taken by his brothers and himself during their journeys in India, the

Himalaya, &c, at various heights and different periods, were chiefly made to test by-

direct experiments the correctness of the tables of the boiling-point of water corre-
sponding to barometric pressure, of which the latest and the most detailed ones are
those of Magnus, Regnault, and Moritz.

   Direct observations had been previously made in India, particularly by Colonel
Sykes ; in America, Mr. Wisse made such experiments up to 14,000 feet; in High
Asia, Messrs. de Schlagintweit had occasion to carry on such observations up to

heights exceeding 18,600 feet.

  A resulting Table of comparison was presented, an examination of which showed

that, for all practical purposes, the tables quoted above are quite accurate enough,
though for great heights, they contain an error ; the correction to be applied is

small, and additive. The instruments with which Messrs. de Schlagintweit made
their observations, were expressly made for the purpose ; they ranged from 100° Cels.
to 78° Cels., but had a length of 1 foot 9 inches, so that it was possible to divide
each degree into fifty parts directly. M. de Schlagintweit drew attention to the
accuracy of the results obtainable by these delicate thermo-barometers, which, as
far as his experience goes, he considered to be quite comparable to the barometer, if
used with all the necessary precautions, though for daily variations the barometer
is preferable on account of the greater facility of reading. The circumstance that
the thermo-barometer is much less liable to get out of order, makes it a most valu-

able instrument for travellers.

On Practical Experience of the Law of Storms in each Quarter of the Globe.
                         By Captain W. Parker Snow.

   From practical experience in several parts of the globe, Captain Snow confirmed
the soundness of the theory of the Law of Storms brought forward by Admiral
FitzRov. In one place, well known to the Admiral, viz. the tempestuous seas about
Cape Horn, he, Capt. Snow, had cruised for two years without the smallest damage
to his vessel, and this owing to the attention he ever paid to those laws of nature
in connexion with wind movements.

   On another occasion, off the coast of Australia, he preserved his little ship, by

similar attention, in a terrific gale, when at the same time several other vessels were
wrecked. He well remembered how his chief officer derided the idea of any storm
theory being true, and, when referred to Reid and other stormists, said he had never
heard of them, and did not believe in what they might say. But that same night
the mate was convinced when the gale took the turn predicted by the captain.

   One more occasion Capt. Snow would refer to. He was coming home as passen-

ger in a sailing ship ; it was in the end of 1856. Within a few days' sail from England

a cyclone came down upon them. Clearly it was passing ahead, and Capt. Snow

advised his brother captain to adopt those measures which prudence then suggested,
and allow the centre to go by. After some argument this was done ; but, to con-
vince the master of the ship, Capt. Snow said that the correctness of his view of the
case then, would be proved bv the direction of the wind at that time in the South of
England, which should be opposite to what they had it. Four days afterwards they
took a pilot, and ascertained it to have been exactly so.

 --Note. The above is merely the substance of remarks made when Admiral FitzRoy read

his paper. They form the outline of what was read on a following day, by Captain Snow,
when he entered upon details.

 Results of an Investigation into the Phenomena of English Thunder-storms

   The effect of thunder-storms on the various meteorological instruments was exa-
mined and described, special attention being drawn to those sudden oscillations of the
barometer which occur during the height of a storm, and which have been found by
Mr. Eaton, of Little Bridy, to be contemporaneous with tidal disturbances. The
shape, colour, and disruptive force of lightning were also treated in detail, the
frequency with which it assumes a globular form being proved by the number of
cases in which it is so described : the determination of colour was not perfectly
satisfactory the returns taken generally show that forked lightning is usually blue,

                                                                ;

sheet lightning being, on the contrary, white. Mr Symons, however, supposes that
the colour mav vary with the distance of the discharge from the observer, with the

density of the air through which it passes, and with the existence or non-existence of
other sources of illumination ; but the subject is quite open to investigation : the
disruptive force was shown to be often equal to a dead weight of 500 tons.

   The advantage of employing the gutters and rain-water pipes of private houses
as lightning conductors, by establishing perfect communication with the earth, and
at the same time carrying a short rod from the gutter up the side of the chimneys,
was discussed ; the author's opinion being that, although far from a perfect arrange-
ment, it would determine the discharge to the outside of the house rather than
inside, its most frequent course ; and from its trifling cost it seems more adapted for
general use than the expensive forms hitherto employed.

              Notes on Atmospheric Electricity.

By Professor William Thomson, LL.D., F.R.S.

Two water-dropping collectors for atmospheric electricity were prepared, and

placed, one at a window of the Natural Philosophy Lecture-room, and the other at

a window of the College Tower of the University of Glasgow. A divided ring-

electrometer was used at the last-mentioned station ; an electrometer adapted for

absolute measurement, nearly in the form now constructed as an ordinary house elec-

trometer, was used in the lecture-room. Four students of the Natural Philosophy

Class, Messrs. Lorimer, Lyon, M'Kerrow, and Wilson, after having persevered in

preliminary experiments and arrangements, from the month of November, devoted

themselves with much ardour and constancy during February, March, and April to

the work of observation. During periods of observation, at various times of day,

early and laie, measurements were completed and recorded every quarter-minute

or every half-minute ; the continual variations of the phenomenon rendering soli-

tary observations almost nugatory. During several hours each day simultaneous

Aobservation was carried on on this plan at the two stations.  comparison of the

results manifested often great discordance, and never complete agreement. It was

thus ascertained that electrification of the air, if not of solid particles in the air

(which have no claim to exclusive consideration in this respect), between the two

stations and round them, at distances from them not very great in comparison with

their mutual distance, was largely operative in the observed phenomena. It was

generally found that after the indications had been negative for some time at both

stations, the transition to positive took place earlier by several minutes at the

tower station (upper) than at the lecture-room (lower). Sometimes during several

minutes, preceded and followed by positive indications, there were negative indica-

tions at the lower, while there were only positive at the upper. In these cases the

Acircumambient air must have contained negative (or resinous) electricity.    hori-

zontal stratum of air several hundred feet thick overhead, if containing as much

positive electricity per cubic foot as there must have been of negative per cubic foot

of the air about the College buildings on those occasions, would produce electrical

manifestations at the earth's surface similar in character and amount to those ordi-

narily observed during fair weather.

Beccaria has remarked on the rare occurrence of negative atmospheric indications

during fair weather, of which he can only record six during a period of fifteen vears

of very persevering observation by himself and the Prior Ceca. On some, if not

all of those occasions, there was a squally and variable wind, changing about rapidly

between N.E. and N.W. On several days of unbroken fair weather in April and

May of the present year the atmospheric indication was uegative during short periods,

and on each occasion there was a sudden change of wind, generally from N.E. to

N.W., W., or S.W. For instance, on the 3rd of May, after a warm, sunny, and very

dry day, with a gentle N.E. breeze and slight easterly haze in the air, I found about

8"30 p.m. the expected positive atmospheric indication. After dark (nearly an hour

later) it was so calm that I was able to carry an un protected candle into the open

air and make an observation with my portable electrometer. To my surprise I

found a somewhat strong negative indication, which I observed for several minutes.

Although there was no sensible wind in the locality where I stood*, I perceived by

the line of smoke from a high chimney at some distance that there was a decided

Abreeze from W. or S.W.  little later a gentle S.W. wind set in all round, and

with the aid of a lantern I found strong positive indications, which continued as long

as I observed. During all this time the sky was cloudy, or nearly so. That re-

versed electric indications should often be observed about the time of a change of

wind, may be explained with a considerable degree of probability, thus :

The lower air up to some height above the earth must in general be more or less

electrified with the same kind of electricity as that of the earth's surface, since this

reaches a high degree of intensity on every tree -top and vegetable fibre, and must

therefore cause always more or less of the phenomenon, which becomes conspicuous
as the " light of Castor and Pollux," known to the ancients, or the " fire of St.
Elmo " described by modern sailors in the Mediterranean, and which consists of a

flow of electricity of the kind possessed by the earth into the air. Hence, in fair
weather the lower air must be negative, although the atmospheric potential, even close
to the earth's surface, is still generally positive. But if a considerable area of this
lower stratum is carried upwards into a column over any locality by wind blowing

inwards from different directions, its effect may for a time predominate, and give rise

to a negative potential in the air and a positive electrification of the earth's surface.
    If this explanation is correct, a whirlwind (such as is often experienced on a small

scale in hot weather) must diminish, and may reverse the ordinary positive indication.
    Since the beginning of the present month I have had two or three opportunities of

observing electrical indications, with my portable electrometer, during day thunder-

storms. I commenced the observation on each occasion after having heard thunder,
and I perceived frequent impulses on the needle which caused it to vibrate, indicating
sudden changes of electric potential at the place where I stood. I could connect the
larger of these impulses with thunder heard some time later, with about the same de-
gree of certainty as the brighter flashes of lightning during a thunder-storm by night
are usually recognized as distinctly connected with distinct peals of thunder. By
counting time I estimated the distance of the discharge, not nearer on any occasion
than about four or five miles. There were besides many smaller impulses, and most
frequently I observed several of these between one of the larger and the thunder with
which I connected it. The frequency of these smaller disturbances, which sometimes
kept the needle in a constant state of flickering, often prevented me from identifying
the thunder in connexion with any particular one of the impulses I had observed.
They demonstrated countless discharges, smaller or more distant than those that gave

rise to audible thunder. On none of these occasions have I seen any lightning.

The absolute potential at the position of the burning match was sometimes positive
and sometimes negative ; and the sudden change demonstrated by the impulses on
 the needle were, so far as I could judge, as often augmentations of positive or dimi-
 nutions of negative, as diminutions of positive or augmentations of negative. This
 afternoon, for instance (Thursday, June 28), I heard several peals of thunder, and I
 found the usual abrupt changes indicated by the electrometer. For several minutes
 the absolute potential was small positive with two or three abrupt changes to some-
what strong positive, falling back to weak positive, and gathering again to a discharge.
 This was precisely what the same instrument would have shown anywhere within a
 few yards of an electrical machine turned slowly so as to cause a slow succession of
 sparks from its prime conductor to a conductor connected with the earth.

     I have repeatedly observed the electric potential in the neighbourhood of a loco-
 motive engine, at work on a railway, sometimes by holding the portable electrometer
 out of a window of one of the carriages of a train, sometimes by using it while stand-
 ing on the engine itself, and sometimes while standing on the ground beside the line.
 I have thus obtained consistent results, to the effect that the steam from the funnel
 was always negative, and the steam from the safety-valve always positive. I have
 observed extremely strong effects of each class from carriages even far removed from
 the engine. I have found strong negative indications in the air after an engine had
 disappeared round a curve, and its cloud of steam had dissolved out of sight.

     In almost every part of a large manufactory, with steam-pipes passing through

 them for various heating purposes, I have found decided indications of positive elec-
 tricity. In most of these localities there was some slight escape of high pressure

 steam, which appeared to be the origin of the positive indications.
     These phenomena seem in accordance with Faraday's observations on the electricity

 of steam, which showed high pressure steam escaping into the air to be in general,
 positive, but that it was negative when it carried globules of oil along with it.

  relations of the plane of polarization, discovered as we all know by Mr. Faraday,
 have naturally led me to examine how these relations vary with the nature, or, using
  theoretical language, with the length of the undulation, of the light. The experi-

  mental method which I have employed is the general method introduced into science

in examining how this modification varies from one extremity to the other of the

spectrum thus obtained, selecting especially, for the numerical measure of the rela-
tive effect, the seven principal rays which Fraunhofer has defined, and the length
of those undulations he has determined. As the exact determination of the position

of a plane of polarization requires that the light shall have a certain intensity, I have

been obliged to confine myself to measuring the relations of beams which correspond

with five rays, C, D, E, F and G.

myAs in         previous researches, in order to operate upon certain bodies well de-

fined and easily reproduced, I have always experimented upon liquids, contained in

tubes   closed  at  their extremities  by transparent plates                                                                     placing  these  tubes in the
                                                                                                                              ;

interior of a strong electro-magnetic coil, and so arranged that their two ends shall

sufficiently pass the edges of the coil, to obviate the necessity of taking into account

the action which the transparent plates themselves might exercise on polarized light.
But under these conditions the employment of a powerful current was rendered ab-

solutely  necessary by  the  feebleness  of the  phenomena                                                         and           the  nature of the  experi-
                                                                                                                ;

ments requiring that each liquid should remain for a long time under observation,

an elevation of temperature was produced which easily reached 50° or 60° Centigrade,

and which produced a contraction of the rotations observed, which it was very diffi-

cult to correct.

The only way of avoiding this source of error, was to place the tube containing the

--liquid in an annular collar continually traversed by a stream of cold water within

the electro-magnetic coil, a considerable complication to the apparatus.

The coil which I employed was not less than 45 centimetres in length, 15 centi-

metres in internal, and 30 centimetres in external diameter. It contained more than
80 kilogrammes of copper wire 225 millimetres in diameter, and was set in action

by a Bunsen's battery of twenty or thirty elements.

   I have not yet quite finished my experiments, but I am now in a position to esta-
blish one result, which does not appear to me to be unworthy of being communi-
cated to the Association. M. Wiedemann, in a note published in 1851, believed that

he might deduce from a small series of experiments, that if one submitted to the

action of magnetism a substance capable of itself of turning the plane of polarization,

such as the spirit of turpentine or essential oil of lemon, the rotation proper to the

substance and the magnetic rotation were proportional to one another through all

the colours of the spectrum. In order to submit to a decisive proof this law, which

would be, were it true, of immense theoretical importance, I have just examined an
Weextreme case, that of tartaric acid.
                                         know that solutions of this acid induce in

the planes of polarization rotations which do not increase from the red to the violet,

as in ordinary cases, but which present in the interior of the spectrum a maximum

whose exact position varies with the strength of the solution. Were the relations

admitted by M. Wiedemann correct, the magnetic rotations of tartaric acid should

Mypresent the same anomaly.        experiments have, however, proved, on the contrary,

that the magnetic rotations in different solutions of this acid always increase from

the red to the violet. There is no essential relation between the two orders of phe-

nomena, as there is no analogy between their causes.

  On the other hand, my experiments show how the two phenomena may have ap-

peared in some cases proportional. They show, in fact, that in all cases the mag-

netic rotations of the plane of polarization increase very rapidly from the red to the

violet, but that the product of the rotations by the square of the length of the un-

dulations, increase very slowly between the same limits ; and one recognizes in this
announcement, that which experiment has long ago demonstrated in most of the

natural rotatory powers.

ByResults of Self-registering Hygrometers.       E. Vivian, M.A., Torquay.

   Mr. Vivian reported to this Section a series of observations made with his new
self-registering hygrometers, which were first exhibited before the Association at its
Cheltenham meeting. One is a combinalion of the ordinary wet and dry bulb and
the differential thermometers, registering the maximum and minimum, or range during

any period ; the other, by the continuous precipitation of the vapour from alcohol, re-
cords the mean amount of difference between the wet and dry bulbs. The curves laid
down from these instruments varied very greatly from that of the ordinary observa-
tions at 9 a.m. The instruments are very simple, and not capable of derangement.
Curves were also exhibited showing the character of the climate of Torquay during
a long series of years, from observations periodically communicated to the Registrar-
General. The comparison with the average of other places in England showed the
climate of South Devon to be very much more equable, both in regard to temperature
and humidity. The summers are as much cooler as the winters are more mild.
The fall of rain is rather greater, but the number of wet days is less. Other curves
exhibited the degree of confidence to be placed in the barometer in prognosticating
changes in the weather, and the influence of the moon, which was only discoverable

in the more disturbed state of the atmosphere at the times of the spring tides.

    Results of Ten Years' Meteorological Observations at Stonyhurst.

                           By the Rev. A. Weld.

    Stonyhurst College is situated in the county of Lancashire, in lat. 53° 50' 40" N.,

W.and long. 9° 52'  It stands at an elevation of 380 feet in the S.E. vicinity of

Longridge Fell, which rises upon elevated broken undulations from the bed of the

Kibble to 1140 feet. In the centre of the garden, which commands a wide extent

of country, was chosen the site for the observatory, having on all sides generally a

free and distant horizon. The observatory contains a 5-foot equatorial, a meridian

circle 2\ feet diameter, a transit instrument, two transit clocks, and a considerable

meteorological apparatus. The report opens with an historical sketch of the origin

of the Meteorological Observations in 1847. The instruments have been compared

with standards by Mr. Glaisher, of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The report

extends over ten years, from the beginning of 1848 to the end of 1857. The chief

instruments recorded have been the barometer ; the dry and wet bulb ; the highest

and lowest readings of the thermometer in the shade ; the highest of a thermometer

"with a blackened bulb exposed to the sun's rays, and the lowest of a thermometer

exposed upon grass ; the direction and estimated force of the wind, and the amount

of  cloud at the  time of  each  observation                                                                    the  daily  and  monthly  fall  of rain and

snow ; amount of evaporation from an exposed surface of water ; the general cir-

cumstances observed to attend Aurora Borealis and thunder-storms ; and a general

description of the state of the weather and appearance of the sky. The observations

were recorded at 9 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p. m., local time, which have been

made, almost without exception, throughout. The report describes at length the

methods used in recording and reducing the observations. Then follow the tables

and very carefully executed curves and diagrams, with explanatory notes interspersed.

                     Physics as a Branch of the Science of Motion.

                        By J. S. Stuart Glennie, M.A.

   In order that the great aim of modern science may be accomplished, and

mechanical principles be rigorously applied to physical and chemical phenomena,
it seems clear that physical and chemical forces must be conceived in the same

way as mechanical forces. Therefore, as the general condition of the development

of a mechanical force, and, consequently, of a mechanical motion, is a difference of
pressures, and as a mechanical motion is in the direction of least pressure, a phy-
sical or chemical force must be similarly conceived as a difference of pressures, and
attractions and affinities explained as motions in the direction of least resistance
and as the cause of an ordinary mechanical motion is no supernatural or unrelated

entity or agent, but simply the condition or relation of difference among a set of
mutual pressures, so the causes of physical and chemical motions must be conceived,
not as agents, but as relations. But as (though an absolute force is inconceivable)
                                                          TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                     57

we may speak of a moving body as a mechanical force because it cannot come into

contact, be. brought into relation with another body without there being thus a dif-

ference of the previously existing polar pressures on that body, and hence a motion

or  change of motion                                                                                    so  we  may speak of  heat, electricity, &c.  as forces, because
                                                                                                     ;

bodies in such states of molecular motion or tension cause a motion of other bodies,

or of their molecules. And these forces are thus conceived, not as absolutely exist-

ing agents acting on matter, but as conditions of matter.

    It is evident that this idea of force, by which all particular forces become one (by
being referred to the same general conception of a difference of pressure), postulates

a plenum. But this will probably be now generally granted. If, then, there is a
plenum, we may conceive the influence which every part of matter exerts on every

other, as acting not " at a distance," but through other intermediate matter, form-

ing lines of pressure. Hence Ave may conceive a body or molecule as a centre of
pressure, and see whether, retaining the usual mechanical conception of" pressure"
as " a balanced force," or " virtual momentum," such influence, or, more definitely,

physical and chemical phenomena, become mechanically explicable.

  A molecule, therefore, or body, an aggregate of molecules, is conceived as a centre

of lines of pressure ; the lengths and curves of these lines are determined by the rela-

tive pressure of the lines they meet ; and lines from greater, are made up of similar

lines from lesser molecules, and so on ad infinitum. In speaking of a molecule or

body as such a centre of pressure, we may, for convenience sake, call it an atom.

In chemistry, the term equivalent will be used exclusively, and not as more or less
synonymous with atom, which I have thus ventured to appropriate for a new con-

ception.

   Atoms, or mutually determining centres of lines of pressure, may also be defined

and mathematically considered as mutually determining elastic systems with centres
of resistance.

   But these fundamental conceptions of centres of lines of pressure, or centrally
resisting elastic systems, are not hypotheses, but convenient forms of the general
conception of the parts of matter as mutually repelling.

    If, in a system of such atoms, the centres, whether molecules or suns, are all of

equal mass, and at equal distances, the mutual repulsions of thsir lines will be equal

in  all  directions                                       there will                                            be  no  difference of pressure, no  moving  force will be
                                                       ;

developed, and the conditions of equilibrium are satisfied. But it was shown that

if there are in such a system differences in the masses of the resisting centres, or

in their relative positions, the law of universal attraction, or approach of these

centres, whether, in any particular case, equal or unequal, would follow as a me-

chanical consequence of the deflection of the mutually opposing lines.

    But such centres may differ not only in mass, but in tension. Tension is conceived

as a state of unstable equilibrium, in which a (molecular) atomic centre, having been

moved towards the next atom in any plane, rests in a position in which the pressure

of its lines is increased in that direction, and correspondingly, of course, diminished

in the opposite. Such is the general mechanical conception of polarity proposed in

this theory.

   The phenomena caused by bodies in a state of static electricity are deduced from
the conception of outward or inward tension iti a closed curve.

    In dynamically electrified bodies the tension is conceived as longitudinal, and the

poles as the ends towards and from which the molecules have been moved. A mag-

net is conceived as a body in which the molecules are in a permanent state of trans-
verse tension ; and hence, evidently, as in Ampere's theory, the analogy (except as
to power on iron core) between a helix and a magnet.

    Induction is the necessary mechanical effect on adjacent bodies of electricity or
magnetism as above conceived. The character of that effect depends on the rela-

tive conditions of the tension of the acting body, and of the mechanical resistance
due to the molecular motion or aggregation of the bodies acted on.

   The various motions in the presence of electric or magnetic bodies are explicable

as differential effects of (electric or magnetic) conduction.

   It is proposed to apply this general theory to the undulatory theory of light and

heat, with the hope that the difficulties therein at present encountered may be hereby

overcome.
--58 REPORT 1860.

  As to chemistry, it may be briefly noted that its phenomena seem capable of being

brought within the science of motion by deductions from the general conceptions of
a body as a system of moving molecules (specific heat), which, the motion at every
point being equal in intensity, is in a state of dynamic equilibrium; and of the

formation of compounds, as the formation of new states of dynamic equilibrium.

            A General Law of Rotation applied to the Planets.

                        By J. S. Stuart Glennie, M.A.

   The author directed attention to a table of elements which seemed to point to a
general law for the angular velocity of rotation of the planets ; though, of the many
formulae calculated, none had as yet given perfect accuracy.

   But these tables gave a new law connecting the angular velocities of revolution

with the distances.

   He referred the nullity of effect on the planets of the resisting medium which

shortens the periods of Encke's comet to a neutralization deduced from a hydrody-
namical theorem.

                                                    Sound.

                       On the Velocity of the Sound of Thunder.

                        By the Rev. S. Earnshaw, M.A.

   The object of this paper was stated by its author to be, to solicit the attention of
observers to certain phenomena which seem to indicate that the velocity of the

sound of thunder is sometimes much greater than that of ordinary sound. He had

himself noticed a case where the sound followed close upon the flash of lightning,
though judging from the distance of the point struck (more than a mile) from him,
the interval between the flash and the sound should have been upwards of five seconds.

He stated also that Professor Montigny of Antwerp had communicated to him accounts
of similar instances noticed by himself and M. Raucoux, cure of Temploux. One in
particular was very remarkable. On a certain night last autumn, Professor Montigny

observed the lightning strike a farm at such a distance from him, that, according to
the received velocity of sound, more than fifteen seconds ought to have elapsed before
he heard the report, whereas it reached him in two seconds. This was confirmed

to him the next day by the cure of Temploux, who being at nearly the same distance
from the farm, heard the crack of the thunder in what he judged to be certainly not
more than two seconds from the descent of the electric fluid. The difference in this

case is so great between theory and observation, that errors of estimation of the time
cannot possibly account for it. The two observers were more than 4000 metres
apart. The author stated, that although there were in these instances such discre-
pancy between them and the received theory, he had communicated investigations to
the ' Philosophical Magazine ' with which they were in perfect agreement. But,
nevertheless, he hoped that some of the members of the Association would turn their
attention to these phenomena, in order that it might be definitely settled, whether
his theoretical deductions are, or are not, supported and confirmed by undoubted

facts.

On the Triplicity of Sound. By the Rev. S. Earnshaw, M.A.

The fundamental idea of this paper is the hypothesis of finite intervals. Setting

out from this, the author shows that the most simple elements of wave-motion are

~ =+kdefined by the equation  2x, x being the displacement of an aerial particle at

any time t. If the radius of molecular action extend over a large number of parti-
cles, the method pursued by the author gives the velocity of ordinary sound 1130

feet. He also shows that the velocity of a thunder-clap must of necessity be greater

than that of ordinary sounds. There are two essentially distinct types of wave-
motion, corresponding to the two signs with which k- is affected in the above

equation; the upper sign belongs to the thunder type, and the lower to ordinary

musical sounds : and it is shown that for a given value of k there are three different
velocities of wave transmission, viz. one corresponding to the upper sign, and two to
the lower sign. This is what the author means by the triplicity of sound. The
papers on this subject will be found printed at length in the ' Philosophical Maga-

zine ' for June, July, and September.

                                             Instruments.

          Description of an Instrument for Measuring Actual Distances.

                               By Patrick Adie.

   The telemeter consists of two telescopes so arranged in two concentric tubes, that
the rays formed by two object-glasses, at or near the extremities of the tubes, are by
means of reflectors brought together into one eyepiece in the middle of the tubes

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

thus both telescopes are simultaneously pointed at the same object, one being move-
able, and their relative angle taken from a scale and vernier, and this by reference
to a table on the instrument gives the distance of the object looked at. The author
has obtained measures to 5 yards in 500, and 20 in 1000 with a base of only 18 inches.
The length of the arm and power of the telescopes being equal to such minute accu-
racy, this promises to supply the link wanting to make the long range in gunnery use-
ful. Its power is such, that with the 18-inch base, the one described, we can read to

5 yards in 500, or 20 in 1000, and it may be used up to 4 or 5 miles with effect.

   Description of a New Reflecting Instrument for Angular Measurement.
                                By Patrick Adie.

   The instrument is a sextant or circle which the author proposed to name the bino-
cular reflector. It consists of two telescopes, also so arranged as to work with one
eyepiece, one telescope being directed to each of the objects whose angular distance
is sought; one of these is fixed below the limb, the other above it; and the rays are
passed from the lower into the upper, by means of a reflector sending them at right
angles through the centre of the instrument, which is hollow ; these rays entering
the upper telescope, are by means of a second reflector passed along with those of
the other half which is open into the eyepiece. The point of this instrument is, that
it gives the whole instead of half degrees as in Hadley's principle, thus reducing the
size of the instrument one-half, and the cost nearly in like degree; it will also be
much less subject to disarrangement, and can measure any angle up to 180°.

On a Pile with Sulphate of Lead. By M. E. Becquerel.

The pile of M. Edmond Becquerel is composed of an exterior receiver of zinc of

Aan annular shape, and of a cylinder composed as follows.  cylinder of lead of 29

centimetres (finches) long and about half a centimetre (T%thsof an inch) diameter,
is placed in the inside of a mould 13 centimetres (4-6 inches) in height, and 9 centi-

metres is filled (21 inches) in diameter, with a paste of sulphate of lead pulverized,

and 400 grammes water saturated with marine salt at 25° of the areometer, [being

129 to 139 cubic centimetres. The mixture of these should be made very quickly.

After the sulphate of lead has acquired a sufficient consistence, we remove it from the
mould, and we cover it round with a bed of plaster of half a centimetre in thick-

ness. This pile is charged with water rendered saline with common (sea) salt about

Jth saturated. Its electromotive force is equal to the half of that of sulphate of

copper, and its resistance to conduction is equivalent to 100 metres of red copper

wire of a millimetre diameter. It has the advantage of being very simple, and of

not requiring anything to keep it in action ; it is put into action by a single liquid,

and does not need a porous vessel. It possesses much constancy, and does not cease

to act until the sulphate of lead is entirely reduced to the metallic state. M. Bec-

querel had one in action composed often pairs, of which the circuit remained com-

pletely closed for three months.

      On an Atmotic Ship. By the Hon. W. Bland, New South Wales.

     The proposal in this case was to employ a light keel and ship-formed body buoyed
  up by an elongated balloon, and two heavy weights guided by a rope slung from
  stem to stern, to alter the centre of gravity of the machine and direct its motion
 upwards or downwards at pleasure. To cause it to move onwards in any assigned
  direction, large but light and strong vanes were to be driven round, acting like the

  screw propeller of a ship.

     On an Improved Instrumentfor describing Spirals, invented by Henry

               Johnson. By the Itev. J. Booth, LL.D., F.R.S.

     Mr. Johnson's instrument, which, looking to its practical use, he calls a volutor,

 --admits of several varieties, and may be briefly described as follows: The form

 which most clearly exemplifies the principle consists of a vertical axis resting on a
 horizontal plane, and retained on it by a metal point to prevent slipping or lateral
 motion. To this upright axis is attached one extremity of the horizontal arm or
 bar. The vertical axis passes through the extremity of the horizontal arm, or a block

 attached to the end of it, in such a way that the horizontal arm may revolve freely
 round the vertical axis. The remote extremity of the horizontal bar is furnished
 ·with a drum or pulley, over which a band or chain passes ; one end of this band is
 affixed to the centre upon a level with the pulley, and the other end of the chain or

 band, after passing over the pulley at the outer end of the horizontal rod, returns
 and is attached to a slide which carries a pencil or marking instrument. The hori-
 zontal bar is made to revolve, either by the hand directly applied to it, or by a string

 wound round a drum attached to the block revolving on the vertical axis.
    The chain or band is thus wound round the upright axis, while each succeeding

 coil encloses the preceding one, and is supported by a small plane projecting from
 the centre. The slide is drawn from the centre towards the drum at the other end
 of the horizontal arm, and thus the curve is traced by the pencil or other point, pro-
 gressively increasing its radius vector as the slide recedes from the axis. The addi-
tion of small tubes to slide down, when required, to the junction, with an opening
for the chain or band, will afford the means of varying the size of the axis, and con-
sequently the interval between the successive spirals of the curve. The intervals
between the spirals are determined by the size of the axis, and the thickness of the

band coiled round it. When each coil round the cylindrical axis rises above the

preceding one, without enclosing it, the spiral of Archimedes is described, as the
radius vector is increased each revolution by the circumference of the axis, neglecting

the inclination of the cord.

   A cone may be conveniently used as a centre, and the band wound round it in lieu

of being wound in a flat coil ; and the size of the centre may be enlarged, by wind-

ing the band one or more times round the cone before tracing the curve.

   A number of pulleys are affixed to the slide and the block on the axis, and the

curve may be modified by passing the band over one or more of them.
   As the vertical axis of the volutor, and the slide on the horizontal bar to which

motion is communicated, are connected by a cord or chain passing over a system of
pulleys, the length of cord which wraps round the vertical cylinder becomes In times
the radius of the spiral, n being the number of pulleys attached to the slide which

travels on the horizontal arm. Hence, by increasing n, we may diminish the mag-

nitude of the spirals described by the volutor*.

   When, instead of the vertical cylinder round the axis, a grooved cone is sub-

stituted, the width of the whorls increases with each revolution of the radius vector
of the spiral ; and by substituting in succession a series of cones in the vertical axis,

each of a different pitch, we may obtain spirals where successive whorls shall widen

out in any given ratio.
   Recent improvements in the volutor, as shown in the annexed drawing, include

arrangements for the vertical position of the pencil, as also for attaching the band to
the base of the cone when required, and for applying the set of pulleys to either end

of the horizontal bar.

   * In fact, the cord wound round the axis, and the end of the slide which carries the
tracing point, are as power and weight in a system of mechanical pulleys.

On the Means of increasing the Angle of Binocular Instruments, in order to

   obtain a Stereoscopic Effect in proportion to their Magnifying Power.

   By A. Claud et, F.R.S.

   In a paper on the stereoscope, which Mr. Claudet read before the Society of
Arts in the year 1852, alluding to the reduction of the stereoscopic effect produced
by opera glasses on account of their magnifying power, he stated that, in order to
redress that defect, it would be necessary to increase proportionately the angle of the
two perspectives. This he proposed to do by adapting to the object-glasses two sets
of reflecting prisms, which by a greater separation given to the two lines of perspec-
tives, would reflect on the optic axes images taken at a greater angle than the angle
of natural vision. Such was the instrument that Mr. Claudet submitted to the
British Association, to prove, as he has always endeavoured to demonstrate in various
memoirs, that the binocular angle of stereoscopic pictures must be in proportion to

--the ultimate size of the pictures on the retina, larger than the natural angle when the

images are magnified, and smaller when they are diminished ; which, in fact, is
--62 KEPORT 1860.

nothing more than to give or restore to these images the natural angle at which the

objects are seen when we approach them or recede from them. For magnifying or

diminishing the size of objects is the same thing as approaching them or receding
from them, and in these cases the angles of perspectives cannot be the same. Mr.

Claudet showed that, looking at the various rows of persons composing the audience,

with the large ends of the opera-glass, all the various rows appeared too close to

one another, that there was not between them the distance or space which separates

them when we      look with the eyes                                   alone                            and he showed also that, with the small
                                                                                                     ;

end, the distance appeared considerably exaggerated. But applying the sets of

prisms to the opera-glass in order to increase the angle of the two perspectives, then

looking at the audience as before, it appeared that the various rows of persons had

between them the natural separation expected for the size of the image or for the re-
duction of the distance of the objects. By applying the two sets of prisms before

the eyes without the opera-glass, it was observed, as was to be expected, that the
stereoscopic effect was considerably exaggerated, because the binocular angle was in-

creased without magnifying the objects. But looking with the two sets of prisms

alone at distant objects, the exaggeration of perspective did not produce an unplea-

sant effect. It appeared as if we were looking at a small model of the objects
brought near the observer. By the same reason, stereoscopic pictures of distant

objects (avoiding to include in them near objects) can advantageously be taken at a
larger angle than the natural angle, in order to give them the relief of which they
are deprived as much when we look at them with the two eyes, as when we look

only with one eye ; instead of being a defect, it seems that it is an improvement.
In fact, the stereoscope gives us really two eyes to bring out in relief the pictures of

distant objects.

On the Principles of the Solar Camera. By A. Claudet, F.R.S.

The solar camera, invented by Woodward, is one of the most important improve-

ments introduced in the art of photography since its discovery. By its means

small negatives may produce pictures magnified to any extent; a portrait taken on a

collodion plate not larger than a visiting card can be increased, in the greatest per-

fection, to the size of nature ; views as small as those for the stereoscope can be also

considerably enlarged. This is an immense advantage, which is easilv understood

when we consider how much quicker and in better proportion of perspective small

pictures are taken by the camera obscura, while the manipulation is so greatly sim-

plified. There is nothing new in the enlargement of photographic pictures. This

has been done long ago simply by attending to the law of conjugate foci ; and every

photographer has always been enabled, with his common camera, to increase or

reduce the size of any image. For the enlargement, it was only necessary to place

the original very near the camera, and to increase in proportion the focal distance.

But the more the focal distance was increased, the more the intensity of light was

reduced ; and a still greater loss of light arose from the necessity of diminishing the
aperture of the lens, in order to avoid the spherical aberration. Such conditions

rendered the operation so long that it became almost an impossibility to produce any

satisfactory results when the picture was to be considerably enlarged. For these

reasons, it naturally occurred, that if the negative, having its shadows perfectly

transparent and its lights quite black, was turned against the strong light of the sun,

its image at the focus of the camera would be so intense that the time of exposure

would  be  considerably  reduced                                       so that, in order                to employ the  light of the  sun,
                                                                    ;

and follow easily its position without having to move constantly the whole camera,

it was thought advisable to employ a moveable reflecting mirror sending the parallel

rays of the sun on a vertical plano-convex lens, condensing those rays on the nega-

tive (placed before the object-glass and behind the condenser) somewhere in its

luminous cone. Many contrivances for this object were resorted to, but without

considering anything else than throwing the strongest light possible on the negative

to be copied. The constructors of these solar cameras never thought it very im-

portant to consider whether the focus of the condensing lens was better to fall before

or behind the front of the object-glass, provided the negative was placed in the lumi-

nous cone of the condenser. This want of attention has been the cause which has

made the solar camera a very imperfect instrument for copying negatives. The
              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                 63

beautiful principle of Woodward's apparatus consists in his having decided the ques-

tion of the position of the focus of the condenser, and in having placed it exactly on

the front lens of the camera obscura. As this principle had not yet been explained
when the invention was exhibited before the Photographic Societies of London and

Paris, and not even by the inventor himself in the specification of his patent,

Mr. Claudet has undertaken, in the interest of the photographic art, to bring the

subject before the British Association, and to demonstrate that the solar camera of

Woodward has solved the most difficult problem of the optics of photography, and

is capable of producing wonderful results. This problem consists in forming the

image of the negative to be copied only by the centre of the object-glass reduced to

the smallest aperture possible, without losing the least proportion of the light illu.

minating the negative. The solar camera does not require any diaphragm to reduce

the aperture of the lens, because every one of the points of the negative are visible

only when they are defined on the image of the sun, and they are so exclusively for

the centre of the lens, the only point which sees the sun ; while the various points

of the negative, which from the marginal zone of the lens are defined against the

comparatively obscure parts of the sky surrounding the sun, are, as it were, invisible

to that zone ; so that the image is produced only by the central rays, and not in the

least degree by any other points of the lens, which are subject to spherical aberration.
It is, in fact, a lens reduced to an aperture as small as is the image of the sun upon

its surface, without the necessity of any diaphragm, and admitting the whole light

of the sun after it has been condensed upon the various separate points of the nega-

tive. It is evident that from the centre of the lens the whole negative has for back-

ground the sun itself, and from the other points of the lens it has for background

only the sky surrounding the sun, which fortunately has no effect in the formation

of the image. Such is the essential principle of Woodward's solar camera, which
did not exist in that instrument when the focus of the condenser was not on the

object-glass. This principle is truly marvellous ; but it must be observed, that the

solar camera, precisely on account of the excellence of this principle, requires the

greatest precision in its construction. For its delicate performances, it must be as

perfect as an astronomical instrument, which, in fact, it is. The reflecting mirror

should be plane, and with parallel surfaces, in order to reflect on the condenser an

image of the  sun without  deformation                                                          and in order to  keep  the  image always on
                                                                                             ;

the very centre of the object-glass, the only condition for the exclusion of the oblique

rays, the minror should be capable, by its connexion with a heliostat, of following

the movements of the sun. The condenser itself should be achromatic, in order to

refract the image of the sun without dispersion, and to define more correctly the

lines of the negative ; and a no less important condition for losing nothing of the

photogenic rays would be, to have the condenser formed with a glass perfectly

homogeneous and colourless. With such improvements, the solar camera will be-

come capable of producing results of the greatest beauty ; and, without any question,
its introduction into the photographer's studio will mark a period of considerable

improvement in the art.

On a Reflecting Telescope for Celestial Photography, erecting at Hastings,

               near New York. By Henry Draper, M.D.

In the summer of 1857, after the Dublin meeting of the British Association, a

Weparty visited Lord Rosse's telescope at Parsonstown.                                                                 were shown the ma-

chinery employed in its construction, and, as far as the weather permitted, its per-

formance.

   That visit first led me to attempt constructing an instrument which should be

specially adapted for celestial photography, for which purpose the reflector possesses

such conspicuous advantages over any refractor.

   Those who are familiar with photographic operations know well how important it

is for the ensuring of uniform success, that the sensitive surfaces should always be
placed in similar circumstances as to position, and that position must afford every

facility for carrying on the necessary manipulations.

   It appeared to me that a modification of a form of mounting, proposed some

time ago by Mr. Nasmyth, could be made to answer these requirements perfectly,
--64 REPORT 1860.

and that a Newtonian reflector, sustained on hollow trunnions, through one of
which the rays from the small mirror could come, would permit of operations being
carried on upon a horizontal table at the end of the trunnion with great ease. What-
ever might be the altitude or position of the object the photographic table would

always be horizontal.

   As I proposed that the telescope should not be less than 12 feet in focal length,
an advantage would obviously arise from making the vertical axis of the framework
beneath its centre of gravity. The observatory in which it should be placed would
then require to be only one-half the diameter that would otherwise be demanded.

A 12-foot tube could be worked with its frame in a cylindrical space, 13 feet in dia-

meter and 13 feet in height.
    I therefore cast a speculum of 15 inches in diameter and 2 inches in thickness.

The materials employed were Minnesota copper, regarded in America as the purest
commercial form of that metal, and Banca tin. Their proportions were those re-
commended by Lord Rosse. The cast was made in sand, 4 inches in thickness in
every direction from the speculum, which was permitted to remain for two days un-
opened, to ensure slow cooling. It proved to be perfectly successful. The machine
used for grinding and polishing it was that of Lord Rosse.

   The tube of the telescope is of black walnut, bound externally by brass rings, and
strengthened interiorly by iron ones. The trunnions at the little mirror are of gm*-
metal : they work on friction rollers of the same substance, supported on polished

steel axles.

   The telescope is moved in altitude, with the utmost facility, by the aid of counter-
poising levers, which act perfectly, whatever the position of the tube may be. The
pulleys through which these counterpoising levers work are also of gun-metal, sup-
ported on friction rollers, with polished steel axles. The motion, upon a vertical
axis, is accomplished by a cast-iron shaft, 2 t feet in length and 3 inches in thick-
ness, working at one end on a hemispherical termination in gun-metal, and the other
sustained in a strong and ground cast-iron collar.

   The observatory in which this instrument is being placed is situated on a hill,

400 feet above the level of the sea, at Hastings, about twenty miles north of New

York.
   The edifice consists of a sunken chamber, excavated out of the solid rock. The

walls of this chamber are substantially built of stone, laid in hydraulic cement.

Thev are 9 feet high. On the top of these walls a lighter wooden edifice is raised,

sufficient to make the building of the required height. The revolving roof is metallic.
The ground plan is square, and 17 feet in the clear interiorly. As the frame of the

telescope only requires a cylindrical space of 13 feet, the corners of the building are
very available for the necessary photographic preparations.

   On the top of the stone wall is placed a circular gallery running entirely around

the interior of the room, and enabling the operator to have access with great facility
to the photographic table and the eyepiece trunnion of the instrument. The in-
terior of the observatory is sheathed throughout with wood.

    This partly underground construction has been adopted for the purpose of ensu-

ring a more complete invariability of the temperature of the mirror. A thorough

ventilation is, however, secured whenever desirable, the local position of the edifice
being such that the door of entrance is on the side of the hill at the level of the floor.
The wooden sheathing is for the purpose of avoiding deposition of moisture.

   At the moment of writing this paper the building is unfinished, though rapidly
approaching completion. The various parts of the instrument and the photographic

arrangements are provided, and no difficulty is anticipated.
    This is the first observatory that has been erected in America expressly for celes-

tial photography, and it is hoped that, considering the purity of the skies, it will

yield good results.
    I expect also to derive considerable advantage from the method of darkening col-

lodion negatives by the aid of protochloride of palladium, described by me in a paper

read before the American Photographical Society, and which I think in this applica-
 tion will permit of good proofs being taken by unprecedentedly short exposures.

On the Chromoscope. By John Smith, M.A., Perth Academy.

The author sent a specimen of the cut-out card, by the rotation of which, in

strong light, as sunshine, he could produce various colours. There were also dia-

grams exhibited painted so as to represent the several colours and tints which the

author had succeeded in causing to appear. The chromoscope, he said, was not the

result of a happy accident, but was constructed to verify certain opinions which he

had long entertained as to the cause of colour; that it not only produced colour, but

explained the principle on which it was produced, and proved the necessity of intro-

--ducing a negative term into the theory of colour the purpose for which it was con-

structed. On the theory he said he would not enter, as he had explained it at the

Meeting at Aberdeen, when he also made some experiments before Section A.

The author's object at present was to direct attention particularly to what he

considered a most remarkable phenomenon connected with these experiments, which

manifested itself in the change of colour which took place when the motion of the

figure was reversed. The simplest illustration given, was a semidisc divided into a
number of concentric rings of equal breadth, each alternate ring being painted black

or cut out of the card, and tbe card fixed on the axle of the machine at a point,

exactly equal to half the breadth of one of the rings, from the centre of the disc.

When the card is made to rotate, each ring is thus divided into two equal sections,

and the section of a black ring is superposed, as it were, on a white, or a white on

a black when in motion ; or in each revolution of the machine there is produced a

sensation of light and no light on the same spot of the retina. In this experiment

each contiguous ring has a different colour, one purple, the other a greenish yellow,

and each alternate ring has the same colour.

Reverse the motion, the rings which were purple will now be yellow, and vice

versa, those which were yellow will be purple.

   There was another diagram giving an analysis of this ; showing how all the rings
could be made of one colour, exhibiting discs wholly of purple rings, or wholly of

yellow rings.

He said that in these experiments, when the revolutions of the machine were more

than thirty-two in a second of time, all colour was lost to the eye ; among other

reasons, demonstrating to the mind of the author, that the pulsations of light are

not so frequent as science represents them to be. He considered every revolution of

the machine equivalent to an effective pulsation of light ; and that the usual experiment

of placing the prismatic colours on a wheel, and making them revolve, only proves the

inability of the eye to estimate such rapid vibrations, and not the composition of

white light, for the colour produced is a gre}', not white, and so is the colour of his
cards when in such rapid motion.

To represent refracting substances, such as prisms or other transparent crystals

of any form, the author said it was necessary to make the cards revolve perpendi-

cularly, in order to produce the form of a solid. Several of these were shown to

Athe Section.     section of a ring produced the figure of a vase of a pink colour, with

Aa greenish centre.  semiring produced a vase of a different form and of various

Acolours, the brim being of a deep purple.    scroll composed of two semirings pro-

duced a strange compound figure, the predominant colour being a deep dark green.

Along these figures, in given conditions, there is a dark or a bright line, which he

said was the axis of motion, and might be considered as the line of no motion or of

no reflexion, or of intermittent reflexion, according to the construction of the figure.

-- --The card can be cut so as to represent both phases the black and the coloured in

the same figure.

The author in his paper said, " Are not these phenomena very like those of

polarized light?" only more astonishing, and more within the range of human

research. After looking at these experiments he always felt disposed to put the

question, " What now is polarized light ?"

   He also added that the horizontal and perpendicular experiments were constructed

on the same principle, and that the colours are the result of the same law.

   la concluding the author said, " He was anxious that philosophers should become

acquainted with these experiments, as he considered that the ideas which they con-
veyed, and the facts which they revealed, must modify our views of some of the cog-
nate sciences ; and he was of opinion that they gave rise to a new theory of coloured
refraction, jut that he was unwilling to enter on the subject of refraction, until

scientific men were acquainted with the phenomena of the chromoscope."

On some remarkable Relations existing betxceen the Atomic Weights, Atomic
  Volumes, and Properties of the Chemical Elements. By J. J. Coleman.

   The author commenced by referring to the labours of Kopp, Schroeder, Joule, and
Herapath, respecting the atomic volumes of the non-gaseous elementary bodies.
The term atomic volume being defined as "indicating the space occupied or kept

freefrom the excess of other matter by the material atom itself together with its investing
sphere of heat," particular attention was directed to a fact noticed some time ago by

Kopp, viz. that the atomic volumes of several elements correspond, so that they may
be arranged in groups. The author then proceeded to show that, in taking a group

of elements having equal or nearly equal atomic volumes, it would invariably be found
that the element possessing the least atomic weight would be the most chemically

active, the least reducible ; and, on the contrary, the element having the greatest
atomic weight would be found to be the most chemically inactive, the most reducible

member of the series. These important facts were demonstrated by quoting numerous

groups. Thus, amongst others, were brought forward the following, viz. :

--afforded, the striking differences between the weight of the atoms finding its repre-

sentative in the equally striking differences between the properties of the respective

--chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten group, chromium the most active, the most
--difficult to reduce, the metal forming the largest number of combinations, possesses

the least atomic weight of any member of the series, and precisely as the weight of

the atom increases, in molybdenum, and then in tungsten, does the chemical activity

decrease.

The group sulphur and selenium offers a pertinent illustration of the existence of

the law                                     selenium having an atomic weight 2J times greater than that of sulphur,
                                         ;

being to a corresponding extent the more reducible of the two.

Lead, gold, and silver afford another illustration of the universality of the law,

lead having the least atomic weight, being the most active, the least reducible, and

gold the greatest atomic weight, being the least active, the most reducible.

In the group chlorine, bromine, and iodine, the relation is very evident (the atomic

volume of chlorine being that of the liquid state). Phosphorus, antimony and

bismuth, and many other groups, when studied in a similar manner, confirm the

generality of the law, as applied to groups of elements having equal or nearly equal

atomic volumes.

These interesting results induced the author to extend the survey, and to institute

a careful examination into the general relations existing between the atomic weight,

atomic volumes, and properties of the whole of the elements. Considerable details

were entered into, the results arrived at being summed up as follows :

   1. That elements having a small atomic weight and a small atomic volume, such

as carbon, aluminium, sulphur, are difficult to reduce from their compounds. When

they are isolated, they are endowed with a certain degree of permanence ; but the

limit of their resistibility is easily attained.

2. Elements with a small atomic weight and a large atomic volume, such as

potassium, sodium, phosphorus, are invariably active, and difficult to keep in an

isolated state.

3. Elements having a large atomic weight associated with a small atomic volume,

such as platinum, iridium, are characterized by their capability of resisting chemical

and physical agencies.

4. Elements possessing alarge atomicweight, associated with alarge atomic volume,

such as gold, bismuth, have considerable chemical activity; but the motion of the

atoms appears to be impeded by reason of their great weight.
   From an accumulated amount of evidence of this nature, the author came to the

conclusion that the cohesive or attractive force of the chemical atom bears some
marked relation to (if it is not represented by) the actual weight of the atom, and

that it is to the repulsive forces associated with the atom that we must attribute the

variations in the relative volumes of the elements. The correctness of this conclusion

was further confirmed by reference to the atomic constitution of a numerous series of

compounds                                              but prior to entering into details, reference was made to those elements
                                                    ;

which possess the peculiar power of condensing upon their surfaces the molecules of

the surrounding medium.

   Attention was called to the fact that elements or compounds possessing a small
atomic volume are invariably found to be endowed with this property, provided the

atomic weight is sufficiently high.

   Thus carbon, an element remarkable for its power of effecting surface condensa-
tion, not only possesses a small atomic volume, but the smallest of any known element.

Again, the atomic volumes of zinc and platinum are equal, but their atomic weights

differ widely, that of zinc being 33 and of platinum 98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      thus in this group of elements
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

we find that the one possessing the greatest power of inducing surface condensation

is the one endowed with the highest atomic weight. Other comparisons of a similar

character, and leading to a similar result, induced the author to believe that " surface

condensation is caused by the cohesive attraction of the solid exerted upon the sur-

rounding molecules of gas." This idea was put forth some time since bv Dr. Faraday.

The author further extended it by supposing that the amount of the power of effect-

ing surface condensation is dependent upon, and corresponds with, the actual weight
of the atom, but that the repulsive force which keeps the atoms asunder, acting

in a contrary direction to the cohesive force, prevents that cohesive force from per-

ceptibly acting upon the molecules of the medium in which the atom is placed.
    Resuming the consideration of the atomic constitution of compounds, particular

attention was directed to the fact that, in a series of compounds of one metal (oxide
for instance), it would be found that the compound possessing the most neutrality (the
least activity) would have the greatest atomic number. The term " atomic number "
was defined as " denoting the total number of elementary atoms capable of being
contained within the space which would be filled by a single atom, of hydrogen."
The numbers brought forward by the author were quoted from Gmelin's works ; but,
as Gmelin's atomic numbers denoted the number of compound atoms capable of being
contained within a given space, his (Gmelin's) numbers were by the author multi-
plied by the total number of elementary atoms contained in an atom or equivalent of
the compound. Thus, taking equal bulks of lead and oxide of lead, it will be found
that if the lead contains 1218 atoms, the oxide of lead will contain 1888 atoms, half
of them oxygen, and the other half lead atoms. The following, amongst other series,
were brought forward :

Thus in the first series quoted the compound endowed with the most inactivity, the

most neutrality, possesses also, of the three, the greatest atomic number, so that in the

union of two atoms of chromium with three atoms of oxygen in the production of this

compound, viz. the sesquioxide, considerable condensation must occur. Chromium

is chemically active in one direction, oxygen in another; and on bringing the two

together, the opposing forces appear to neutralize, and balance each other ; if the pro-
portion of oxygen is increased, if one atom of chromium is united with three of oxygen,

a compound is produced, not neutral, but endowed with great activity ; and connected
with that activity is the important fact, that its constituent atoms are wider apart

than the constituent atoms of the sesquioxide, the neutral member of the series.

Examining the succeeding scries in a similar manner, equally striking and interesting

results were obtained.

The paper concluded with the following remarks :

To seek for an explanation of the phenomena we have been studying is a natural

impulse; that an explanation cannot be given without resorting to hypothesis is very

obvious                               but if an hypothesis can be advanced which will connect the facts together,
                                   ;

which will tend to enlarge our views upon the subject, and which will not be incom-

patible with well-known and established facts, surely that hypothesis, whatever it

 accounted for on the supposition that the force which gives chemical activity to the
atom is identical with the force which keeps the atom asunder, and that the cohesive
power of the atom is represented by its weight. Thus potassium has a powerful

chemical force, an electro-positive force (if we are so pleased to name it), and that
force confers activity upon the atom, and by its self-repulsive nature keeps those atoms

widely asunder. Chlorine has an activity of quite an opposite character, an electro-
negative activity, and the self-repulsive nature of that force keeps its atoms widely

apart. But when the two elements are brought together, the activity of the one de-

stroys the activity of the other, the repulsive force of the one destroys that of the other
consequently the cohesive force (a force represented by the weight of the atom)
immediately comes into play, and its effects are manifested by the great condensation',

the permanent character of the resulting compound. The argument then is, that it
is chemical force or electrical attraction (for the two terms are by many considered a3
synonymous) which determines the combination of atoms ; but that, when combina-

tion actually occurs, the very force which occasions it is masked, neutralized, the
elements of the compound being merely held together by the cohesive force, which
corresponds with and depends upon the absolute weight of the atom.

   In conclusion, the author reminded the members of the Section that the hypothesis
advanced should be considered separate and distinct from the numerous facts which
it had been his object to bring before their notice.

                  On a new Organic Compound containing Boron

                     By Dr. Frankland and B. Duppa.

   The authors exhibited a new body obtained by the action of zinc-ethyl on boracic

ether, in which the whole of the oxygen in boracic acid is replaced by ethyl, B(CH 5 ) 3 .

This boric triethide is a colourless, mobile liquid, spontaneously inflammable. The
authors are engaged in investigating the corresponding reaction on the ethers of car-
bonic, oxalic, and silicic acids.

Chemical Notes. By Dr. Gladstone, F.R.S.

The first of these notes referred to the gradual reduction of hydrate of cresyl into hy-

drate of phenyl and other compounds through the agency of chloride of calcium or zinc :
the second described a crystalline precipitate obtained by the addition of hydrofluoric

acid to molybdous chloride : the third showed by an analysis of the dift'usate, that when

equivalent proportions of choride of sodium and nitrate of baryta are mixed together

in solution and diffused, four salts exist contemporaneously in the liquid; or in other

words, a portion of each acid combines with a portion of each base                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               thus affording an

                  On the Transmission of Electrolysis across Glass.

                      By W. R. Grove, Q.C, F.tt.S. $c.

    If glass, or an equally non-conducting substance, be interposed between electrodes
in an electrolyte, so that there be no liquid communication around the edges, it is
hardly necessary to say that, according to received opinions and experiments, no
current passes, and no electrolysis takes place. Mr. Grove was led by some theoretic
considerations to think that this rule might not be without an exception, and the follow-

Aing experiment realized his view :-- Florence flask, well cleaned and dried, was

filled two-thirds full of distilled water, with a few drops of sulphuric acid added to it,
and placed in an outer vessel, containing similar acidulated water, and which reached

to the same height as the liquid in the interior. A platinum wire was passed through

a glass tube, one end of which was hermetically sealed to the platinum, so that a small
part of the wire projected beyond the tube. This tube passed through a cork fitted to
the flask, and the platinum point was dipped into the liquid within the flask, and a simi-
lar coated wire was dipped into the outer liquid, and the two wires connected with the

extremi*'

portions of the flask above the liquid, both outside and inside, were perfectly dry, so

that there could have heen no communication of the current over the surface of the
glass. This was further proved by removing the outer wire a short distance from the
liquid, when sparks passed nearly equal in length to those between wires from the ter-
minals. As the outer wire was further removed, keeping it near the flask, sparks
passed along the surface of the latter for a short distance; and as it was further re-
moved from the liquid, still being near the flask, they ceased, thus showing that there
was no passage of electricity over the upper and unwetted surface of the glass. With
unacidulated water no electrolysis was observed, nor when a battery of thirty cells
was used instead of RuhmkorfF's coil. In the first experiment the evolution of gas
gradually diminished, and ceased in about twenty minutes, but recommenced on rever-
sing the current. Mr. Grove concluded that the electrolysis was effected by induction
across the thin glass of the Florence flask, and that its cessation indicated something
like a state of charge or polarization of the surface of the glass.

On the Oxidation of Potassium and Sodium. By A. Vernon Harcourt.

On the Atomic Weight of Oxygen. By Prof. W. A. Miller, M.D., F.R.S.

   In this paper tbe author pointed out some practical objections to Gerhardt's pro-
posal for doubling the atomic number for oxygen.

   It has been stated that one advantage which would be obtained by adopting the pro-
posal, would be that it would remove all inconsistency in the vapour volumes of all

compound bodies by representing them all as of equal volume.
   The author commenced by showing that this assumed consistency was onlyimaginary,

inasmuch as such uniformity does not exist in nature. In addition to the differences
existing between the vapour volumes of the protoxide and deutoxide of nitrogen, similar
irregularities exist in the volume of chlorous acid, and of bisulphide of mercury and

some other bodies.

The practical objections, if a notation in harmony with this view were adopted, were,

he stated, of still greater weight, and might be summed up as follows :
   1. The ordinary notation is known to every one who has made the science of che-

mistry his study. 2. All the memoirs, with the exception of a few in later years, are

written in accordance with this system, and a change of notation would at once render
these memoirs less easily accessible and intelligible. 3. The new notation required

would not be in harmony with the language of chemistry, NO, for example, would be

called binoxide of nitrogen, but written as a protoxide. 4. The present system of

notation is capable of expressing all the later theories with perfect precision, while it

is applicable to the older views ; but the new notation is not applicable to many of the

older views. By the ordinary notation, nitrate of potash, for instance, may be repre-
N0sented either as a compound of potash and nitric acid (KO,
                                                              5 ), or as a combination

N0of potassium with nitrion (K,  6), or as an aggregation of particles without indicating

(KN0any specific mode of combination  6 ) ; whereas, in the new notation, unless its

(KNQprinciple is abandoned by doubling the formulae, it is impossible that  3 ) should

be represented as formed of potash and nitric acid. It would therefore be a retro-

grade step thus to exclude from our notation the power of indicating the constitution

of a large class of compounds upon a view which has long been more or less prevalent.

5. Any extensive change of nomenclature or of notation, while the truth of the

theory upon which it rests is still under discussion, cannot but lead to serious incon-

venience. If such a practice were admitted, every new theory would be privileged to

introduce a new language, which, in a continually progressive science like chemistry,

would soon give way to an equally transitory successor. Chemistry, it must be re-

membered, is not merely a science : it is also an art, which has introduced its nomen-

clature and its notation into our manufactories, and, in some measure, even into daily

life ; it is therefore specially necessary to beware of needless innovation. Any system

of notation, it must also be borne in mind, is a mere artificial contrivance to represent

to the mind certain changes or certain hypotheses ; and to argue for a system of nota-

tion as though it were anything more, as has sometimes been done, shows a want of
true appreciation of its meaning.

   The question to be considered is not simply, what is in the abstract the best mode

of notation, but what, considering all the circumstances of the science, possesses the

greatest advantage. That system of notation which is consistent with itself, and
which lends itself most completely to the expression of the various theories and aspects

of the science which have been maintained,;or may be maintained, is therefore, philo-
sophically speaking, the best. And such grounds, it appeared to the author, exist

for continuing to use the system hitherto generally adopted.

   The question of notation, it was observed, is entirely independent of Gerhardt's
theory of the atomic constitution of the elements to which he proposes to apply it, for
even those who admit the truth of his hypothesis may still express it by the ordinary
mode of notation.

        Remarks on the Volume Theory. By C. Moritz von Bose.

It is endeavoured to show that the theory of volumes which separates gases from

other bodies must be untrue; that there is no generic difference, but a difference of
degree only between gases on the one hand, and solid and fluid substances on the

other ; that therefore the three states of aggregation may be considered under the

same aspect.

And it is suggested that one equal standard be introduced for the specific gravity

of gases and other substances                                                                                                            and that the attention of mathematicians be drawn
                                                                                                                                      ;

to the numbers of equivalent weight and atomic volume (as obtained on using equal

standard), with the view to solve the question whether those numbers being inter,

preted as relative distances of equivalent masses, chemical processes can be accounted

for by the law of gravitation.

                 On the Occurrence of Poisonous Metals in Cheese.
                              By Professor Voelcker.

   The author stated that he had detected hoth copper and zinc in cheese : in some
specimens copper, in others zinc, and in some hoth copper and zinc were found. The
description of cheese in which these poisonous metals were found was double-Glou-
cester cheese. Skimmed-milk cheese, which was likewise examined for copper and
zinc, did not contain any metallic impurity. Stilton, and other varieties of cheese,
have not as yet been examined ; it must not therefore be inferred that cheese made

in other districts than Gloucestershire contains poisonous metals. Inquiry in the

dairy districts of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire has led to the discovery that in many

dairies in these counties sulphate of copper, and sometimes sulphate of zinc, are
employed in the making of cheese. The reasons for which these prejudicial salts are
added to the cheese are variously stated. Some persons added sulphate of zinc with a
view of giving new cheese the taste of old ; others employed sulphate of copper for

the purpose of preventing the heaving of cheese. Dr. Voelcker also stated that he
ltad found alum in Gloucester cheese, and mentioned that he had learnt that in some
dairies alum was employed to effect a more complete separation of the caseine from
the whey.

   On the Stratigraphical Position of certain Species of Corals in the Lias.

                  By the Rev. P. B. Brodie, M.A., F.G.S.

   The author first alluded to the exact position of a species of Coral found in the
Hippopodium bed near Cheltenham, and another locality near Evesham, where the
same form was equally abundant. Another and distinct genus, a Mcnllivaliia allied
to M. Stutchhuryi, was procured in the same bed in Warwickshire, associated with
numerous other fossils, and a section of the pit was given. Other and distinct species
of Corallines, one of which from Gloucestershire belongs to the genus Cladophyllia,
were known to occur lower down in the ' Lima beds,' the probable position of the fine
Isastrcea Murchisoni, found occasionally in Worcestershire and Warwickshire. One
or more additional species have been met with in the bottom beds of the Warwickshire
Lias, which had not been previously observed so low down. The divisions of the

--Lias, which seem to be characterized by the presence of Corals, are 1, the Hippo-

podium bed; 2, the Lima bed ; 3, the White Lias; and 4, the Guinea bed. So that
it would appear that Corals are more numerous in the Lias than has been usually
supposed, and that they occupy certain zones in it, which future investigations may
show to be as well marked and distinctive as that of any other particular organisms.

     On the Velocity of Earthquake Shocks in the Laterite of India.
                     By John Allan Broun, F.R.S.

   Mr. Mallet's interesting observations on the velocity of earthquake shocks had

drawn my attention to the subject ; and when earthquakes were remarked in Travan-

core, the part, South of India, where I resided, I endeavoured to add something to

our knowledge of the subject.

Four earthquakes were perceived in Travancore during the year 1856; that to

which I am about to allude was observed at the Trevandrum Observatory, August 22,

where the commencement of the shock was noted accurately by the Observatory
clock, at 4b 25 m 10s of Trevandrum mean time. The magnets in the magnetic

observatory were dancing up and down with sharp jerks, but without any change

of mean positions ; a vessel containing water was wetted highest on the points to

W.N.W. and E.S.E. The vibration of the bifilar magnet was 3"0 scale divisions a
few minutes after the shock. On the 11th of the same month a shock had been

felt at Trevandrum, and I had addressed a circular to several persons in the district

for  information  as  to  the  time,  direction,  and   character  of the   shock                               this circular
                                                                                                             :

had drawn attention to the questions of interest in connexion with such shocks.

One gentleman at Quilon (thirty-seven miles N.W. of Trevandrum) was writing
an account of the former shock when the shock of August 22nd occurred. Four
gentlemen and one lady noted the time of the shock at Quilon ; these times were

watches or clocks used in the determination of the time of the shock : the rate of the

chronometer was +8 seconds, and the error was determined before and after the
--comparisons, which were made August 27th. The following are the facts connected

wth the observations: Mr. Newas had set his watch, on the 17th of August, to
6 h m at sunrise ; allowing for the height of the chain of Ghats where the sun rose,
I have computed that sunrise must have been about 3 minutes before six o'clock
the watch had been allowed to run down after the shock, so that it could not be
                                          Supposing the watch without       any                                 marked rate,
compared with the chronometer.          shock was 4h 18£m . Mr. Stone       had                                 set his watch

can be considered only as approximate determinations. Capt. Carr's watch was

     There can be no doubt that Mr. Stone's observation is the most trustworthy, as
his time depends on two comparisons with the Trevandrum Observatory, viz. on the
17th and 27th ; and the deduced error for the middle of the interval (the 22nd) can-
not be far from the truth. Mr. Newas's observation, which agrees with it within
about a minute, depends wholly on the observation for the sunrise ; it is so far con-
                                                                           much  from

by Mr. Mallet in wet sand. If we take the W.N.W. as the direction of propaga-

tion of the shock, or any other than that direct from Quilon, the velocity will of

course be diminished. It should be remarked that the laterite, which forms the

upper stratum (about 30 feet deep) between Quilon and Trevandrum, is a clayey

rock, in a semi-pasty condition of perhaps the lowest degree of elasticity ; and the

laterite reposes in some places on strata of sand and clays.

 On the Course of the Thames from Lechlade to Windsor, as ruled by the
   Geological Formations over which it passes. By the Rev. J. C. Clutter-

    buck, 31.A.

    The tortuous course of the Thames between Lechlade and Windsor shows that
 there must be some physical cause which obliges it to deviate from the straight line

 it would naturally take to its outfall. This is l'ound in the obstructions encountered

in its passage over or through the various strata. From Lechlade to Sandford the

river finds its bed in the Oxford clay ; it then passes through a narrow gap in the
middle oolite to the Kimmeridge clay, holds its course on that clay, under the

escarpment of the Iron-sand in Nuneham Park, turns the escarpment at Culham,

passes to the Gault at Appleford, touches a ledge of the Iron-sand at Clifton Hamp-
 den, returns to the Gault, enters the Greensand near its junction with the Thame

--stream, passes to the Chalk, in which it finds its bed to the point, which is the limit

proposed for consideration. The natural obstructions are found at the junction of the
different strata. The quantity of water flowing down the river, whether issuing in
perennial springs, or thrown from the surface in flood, is due to the geological condi-
tion of the district. The tributaries or feeders discharge more or less of perennial or
flood water, as they carry the water from permeable or impermeable strata. The
flooding of the district necessarily affects the sanitary condition of Oxford. The city
itself is placed on a bed of gravel, overlying the Oxford clay, the surface of which
undulates so that the water is stanked back in the gravel ; it was cutting through one
of these undulations, in carrying out the Jericho drainage, that deprived many wells
in Oxford of their water. As this bed of gravel extends beyond the limits of the city,
on the subsidence of the floods, the water filtrates through the gravel, and thus
noxious evaporation is diminished. Considerable accumulations have raised the bed
of the river in many places, evidence as to the date of which is found in antiquities
which have been discovered when constructing locks or weirs, or in dredging for gravel.
At Sandford, arms of the time of Charles I. have been found 8 feet below the river-
bed, relics of greater antiquity and at various depths have often been found in other
places, where the bed of the river has been raised, or, as in some cases, entirely
changed its course. The phenomenon of the formation of ice at the bottom of the
stream, when the temperature falls to 20 Fahr., and the transportation of stones from
the bottom by the ice rising to the surface, adds to the natural obstructions in the
stream, and hinders the passage of the flood-waters by which so much damage has
been done at various times in the neighbourhood of Oxford. The paper, which
entered into full details, was illustrated with a map, sections, and diagrams.

                      Remarks on the Elevation Theory of Volcanos.

                     By Professor Daubeny, M.D., F.R.S.

   This paper was chiefly intended as a protest against the assumption of certain geo-
logists, that because it had been shown, more especially by Sir Charles Lyell in his
memoir published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1858, that sheets of compact
lava have been formed on steep inclines, it therefore followed, that all volcanic moun-
tains have been built up by a series of successive eruptions.

   Not denying that this explanation may serve for the oldest, as it certainly does for

the more recent beds, which constitute such mountains as Etna and Vesuvius, the

author contended that it is not applicable to the celebrated case of Jorullo, as described
by Humboldt, nor yet to the volcanic islands thrown up in deep water at various times
during the historical period.

   He was also disposed to refer the four trachytic Puys near Clermont, in Auvergne,

as well as the still loftier Cones composed of the same material in the Andes, which
Humboldt describes, rather to the upheaval of a softened mass of rock, than to the

outburst of liquid lava.

   He appealed also to the crater-lakes in the Eifel country and elsewhere, as furnish-

ing cases of upheaval, even where no lava had been ejected; and argued, that so long
as the idea of paroxysmal action continued to be entertained with reference to rocks
in general, it was probable that volcanic countries, above all others, would be subject
to such operations.

 On the Mode of Flight of the Pteroductyles of the Coprolite Bed near Cam-

                bridge. By the Rev. J. B. P. Dennis, F.G.S.

    Coprolitic remains of Pterodactyle bone have afforded an opportunity of studying its
microscopic characters, and this had led to the present attempt to show from the ana-

logy of other flying animals, from the different modes of flight among birds, from the

apparent adjustment of the haversian canals thereunto, and the harmonious perfection
of the skeleton with the adaptation of the pectoral muscle to the same (so that even the
humeral process of its attachment has its marked characteristics), that these and other
analogies lead to the inference that considerable knowledge even of the mode of flight

of this extinct reptile may be obtained from the study of its microscopical bone struc-

ture. In elucidation of this subject, a brief account was given of the structure of the

wing-bones of a bird, and of the mode of flight of the Gull, a bird distinguished for
its elasticity and endurance on the wing, and in other respects very suitable for illus-

trating the subject.

   A description was then given of fragments of Pterodactyle bone obtained by Mr.

Barrett from the coprolite bed, most of which were portions of wing-bones of very
thin texture. It was also shown that the Pterodactyle required not to be encumbered
with muscular legs, and thus the vastus was only sufficiently developed to enable the
animal to spring from the ground preparatory to flight (as the form of the femur also

seemed to indicate); also the biceps, semitendinosus, &c, or their analogues, did not
require any great development; while the gastrocnemius, as it would assist in the
spring, was probably on that account fairly represented. The pectoral muscle, follow-
ing the saurian type, must have been less voluminous than that of birds, flatter, with
its greatest development in front, and in position comparing somewhat with that
muscle in gulls and owls, birds of elastic but not rapid flight. The Pterodactyle was
also shown to agree more with birds than with bats, especially in its omoplate, while
the absence of a fercula implied no similar volume of muscle ; the bones in like man-
ner were permeated by air, or if some were not, they were yet filled with a light fatty
 substance or marrow to give additional strength to their light texture ; and though the
 natural weakness of its muscular powers was considerable in comparison with birds,
 yet this was balanced by an extremeh' light framework, the weight of which predomi-
nated in front, where the muscular force was more directly antagonistic; and above all, the

 admirable microscopic structure of its bone eminently conduced to its powers of flight.
Delicate in the extreme to the unassisted eye, when examined under the microscope,
the bone is found to contain numerous and large haversian canals in a very marked
 degree, comparing in their arrangement with those seen in the wing-bones of gulls;
 also lacunas well displayed, larger than those of a bird of flight, long and fusiform.

From this correspondence of the characters of the haversian canals, of which illustra-
tions were given, an inference seems capable of being drawn in reference to the flight

of these large Pterodactyles, which, if they did not possess the dash of the falcon or the
impetuosity of the wood-pigeon, yet sailed gracefully over primaeval seas with a light-
ness and buoyancy, as it would seem, analogous in some degree at least to the con-
spicuous grace of the gulls, which are the present ornament of our coasts. So in every
respect is seen the wisdom displayed in the adaptation of means, each inadequate
in itself, and the result is the production of one of the strangest anomalies, of

--which, if we had not had the clearest testimony, the imagination would have failed to

picture, a true Pterosaurian, in some respects perhaps more wonderful in its con-
struction than bats or even birds, and being as fully capable of flight as they, teaching

      On the Corrugation of Strata in the Vicinity of Mountain Ranges.

                              By the Rev. J. Dingle.

    This paper was in continuation of an attempt to determine the mechanical causes
of the formation of the earth's crust, and to trace its progress. The author described

the varying forms of flexure, diminishing in intensity with their distance from the

igneous axis, which characterizes the strata in the neighbourhood of the mountain
chains; and showed how this form would arise from the action of the molten interior,
by referring to the result of experiments upon the action of fluids under like condi-

tions. He expressed his obligations to Professor Rogers for the valuable information

which he had derived from a paper of his in the Edinburgh Transactions, but de-
murred to some of his hypotheses. Flexures at definite points must be produced by
repeated or continued pressures, and not by paroxysmal action. The latter chiefly
spends itself in earthquakes and volcanoes, which, upon the whole, can produce no
continuous change of form. The two forces, however, seem to be intimately related
to each other; and if we suppose the one to be only the other in excess, we are
supplied with a simple explanation of the connexion between the corrugated moun-
tain chains and the lines of earthquakes and volcanoes.

   As a corollary from the above views, it might be observed that they destroyed the
idea of any distinct theory of volcanoes of elevation or eruption, as the quantities of

elevated or ejected matter in the case of a fissure or a ruptured corrugation might be
in any proportion whatever to each other.

                      Remarks on the Ichthyolites of Farnell Road.

            By Sir Philip de M. Grey Egerton, Bart., F.R.S.

    At the Meeting of the British Association last year at Aberdeen, I had an oppor-
tunity of examining several specimens of the small fishes found in the Old Red Sand-
stone deposits of Farnell, and in the discussion which ensued upon the reading of
Mr. Mitchell's paper, I took occasion to remark upon their several characters. I then
stated that all the specimens I had seen belonged to the family Acanthodei, and the
great majority of them to the genus Acanthodes, representing, however, a new species
of the genus. I proposed inconsiderately to name this species A. antiquus, a very
inappropriate title, inasmuch as two contemporaneous species were subsequently ex-
hibited by Mr. Peach. As, however, this name has not appeared in print, I propose
to cancel it, and substitute A. Mitchelli, as the original or type-specimen is in the
possession of the Rev. Hugh Mitchell, of Craig. The other specimens I described as
constituting a new genus corresponding in many characters with Diplacanthus, but
differing in the shortness and position of the spines of the fins. I proposed for this
genus the name Brachyacunthus.

   The specimens from the same locality recently received from Mr. Powrie are of the
same species as those examined at Aberdeen. I learn, however, in a letter received
from Mr. Powrie since I have examined his specimens, that he has in his possession
others comprising at least two very distinct species of Diplacanthus, one remarkable
for it3 very strong anterior dorsal spine, and fragments belonging probably to other
species. Mr. Mitchell also writes that another locality has been found rich in remains
of Acanthodian and other fishes. Under these circumstances it would be premature to
enter into any detailed account of these interesting ichthyolites. As the materials, how-
ever, are sufficiently complete, 1 append a short description of Acanthodes Mitchelli.

   The specimens I have examined vary in length from 2 to 2| inches. The one I
have selected for description attains nearly the latter dimensions. The greatest depth
of the trunk occurs in advance of the ventral fins, where it measures rather more than
half an inch. The head is small and elegantly sculptured. It measures about -1th of
the total length. The outline of the body is very graceful. It is fusiform anteriorly,
and tapers gradually posterior to the insertion of the highly heterocerque tail. The
orbit is placed very forward, and is embraced by the remarkable bony plates described
by Rbmer as characteristic of the genus. The peculiar structure of the gill-covers also
corresponds with that of other species of Acanthodes. The pectoral spines are long
and curved. The other fin-spines are slender and straight. The species differs from

                        On Circular Chains in the Savoy Alps.

           By M. A. Favre, Professor at the Academy of Geneva.

    The object of this memoir is to describe the peculiar structure of the mountain
chains in Savoy, on the left bank of the river Arve.

   This region may be divided into several districts, which, in passing from Mont
Saleve to Mont Blanc, are as follows : (1) the Tertiary, (2) the Cretaceous, (3) the
Jurassic, and (4) the district of crystalline rocks. M. Favre treats of the second of

these, in which the mountain chains surmounted by precipitous peaks are composed in
great part of cretaceous rocks. This district is about 49 kilometres long from the
river Arve to the lake of Annecy, by 24 broad. The loftiest mountain attains the
height of 2760 metres above the sea-level, and there are several other summits be-
tween 2300 and 2400 metres high. The geological formations which constitute this

--district are, 1. the Jurassic which occupy a very limited space ; 2. the Neocomian;

3. the Urgonian, which forms enormous escarpments, and constitutes the crest of the
mountains; 4. the green sandstone; 5. the chalk; 6. the nummulite limestone ; 7.
the alpine macigno, which at its base contains various nutria with fish scales, and
above marls and sandstones associated with the Taviglianas freestone which is a

species of volcanic cinder.

   One of the valleys of this district, that namely of Thones on Grand Bornant, is a

longitudinal valley ;" the others are transverse valleys watered by rivers arranged almost
like the radii of a circle. This peculiarity in the direction of these rivers depends on
that of the mountain chains ; for the rivers in general cut the chain perpendicularly

to their axes, and with the exception of Mont Charvin a la Pointe Percee, all the

mountain chains of this district, and especially those on the borders, are in the shape
of a quadrant, and lie in every direction that can be found in a quadrant. It is to
these chains that M. Favre has given the name of circular chains.

   Mountain chains have long been remarked whose axes are more or less undulatory,

others separating from a common trunk like the branches of a tree ; strata, moreover,

have been observed that rise to the surface of the ground in the form of the bottom
of a boat ; and the opposite phenomenon has likewise been observed, that namely of a
mountain chain in the form of a vault or half cylinder sinking so as to disappear in

the plain ; but M. Favre is of opinion that the fact to which he has called attention is

different from any of these, insomuch as it refers to entire chains, which are not only
curved, but curved to such a degree that their extremities are at right angles to each

other.

   M. Favre concludes his essay by calling attention to the fact that the chains of the

Alps display the closest orographical resemblances to those of the Jura, which are

now well known. Although the displacement of the soil is much greater in the Alps

than in the Jura, in both are found groups either entire or broken, which in the latter
case disclose in their interior, one, two, or three of the strata below that which forms

their crest ; in both are found combes, ravines, and valleys of the same form. M.

Favre believes that the identity of these forms leads to the conclusion that the eleva-
tion of the Alps and the Jura is due to causes of the same nature.

On some Transformations ofIron Pyrites in connexion with Organic Remains.
                               By Alphonse Gages.

    I have to direct the attention of the Section to some facts regarding the transforma-
tion of iron pyrites connected with fossil graptolites from Tinnaglough, Co. Wexford.

   These peculiar characteristic fossils of the Lower Silurian schists are found very
often transformed into rhombic iron pyrites.

    This transformation into pyrites is now, since the observations of Pepys and others,
easily accounted for, and therefore I have not to dwell upon it.

   Looking over some of those schists, we may observe the various transformations

the fossil has passed through until it entirely disappears from the schist.
    I. Fossil exhibiting some traces of organic matter, and not mineralized by pyrites.
   II. The same fossil transformed into rhombic iron pyrites.

   III. The transformation of the pyritic fossil into a corresponding fossil of aluminite.

   AIV. mere cast of the fossil, or indication of one only remaining.

   And lastly, in some neighbouring joints of the schist, a thin layer of sesquioxide of

iron, alum, or of aluminite generally accompanied by free sulphur.

   Analogous phenomena may be observed in other fossils of the carboniferous form-

ation, and especially in the lower limestone shale near Drogheda.

   One may observe in some points in which the fossil has been completely obliterated,
a thin mineral layer of aluminous compounds, varying more or less in their chemical

constitution.

    These facts are very suggestive in this sense, that if the processes of mineralization

going on for ages have served to preserve many forms of organic beings, so also they

serve to destroy them.

  We witness every day the destruction of a great number of pyritic fossils by the

mere action of air, and their transformation into sulphates, and sometimes, according
to local circumstances, into sulphates and free sulphur. Whenever sulphur occurs
in deposits containing organic remains, we are induced to believe that it has been
formed in somewhat a similar way.

On the Silurian Formation in the District of Wilsdruff. By Dr. Geinitz.

   The discovery of Graptolites in the Lydit and Phthanit, lately made in the district
of Wilsdruff, near the villages of Limbach, Lotzen, and Lampersdorf, a neighbour-
hood where the azoic and metamorphic clay-slates, sometimes with true chiastolith,
are predominant, now combines a considerable part of the most northern part of the
Saxon Erzgebirge with the Silurian.

   These black schists of Graptolites, with Monograpsus triangulatus, Harkness, Mon.
priodon, Bronn, Mon. Becki, Barrande, and Mon. nuntius, Barrande, are continued in

the schists of Graptolites on the northern slope of the Erzgebirge near Langenstriegis,
not far from Frankenberg, Ober-Cainsdorf near Zwickau, Ronneburg, Oelsnitz, Hein-
richsruhe near Schleiz, and various places of the district called Voigtland, where they

indicate the same geological horizon as in Bohemia, the upper part of the Lower
Silurian, or the base of the Upper Silurian of M. Barrande. All the species found
in Saxony are described in the author's 'Monograph of Graptolites,' Leipzig, 1852.

On the Metamorphic Rochs of the North of Ireland. By Robert Hark-

   ness, F.R.S., F.G.S., Professor of Geology in Queens College, Cork.

   Almost the whole of the county of Donegal is occupied by rocks which appertain
to the metamorphic series, consisting of gneissose rocks associated with limestones
and quartz rocks. The relation which these several rocks bear to each other, and to
the syenitic masses which in some cases are found accompanying them, is well exhi-

bited in the sections along the north side of Lough Foyle, from Malin Head to Inis-
howen Head. On the S.W. side of Malin Head a protrusion of syenite is seen, which

forms an axis in this portion of Ireland ; and reposing on this axis there are found,
first and lowest, quartz-rocks, succeeded conformably, on the north side, by flaggy
gneiss ; and on the southern side a like occurrence commonly takes place. In some

localities, on the southern side of this nxis, limestone frequently intervenes between
the underlying quartz-rocks and the overlying gneissose strata ; and the limestones,

scattered in small patches among the metamorphic rocks of the north of Ireland, oc-
cupy this position with reference to the rocks of this character. The arrangement of

these rocks in this part of Ireland, as regards position, is as follows : the lowest quartz-

rocks succeeded by limestones, which are not persistent, but upon which, when present,
great masses of chloride gneiss are seen having usually a S.E. dip, often the result of
reversed flexures. Through these rocks, which are the Irish representatives of the
strata of the Grampians, numerous trap dykes occur.

    Notes on the Geology of Captain Palliser's Expedition in British North

                          America. By Dr. Hector.

   The following remarks are explanatory of a section commencing at Lake Winnipeg,
continued along the basin of the Saskatchewan River to the Rocky Mountains, and
from thence to Vancouver's Island. This section is only intended to represent the
more general results of this geological exploration, as a preliminary to the reports
which are in preparation.

   The rocks east of Lake Winnipeg have been fully described by geologists. They
are a part of the so-called Laurentine chain, and consist of granite and metamorphic
rocks. On these lie Silurian limestones, cherty, and of magnesian character, with
corals and shells, easily referable to Silurian types. Above these Mr. Hind has found
Devonian strata, of which, however, I saw no trace farther south. The supposed line
of their outcrop is marked by salt springs.

   The first well-defined strata in the Prairie country occur 150 miles west of Red
River, and are indurated olive shales, with ferruginous bands and traversed by veins

of clay ironstone, with a few small fossils, chiefly fish-scales, and a small, neat species
of nucula. They are a deep-water deposit.

   At the elbow of the Saskatchewan River, the banks are formed of purple laminated
clays, with lines of Septaria of various sizes. These Septaria yield fossils, which are truly
cretaceous forms. The most common are Bacidites and Inocerami. These Septaria
clays are also deep-sea deposits. They are again met with on the north branch of
the Saskatchewan, 150 miles to north-west, and the course of this river is for some
distance determined by these soft beds. At the Snake Portage, in lat. 54° N., 1
thought I observed them overlaid by thick grits and clays, which must be next de-

scribed ; but of this junction I am not certain, and the dip is so slight that they may

be even underlaid by these grits.

   The latter strata, in beds often 200 feet thick, form high ridges, which range north
and south, crossing both Saskatchewans, and also the Red Deer River, at the Nick
Hills. They form mainly two parallel ranges, and between them occur clays with
coal or lignite beds from 2 to 10 feet thick, and consistent in their strike from north-
west to south-east. This coal is used at Fort Edmonton, and burns pretty well.
Some vegetable impressions, like those of cypress and dicotyledonous leaves, are found
in the shale, but no other fossils.

   As these coal-beds and shales occur in the river-beds, and at low levels compared
with the surrounding prairie, it is manifest that the surface-beds of which these are

composed, are of later age; but whether conformable with them or not, I am unable

to say.

   To the south-east of the elbow of the Saskatchewan, at the base of the Coteau de
Prairies, and at a locality on the Souris River known as the Roche Percee, is a group
of marls, with limestone bands, containing so much iron as to weather of a bright ver-
milion colour, and ash-coloured arenaceous clays, with their bands of lignite and

silicified wood. Selenite crystals are abundant in these marls, often clustered in stel-
late forms. They are mixed with bands of grit, from a few feet to 30 feet in thick-
ness ; and these being generally of a soft nature, with indurated portions, weather out
in the most grotesque forms.

   On the higher grounds traversed by Battle River, and again on Red Deer River,

where they are seen to rest on the great lignite group, are also beds of marl, lime-
stones with iron like those of the Roche Percee, beds of lignite and true brown coal,

with silicified trees, and abundance of fossils of an estuarine character. Among these

latter are oysters, a good deal like the Pacific species, Mytili, Cyprina, and other
                                                                                                            TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                       81

marine forms in some beds; and in others PaluJina is the prevalent fossil. On the
very high grounds (such as the Ocheschis or Hand Hills and the Cyprees Hills), these

strata pass up into sands, gravel, and beds of coarse shingle, which, at the same level

(4000 feet above the sea), skirt the base of the Rocky Mountains, and there rest on

the edges of upturned strata of various ages.

   -All the strata which 1 have mentioned are covered with a mantle of drift, which

does not rise much above 3000 feet; but near Battle River there seems to be a group

of deposits which I have termed Tertiaries of the low grounds.

--The strata composing the Rocky Mountains may be briefly described as follows :
    In crossing from the east, thirty or forty miles before entering the range, beds of

grits and shales are observed much disturbed, but obviously dipping to the east.
From a level of 4000 feet above the sea, the mountains rise as parallel ranges of cliffs

from 3000 to 4000 feet in height. The first five or six of these ranges are composed

of blue crystalline and earthy limestone in bold plications, including portions of the
same grits and clays that are seen along the eastern base. This group of strata must

be several thousand feet in thickness, and contain fossils of Carboniferous age. To

the west, and forming the range which in general determines the water-shed, is an

immense thickness of quartzite and conglomerates, not much altered, and apparently

Ahorizontal.     wide longitudinal valley marks the line between this formation and

the last mentioned, and is probably the site of a great fault.

   On descending the western slope of the mountains, while in the bottom of the

valleys are vertical talcose slates, the higher parts of the mountains are composed of

the same strata which form the eastern ranges, until the great valley is reached,

which the Columbia and Kootanie rivers traverse, while their course is parallel to the

range.

West of this a belt of slates and semi-metamorphic rocks was crossed, followed by

granite with true metamorphic rocks containing serpentine and marble, which brings

us to Colville.

South and west of this plain commence the great superficial floes of basalt with

beds of tufa, which have emanated from the flanks of the Cascade range. The Cas-

cade range itself consists of syenite and slates, with volcanic rock of recent date.

The greater mass of Vancouver's Island is composed of the same metamorphic

strata as at Colville                                                                                       but along both  sides of the  Gulf of  Georgia,  which separate it
                                                                                                         ;

from the mainland, and also forming the islands in that gulf, occur beds of grits and

coarse conglomerate, much disturbed and resting on volcanic rocks, and containing

the well-known deposits of coal and lignite as at Nanaimo and Bellingham Bay.

These coal-bearing grits at Nanaimo, I found to be overlaid by Septarian clays, such

as those I have found to the eastward of the Rocky Mountains, and containing the

same cretaceous fossils, comprising Bacidites and Inocerami. These clays are ob-

served, again, to be covered by grits. Fossils were obtained at some distance below

the coal at the base of the whole group, which have not yet arrived in England for

examination. They are, however, either lower cretaceous or oolitic forms.

outcrop being traceable for some distance along both banks of the river. It is

identical in geological position with the Cleveland ore of Yorkshire, and similar in
its mineral character. The bed varies in thickness from 10 to 15 feet, and the ore is
capable of being worked to an unlimited extent by tunneling into the hilly side from
the outcrop. The fossils, which are local, consist of the usual Marlstone species, as
Rhynchonella tetrahedra, Terebratula punctata, &c.

  --Mineral Character. At the outcrop, the iron-bed presents a rich ferruginous aspect

but when followed to some depth below the surface, the original colour is found to be
olive-green, and under the magnifying glass the stone appears oolitic. In this state

--the ore is probably a carbonate and silicate of iron the latter imparting a green

tinge. When exposed, it passes into a hydrated peroxide of iron. The remaining

constituents are carbonate of lime, 10 per cent. ; silica, 12 per cent. ; alumina, 7'8 per

cent. Phosphoric acid is only present in minute quantity, viz. 0'55 per cent. The
chief market for the ore is expected to be South Wales*.

   For the purpose of ascertaining the depth of the iron-bed below the Stonesfield
slate, the Duke of Marlborough directed that one of the slate pits should be continued
downwards till the ore was reached. This has not been accomplished ; for on reach-
ing at a depth of 120 feet the Upper Lias Clay, the water flowed in so plentifully that

the men were drowned out. With the assistance of numerous sections near Fawler,
the deficiency in the series may be supplied ; and the following are the results :

these facts bore out the theory which he had on previous occasions endeavoured to
demonstrate, that all the secondary rocks of England undergo attenuation towards
the south-east. The following comparison had been arrived at from carefully mea-

the greater part.

                       Notes on some Points in Chemical Geology.

 By T. Sterry Hunt, F.R.S., of the Geological Survey of Canada.

--Dolomites and Gypsum. Mr. Sterry Hunt has shown, from the mode in which dolo-

mites occur and from the phenomena presented by their associated fossils, that these

magnesian rocks cannot have been formed by the alteration of pure limestones, so that

the theories of Von Buch and Haidinger, proposed to explain their formation, are

really in nowise applicable. He has further shown, that in the famous experiment

suggested by Haidinger and performed by Von Morlot, who asserted that by the

action of sulphate of magnesia, in presence of water in an excess of carbonate of lime,

at 200° C. under pressure, there is formed sulphate of lime and a double carbonate of

lime and magnesia, the fact has been overlooked that in reality no double carbonate

is obtained, but only a mixture of anhydrous carbonate of magnesia with carbonate

of lime, and consequently not a dolomite, which is a chemical compound of the two.

   In Marignac's modification of Von Morlot's experiment, where the chloride is sub-
stituted for the sulphate of magnesia, Mr. Hunt finds that a variable portion of this

double carbonate is really formed, and remains mingled with the excess of carbonate

of lime and anhydrous carbonate of magnesia, which is also a result of the reaction as

before. Charles Deville's late experiments, in which fragments of limestone were im-

pregnated with magnesian solutions, and heated at the ordinary pressure, with forma-

tion of soluble lime-salts and magnesian carbonate, are but imperfect repetitions of

Von Morlot's and Marignac's processes, and none of these are applicable to the great

majority of cases in which pure and magnesian limestones are associated in such ways

as to show that they have been successively deposited from water, the latter sometimes

enclosing pebbles and fossils of pure carbonate of lime.

   Mr. Hunt proceeds to show that, when mixtures of amorphous hydrated carbonate

of magnesia with carbonate of lime are heated under pressure to a temperature of
300° to 400° F., direct combination ensues, and dolomite is formed ; and he gives

reasons for supposing that this combination may take place slowly at much lower

temperatures.

It was, however, necessary to find a source for the magnesian carbonate which had

formed these magnesian sediments, and here Mr. Hunt has signalized a remarkable

and hitherto undescribed reaction, by which carbonate of lime decomposes sulphate of
magnesia, not with the aid of heat and pressure as- in Von Morlot's experiment, but at

the ordinary temperature. When a solution of bicarbonate of lime is mingled with a

liquid containing sulphate of magnesia, a double decomposition takes place, and by
evaporation at temperatures between 90° and 180° F., the lime is deposited in the
form of gypsum, a very soluble bicarbonate of magnesia remaining dissolved, which
is precipitated by further evaporation. If we conceive the carbonate of lime to be
furnished by springs falling into a closed lake or basin, the carbonate of magnesia
would be precipitated in a state of mixture with carbonate of lime, thus giving the
elements of the dolomite which is always associated with stratified gypsum.

   Mr. Hunt has further shown that, by the action of waters containing alkaline carbo-
nates upon sea-water, the lime is first precipitated, and at length there is formed a
solution of bicarbonate of magnesia. To this agency he ascribes the vast deposits of
magnesian rocks which exist independent of gypsum, and which sometimes contain

an excess of carbonate of magnesia over that required to form dolomites, or lime being

absent, are magnesites.

The part which carbonate of soda has played in giving rise to carbonates of lime and

magnesia must, according to Mr. Hunt, have been very important in former periods.

The source of this has been the decomposition of felspar, which, in being reduced to

clays, have lost the whole or a part of their soda in the form of silicate, which, converted

into carbonate by the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, is now represented by the sea-

salt of the ocean and the carbonates of lime and magnesia of the rocky strata. Clays

and argillites are unknown in the vast thickness of crystalline rocks which constitute

chlorite, epidote, and alumina-garnet, and in those strata where lime and magnesia
are absent, chloritoid Andalusite, staurotide, and kyanite. These minerals, which are
only formed in aluminous sediments that have lost their alkalies, become more and

more abundant on the newer strata.

   The consideration of the composition of mineral springs, as Mr. Hunt has remarked,
shows that the solvent action of water removes from sediments chiefly soda, lime, and
magnesia, and with the concurrence of organic matter, oxide of iron, so that the more
permeable strata, and generally more siliceous, retain scarcely any other bases than

alumina and potash                                                                           the argillaceous and less permeable beds,  on  the contrary, retain
                                                                                          ;

the whole of their bases. The operation of processes continually going on in nature

therefore tends to divide the silico-argillaceous rocks into two classes, whose meta-

morphism and displacement will give rise, on the one hand, to granites and trachytes,

and on the other, to rocks made up of basic felspar and pyroxenes.

The author regards all the so-called igneous rocks as altered and translated sedi-

ments, and distinguishes them by the name of exotic rocks, from the same sediments
altered in situ, which may be called indigenous plutonic rocks. He insists upon the

fact that the chemical composition and, for the most part, the lithological characters

of all the varieties of intrusive rocks may be found represented in metamorphosed sedi-

ments.

Mr. Hunt has called attention to the fact, that as long ago as 1834 Keferstein

advanced the opinion that all plutonic rocks are only altered sediments, and thus

anticipated in part Sir John Herschel's theory of earthquakes and volcanic pheno-

mena, to which Mr. Hunt has given a wider extension, connecting it with Mr. Bab-

bage's speculations on the result of the rising of the isothermal lines in the earth's

crust, consequent upon the accumulation of sediments. The first result of this heat

would, as Mr. Babbage has shown, produce expansion and elevation but when meta-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

morphisin takes place, the contraction attendant upon the conversion of the sediments

into the denser silicates, such as chloritoid pyroxene, garnet, epidote staurotide, and

chiastolite, must produce an effect directly opposite. In this way Mr. Hunt conceives

that while the earth's nucleus may be a solid, although incandescent mass of anhydrous
silicates, we may suppose that the inferior strata, which are undergoing metamorphism

and igneo-aqueous fusion, agreeable to the views of Poulett Scrope, Herschel, Scheerer,

and Sorby, are contracting in such a manner, that we may possibly admit with Elie

de Beaumont a shrinking of the fluid mass beneath, which will explain the great plica-

tions of the earth's crust, and thus reconcile this theory with the view of a solid

nucleus. At the same time he is inclined to refer the great movements of elevation

and subsidence, for the most part, to what Herschel has described as " the disturbance

of the equilibrium of pressure" consequent upon the transfer of sediments, while the

yielding mass reposes upon a mass of matter partly solid and partly liquid.

These views will be found in the ' Reports of the Geological Survey of Canada for

1857 and 1858,' where the experiments upon gypsum and magnesian rocks are given

in detail. Also in a memoir published in the ' Quarterly Journal of the Geological

Society' for Nov. 1859.

On the Igneous Rocks interstratified tvith the Carboniferous Limestones of the

           Basin of Limerick. By J. Beete Jukes, M.A., F.R.S.

   The author called attention to some of the lately published sheets of the ' Geological
Survey of Ireland,' including this district, and stated that the ground had been sur-
veyed by Messrs. Kinahan, Foot, O'Kelly, and Wynne.

   He gave a brief sketch of the physical structure of the country around Limerick,

and then proceeded to describe its igneous rocks. These are of two kinds, trap and
trappean ash. The trap varies greatly in texture and aspect, more perhaps than in
mineral composition. The trappean ash (or tuff) is the result of the mechanical ero-
sion of the igneous rock, either during the time of its eruption or immediately after,
and before it was buried under other aqueous rocks. It consists of grains or frag-
ments of trappean material, varying from the finest powder to a coarse conglomerate,
with blocks several inches in diameter, and often contains large and small fragments
of limestone, and sometimes of other matters.

    It is perfectly stratified, lying in regular beds, interstratified both with the limestone
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  85

  and with the trap, and blends, almost insensibly, sometimes into one, and sometimes

  into the other rock.

       In the centre of the district, about Ballybrood, is a small hill of the lower coal-mea-

  sure shales, resting upon the upper limestone on one side, and on trap on the other.

  This trap attains a thickness of 800 or 1000 feet, and is chiefly contemporaneous bedded
  trap, but has some intrusive parts, which cut like dykes into the coal-measures. It rests
  on a bed of ash, and at its eastern end, at Nicker Hill, near Pallas, the most curious

 and complicated intcrstratifications of limestone, ash, and trap may be distinctly ob-

  served.

     Beneath this upper trap comes a regular band of upper limestone, 600 or 800 feet

  thick, surrounding the trap and coal-measures on all sides, and forming an oval basin.

     From underneath this another great belt of trap and ash crops out, forming a cor-

 responding outer basin, the dimensions of which are about 12 miles from E. to W., and
 6 miles from N. to S.

     The lower limestone rises from underneath this, and undulates for some miles over
 the adjacent country. Towards the N.W. some of these undulations are sufficiently

 great to bring the upper limestone in again, underneath the present surface of the
 ground, and with that largo parts of the lower trap and ash. There are thus formed

 three considerable detached outlying basins of trap and ash, one round Cahernarry
 and Roxborough, another about the eastern side of the city of Limerick, and a third
 round Carrigagunnil. There are also one or two small exhibitions of similar rocks
 towards the north, apparently on a rather lower horizon.

    The above igneous rocks are all bedded and interstratified with the limestones,
 except in a few places, where they seem rather to occur as small intrusive dykes,

 cutting through the other traps as well as the aqueous rocks.

    In many places the bedded traps become quite vesicular and scoriaceous, the vesi-

 cles being often filled with carbonate of lime and other minerals, and thus forming
 an amygdaloid.

    In some places these vesicular parts occur as irregular bands intermediate between
 bands of solid, compact, or even crystalline trap, precisely resembling the figures given
by Sir C. Lyell of the junctions of different flows of lava on Mount Etna.

     There are, however, six other detached masses of igneous rock, five on the south
 and one on the north of the basin above spoken of, which are clearly intrusive masses

rising up through the limestone, and not now connected with any overlying contem-
poraneous sheets of trap. It is probable that these mark the sites of the volcanic foci
 or funnels, through which some of the sheets of trap flowed to the then surface, such
 sheets, with the upper limestone including them, having been long ago removed by

 denudation. It is also probable that similar small detached foci or funnels lie still
concealed beneath the areas occupied by the contemporaneous traps and ashes.

    One of these detached masses, called Knock Dirk (not the hill which is called merely

Dirk), is a true syenite, having crystalline particles of quartz mingled with felspar
and hornblende.

    It is difficult to give any precise name to the rock comprising the other masses.
Some of the traps, both intrusive and contemporaneous, would be commonly called
felspar porphyry, others greenstone, and others basalt. When the felspar porphyry
loses its distinct crystals of fclpar, it might perhaps be called felstone. Felstone,
however, as understood by the author, means a rock composed of a trisilicated fel-

spar, mingled with an overplus of silica in a state of paste; and it seems difficult to
suppose that sihcated rocks proceeding in a molten condition through and over such a
basic substance as the carboniferous limestone, should still contain anv uncombined
silica, except in the heart of a large mass like Knock Dirk. It would se'em, therefore,
adrisable to apply some other name, such as aphanite, for instance, to the compact
felspathic rocks above spoken of. In the absence of precise chemical analysis, which
the author regretted that he had been unable hitherto to procure, it had seemed better
to speak of all the igneous rocks collectively under the vague but sufficiently intelligible
designation of trap.

   Mr. Jukes also stated, that he was much struck with the very great resemblance
between these trappean ashes and some of the traps, and those which he recollected

to have observed in the volcanic islands in Torres Straits, where small detached vol-
canoes have broken through the coral reefs, and formed rudely conical accumulations
of stratified ashes containing lumps of coral limestone together with flows of horn-
--86 REPORT 1860.

blendic lava. It is probable that beneath the sea-level sheets of such lava and vol-
canic ash lie interstratified with the coral limestone. Certainly, if Torres Straits were
depressed, and these islands exposed to the breakers, horizontal beds of the ash and
volcanic conglomerates would be derived from them, and spread over the surface of the

coral reefs.

On the Tynedale Coal-field and the Whin-sill of Cumberland and Northumber-

                              land. By J. A. Knipe.

   The author points out the interesting fact of the true Newcastle coal being worked,
and that most successfully, at a distance of about 40 miles west of the Great Northum-
berland and Durham coal-fields at the locality named. The history of this and an ad-
joining coal-field, called the Stublick, are both similar, viz. the strata are thrown down
many hundred feet by the prolongation of the 90 Fathom Fault, which is well known
and may be well observed on the Northumberland coast at Cullercotes. The principal
shaft sunk on this outlying coal-field, on the line of railway from Haltwhistle to Aid-
stone Moor, is named the "King Pit," Midgeholm Colliery. The depth of the shaft
is 506 feet 6 inches; there are five workable seams of coal, the aggregate thickness
of which is 23 feet.

   The Great Whin-sill, or interstratified trap, may be traced, more or less, for many

score miles in the counties of Cumberland and Northumberland, to its termination
on the coast of the German Ocean, at Dunstanburgh Castle. At Wall Town, situated

on the old Roman Road, north by west from Haltwhistle, a town and station on

the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway, about 2i miles, the Whin-sill assumes a very bold
bluff appearance, after emerging from the superincumbent limestone rock. In places

it has a columnar structure, but has now much of its mural appearance changed by
trees growing amongst the ruin and debris of the rocky structure ; on the summit
there is still a very perfect portion left of the Roman wall. The author described the
section through the limestone grit shales, ironstone, and Blenkinsop Mines to the King

Pit and Tynedale Fault.

     On ike Eruption in May 1860, of the Kotliigja Volcano in Iceland.
                     By W. Lauder Lindsay, M.D., F.L.S.

   It may interest the Geological Section of the British Association to be informed

that an eruption has recently occurred of the Kotliigja volcano, Iceland, from a visit

to which island I have just returned. Had time permitted (which it does not) I in-

tended to have drawn up for the British Association a brief account of the chief phe-
nomena of the eruption in question, accompanied by drawings made on the 13th June

Inst., and a map of the district, and preceded by a summary of the preceding erup-

tions of the same volcano, which are fourteen in number. I hope at greater leisure to
prepare such a notice for some of the journals.

   Meanwhile I may concisely state that the volcafno in question is situated in the

south of Iceland, about twenty miles from the coast, near, but considerably to the east
of, the well-known Hekla, which has been quiescent since 1846. Kotliigja is part of a
range, fifteen to twenty miles long, of glacier-covered mountains or " Jokuls," which
include Eyafjalla, Myrdals and Godalands Jokuls ; the average elevation above the

sea being between 4000 and 5000 feet. The eruption began on the 8th of May last;

it was preceded by earthquakes of a local character; the first indication of its advent
being a dark cloud hovering over the summit of the mountain. The usual chief ejecta

of Kotliigja, when in a state of eruption, are hot water, pumice, and ashes. On the
occasion of the last, or fifteenth eruption, in May last, the most noteworthy pheno-
menon was the enormous water-flo-d sent forth, a flood which bore with it pieces of

ice so large that they were stranded in the sea (twenty miles distant) at a depth of 20

fathoms. The flames which issued from the crater were on the 12th of May visible

in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, which is at least eighty miles distant; and on
the 16th smoke rose to the height of 24,000 feet, this column of smoke being also
visible in Reykjavik. I left Scotland for Iceland on the 8th of June inst, expecting to

find Kotlugjd still giving forth its fire and pouring out its floods of water. On the 13th
we sailed close to the south coast of Iceland from Portland's Hak westward, the wea-

ther being beautiful and our view of Myrdals- Jbkul and the neighbouring Jokuls ex-

cellent: but all was quiet; not a vestige of smoke even was to be seen. Touching
at the Westmanna Islands, we were informed that the Kbtliigja eruption had ceased
a few days previously, having done comparatively little mischief to the farms in its

vicinity.

and Topography of Kbtliigja, will be found in a paper by the author " On the Erup-

On some Reptilian Foot-prints from the New Red Sandstone, north of
               Wolverhampton. By the Rev. W. Lister.

The object of this paper is simply to announce the discovery, in a fresh locality, of

foot-prints of the Labyrinlhodon, Rhynchosaurits, and of another animal, or animals,

with which I am not acquainted. Hitherto, I believe, the remains of the Laby-

rinthodon have only been found in Warwickshire, and the north of Cheshire and its

neighbourhood                                                          and  the  Rhynchosaurits  in  the  Grinsel  quarry  near  Shrewsbury*.                                   The
                                                                    ;

foot-prints now discovered have been met with in Staffordshire, in a quarry of the

New Red Sandstone, on the very borders of the Red Marl, at a place about six miles

north of Wolverhampton, in the parish of Brewood, on the road between " The
Stone House " and Somerford. " The Stone House," which is given on the Ordnance

Map, is near to Chillington Avenue Gites, and within 200 yards of the quarry. The

bed in which the foot-prints occur is about 12 feet from the surface. One of the slabs

was so thickly covered with impressions, resembling those of the Rhynchosaurits, as
to make one feel that the animals which made them must have been very numerous

on the spot. These were smaller than most of the others, and I have a" strong im-

pression that they were those of young animals, they were so uniform in size and

form. But unfortunately, the slab, which was from 5 to 6 feet long by from 3 to 4
broad, was removed before I had an opportunity of re-examining it.

   The ripple-mark is very beautifully preserved on some of the slabs, and so is also
the rain-drops; while in many cases the amount of sand deposited by each tide is

readily discovered by the thickness of its layers, which lie one on the other, and which,

by means of the ripple-mark, show also the direction in which the water flowed, or

the wind blew, at the time they were deposited. The deposits of two, three, and, in
some cases, of even four tides are easily seen.

Some  of the foot-prints of                                                      the  Labyrinlhodon       are  10  inches  in  length                                 those of  the

Rhynchosaurits are from 1 to 2 inches.

           On the Contents of Three Square Yards of Triassic Drift.

                              By C.Moore, F.G.S.

   The author stated that several years ago he suspected the presence of triassic rocks
in the neighbourhood of Froine, from accidentally finding a single block of stone on a
roadside heap of carboniferous limestone, containing fish remains of the former age;
but that for a long time he was unable to discover it in situ. More recently, when
examining some carboniferous limestone quarries near the above town, he observed
certain fissures which had subsequently been filled up by a drift of a later age. One
of these was about a foot in breadth at the top, but increased to 15 feet in breadth at
the base of the quarry, 30 feet below, at which point teeth aud bones of triassic reptiles

   * After the reading of the paper, it was stated by Mr. Hull of the Government Survey,
that impressions of the Labyrinlhodon have been discovered in two or three other fresh

--localities, but they have not, as I understand, been published. W. L.

and fishes were found. Usually these infillings consisted of a material as dense as

the limestone itself, and from which any organic remains could only be extracted

with difficulty. In another part of the section he was fortunate enough to find a de-

posit consisting of a coarse friable sand, containing similar remains. In order that

this might receive a more careful examination than could be given to it on the spot,

the whole of it, consisting of about 3 tons weight, was carted away to the residence

of the author, at Bath, a distance of twenty miles ; all of which had passed under his
observation, with the following results:-- The fish remains, which were the most

abundant, were first noticed. Some idea might be formed of their numbers when he

stated that of the genus Acrodus alone, including two species, he had extracted 45,000

teeth from the three square yards of earth under notice, and that they were even

more numerous than these numbers indicated, since he rejected all but the most

perfect examples. Teeth of the Sauriclrfhys of several species were also abundant
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and, next to them, teeth of the Hybudus, with occasional spines of the latter genus.

Scales of Gi/rolepis and Lepidotus were also numerous, and teeth showing the pre-

sence of several other genera of fishes. With the above were found a number of

curious bodies, each of which was surmounted by a depressed, enamelled, thorn-like

spine or tooth, in some cases with points as sharp as that of a coarse needle; these

the author supposed to be spinous scales, belonging to several new species of fish,

allied to the Squaloraia, and that to the same genus were to be referred a number of

hair-like spines, with flattened fluted sides, found in the same deposit. There were

also present specimens, hitherto supposed to be teeth, and for which Agassiz had

created the genus Ctenoplychius, but which he was rather disposed to consider

(like those previously referred to) to be the outer scales of a fish allied to the Squa-

loraia. It was remarked that, as the drift must have been transported from some di-

stance, delicate organisms could scarcely have been expected; but, notwithstanding,

it contained some most minute fish-jaws and palates, of which the author had, either

perfect or otherwise, 1.30 examples. These were from a quarter to the eighth of an

inch in length, and within this small compass he possessed specimens with from thirty

to forty teeth                                                            and in one palate he  had succeeded  in    reckoning as many         as seventy-
                                                                       ;

four teeth in position ; and there were spaces where sixteen more had disappeared, so

that in this tiny specimen there were ninety teeth ! Of the order Reptilia there

were probably eight or nine genera, consisting of detached teeth, scutes, vertebra?,

ribs, and articulated bones. Amongst these he had found the flat crushing teeth

Placodus                                                                                                                            had

in the muschelkalk of Germany, a zone of rocks hitherto wanting in this country,

but which, in its Fauna, was represented by the above reptile. But by far the most

important remains in the deposit were indications of the existence of triassic mam-
malia. Two little teeth of the Microlestcs had, some years before, been found in

Germany, and were the only traces of this high order in beds older than the Stonesfield

slate. The author's minute researches had brought to light fifteen molar teeth, either

identical with, or allied to, the Microlcstes, and also five incisor teeth, evidently be-

longing to more than one species. A very small double-fanged tooth, not unlike the

oolitic Spalacot Iterium, proved the presence of another genus and a fragment of a

tooth, consisting of a single fang, with a small portion of the crown attached, a third

genus, larger in size than the Microlestcs. Three vertebra3, belonging to an animal
smaller than any existing mammal, had also been found. The author inferred that

if twenty-five teeth and vertebra?, belonging to three or four genera of Mammalia,

were to be found within the space occupied by three square yards of earth, that por-

tion of the globe which was then dry land, and from whence the material was in part

derived, was probably inhabited at this early period of its history by man}' genera of

Mammalia, and would serve to encourage a hope that this family might yet be found

in beds of even a more remote age.

      Remarks on Fossil Fish from the North Staffordshire Coal Fields.

                            By William Molyneux.

   The author of this paper stated that little more than two years ago the fossil fish of
the coal-field in question comprised, so far as was then known, a list of eight genera

of exhibiting before this Section a collection of such remains, the generic number of

which amounted to upwards of twenty, including some new to science, and others of
a rare and interesting order. On the present occasion his principal object was to

draw attention to some specimens obtained since the period alluded to. One of

these, Ctenacan'hus Itybodoides (Egerton), was in a perfect state of preservation.

Another specimen was a lower jaw of Rhizodus, whose long powerful teeth, arranged

in pairs, resembled in their curved points R. incurvus of the Ohio coal-field                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           but as

there appeared to be doubts of its specific identity, probably it would prove to be a
new species. There was also a fragment of a massive jaw of the same genus which

presented features of much interest to the ichthyologist.

   Of the smaller ganoids exhibited, one represented a new genus, obtained from the
deep mine ironstone shale at Longton, at the pit where ironstone was first worked

for the purpose of manufacture in North Staffordshire. The specimen measured four
inches in length, but was scarcely one inch in its greatest depth immediately behind

the head                                    the form being tapering and elegant.  The dorsal fin was placed but half
                                         ;

an inch before the bifurcating point of the caudal, and slightly in advance of the

anal fin, the rays being strong and articulated. The scales were rhomboidal in
form, and profusely ornamented with raised lines, which assumed the character of a
series of Gothic arches ranging from the centre of the scale. Some undescribed spe-
cimens of Palaeoniscus, with many large teeth of Placoid fish, were also exhibited.

The  coal-field in question was found              to be particularly rich        in fish-remains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       and
                                                                                                                                                         ;

although little more than two years had been actively devoted to the subject, the

generic list had during that time increased from eight to thirty-three in number,' and

the author felt sanguine that it would ultimately prove quite as rich in species as the

Old Red of Scotland.                        These  remains, it was                stated, occur very irregularly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        some

beds of ironstone in the upper division of the measures contain considerably more

than others, but it was only in one instance, that of the new mine, that they were

found forming a stratum from one to three inches in thickness. Though anything like
perfect specimens were comparatively rare, the fine compact shales of the knowls

and deep mine ironstones had lately produced some well-preserved specimens of
Palaeoniscus and Platvsoma.

     Notice of a Fossiliferous Deposit near Farnell, in Forfarshire, N. B.

            By J. Powrie. {Communicated by Sir R. Murchison.)

    This deposit, which is situated on the south-east bank of the Pow Burn, about half a

 mile soulh-west of the Farnell Station of the Scottish North-Eastern Railway,
 mostly consists of fine greyish argillaceous shales, the lower portion splitting into

laminae nearly as thin as writing-paper, and when first opened of a delicate cream-
 colour; the upper beds are thicker, and vary from a cream-colour to dark grey: in
many places these are considerably stained by the infiltration of iron in solution.
The dip is, at an angle of about 12°, in a nearly north-west direction, the strike thus

 following that of the Great Anticline which runs through Forfarshire, a little to the
 south-east, in a direction of from north-east to south-west nearly'.

    This deposit rests conformably on a thick-bedded coarse dark red sandstone, and
 varying from 4 to 6 or 7 feet in thickness, is overlaid by coarse broken shales, above
 which is a considerable thickness of boulder clay and soil. Both from its position
and peculiar organic remains, it can at once be recognized as occupying the same
position in the Forfarshire formations as the Turin Hill and Carmvllie flagstones.
Cropping out on the banks of a small stream, it was first noticed as affording indications
of being fossiliferous by the Rev. Henry Brewster of Farnell, and pointed out by him

as such to the Rev. Hugh Mitchell, who first discovered that, besides Parca decipiens
and remains of Pteryyoti, &c, it contained small fishes in astate of wonderful preserva-

tion; these being, with the exception of Cephalaspis and afew very imperfect ichthyolites,
the first fishes found in the Forfarshire sandstones : a paper was read, and a selection
of these exhibited by Mr. Mitchell at the Meeting of the British Association held at
Aberdeen last August (1859). Indisposition has prevented him continuing to aid in

these explorations.

   The Earl of Southesk, on whose estates this deposit is situated, has lately most
liberally opened up this deposit, and placed the examination of its contents under the
90 REPORT 1860.

superintendence of Mr. Brewster and myself : already a considerable portion has

been carefully looked over, and has yielded to our researches some most interesting

remains : these lie scattered through the whole deposit, but in the upper and coarser

beds are for the most part both badly preserved and very fragmentary ; in the lower

fissile portions they are more perfect, and the state of preservation is generally very
fine : no painting could equal the beautiful appearance some of the smaller fishes
exhibit when the Httle slab in which they have been entombed is first opened up, and

still damp. From the fragile nature of the matrix, great care is required in splitting

it  up                    and  in  afterwards fitting up the specimens for preservation  they  are exceedingly
                       ;

apt to be destroyed.

   The Parca decipiens is the most abundant organism found; finely sculptured frag-
ments of Pterygotus Anglicus and other Pterygoti are by no means uncommon ; and
one or two varieties of as yet unnamed Eurypteridce have been found, and are now in the

collections of Mr. Brewster and Mr. Mitchell. But by far the most interesting feature

of this deposit is the comparative abundance of small-sized fishes not found elsewhere

in Forfarshire ; although Cephalaspis is frequently found in other localities along with

Pterygotus, as yet not a fragment of this fish has been disinterred. All the fishes I

have as yet examined, in a state of preservation sufficient for identification, belong to

the family Acanthodii, and, in so far as I am able to ascertain, to the genera Acanihodes

and Diplaccuithus. Of the latter genus (DipUtcanthus), two, if not more, very distinct

species have, up to this time, been found; unfortunately these are very rarely entire,

the deposit being a good deal fractured and faulted; although the largest of the

Diplacanthus yet found does not seem to have been over 6 inches in length, only one

nearly complete fish of that genus has as yet turned up ; the other specimens show

merely portions of the body, tail, &c. Of Acanihodes, the fishes, being small, are

generally much more entire : of this genus I can only discern one species, and this,

Aalthough provisionally named at the Aberdeen Meeting " canth odes antiquus," in

no way differs, in so far as I can see, from the specimens of Acanihodes pusilhis I have

been able to procure for comparison (these, however, have all been very imperfect),

further than the condition of the sediment in which they had been laid down, and

similar natural causes might readily explain.

    Although by no means prepared to assert the positive specific identity of the Far-

nell fishes with those of the same genera found in Cromarty, Morayshire, &c, yet their

general resemblance to these fishes found in our more northern deposits, in my

opinion, strongly points to the probability of our Forfarshire flagstones belonging to an

epoch more nearly approximating in geological time to the fish-beds of the northern

counties than has as yet been generally thought likely.

    Besides these, some very imperfect remains of fishes, evidently belonging to other

families, have been found; it is to be hoped that further explorations may throw some

additional light on the nature of these fragments (see p. 78).

   On some New Facts in relation to the Section of the Cliff at Mundesley,

                Norfolk. By Joseph Prestwich, F.R.S. fyc.

   The object of the author was to correct an opinion which prevailed regarding the
superposition of the freshwater deposit at Mundesley. In the interesting sections

of the Norfolk coast, given by Sir C. Lyell in the ' Philosophical Magazine ' for May

1840, the freshwater beds of Mundesley are represented as intercalated in the Boulder
Clay. The wearing away of the cliff since that period has exposed a clearer section,
from which it appears to the author that there is no intercalation of the beds; but
that the freshwater beds overlie the Boulder Clay, and that they are newer than any
portion of the cliff except a bed of the gravel which passes over them. They lie in a
hollow worn through the upper beds and the Boulder Clay down to the sands beneath,

and they are clearly separated from all these older beds by another and underlying bed

of gravel.

   The author further noticed that the lower sands and gravels under the Boulder clay
contained a layer of marine shells in a perfect state of preservation, consisting of
Mytilus edulis (some with Balanl attached) and Littorina lilloralis, and traces of
others. Again, below this is a seam of dark clay containing freshwater shells, chiefly
the Pisidium amnicum, and a Unio, while a short distance lower is the well-known
Forest bed with its elephant and other mammalian remains. He concludes by call-
ing attention to the Mundesley deposit as being probably synchronous with the flint-
implement bearing deposit of Hoxne.

On the Chronological and Geographical Distribution of the Devonian Fos-

     sils of Devon and Cornwall. By William Pengelly, F.G.S.

The limestones, slates, and associated sandstones of North and South Devon and

Cornwall have, as is well known, caused much perplexity as to their real place in the

chronological series of the geologist. Thanks, however, to the labours of Professor

Sedgwick, Sir R. I. Murchison, Mr. Lonsdale and others, the problem is now gene-

rally admitted to be solved ; the rocks in question are the equivalents of the Old Red

Sandstones of Scotland  and  elsewhere                                                          they belong  to what  is  known as  the Devonian
                                                                                             ;

age of the world.

 -- --Some little difficulty, however, exists or rather once existed in the way of the

full and unqualified acceptance of this decision. The rocks of Devonshire are crowded

with the remains of invertebrate animals, especially sponges, corals, and shells;

whilst the supposed contemporary deposits of Scotland and the adjacent isles are so

rich in fossil fish, that, in the language of the late Hugh Miller, " Orkney, were the

trade once opened up, could supply with ichthyolites, by the ton and the shipload,

the museums of the world*;" but the fossils characteristic of either of these districts

are not found in the other. Scotland does not yield the mollusks and zoophytes of

Devonshire, nor is there recorded in the latter district more than the faintest trace of

the ichthyolitic wealth of the North.

   Though this fact may still have difficulties connected with it, they have ceased to
be chronological ; for Sir R. I. Murchison tells us that " The same fossil fishes, of

species well known in the middle and upper portions of the Old Red of Scotland, and

which in large tracts of Russia lie alone in sandstone, are in many other places found

intermixed, in the same bed, with those shells that characterize the group in its slaty

and calcareous form in Devonshire, the Rhenish country, and the Bouionnais." " The

fact of this intermixture completely puts an end to all dispute respecting the identifi-

cation of the central and upper masses of the Old Red of Scotland with the calcareous

deposits of Devonshire and the Eifelf."

Professor Sedgwick has proposed the following threefold division of the Devonian

rocks of Devon and Cornwall :

"The first and oldest of these groups may be conveniently called the Plymouth

group, using these words in an extended sense, so as to include all the limestones of

South Devon and the red sandstones superior to the Plymouth limestones. The

equivalent to this group in North Devon includes, I think, the Ilfracombe and Linton

limestones as well as the red sandstones of the north coast.

" The second group includes the slates expanded from Dartmouth to the metamor-

phic group of Start Point and Bolt Head, and is, so far as I know, without fossils: it

may be called the Dartmouth group, and its equivalent in North Devon is found in

the slates of Morte Baiy, which end with beds of purple and greenish sand-rock and

coarse greywacke. It ranges nearly east and west across the county.

   " The third group is not, I think, found in South Devon ; but in North Devon it is
well-defined, commencing on a base-line of sandstone beds which range nearly east

and west from Baggy Point (on the western coast) to Marwood (which is a few miles

north of Barnstaple), and thence towards the eastern side of the county. This group

--92 REPORT 1860.

is continued in ascending order to the slates on the north shore of Barnstaple Bay;
but its very highest beds are seen on the south shore of the bay, dipping under the

base of the culm- measures.

   "The equivalent of this third and highest Devonian group is found to the south of

the great culm-trough in a group, near the top of which appear the limestone bands

and fossiliferous slates of Pethenvin. It may be called the Barnstaple or Petherwin

group*."

Professor Sedgwick recognizes the Plymouth group in the slates of Looe, Polperro,

and Fowey in Cornwall f.
   Accepting, at least provisionally, these divisions, we have, when considered chro-

nologically as well as geographically, what, as a matter of convenience, may be called

five fossiliferous areas; namely, a deposit of the age of the Plymouth group in each of

the districts, South Devon, North Devon, and Cornwall ; and one of the Barnstaple
age in each of the two latter. To avoid undesirable repetition, the)' will be spoken of
throughout this paper as Lower South Devon, Lower North Devon, Lower Cornwall,
Upper North Devon, and Upper Cornwall. The terms " Lower" and " Upper" are
to be understood as applied relatively only to the rocks of Devon and Cornwall, and

not as embodying or implying any opinion respecting the co-ordination of these rocks

with deposits of the Devonian age elsewhere.

   Had existing materials warranted it, it would have been desirable to have made a

farther division, namely, one having reference to the mineral character of the depo-

sits, as well as to time and place ; for it is certain, as might have been expected, that,
in the same area, some fossils are peculiar to the argillaceous beds, and others are
found only in the calcareous strata; thus, for example, I learn from Mr. Godwin-

Austen that he has found the remarkable coral Pleurodictyum problemalicum in the

Myslates, but not in the limestones, at Ogwell in South Devon.  own experience is

in harmony with this; the same fossil occurs in the slates at Torquay and, in great

abundance, at and near Looe in Cornwall ; but not in limestone anywhere. At pre-

sent, however, it would be premature to attempt a division of this kind.
   The object contemplated in the present paper is to give some account of the ancient

population of the five areas, especially with reference to their distribution, so far as it

was known when the Census was last taken.

   Amongst the things which have recently drawn my attention to this subject may be

mentioned the following passage in the address of Professor Phillips as President of
the Geological Society of London. " Only a small proportion of the fossils of North

--Devon occur in South Devon J." And also the following statement by Professor

Haughton : " I do not believe in the lapse of a long interval of time between the

Silurian and Carboniferous deposits, in fact in a Devonian period.
   " The same blending of corals has been found in Ireland, the Bas Boulonnais, and

in Devonshire, where Silurian and Carboniferous forms are ol common occurrence in

the same localities §."
   It should be remembered that the statement with which we have here to deal is that

the "blending of corah" (the word is not fossils) "of Silurian and Carboniferous
forms is of common occurrence in Devonshire.''

   I have consulted such registers as I have been able to command, and have thrown
so much of their contents as bear on the questions before us into the following tabular

form, for which, of course, no higher value is claimed than attaches to the original

documents.

The materials have been in a great degree derived from Professor Morris's ' Cata-

logue of Fossils.'
   Every geologist must, of course, be aware of the numerous and elaborate Tables

which Professor Phillips has introduced in his ' Palaeozoic Fossils of Devon and

Cornwall,' when discussing subjects akin to those at present under consideration. In
the preparation of this paper the author has in no way made use of the valuable data

these Tables contain.

--94 REPORT 1860.

Table, that, taken together, the five areas have yielded 347 species of fossils belong-
ing to 97 genera and 49 families, of 9 classes of animals; namely, three classes of
the subkingdom Radiata, one of Articnlata, and five of Mollusca; hence 15 of the
24 classes into which the existing animal kingdom is commonly divided are totally
unrepresented in the series, as is the entire vegetable kingdom also.

   It is scarcely necessary to remark that the fossils of Devon and Cornwall do not

--fully represent the organisms of the Devonian age, as six other classes Pisces,

Pteropoda, Cirripedia, and Annelida amongst animals, and Cellulares and Monoco-

--tyledones amongst plants have been found in rocks of this age elsewhere ; and of

these the last and first two have been met with in British localities.
   The most important class numerically is Brachiopoda, to which 108 species belong;

that is 31 per cent, of the entire series. The families and genera of Cephalopoda are
richer in species than those of any other class, averaging 16 for each family and 10

for each genus.

   The most striking fact in this connexion, is the abundance of Brachiopoda and
Cephalopoda, and the paucity of Lamellibranchiate and Gasteropod species, as com-
pared with the numerical rank of the same classes in the existing British fauna; this
will, perhaps, he most strikingly exhibited by the following Table :

species of fossil Mollusca found in Devon and Cornwall has been put=1000, and the

numbers belonging to each class equated to this; the right hand column has been

formed on the same principle, and is based on the data given by Forbes and Hanley

in their ' History of British Mollusca.'

It appears then that within existing British seas, the Lamellibranchiates are about

twenty-four times more numerous, specifically, than the Brachiopods, whilst within

what may be called the same area, the latter were to the former during the Devonian

period somewhat more than as 2 to 1 ; that is, they were then 50 times more abun-

dant than at present in comparison. with the other great class of Acephala. In like

manner it is seen that, relatively to the Gasteropoda, the Cephalopoda were, in this

early age of our planet, seventeen times more numerous than now. It may be added

that, within the district under notice, the registered species of Devonian Brachiopoda

and Cephalopoda absolutely, and in a high ratio, exceed those belonging to the same

classes within existing British seas.

The five columns of Table I. headed "Peculiar to," and distinguished from one

another by the initials of the five areas, show the number of fossil species which, so

far as England is concerned, are peculiar to each ; from which it appears that 296

species are peculiar to one or other of them, leaving no more than 51 distributed

amongst them. Lower South Devon monopolizes no fewer than 191 species in this

way, whilst Lower North Devon is equally remarkable for its fossil poverty.

Five areas, taken two, three, four, and five together, are capable of being formed

into twenty-six different combinations. Not a single species is common to the

five areas, and only one, Cyathophyllum celticum, is found in each of four of them.
The well-known coral Favosites cervicomis is the only fossil found in each of the

three contemporary deposits of Lower North and South Devon and Cornwall. Of

--two areas only, Upper North Devon and Upper Cornwall have the greatest number

fourteen in common.*

  * See in Table I. the ten columns headed " Common to," and distinguished by combina-

tions of initials of two or more areas.

It must be understood that any one of the ten columns just noticed shows, not the

total number of species common to the areas the initials of which stand at its head,

but simply the number at once common and restricted to them collectively; thus the

second of these columns, headed L. S. D., L. C, shows that five species are common

and  restricted  to  Lower South  Devon                                                                                                                                                and  Lower  Cornwall                                                       but  in  the  third  column
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

we find one species common to them and also to Lower North Devon, in the fourth

one common to them and to Upper North Devon, and in the eighth one found in each

of them and also in Upper North Devon and Upper Cornwall; hence there are eight

species common to the two areas instanced, five being restricted to them collectively

and three not. The same explanation applies to the other areas. Hence the total

number of species found in any area will be ascertained by adding the figures in all

the columns marked "Peculiar to" and "Common to" at the head of which the

initials of the  area  are  found                               thus,                                                                                                                  for  example, a total of 47 species of .Zoophyta
                                                             ;

occurs in Lower South Devon, of which 40 are not found elsewhere in Devon and

Cornwall. Moreover, as the column marked " Species " shows that the two counties

have yielded a total of 49 species belonging to this class, it is evident that two of this

total number have not been met with in Lower South Devon. And so on for the

other classes and areas, as is shown in the five columns headed " Totals " and

distinguished by the initials of the areas.

Of the 347 species, 67 are met with in various parts of Continental Europe, and

7 in North America; G of the latter being included in the European 67, and one of

the 6 is also found in New South Wales; thus making a total of 68 common to Devon

and Cornwall and to districts beyond the British Isles*.

Comparatively few of the Devonian fossils of the two counties appear to have been

derived from the Silurian fauna ; eight species only are referable to that earlier period f.
Amongst these are the three corals, Favosites fibrosa, Emmonsia hemisphcerica, and

Chonophijllum perfoliation. The first has been found in Lower Silurian rocks at

Llandovery; in the upper deposits of the same system in various parts of the typical

Silurian country, in eight counties of Ireland, in Russia, and in three North American

localities ; during the Devonian era it existed in several parts of Devonshire, in
France, and in Germany. The second, Emmonsia hemisphcerica, dates its origin

in Upper Silurian times, when it seems to have been confined to the area of modern

North America, ranging from the State of Ohio to Tennessee ; having outlived the

Silurian period, it sent colonies to Spain and Britain and greatly extended its range

in America.

Clionophyllnm perfolialum differs from the two former in having always lived

within narrow geographical limits                                                                                                                                                      it occurs in Upper Silurian beds at Wenlock, and
                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

in Devonian in one quarry near Newton in Devonshire; but its appearance is not

recorded elsewhere.

The wide geographical range of the first two would seem to imply hardy plastic

constitutions, fitting them for distant travel, and existence under varied circumstances;

there is, therefore, nothing very surprising in their extended vertical range ; it is,

perhaps, worthy of remark, that the second seems to have disappeared at the very

zenith of its widely extended power.

The very limited distribution, in space, of the last of the trio would scarcely suggest

the thought that such an organism would be likely to be capable of enduring physical

and thermal changes such as, there are reasons for believing, considerable lapses of

time have always introduced into any given area; changes probably similar to those

which an organism would experience in passing to a distant locality in any one and

the same period.

   On the other hand, the well-known fossil coral Favosites Goldfussi occurs in Devo-
nian rocks in Devonshire, at Nehou and Vise in France, at Millar in Spain, in the
Oural, in the States of Ohio and Kentucky in North America, and in New South

Wales. It seems to have successfully struggled with the varying conditions of change

of place, and might have been expected to be equally capable of contending with
such as depend on lapses of time ; nevertheless, the facts do not harmonise with such

every part of the world, yet it commenced and terminated its career within the De-

vonian period.

The rocks of Devon and Cornwall have 58 species of fossils in common with

those of the Carboniferous group*, but no corals or sponges amongst them ; so that
it cannot be said that " there is a blending of Silurian and Carboniferous corals in

Devonshire," whatever there may be elsewhere; for though, as has been stated, three

Silurian corals have been found, not one referable to the Carboniferous fauna has

been exhumed theref.

   The species which thus passed from the Devonian into the Carboniferous period are
found in the three principal fossiliferous deposits of Devon and Cornwall, as exhibited

in the following Table :

   Each area is marked by some class being relatively most abundant in it, as is ex-

hibited below, thus* :

large outstanding amount of fact incapable of being thus explained away ; the problem
demands some other solution. Suppose it true that in some cases the organic dissi-
milarity, which has been described, was due to differences in the mineral character of
the ancient sea-bottoms; still when we have two areas like Lower South and North
Devon, consisting of contemporary, almost contiguous, and scarcely dissimilar depo-
sits, one rich and the other poor in the variety of its organic remains, having together
233 species yet no more than 8 in common, some other solutionis obviously needed.

   Was there a terrestrial barrier separating the two areas ? Was that which is now

Central Devon occupied by dry land, which stretched far both east and west, while
the waves of the Devonian ocean rolled over the north and south of the county? All
the known physical facts are opposed to such a hypothesis. Moreover, 8 species
actually did migrate from one area to the other; eight proofs, then, that a passage did
exist, unless we suppose that both areas were peopled from some more distant centre

or centres of dispersion.

   It may be asked, were not these eight the remnants of an earlier (a Silurian) fauna?

forms of life whose localization had been determined by an earlier distribution of land
and water? Eight Silurian forms do make their appearance amongst the Devonians

of Devon and Cornwall ; are not these the very eight thus common ? Now it so hap-

pens that they are not ; in fact there is not a single Silurian form in the Lower North
Devon series. This hypothesis then fails. Shall we hold with Professor Phillips, that
" this unequal diffusion of definite forms of life may often be ascribed to oceanic cur-
rents*?" 1 cannot but think that fewer difficulties attach to this than to any other
hypothesis which has been proposed. It simply requires us to suppose that a per-
sistent oceanic stream, flowing through Central Devon, separated the contemporary
deposits of the north and south, and formed, by its thermal or other qualities, an all

but impenetrable barrier to the marine tribes.
   Though, as we have seen, at least so far as Devonshire is concerned, the basis

entirely fails on which scepticism respecting the existence of a Devonian period has
been founded, namely, that ' : the blending of Silurian and Carboniferous corals is of

common occurrence," yet if the word "fossil" be substituted for "coral," a blending

of this kind certainly does occur, and doubtless the fact is not without a meaning.
Eight species from the older and 58 found in the more modern (a total of 66) meet

in Devon. Are they necessarily so many proofs that the rocks in which they were
inhumed are not Devonian? It must be borne in mind that there are 281 species
that are neither Silurian nor Carboniferous, but of an intermediate character. The

palceontological argument then stands thus : there are 66 witnesses supposed to

testify that the rocks are not Devonian, and 281 (upwards of 4 to 1) emphatically
declare that they are. But the adverse witnesses are by no means agreed amongst
themselves ; eight of them claim the rocks as Silurian, and fifty-eight as Carboniferous.
Is there no way of interpreting their evidence, but that of sacrificing the Devonian

system altogether? Are they not so many arguments in favour of the gradual pas-
sage of system into system ? so many difficulties in the way of a belief in catastrophes?
by which I mean convulsions (or call it by any other name) which, from time to

time, shook the very life out of the world, causing a series of universal and synchro-

nous depopulations of our planet. May we not regard them as so many tints inter-

mediate, both in quality and in place, between the extreme bands of the rainbow,
uniting them into one beautifully graduated chromatic spectrum, so softly blending
as to render it impossible to define the exact place of lines of demarcation? which
perhaps have not, and never would have been supposed to have, a physical existence,
had not observers hastily generalized from the imperfect evidence obtained during

a period of colour blindness.

   But if the Devonshire rocks were handed over to the Carboniferous system, we
should not be quit of the doctrine that some of the forms of one period have, at least

in some instances, lived through it into the next; for the opponents of a Devonian
period not only admit this, but rest their case on the alleged fact that " Silurian and
Carboniferous forms are found blended together in Devonshire and elsewhere." When,
nearly a quarter of a century ago, Mr. Lonsdale first suggested that the fossils of

South Devon, taken as a whole, exhibited a peculiar character intermediate to those
of the Silurian and Carboniferous groups, he was perfectly aware that amongst them

were forms referable to each of these faunas, yet this did not deter him from making

the suggestion, even in the face of a physical difficulty connected with the culmiferous

--beds of North Devon subsequently removed by Prof. Sedgwick and Sir It. I, Mur-

cln1sSoUInI..

   And what has been the efFect of the recent progress of discovery and nicer discri-

mination on this question? Has it increased or decreased the evidence in favour of
a Devonian period? In IS 16 Sir II. De la Beehe, discussing this subject, gave a
total of 190 species noticed in South Devon which he disposed of thus : 75 Carboni-
ferous forms, 10 Silurian, S common to Silurian and Carboniferous, and 07 peculiar

-- --to Devonshire*. At present confining ourselves also to South Devon the lists give

a total of 226, of which 34 are Carboniferous, 6 Silurian, not one common to both,
and 186 peculiar to the district; or putting the totals at each period =1000, and

equating the separate numbers to this, the figures stand as ill the following Table, and
show a decided advance Devonianward.

hypothesis that the two deposits arc strictly of the same age.

only be regarded as rough approximations. It is more than probable that whenever
the Census is taken again, it will be found necessary to make, perhaps extensive,

modifications in the Tables.

          On three undescribed Bone- Caves near Tenby, Pembrokeshire.

                         By the Rev. Gilbert N. Smith.

The first of these caves was discovered about twenty years ago in blasting a cliff

overhanging the sea at Caldy Island, for the purpose of'dtransporting the mountain

limestone of which it is composed to the opposite coast of Devonshire. It had no

external opening at that time : the side walls were vertical, or nearly so, the strata

standing perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, as they frequently do hereabouts.

The cave was formed by a stratum of considerable thickness, having disappeared at
that place for some eight or ten yards, being probably of softer materials than that

both above and below, supposing the mass to be restored to its natural horizontal posi-

tion ; and this apparently by the action of the sea in earlier periods. Both the walls
and the roof have since been removed, so that now no cave exists there; but the_y?oor,

still containing fragments of bone, is covered with the debris of the quarrymen's

labours.

 --"While the cave yet remained I obtained from it the usual osseous relics of the cave

mammals, as bones of the EUphas primigenius, Rhinoceros, Sus Scrofa, Equus,

Cervus, Bos, Ursus, Hyana, Felts Tigris or Leo, Lupus, Cunis Vulpes, and some

smaller Carnivora. Besides these bones, there were the remains of marine fauna

abundance of dorsal spines of some species of ray probably : these varied in length
from Ij inch to 2 inches; and other portions offish skeletons.

   The larger bones showed the same marks of gnawing described in the ' Reliquiae
Diluvianse ' of Buckland. Some of them exhibit down the edges impressions of the
teeth of a Rodent, probably a rat. The nearer these bones lay to the surface of the

red water-washed loam in which they were imbedded, the lighter they were, and more

nearly approaching in every respect the condition of exposed bones of recent existing

animals                                       indeed  many  on  the  surface  were  sheep's  bones ;  but  some                       on   high  ledges  of
                                           ;

the cave were in the same ponderous stale as those below, which is usually called

fossil. At this time geology had not so far progressed as to suggest the possibility

of human remains, which therefore, if present, were not observed.

   The condition of the cave in general, and the situation of some of the bones in

particular, suggested nothing of the probability of this being a den of hyaenas, by whom

the bones had been conveyed into its recesses, but quite the contrary. Hyaenas' bones
lay about precisely in the same condition as ihe rest : the whole seemed to have been

forcibly driven into the cavern by the action of water; and some of the bones, par-
ticularly a large ulna, 10^ inches in diameter, were wedged firmly into fissures, just
as pieces of drift wreck are observed to be on rocky coasts.

It is assumed in the ' Reliquiae Diluvianse ' that the presence of hyaena's dung in

these caves decides this point ; but it should be remembered that the hyaena is a hone-

rather than a flesh-eating animal, and that consequently the coprolitic balls are exceed-

ingly  hard,                                  being   composed  almost  entirely    of phosphate  of lime                             and  that  they  stand
                                                                                                                                   ;

impression is that the whole were carried into the cave by water, and that the bones

 were gnawed before they were deposited there. Moreover, if these Troglodytae follow

 the habits of their congeners in this latitude at present, they will be found to seek
 external, and even distant places for the purpose indicated. Badgers, for instance,
 resort to the same place nightly ; and the ground glitters with the elytra of beetles,
 which at one time of the year constitute their principal food. It is an ill bird that

 fouls its own nest. The cleanly habits of dogs, too, are well known.

   A brief notice will suffice to mark the site of the second cave for future examination.

 It is on the same coast-line, and about the same sea-level, but further to the eastward.
 Like the former, its walls have been removed. The floor was covered with bones, which
 were shovelled into the sea when it was first broken into by the quarrymen.

    The particulars of the third cave will at this time be more interesting, perhaps,
 because with some of the same remains of Carnivora mentioned above, flint-implements,
 apparently of human workmanship, have been obtained.

     This cave is situated on the main land, and has a large open entrance half-way up

 the cliff, known to the inhabitants by the name of "the Hoyle." I am not aware
 that it was examined with a definite purpose till about twenty years ago, when Major,
 afterwards Colonel, Jervis and Major Pugett exhumed two so-called flint celts, and one
 of metal, which were sent to a museum in London. Lately a more careful examination
 has been made of the contents of the red loam which constitutes the floor of what may

 be called the first chamber of the long winding passage of which this cave consists.
 Teeth of the bear and hyaena were discovered in this deposit, together with a consider-
 able accumulation of sheep, pigs, and other existing animals. Here also are fish-bones,

 mixed with littoral shells like those of our present sea; among them may be named
 Patella, Cardium, Purpura lapillus, Mytilus, Liltorina liltorea, and Natica monili-

fera. Most of these shells are found also in the raised beaches which appear at different
 heights ail round the adjacent coasts.

    Of the filling of these caves we have possibly some examples in the deep holes
which occur in water. courses, over mountain limestone, in the neighbourhood, and
which receive the mud and water after every glut of rain, for very many years, without
becoming choked or full ; but something more in the nature of a flood would really
sometimes appear to be necessary to account for some of the phenomena.

    On the Selection of a Peculiar Geological Habitat by some of the rarer

        British Plants. By the Rev. W. S. Symonds, M.A., F.G.S.

   The Rev. Mr. Purchas, who is now engaged on the Botany of Herefordshire, has
divided the county of Hereford into twelve districts, and Mr. Symonds has been struck
by the apparent selection of a peculiar geological habitat by some of the rarer British

plants.

   The Snowdonian plants appear to affect the bands of volcanic ash that are inter-
stratified with rocks of Snowdon.

    Lychnis viscaria grows in four botanical districts out of five in Great Britain on
Greenstone; it grows on Stanner rocks, near Kington, with Scleranllius perennis.
Carex montana is only found on the carboniferous limestone. Lathyrus Aphaca, in
Worcestershire, affects the Keuper marls and sandstones.

   Mr. Symonds asks his brother naturalists especially to observe the flora of isolated
trap rocks, and do him the favour of forwarding to him the result of their observation.

            On the Geological System of the Central Sahara of Algeria.

               By the Rev. H. B. Tristram, M.A., F.L.S. fyc.

   The paper, of which a short summary is appended, was compiled from the notes
and observations made during a six months' travel in the Sahara. The writer has no
pretensions to being a geologist, nor was geology the object of his wanderings.

   But as so little is known respecting the characteristics of this portion of North

Africa, he has not hesitated to give the result of his observations, in the hope that

the attention of more able and scientific naturalists may be directed to so interesting

a field.

   On leaving the Atlas crest, and descending its southern slopes, we soon come upon

the secondary rocks, which are the prevailing formation of the whole country between
the Atlas and Laghouat. This district for about 400 miles due south is rocky,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                          103

and with mountain-ranges running for the most part in parallel lines north-east and
south-west. The southern slopes of the Atlas chain rise from a depression which in
several parts, especially to the south of Tunis, is many feet below the level of the
Mediterranean. From this depression the Sahara is for the most part a system of end-

less terraces, some of which are only a few miles apart, while others are expanded into

plains of from 50 to 100 miles in width, and which, so far as my observations and the

information I could gather from native caravans and a trustworthy guide extended, in
an unbroken series to within three days' journey of Timbuctoo, when the traveller will

probably find himself on the northern watershed of the valley of the Niger.

   As we advance, on every stage is written the record of the retiring ocean, which
gradually, by the elevation of its southern shores, was driven back and back to the
northward, till the last long inlet from the Gulf of Cabes to Tuggurt was drained and

-- Wedevaporated, leaving its traces in the salt plains, and occasional moisture of the

R'hir and Chott el Melah the ancient Lake Tritonis.

There are several singular exceptions to the course of the mountain-ranges above

mentioned, which are generally the local causes of the oases.
   Thus at Laghouat we find several elliptical basins of diminishing size piled one on

another. The lowest and largest rests on the flat surface of the secondary rock, which
is the base of the whole system. Several great fissures, which pervade all these super-
imposed basins, allow the water to percolate. It then rests on the impermeable rock,
draining through a very thin stratum of gravel or sand into any depressions, whence
it is raised by artesian wells, and creates an oasis.

   From the Sebaa Rous to Laghouat, all these ranges appear to belong to the lower

chalk formation. Limestone predominates, and forms the ridges of the Sahari, Senalba,
and Djellal mountains. It is of saccharoid structure, and of a variable colour, generally

greyish white. In many of the plains there is sandstone, sometimes hard, and at other

times so soft as to yield to the pressure of the fingers. This sandstone encloses nodules

of flint of various colours and semi-transparent. By disaggregation these become de-
tached from the softer medium in which they were imbedded. As the wind sweeps
the sand, they form shingly beaches of pebbles, many of them of a pretty chalcedony,

which is exported in some quantity to Paris.
   The upper deposit of limestone is marked by regular beds of gypsum of vast extent,

which are found in every district of the Sahara, but never in the secondary formation

of the Atlas region.

   South of Laghouat, the furthest French outpost, we came upon a shallow alluvial
deposit of the very latest tertiary and diluvian formation. Near the mountains this is
often composed of rolled pebbles in a limestone matrix. On the plains it is a white

calcareous rock, a sort of crust, very hard at the surface, but soft and friable below,

where it is mixed with green or grey clay, and encloses many crystals of gypsum.
   The diluvian formation may be traced more or less distinctly, I believe, between

all the ranges, even as far north as the Zahrez, near Djelfa.

   I was particular] v struck by the fact that several of my fossil shells from these super-

ficial deposits proved specifically identical with freshwater tertiary fossils from the

region of the Black Sea. May not further research perhaps reveal, that at no very

distant geologic epoch a vast chain of freshwater lakes, similar to those of North

America at the present day, extended from the plateaux of the western Sahara as far

as the neighbourhood of the Caspian 1

   The basin of the M'zab country further still to the south supplied me only with a

few fossils, apparently miocene.

In turning from the M'zab southwards to Waregla, and thence north-east towards

Tuggurt and the Gulf of Cabes, the geological system appears to be the same, but with

fewer distinct little basins, and with more extensive diluvial deposits.

As far as we could trace them, the basins are generally horizontal up to Biskra in

the north, and Gufza in the east, or very slightly inclined, consisting of alternating

beds of greensand (?), gypsum, and clay. These beds extend almost without inter-
ruption, or with very slight depressions, from latitude thirty-one degrees north to

thirty-five degrees north, and from longitude five degrees east to nine degrees east.

WedThe most interesting portion of this district is the  R'hir, a long line of depres-

sion sloping from the Touareg desert, latitude thirty degrees north, and longitude five

degrees east (circiter), with its surface occasionally moistened by salt lakes, but with-

out any springs of fresh water, yet affording at intervals throughout its whole extent
a never-failing supply of sweet water, through artesian wells penetrating the upper

limestone. An immense population is supported by this Wed It'iiir, which is for many

days' journey one continuous line of oases, such as El Marier, Tameina, Tuggurt,
Temacin, and after a further interval, in which its traces are lost, it reappears in the
oases of N'Goussa and Waregla, and gradually is lost in the highlands of the south.
But it is probable that even here the subterranean course of the water can be traced,
and that the Touareg owe their means of subsistence to their knowledge of wells on

this line.

   The Wed R'hir terminates in the Chott Melr'hir, a depression probahly eighty feet

below the Mediterranean sea-level and the lowest point of the whole Sahara. This
basin extends eastwards to the Chott el Melah (LakeTritonis), at a greater elevation,
but yet scarcely rising to the sea-level, from which it is separated by some thirty miles

of sand-hills and rocks.
   Proceeding northwards of the Melr'hir, we rapidly lose all traces of the diluvial

deposits, and come upon the chalk, chalk-marl, and greensand in regular succession,
dipping generally southwards. The three southernmost ridges of the Mons Aures,
viz. the Djebel Checha, the Dj. Khaddou, and Dj. Amar, present us with these three

stages of the cretaceous group in order.

   When we advance to the north of Biskra, the boundary between the Tell and the

eastern Sahara, the mountains are composed of masses of nummulite limestone, with
bands of gypsum and occasional interruptions of rock-salt, mixed with layers of marl.

--One of these mountains of rock-salt has been described long since by Dr. Shaw that

of El Outaia.

   There are many salt deposits, sometimes masses of isolated rock-salt, perfectly pure,
of many hundred yards in circumference, as at Hadjera el Mehl (or Kochers de Sel),
more frequently in the form of layers or incrustations on the plains near the Chotts,
or beds of evaporated lakes. Some of the isolated rock-salt hills have been suggested
to have been eruptions of argillaceous mud, gypsum, and rock-salt across the secondary

and tertiary deposits.
   In such a country as the Sahara, we cannot expect to find much mineral wealth,

beyond the salt, gypsum, and natron. There is a quarry of oxide of manganese in the
Djebel Trisgrarine, traces of lignite and carbonized trees at Ain el Ibel, and many hot

--springs some pure, others strongly impregnated with chlorine. The temperature of

one of these I found to be 125° Fahr., of others from 75° to 95° Fahr. In one of the

latter were swarms of a little fish, Cyprinodon dispar, also found in the warm springs

of Egypt.

On the Invertebrate Fauna of the Lower Oolites of Oxfordshire. By J. F.

 Whiteaves, F.G.S., Honorary Member of the Ashmolean Society, Oxford.

   Although the physical geology of the neighbourhood of Oxford is, with some ex-
ceptions, tolerably well understood, our knowledge of its palieontology, especially of
the invertebrate division of the animal kingdom, is very meagre and unsatisfactory.

The only exception I am aware of is a detailed list of the fossils of the Stonesfield

Slate, in a paper contributed by Prof. Phillips to the volume of " Oxford Essays" for
]855, entitled " The Neighbourhood of Oxford and its Geology."

   The following brief sketch of the Invertebrate obtained from the Great Oolite,
Forest Marble, and Cornbrash during several years' collecting, must be considered as

temporary only, nearly every day spent in practical investigation revealing fresh
species, only a very small area having been carefully explored, and even that small
area by no means so thoroughly as one could wish, Hence the few inductions that
I have, as it seems to me, legitimately deduced from facts, must be considered as

approximate results only in the present state of our knowledge. To Prof. Phillips's
list of the fossils of the Stonesfield Slate, I am enabled to add twenty-eight species of

Mollusca ; these are,

Ammonites Waterhousci, Mor. and Lye.        Nerita hemisphanica, Roemer.

   In deep cuttings on the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway, between

the Handborough and Charlbury stations (especially in two sections nearly opposite
the village of Slonesfield), the lower zone of the Great Oolite is well exhibited. Near
the Kirtlington station on the Great Western Railway several fine sections exposing
the upper zone of the same formation may be studied with advantage : for detailed
descriptions of these beds see Hull's Memoir on the Geology of the country round

Woodstock. Up to the present date (June, 1860), the following is a list of the Inver-

tebrata procured from these localities.

Until the publication of the Monograph on the Mollusca of the Great Oolite (by

Messrs. Morris and Lycett), but little was known respecting the fossils of this forma-

tion. This monograph, too, was not so much an account of English Great Oolite

fossils in general, as  of a particular assemblage, restricted for the most part to a

limited area around     Minchinhampton. The above lists of species appear to me

chiefly interesting as tending to remove the apparent isolation of the Minchinhampton

fauna. As in Gloucestershire, so in Oxfordshire, the Cephalopoda seem to be but

sparingly distributed in the Great Oolite ; and but few species of carnivorous Gaste-

ropods°have yet been detected in the same formation near Oxford.

As compared with the same zone of life at Minchinhampton. the upper beds of the

Oxfordshire Great Oolite would seem apparently to have been deposited in seas of
greater depth and of more tranquillity. Bivalves are commonly found with the valves
united and the ligament preserved, and large reef-like masses of coral are not unfre-
quent. In Oxfordshire a large proportion of the Great Oolite fossils range upwards

into the Forest Marble and Cornbrash, and no inconsiderable series occur even as high

as the Coralline Oolite. Five species have not previously been detected in this for-

mation, and eleven shells are quite new to science. From the Forest Marble at Islip

and Kidlington I have collected the following species :

   The similarity between the fossils of this group and those of the Great Oolite is
very remarkable ; many Minchinhampton fossils occur in it which, as yet, I have been
unable to detect in the Great Oolite of this district. Teeth of fishes, which are so
abundant in the Wiltshire Forest Marble, appear to be somewhat rare in the same
beds in Oxfordshire. The Cornbrash at Islip and Kidlington has yielded the following

assemblage.

  A careful study of the fossils of the Oxfordshire Cornbrash appears to me by no

means favourable to that theory of Professor Buckman, that the Cornbrash assemblage
of fossils, on the whole, more strongly resembles the fauna of the Inferior than that of

the Great Oolite.

   Very few of the fossils common to both the Cornbrash and Inferior Oolite are not

found in the intermediate formation ; and in the above list of Cornbrash fossils, a large
per-centage are well-known Great Oolite speuies. The great comparative rarity of
the Cephalopoda is also noticeable, both in the Cornbrash and Forest Marble; one
solitary, mutilated fragment of an ammonite in the Islip Cornbrash is the only
example of this class I have seen from these two formations during several years

active collecting.

On the Intermittent Springs of the Chalk and Oolite of the Neighbourhood of
             Scarborough. By Captain Woodall, M.A., F.G.S.

  On the Avicula contorta Beds and Lower Lias in the South of England.

             By Thomas Wright, M.D., F.R.S.E. and G.S.

   The black shales, with their interstratified sandstones and bone- beds which lie at
the base of the Lias, have by one class of observers been grouped with the Lias, by
others with the Trias ; the author had made a series of observations on these beds,
where they are exposed at Westbury, Wainlode, and Aust, on the banks of the Severn
and at Penarth and VVatchet, on the shores of the Bristol Channel : in all these sec-
tions he had found several species of Conchifera, which are special to the beds, as
Avicula contorta, Portl., Pecten Valoniensis, Defr., Mytilus minutus, Goldf., Cardium
Rhceticum, Mer., Lima precursor, Querist., Ncoschizodus posterus, Quenst., Cardium,
sp., Cypricardia, sp., Anomya, sp., with several other small bivalve shells which he

was unable to determine. He found the same beds at the base of the Lias in War-

wickshire and Worcestershire ; and they have recently been found in Staffordshire by
Mr. Howell, and several years ago were discovered by General Portlock in Ireland.
In Germany Quenstedt calls these beds Vorlaufer des Lias; they are the true repre-
sentatives of the Upper St. Cassian beds of German geologists, and the Kbssener-
schichten of the Tyrolese. Since they were first described by Von Buch thirty

years ago, they have formed the subject of many interesting observations by conti-

nental geologists, although up to this time it has not been settled whether they belong
to the Trias or to the Lias. The Conchifera found in these beds in England are special
to them, and none of the species pass into the true Lias ; whereas it has been asserted
by Sir Philip Egerton and Professor Agassiz that the species of fishes found in the
Bone-beds of England and Ireland are Triassic forms. Should this statement hold
good, the evidence for the triassic character of the Avicula contorta series will greatly
preponderate over their liassic affinities. M. Jules Martin, in an able memoir, ' Pale-
ontologie Stratigraphique de l'lnfra-Lias du D£partement de la Cote-d'Or,' has exa-
mined these beds in the departments of Cote d'Or, Rhone, Ardeche and Isere, and has
placed them all as Infra-lias. The absence of the Bono-bed from the French deposits,
although found in Luxembourg, is remarkable; and therefore the evidence afforded
by the fossil fishes is excluded from M. Martin's estimate of the Palfeontological affi-

 nities of these Infra-Liassic deposits.

    Dr. Wright divides the Lower Lias into six zones of life, each characterized by

--certain species of mollusca which are special to it; these are 1st, the zone of Am-

monites planorbis; 2nd, the zone of Ammonites Bucklandi; 3rd, the zone of Ammo-

 nites Turneri ; 4th, the zone of Ammonites obtusus; 5th, the zone of Ammonites oxy-
 notus; and 6th, the zone of Ammonites raricostaius. Each of these zones was sepa-
 rately described, its fauna enumerated, and the localities where it was developed
 pointed out. The Lower Lias in the South of England was compnred with the Lower
 Lias of Wurtemberg, and the correlations of that formation in both countries pointed

 out.

   On the Progress of Natural Science in the United States and Canada.

                   By Philip P. Carpenter, B.A., Ph.D.

The principal part of this communication was devoted to an explanation of the

principles and working of the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, D.C. It
was founded " for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men," and was
not restricted either by nation or "red tape." It gives aid to students in prose-
cuting any branch of' research ; carries on an extensive series of meteorological
observations over the North American Continent; directs the Natural History
observations of the various governmental Exploring Expeditions of the U.S. Govern-
ment ; superintends an intricate system of exchanges of books and specimens
between individuals or Societies in 'Europe or America, in conjunction with the
Royal Society, and with special exemption from customs ; and gives to the world

a large amount of original matter through the press. The entire Museum depart-

ment of the United States Government, till lately deposited at the Patent Office,
is now the propertv of the Smithsonian Institution, with authority to exchange
duplicates. The publications consist of three classes-- (1) the " Smithsonian Con-
tributions to Knowledge," expensive works sold at cost price; (2) the "Miscellane-
ous Collections " of pamphlets, which are freely distributed ; and (3) an annual

volume of Reports, &c. published at G overnment expense. In regulating exchanges,

whether of books or specimens, the directors do not require a quid pro quo, but
simply a friendly reciprocity ; their first desire being to make their materials useful

to science, wherever that can best be done*.

   The Federal Government, as well as most of the Sovereign States, have published
Reports on Geology and other branches of science, many of which are of the highest
value. The ten quarto volumes on the ' Pacific Railroad,' abounding in plates,
contain a complete resume of the Natural History of the great western deserts and
the Rocky Mountains, and may be purchased in Washington for about £5. The

State of 'Massachusetts is giving liberal aid to Professor Agassiz in forming a

magnificent museum at Cambridge University, which will be arranged geographi-

cally. There is already a vast amount of material accessible to students, and of

duplicates for exchanges. The State Museum at Albany is under the direction of
the Regents of the University of New York. They have a large number of dupli-
cate palaeozoic fossils, available for exchange. The Academy of Natural Science of
Philadelphia, the Lyceum of New York, and the Natural History Society of Boston,
are well known by their publications. The Colleges of Yale, Amherst, and

Charleston, S.C., have also dor.e good service to science. In Canada, the Geologi-

cal Survey under Sir W. Logan is not surpassed by any for admirable arrangement.

The Natural History Societies both of Montreal and of Toronto publish periodicals.
In M'Gill College, "Montreal, under Professor Dawson, and in the University of
Toronto, under Professor Hincks, the study of natural science is steadily increasing.
The importance of the magnetic observations at Toronto is well known ; and a
system of recording meteorological information, at the public grammar schools of
Canada West, is now being organized in connexion with the Smithsonian Institu-

 tion.

Remarks on the Final Causes of the Sexuality of Plants, with particular refer-

   ence to Mr. Darwin's Work ' On the Origin of Species by Natural Selec-
   tion.' By C. J. B. Daubeny, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S., Professor of Botany

    in the University of Oxford.

    Dr. Daubeny began by pointing out the identity between the two modes by which
the multiplication of plants is brought about, the very same properties being im-
parted to the bud or to the graft, as to the seed produced by the ordinary process
of fecundation ; and a new individual being in either instance equally produced.

   We are therefore led to speculate as to the final cause of the existence of sexual

 organs, in plants, as well as in those lower animals which can be propagated by

 cuttings.

   One use, no doubt, may be the dissemination of the species for many plants, if
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

propagated by buds alone, woidd be in a manner confined to a single spot. Another

Asecondary use is the production of fruits which afford nourishment to animals.

third may be to minister to the gratification of the senses of man by the beauty

of their forms and colours.

   But as these ends are only answered in a small proportion of cases, we must

seek further for the uses of the organs in question ; and hence the author suggested,
that they might have been provided, in order to prevent that uniformity in the
aspect of Nature which woidd have prevailed if plants had been multiplied exclu-
sively by buds.

   It is well known that a bud is a mere counterpart of the stock from whence it
springs, so that we are always sure of obtaining the very same description of fruit
by merely grafting the bud or cutting of a pear or apple tree upon another plant of

the same species.

   On the other hand, the seed never produces an individual exactly like the plant

from which it sprung, and hence by the union of the sexes in plants some variation
from the primitive type is sure to result.

   Dr. Daubeny remarked, that if we adopt in any degree the views of Mr. Darwin

with respect to the origin of species by natural selection, the creation of sexual
organs in plants might be regarded as intended to promote this specific object.
"Whilst, however, he gave his assent to the Darwinian hypothesis, as likely to aid us
in reducing the number of existing species, he wished not to be considered as advo-

cating it to the extent to which the author seems disposed to carry it. He rather

desired to recommend to Naturalists the necessity of further inquiries, in order
to fix the limits within which the doctrine proposed by Darwin may assist us in
distinguishing varieties from species.

  Dr. Davbeny invited the Members to visit an experimental garden under his

superintendence in the neighbourhood of Oxford, in which he had been carrying on
some investigations connected with Agricultural Chemistry, the nature of which
he proposed to explain on the spot.

               On the supposed Germination of Mummy Wheat.
                By the Rev. Professor Henslow, M.A., F.L.S.

   The author introduced his observations by reading a letter from Professor
Wartmann, of Geneva, who had recently found that seeds might be exposed to
a temperature of 198° below zero of Fahrenheit's scale, without losing the power
of germination. Professor Henslow had himself exposed seeds to the tempe-
rature of boiling water, and they germinated. The question of how long seeds
would retain their vitality was one of great interest ; and a Committee of this
Association had reported on the subject, but they had not succeeded in making

seeds grow which had been kept more than two centuries. He then showed that

experiments recorded on the growth of mummy wheat were not trustworthy

and especially noticed the case which had been relied on so much, of the growth of

mummy wheat by Mr. T upper from seeds supplied him by Sir Gardner Wilkinson.
He alluded to a sample ot mummy wheat which he had carefully inspected grain
                             -- ";

                             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  Ill

by grain, and found among it two grains of a different variety from the rest ; these
were perfectly fresh, whereas the others were dark-coloured, with decided indica-
tions of decomposition and partial charring. Upon inquiry he was able to ascer-
tain that this sample was a portion of a large stock, which had been taken from a
catacomb some years previously, and had been exposed for sale in the jars of a
corn merchant at Cairo. There could be no doubt an accidental admixture of a
few recent grains left in the jars had taken place. In samples supplied by Sir G.
Wilkinson to the late Robert Brown for the purpose of experiment, the latter

had found in it a few grains of Indian corn ! He thought it not at all improbable

that the samples he had examined, and those furnished by Sir G. Wilkinson, might
have formed portions of the same stock.

On the Distinctio?is of a Plant and an Animal, and on a Fourth Kingdom
         of Nature*. By John Hogg, M.A., F.R.S., F.L.S., Sfc.

The author stated the great difficulty he had long experienced when examining

some of the simpler living beings, in defining the characters of those primary

forms of life, whether they belong to the vegetable or animal kingdom ; and he

considered that there may strictly be no distinction in nature between those king-

doms                         and that life in the lowest animal, as well as in the simplest plant, may be
                          ;

the same ; still that it is necessary to draw a line of demarcation between them, for

the purpose of classifying the numerous creatures or organisms existing in the world.

Mr. J. Hogg then showed that he had, more than twenty years ago, demonstrated

that locomotion, although apparently spontaneous, was no distinction of animality.

Neither could the presence of iodine nor of starch be accounted a satisfactory test

of vegetability. So the four chemical elements, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and

oxygen, have been regarded for the same objects, though without positive success
and even the green colouring matter, called " chromule," or " chlorophyll " (once
supposed to belong exclusively to vegetables), has been shown to be likewise pre-
sent in certain of the lower animals. But the author observed that the " two prin-

cipal characteristics of an animal are undoubtedly the muscular and nervous systems,

which do not exist in a plant, and which Prof. Owen has not included in his de-
finitions of a plant and an animal given in his new work on ' Palaeontology.'
Mr. J. Hogg then referred to Lianeeus's arrangement of all natural bodies into

three kingdoms, and, after quoting his definitions of Lapides, Vegetabilia, and
Animalia, said that they must at this day be accounted as insufficient and too

concise; and, considering the great extension of science, both in Zoology and
Botany, which had taken place since the time of Linnaeus, he attempted to enlarge

the definitions of those three divisions of natural bodies thus : Minerals are bodies,

hard, aggregative, simple, or component, having bulk, weight, and often regular

form ; but inorganic, inanimate, indestructible by death, insentient, and illocomo-

tive. Vegetables are beings, organic, living, nourishable, stomachless, generative,

destructible by death, possessing some sensibility, sometimes motive, and some-
times locomotive in their young or seed state ; but inanimate, insentient, immus-
cular, nerveless, and mostly fixed by their roots. Animals are beings, organic,
living, nourishable, having a stomach, generative, destructible by death, motive,

animate, sentient, muscular, nervous, and mostly spontaneously locomotive, but
sometimes fixed by their bases.

   Further, as regards a fourth kingdom of Nature, the author having perused
Prof. Owen's ' Palaeontology,' published this year, found that he had introduced

the "Kingdom Protozoa," and placed it before the "Kingdom Animalia." He

proved that there were objections to the term "Protozoa," which was formed by a
toreign naturalist, and that it could not include those lower organisms, whose
nature partook more of plants (Phyta) than of animals (Zoo,) without creating

errors ; and since it appears to many desirable to place those organic beings which

are of a doubtful nature in a fourth or an additional kingdom, he suggested one

--under the title of the Primigenal Kingdom, Regnum Primigenum continens
--Protoctista, i. e. Protophyta et Protozoa. This would comprise all the lower

creatures, or the primary organic beings "Protoctista," from npcoros, frst, and

  * This entire paper, with the coloured Diagram, is published in the ' Edinburgh New

Philosophical Journal,' vol. xii. (new series) for October 1860, pp. 216-225,

--KTiara, created beings both Protophyta and Protozoa; and would also include

the Sponges or Amorphozoa of M. de Blainville, although Mr. J. Hogg thought

it better to substitute for the latter the name of Ainorphoctista, derived from

a/xop(f)os, formless, and ktkttii, creatures or organisms.

   Some having compared the Vegetable and Animal Kingdom's to two pyramids,

which diverge from each other as they ascend, but are placed on a common base,

the author conceived that that base might fairly represent the Primigenal King-

dom, which embraces the lower or primary organisms of both the former, but

which are of a doubtful nature, and can, in some instances, only be considered as

having become blended or mingled together.

An accompanying diagram was exhibited, which represented the two pyramids

springing from the same base : one, coloured yellow, denoted the Vegetable King-

dom                      the  other was                                                 tinged  blue,  and  signified  the Animal  Kingdom ;  whilst the
                      ;

base, common to both, was coloured green, which was intended to show by the

union of the two former colours the blending of the two natures of the lower

created beings comprised in the fourth, or Primigenal Kingdom. These pyramids,

with their base, stood on a foundation tinged brown, thereby signifying the eai*th

and the Mineral Kingdom.

On the Normal and Abnormal Variations from an assumed Type hi Plants.
                                   By M. T. Masters.

   The paper was illustrated by a large number of recent and dried forms of mon-
strous plants and parts of plants.

   In this paper there was an attempt to show that no definite limits could be
drawn between what are termed Variations and Monstrosities. Numerous instances
of extreme degrees of variation and of polymorphism in plants, apparently depend-
ent on external circumstances, were exhibited; among them two specimens of
Ficus stipularis, the one taken from a plant grown against a wall, the other from a plant
of the same species, and derived from the same original stock, but which had been
treated as a standard. The differences in habit, size, form and texture of the leaves
and other parts were such, that had the two specimens not been taken from the
9ame plant, it woidd have been difficult to believe that they could have belonged to
the same species. Allusion was made to the changes that naturally take place dining
the growth of some plants, and to the fact that a condition which is unnatural in
one plant is the common condition in another. So also irregularity of growth, as
it is the constant condition in some plants, and for many other reasons, cannot be
considered an abnormal variation. On the other hand, Peloria, or a return to typical
regularity, can hardly be considered abnormal. Again, certain changes which are
physiologically abnormal are not so morphologically. The paper concluded with a

                              On the Structure of Fern Stems. By G. Ogilvie, 3I.D.

The object of this communication was to determine the arrangement and rela-

tions of those tissues in Ferns commonly regarded as analogous to the vascular and
woody elements of the stems of the higher plants.

   In the case of the former the correspondence may be admitted without much

hesitation, from the close resemblance of the vascular bundles of ferns to those of

endogenous stems                                                                        the fasciculi in both being  imbedded  separately in the general
                                                                                     ;

parenchyma, and each surrounded by a layer of soft cambium tissue. The peculi-

arities of the Fern consist in the polygonal form and ladder-like or scalariform

markings of its elongated cells or vessels, and in the disposition of the fasciculi, so

as to form, by their anastomosis, the reticulated wall of a hollow cylinder, imbedded

--in the general parenchyma of the stem an arrangement which is rarely departed

from in our British ferns, though in Pteris aquilina we find in addition two broad

vascular bauds in the central part of the stem, and in Osmunda and HymenophyUum
we have the netted cylinder replaced by a central vascular cord, as in the Lycopo-
diaceaj. The correspondence of the hard tissues to the true stem-wood of the

higher plants is more open to objection, notwithstanding the occasional resemblance

in their minute structure, The so-called woody fibres of ferns are never, like those

of the Phanerogamia, associated with the vessels in the same fasciculus or layer
nor are thev ever surrounded by a stratum of cambium tissue ; but they are merely
indurated and transformed portions of the general parenchyma, and this even when,

as in some species, they form a sort of outer sheath to the fasciculi. Its great
variability is another point which assimilates this element rather to such sclero-
genous formations of the higher plants as nut-shells and other husky tissues, than

to the proper wood of their stems. In some it occurs only as a thin cortical coating
(Polypodium, Lastrea Filix-Mas, Asplenium Filix-Famina) ; in others it constitutes

the entire mass of the rhizome, except a thin sheath of soft tissue surrounding the
vascular bundles (Bleehnum, Osmunda, Hymenophyllum) ; while there are various
intermediate forms in which it occurs in the guise of isolated nodules or filaments
(Lastrea di/ufufu, L. oreqpteris) of sheaths to the vascular bundles (Asplenium), or of
one or more longitudinal tracts (AUosorus, Pteris). [These variations were illus-
trated by magnified sectional views of thirteen specie3, mostly British.]

   The true homologue of the stem-wood of the Phancrogamia is to be sought, it
has been suggested, in a fibrous stratum which occurs in the fasciculi of some tree
ferns, immediately within the cambium layer; far though these fibres have nothing
of a woody character, and are mostly represented in our indigenous species only by
an outer series of small and imperfectly developed scalariform vessels, it is the
outer layer corresponding to them which is woody in the fasciculi of the endogenous
stem, and in all the cases its development seems to show that it arises from a
peculiar transformation of the cells of the cambium tissue.

Remarks on the Respiration of the Nudibranchiate Mollusca. By Cuthbert

   Collingwood, M.B., F.L.S., SfC, Professor of Animal Physiology in

    Queen's College, Liverpool.

   The author described and exhibited drawings of a remarkable immature form
of Triopa claviger, which had led to the observations he was about to make,

moro especially on account of the entire absence of the branchial plumes. He

canvassed the Various definitions given by authors of the term Nudibranchiata,
and showed that, although it might with accuracy be applied to the family Pori-
dida?, the ^Eolididse could not with propriety be called Nudibranchs, inasmuch as
their papillae were neither anatomically nor morphologically to be regarded as
gills. These mollusks all respired by the whole surface of the body, more or less;
and the author suggested that in the Doridinse the appendages to the body were
supplementary to the branchial plumes; which, as a rule, were less developed in
them than iii the true Djrid.s, which were without such appendages. The fact,
however, that there was no specialized apparatus for respiration in the vEolidida?,

coupled with many analogies which that family bore to animals much lower in
the scale of organization, seemed to separate them much more widely from the

Nudibranchiata proper than was generally allowed.

was Antiopa hyalina, a very local species, only found at Hilbre Island, in the Dee,

On Recurrent Animal Form, and its Significance in Systematic Zoology. By

   Cuthbert Collingwood, ALB., F.L.S., §c, Professor of Animal Phy-

siology in Queen's College, Liverpool.

The object of this paper was to call attention to the frequent recurrence of similar

forms in widely-separated groups of the animal kingdom ; similarities, therefore,

which were unaccompanied by homologies of internal structure. These analogies

of form had greatly influenced the progress of classification, by attracting the atten-

tion of systematizers, while as yet structural homologies were imperfectly under-

stood                         and, as a consequence, many groups of animals had been temporarily located
                           ;

in a false position, such as bats and whales by the ancients, and the Polyzoa and

Eoraminifera in more modern times. These resemblances in form were illustrated

--generally by the classes of Vertebrata, and more especially by the various orders of

Mammalia, the Invertebrata affording, however, many remarkable examples.

Since no principle of gradation of form would sufficiently account for these ana-

logies, the author had endeavoured to discover some other explanation, and had

come to the conclusion, that the fact of deviations from typical/orm being accom-

panied by modifications of typical habits, afforded the desired clue. Examples of

this were given, and the principle educed, that agreement of habit and economy in

widely separated groups is accompanied by similarity of form. This position was

argued through simple cases to the more complex, and the conclusion arrived at

that, where habits were known, the explanation sufficed ; and it was only in the

case of animals of low organization and obscure or unknown habits, that any serious

difficulty arose in its application ; so that our appreciation of the rationale of their

similarity of form was in direct ratio to our knowledge of their habits and modes
of life. ba_conclusion, by a comparison of the Polyzoa with the Polyps, it was
TRANSACTION'S OF THE SECTION'S.  115

shown that the economy of both was nearly identical, although the)' possessed
scarcely anything in common except superficial characters ; and this identity of
habit was regarded as the explanation of their remarkable similarity of form.

   This paper is published (as read before the Section) in the ' Annals of Natural
History,' for August 1860; and still more at length in the volume of ' Proceedings
of the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society ' for the past Session.

   Dr. Daubeny gave an aecount of some experiments he had performed on tha
subject of Equivocal Generation. He described the apparatus he had employed,

and stated that, even after vegetable matter had been exposed to a temperature
exceeding 300° of Fahr., and had been subsequently brought into contact with
nothing but water carefully distilled, and with air that had been passed through

sulphuric acid, indications of organic life were discoverable in it.
   Dr. Daubeny stated that Dr. Bowerbank and other gentlemen had examined the

flasks in which he had performed his experiments on Equivocal Generation. No
animal life was to be found, but a few filaments of fungi were visible. As the

latter might possibly have been derived from the cork and linseed-meal, as was
suggested by Dr. Bowerbank, he proposed to repeat the experiment under circum-
stances which would eliminate these sources of error.

On the Intellectual Development of Europe, considered with reference to the
   views of Mr. Darwin and others, that the Progression of Organisms is de-

  termined by Law. By Professor Draper, M. D., Neiv York.

   The object of this paper was to show that the advancement of Man in civilization

does not occur accidentally or in a fortuitous manner, but is determined by im-

mutable law.

   The author introduced bis subject by recalling proofs of the dominion of law in

--the three great lines of the manifestation of life : first, in the successive stages of

development of every individual from the earliest rudiment to maturity ; second,

in the numberless organic forms now living contemporaneously with us, and con-

stituting the animal series ; third, in the orderly appearance of that grand succes-
sion, which in the slow lapse of geological time has emerged, constituting the life
of the earth, showing therefore not only the evidences, but also proofs of the domi-
nion of law over the world of life.

   In these three lines of life he maintained that the general principle is to differ-
entiate instinct from automatism, and then to differentiate intelligence from instinct.

In man himself three distinct instrumental nervous mechanisms exist, and three

distinct modes of life are perceptible, the automatic, the instinctive, the intelligent.
They occur in an epochal order, from infancy through childhood to the more per-

fect state.

   Such holding good for the individual, it was then affirmed that it is physiologi-
cally impossible to separate the individual from the race, and that what holds good

for the one holds good for the other too, and hence that man is the Archetype of

Society, and individual development the model of social progress, and that both are
under the control of immutable law ; that a parallel exists between individual and
natural life in this, that the production, life, and death of an organic particle in the
person, answers to the production, life, and death of a person in the nation.

   Turning from these purely physiological considerations to historical proof, and
selecting the only European nation which thus far has offered a complete and com-
pleted intellectual life, Professor Draper showed that the characteristics of Greek
mental development answer perfectly to those of individual life, presenting philo-
sophically five well-marked ages or periods, the first being closed by the opening
of Egypt to the Ionians ; the second, including the Ionian, Pythagorean, and Eleatic
philosophers, was ended by the criticisms of the Sophists ; the third, embracing the
Socratic and Platonic, by the doubts of the Sceptics ; the fourth, ushered in by the
Macedonian expedition and adorned by the splendid achievements of the Alex-
andrian School, degenerated into Neoplatonism ; and imbecility in the fifth, to which

the hand of Rome put an end. From the solutions of the four great problems of

Greek philosophy, given in each of these five stages of its life, he showed that it ia
                                                                                                        8*

possible to determine the law of the variation of Greek opinion, and to establish its

analogy with that of the variations of opinion in individual life.

Next, passing to the consideration of Europe in the aggregate, Professor Draper

showed that it has already in part repeated these phases in its intellectual life.

Its first period closes with the spread of the power of .Republican Rome, the second

with the foundation of Constantinople, the third with the Turkish invasion of

Europe ; we are living in the fourth. Detailed proofs of the correspondence of these

periods to those of Greek life, and through them to those of individual life, are

given in a work now printing on this subject by the author in America.

Having established this conclusion, Professor Draper next briefly alluded to'mauy

collateral problems or inquiries. He showed that the advances of men are due to

external and not to interior influences, and that in this respect a nation is like a

seed, which can only develope when the conditions are favourable, and then onty

in a definite way ; that the time for psychical change corresponds with that for

physical, and that a nation cannot advance except its material condition be touched,

this having been the case throughout all Europe, as is manifested by the diminution

of the blue-eyed races thereof; that all organisms, and even man, are dependent for

their characteristics, continuance, and life, on the physical conditions under which

they  live                      that the  existing apparent invariability presented by  the world  of
                             ;

organization is the direct consequence of the physical equilibrium ; but that, if that

should suffer modification, in an instant the fanciful doctrine of the immutability

of species would be brought to its proper value. The organic world appears to be

Ain repose because natural influences have reached an equilibrium.                      marble may

remain motionless for ever on a level table, but let the table be a little inclined,

and the marble will quickly run off, and so it is with organisms in the world. From

his work on Physiology, published in 1856, he gave his views in support of the

doctrine of the transmutation of species, the trausitional forms of the animal and

also the human type, the production of new ethnical elements or nations, and the

laws of their origin, duration and death.

On some Specimens of Shells from the Liverpool Museum, originally from

Bythe Pathological Collection formed by the late Mr. Gaskoin.                           the Rev.

H. H. Higgins, M.A., Rainhill, Liverpool.

The late Mr. Gaskoin had in his museum a series of specimens, collected for the

purpose of illustrating the pathology of the Mollusca. Ibis series was in course of

formation in the year 1835, from which period, to the time of his decease, Mr.

Gaskoin devoted considerable attention to the selection, from various sources, of

specimens of shells in any wise remarkable for distorted growth, or for the repair

of injuries received during the life of the animal. I am not aware that Mr. Gaskoin

published or left in manuscript any account of the result of his observations in this

department of Natural History. 1 1 is evident that in any ca3e of abnormal growth a

second, and still more a third or a fourth, instance of the same kind may afford a

fair ground for a conclusion, which, if based upon a single instance only, would be

of little or no value. The extensive character of the series was in this respect very

valuable. In the course of more than twenty years' collecting, Mr. Gaskoin had

enriched bis pathological cabinet, not only with a great variety of mended fractures

aud distorted growths, but with many duplicates, sometimes of cases apparently

Aaltogether exceptional, and likely to be unique.  select series of specimens was

then exhibited to the Section, and remarks were made upon them, which can

scarcely be presented intelligibly apart from the specimens themselves.

    Notice, of British Well Shrimps. By the Rev. A. R. Hogan, M.A.

   The author exhibited specimens of some remarkable additions not long since
made to our British Crustacea. They consisted of two species of Niphargus (Fon-
tanus and Kuehianus), aud the new genus Crangonyx, with it3 single species sttb~
terraneus of Spence Bate. These species have been described and figured in the
volume of the ' Natural History Review and Quarterly Journal of Science ' for last
year (1859). They are of great interest, as examples of a subterranean Fauna in
England, analogous to that long known on the Continent and in America. The

first established instance of the occurrence of Nipharffi in England, was Mr. West-

wood's discovery at Maidenhead,                                  Berkshire,  of a  well  containing    numbers  of     r
                                                                                                                    JS .

amtilex. They have more recently been obtained from Corsbam and Warminster,

Wiltshire, and also from Ringwood, on the borders of the New Forest, Hampshire,

Crangonyx subterrancus has occurred at the two latter places, but not at the first

named. Niphargus fontanus is found at both Corsham and Ring-wood, but with a

difference iu the shape of the gnathopoda and posterior pleopoda, amounting: to a pro-

bably distinct variety, if not species. The form of the gnathopoda, or hands, is

worthy of attention, being each armed with a moveable claw of large size, forming

a prehensile organ of great power. N. fontanus is also possessed of small, yellow

eyes, which distinguish it in a very marked way from the allied species (of the

genus Gammarus) found on the Continent. Every member of the subterranean

Fauna hitherto found has been destitute of eyesight. The movements of Niphargi,

when kept in captivity, are interesting to observe ; but Mr. llogan states that he

has found great difficulty in preserving tliem alive. The longest period during which

even the strongest specimens survived its capture was three weeks. The average

temperature of the water in which Niphargus and Crangonyx are found is about

50° Fahr., and they seem to propagate in recently-formed wells as freely as in old

ones. In no case have any species of this family been found, either in this country or

--abroad, in open wells or other than artificial ones, pumps, in fact. They are found
at all seasons of the year, but most abundantly towards the end of the autumn. The

largest size known among the English species (that of X. fontanus) hardly exceeds

half an inch. Mr. llogan hoped that more extended observations would be made

in Great Britain on this interesting family of Crustacea, as their economy and struc-

ture are as yet very imperfectly known, and an accurate examination would be sure

to reward the investigator with results at least as interesting as those already

obtained regarding their allies by Continental naturalists.

Mr. J. G. Jeffreys exhibited several specimens of the common whelk (Buccinum

undatum) having double opercula ; in one instance, a second or supplementary

operculum being piled on the usual one ; and in the others, there being two separate

opercula, instead of one. in each whelk. He adverted briefly to the different kinds

of monstrosity which occur in animals and plants, and said he believed this to be

the first case of a similar monstrosity in the Mollusca. He observed that the

monstrosity under consideration appeared to be congenital, and not to have arisen

from an accidental loss of the original organ, because in some of the specimens both

opercula were cases of hypertrophy, and in the others of atrophy and he mentioned
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

that all the specimens came from the same place ( Sandgate in Kent ), showing a
repetition, and perhaps an hereditary transmission, of the same abnormal pheno-

menon                                     and he suggested that  thus permanent  varieties  might  in  course  of time
                                       ;

be formed, and constitute what some naturalists would call " distinct species." He

adduced in support of this view, the case of a reversed monstrosity of the common

garden snail (Jfclix aspersd), having been bred for many years in succession by the

late M. d'Orbignv in his garden at Rochelle, as well as many instances of a
reversed form of almond whelk {Fusus antiquus) having occurred in the same

localities on the coasts of England and Portugal, such being the normal form in

the cra"g6;".

                      On the British Teredines, or Ship- Worms.
                             By J. G. Jkffkeys, F.R.S.

   After observing that his researches had not been confined to the British Tere-
dines, but that lie had recently had an opportunity of meeting all the French

naturalists who had published on the subject, as well as of studying all the access-

ible collections and books, lie treated the matter first in a zoological point of
view, and gave a short history of the genus Teredo, from the time of Aristotle and
his pupil Theophrastus to the present time especially noticing the elaborate mono-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

Everard Home and his pupil Sir Benjamin Brodie, iu 1806 ; and the physiological

essays of Quatrefages, in 1840.
118 REPORT 1860.

  He showed that the Teredo undergoes a series of metamorphoses ; the eggs being

developed into a sub-larval fomi after their exclusion from the ovary, and remaining

in the mantle of the parent for some time. In its second phase (or that of proper

larvae) the fry are furnished with a pair of close-fitting oval valves, resembling those

of a Cythere, as well as with cilia, a large foot, and distinct eyes, by means of which

it swims freely and with great rapidity, or creeps, and afterwards selects its fixed

habitation. The larval state continues for upwards of 100 hours, and during that

period the fry are capable of traversing long distances, and thus becoming spread

over comparatively wide areas. The metamorphosis is not, however (as Quatrefages

asserts), complete ; because the young shell, when fully developed, retains the larval

valves. He then discussed the different theories, as to the method by which the

Teredo perforates wood, giving a preference to that of Sellius and Quatrefages, which

may be termed the theory of " suction," aided by a constant maceration of the wood

by water, which is introduced into the tube by the siphons. This process, according

to Quatrefages, is effected by an organ which he calls the " eapuchon eephalique," and

which is provided with two pairs of muscles of extraordinary strength.' Mr. Jeffreys

was of opinion that the foot of the Teredo was the sole instrument of perforation.

He instanced, in illustration of this theory, the cases of the common limpet, as

well as of many bivalve mollusks, Echinus lividus, and numerous annelids, which

excavate rocks to a greater or less depth ; and he cited the adage of " Gutta cavat

lapidem non vi sed ssepe cadendo," in opposition to the mechanical theory. The

Teredo bores either in the direction of the grain or across it, according to the kind of

wood and the nature of the species ; the Teredo Norrec/iea usually taking the former
course : every kind of wood is indiscriminately attacked by it. The Teredines con-

stitute a peaceful, though not a social community ; and they have never been known

to work into the tunnel of any neighbour. If they approach too near to each other,

and cannot find space enough in any direction to continue their operations, they en-

close the valves or anterior part of the body in a case, consisting of one or more hemi-

spherical layers of shelly matter. Sellius supposed that the Teredo ate up the wood

which it excavated, and had no other food ; and, labouring under the idea that it

could no longer subsist after being thus voluntarily shut up, he considered it to be

the pink of chivalry and honour, in preferring to commit suicide rather than infringe

on its neighbour. In this enclosed state the valves often become so much altered

in form, as well as in the relative proportion of their different parts, as not to be

easily recognizable as belonging to the same species                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    and one species ( T. divariccda)

was constituted from specimens of T. Norvegiea which had been so deformed. The

food of the Teredo consists of minute animalcula, which are brought within the

vortex of the inhalant siphon, and drawn into tire stomach. The wood which has

been excavated also undergoes a kind of digestion during its passage outwards

through the long intestine. The animal has been proved by Laurent and other

observers to be capable of renewing its shelly tube, and of repairing it in any part.

It is stated by Quatrefages (and apparently with truth ) that the sexes are separate,

impregnation being effected in a similar mode to that which takes place among

palm-trees and other dioecious plants. There appear to be only five or six males

in one hundred individuals. The Teredo perforates and inhabits sound wood onlv,

but an allied genus (Xyhphaga) has been recently found to attack the submarine

telegraph cable between this country and Gibraltar at a depth of from sixty to

seventy fathoms, and to have made its way through a thick wrapper of cordage into

the gutta percha which covered the wire. The penetration was fortunately dis-

covered in time, and was not deep enough to reach the wire. He gave several

instances to show the rapidity of its perforating powers,--one of them having been

supplied by Sir Leopold M'Clintock while he was serving with the author's brother

in the North Pacific.

   Mr. Jeffreys traced the geographical distribution of the Teredines, and showed

that at least two species, which are now found living on our own shores, occurred in

the post-pleistocene period ; and he inferred from the circumstance of one of these

species having been found in fossil drift wood, that conditions similar to the present

existed during that epoch. Some species inhabit fixed wood, and may be termed

ittoral," while others are only found in floating wood, and appear to be "pelagic."

Each geographical district has its own " littoral " species, and the old notion of

he ship-worm (which Linnaeus justly called " Calamitas Navium ") having been

introduced into Europe from the Indies was contrary to fact as well as theory, be-
cause no " littoral " species belonging to tropical seas has ever been found living

in the northern hemisphere, or vice versa. It is true that some species have been

occasionally imported into this and other countries in ships' bottoms, and that
others occur in wood which has been wafted thither by the Gulf and other oceanic

currents ; but the former cases belong to littoral species, and never survive their

removal, while the latter may be said to be almost cosmopolite. Every species of
Teredo has its own peculiar tube, valves, and pair of " pallets," the latter serving the
office of opercula, and by their means the animal is able at will to close completely
the entrance or mouth of the tube, and thus prevent the intrusion of crustacean
and annelidan foes. The length of the tube is, of course, equal to that of the
animal, which is attached to it by strong muscles in the palletal ring, and varies
in the different species from three inches, or even less, to as many feet. The in-
ternal entrance or throat of the tube is also distinguishable in each species by its

peculiar transverse laniinje, and it has frequently a longitudinal siphonal ridge.

Monstrosities occasionally occur in the valves and pallets ; and in one instance the
pallet-stalk is double, showing a partial redundancy of organs, as exemplified by

the author with respect to the operculum of the common whelk. More than one
species often inhabit the same piece of wood ; and want of sufficient care by natu-
ralists in extracting the valves with their proper tubes and pallets may account in a

great measure for the confusion which exists in public and private collections, and

which has thence found its way into systematic works. The Teredines have many

natural enemies. In the South of Italy, and on the North African coast, they are

esteemed as human food. In Great Britain and Ireland, four species occur in fixed

wood, and eleven others in drift wood, the latter being occasional visitants. Of
these, no less than six have never yet been described, and two others are now, for the
first time, noticed as British. The number of recorded exotic species only amounts
to six more, making a total of twenty-one ; but it is probable that, when the subject
has been more investigated, a considerable addition will be made to this number.

    Mr. Jeffreys then explained the distribution of the littoral species on the shores of
Great Britain and Ireland, and produced a synoptical list with descriptions of the

new species. He believed all the Teredines were marine, except, possibly, Adanson's

Senegal species, and one which had lately been found in the River Ganges, the
water of which is fresh for about eighteen hours out of the twenty-four, and brackish
during the rest of the day ; but as a well-known exception of the same kind occurs
in a genus of marine shells (Area), and the transition from fresh to brackish, and
thence to salt water, is very gradual, such exceptions should not be regarded with

suspicion or surprise. He concluded this part of the subject by exhibiting some

drawings and specimens, and acknowledging his obligations to Dr. Lukis and other

scientific friends.

   He afterwards treated the subject in an economical point of view, and remarked

that, although the French Government had issued two commissions at different
times, and the Dutch Government had lately published the report of another com-
mission, which was appointed to inquire into the mode of preventing the ravages
of the Teredo in the ships and harbours of those countries, our own Government

had done nothing. He alluded to the numerous and various remedies which had

been proposed, during the last two or three centuries from time to time, some of
which were very absurd ; but he was of opinion, from a study of the creature's
habits, that the most effectual preventive would be a siliceous or mineral composi-
tion, like that which has been proposed by Prof. Ansted for coating the decomposing

stones of our new Houses of Parliament, or simply a thick coat of tar or paint,
continually applied, which would not only destroy any adult ship-worms then
living in the wood, but prevent the ingress of the fry. The Teredo never com-

 mences perforation except in the larval state *.

  A Committee of the Association was formed, at the suggestion of Mr. Jeffreys,

 to inquire and report as to the best mode of preventing the ravages of Teredo and

 other animals in our ships and harbours.

   Dr. Lankester called attention to the completion of the first part of Mr. Black-

--wall's work on British Spiders, a copy of which he placed on the table. The

work contains twelve coloured plates, and is one of the most complete monographs

hitherto published of the class of animals to which it is devoted. It forms the Kay-

    On the Statistics of the Herring Fishery. By Charles W. Peach.

                                                                                            On Cydippe. By John Price, Chester.

I will only remind my fellow-naturalists that the Cydippe (which has been, like

everything else, retarded by this cold season) was pretty abundant in the Mersey

on the 16th of June, and may therefore be looked for confidently on the coast

henceforward.

   In order to enjoy the sight of this most enchanting Oceanid, I advise them
   1. To provide tall glass jars, or, fa ute de mieux, the largest size of " sample bot-
tles/' quite transparent, and with large mouths. The last can be taken to the shore

in a frame like a cruet stand to hold several bottles, corked during carriage.

   2. To catch the animals in some cup or ladle large enough to take up a gill of

water with them, to prevent damage. Best of all, in a J spherical ladle, with

tubular handle.

   In either case, plunge it in a full inch in advance of the swimming Cydippe, to
save the trains, which easily break.

   3. To keep them, when transferred to their permanent lodging-jar, glass or
u Aquarium," as cold as possible ; and never (except when examining them) in a

jm light.

4.  To  watch  minutely                                                                          for the ova   grey  specks  smaller  than  "Noctilucai ")  floating

                                                                                         ;

microscopic objects before and after hatching.

5. To microscope, with a low power, Cydippes containing food: easily known, as

they are transparent. And if you get the right kind of prawn, they will capture

and swallow them, but not shrimps.

   6. If Beroes are to be had, and Cydippes are " as plenty as blackberries," re-

member that the latter are the natural food of the former, who will bolt as many

as five, one after the other.

  7. By uniting the two last hints, my curious friends may see, by virtue of the

transparency of both animals, two digestions going on (for a short' time) at once.
The Cydippe digests the prawn, whilst the Beroe digests 'the Cydippe. Qu. /diges-

tion ?, ingestion ?, indigestion ?.

   8. To remember that a number of these creatures were kept in the " good old

     _

times" for 13 weeks, without plants, and only changing the water occasionally

that these perished after all by mere accident, and that it is the pleasing duty of the
rising generation to keep them all tin- year round under the improved regime.

                    On tfie Aspergillum or Watering-pot Mollush.

                      By Lovell Reeve, F.L.S., F.G.S.

   The Aspergillum is a siphoned bivalve niollusk which ceases in an early stage of
its existence to live free, and while yet no more than the eighth of an inch' in length,

sinks into the sand, or adheres to shell or stone, and directs its calcifying functions
to the formation of a comparatively large tubular sheath. Upwards the sheath
enlarges with the growth of the siphons for their special protection ; downwards
the animal closes in the sheath by a disc like the rose of a watering-pot, fissured and

  erforated and bordered by a frill of small tubes.' The mantle of the animal, which
i: as been observed once, and only once, on the shores of the Red Sea, enlarges on
commencing its sheath growth, and a number of tentacles are emitted, each corre-
sponding with a perforation or tube of the disc. Freqm n< distortion is imparted to
the shell, more especially lo the disc end of it, the seat of the niollusk, according to
the circumstances of its place of habitation ; and when adhering to shell or stone
the disc may be scarcely recognizable. Shells with the strength of growth even of
Spondylus, become distorted by their inability to contend against the outward press-
                                                                                       ;

lire of foreign bodies. Shells, therefore, of the delicate .and comparatively fragile

growth of Aspergillum would be liable to extreme contortion. Aspergillum vagini-

ferum, inhabiting the shores of the Red Sea, sinks into the sand, as may be seen

by the particles of sand and shell debris tbat become agglutinated to the sheath, to

the depth of eight to twelve inches and more ; the sheath is comparatively straight
Aand symmetrical, and the protruding end becomes furbelowed.
                                                                season of rest

ensues, another effort is made to extend the sheath, but the calcifying functions
Aeither have done their part, or are enfeebled.
                                                 little is added to the sheath, and

the end is again furbelowed ; and in some specimens the process has been as many

as eight times repeated.

   In adherent species, only one of which, A. Strangei, inhabiting the shores of

N.E. Australia, has been discovered, the disc is very much pressed in. Two speci-

mens only have been collected, one affixed to the inner cleft of a mussel hinge, and

one attached to stone. The peculiarity of this form of Aspergillum is that the

sheath is formed in a square, and being formed, not in sand, but free, is tortuous and

enveloped by a slight periostracum.

Dr. Gray has stated his opinion in a recent memoir in the ' Proceedings of the

Zoological Society,' that the sheath of A. Strangei is an enlargement of the primi-

tive pair of valves, and that it differs in this respect from the rest of the Aspergilla.
I incline to dissent from this opinion. Whether by a stretch of induction it be

regarded as an enlargement of the primitive valves, or not, the relation between

them I hold to be the same in the sand-inhabiting species, as in the adherent species.

Dr. Gray also draws a distinction between species which have a wavy depression in

the sheath around the circumference of the valves, regarding the wavy depression

Myas a part of the valves, of which only the umbones are seen.  own view is that

at the time of the metamorphosis of the mollusk, the valves are not larger in any

Whenspecies than are defined by the smaller outline.  it is considered that the

valves are discarded at this time, but not entirely, inasmuch as they are appropriated

as material for a nucleus from which to develope a sheath, it is only reasonable to

suppose that the new sheath matter would, in some species, obtain a wavy deposit

corresponding with the outline of the nucleus.

 Hemarks on the Geographical Distribution of recent Terrestrial Vertebrata.

                  By P. L. Sclatek, M.A., Ph.D., Scc.Z.S.

    After enunciating the principles of the distribution of organic beings according to
certain laws, independent of the influences of climate and other external conditions,
and that of the " continuity " of generic areas, which might, as a general rule, be
extended to all natural groups, small and large, the author proceeded to point out

what appeared to be the most natural primary divisions of the earth's surface, as

--deducible from a careful study of the distribution of the terrestrial vertebrates.

These were :
   1. The Palaarctic Region, embracing Europe, Asia north of the Himalayas, and a

strip of Africa north of the Atlas.

   2. The ^Ethiopian Region, embracing Africa inclusive of Madagascar, and Arabia.
   3. The Indian Region, including Southern continental Asia, Sumatra, Borneo,
Java, and other islands down to the Straits of Macassar.

  4. The Australian Region, including New Guinea and adjoining islands, Australia,
New Zealand, and Pacific Islands.

   5. The Nearctic Region, including America down to the Southern limits of the

Mexican Table-land.

  6. The Neotrojncal Region, including the rest of the New World and the West

India Islands.
   These Regions were well characterized by their striking zoological peculiarities,

as shown by the preponderance of certain types and the absence of others in each
and by the fact that many of the families, more of the genera, and nearly all the
species found in each were as a general rule distinct, of which numerous examples
were given. These greater divisions of the earth's surface or regions were subdi-
visible into lesser areas or provinces, characterized by being the abode of distinct
species, which in many cases represented one another in their different localities.

  An inquiry into the meaning of these laws of geographical distribution was then
--122 REPORT 1860.

entered upon, and the question asked, whether it was possible in the present state
of our knowledge of the subject to arrive at any explanation of them. It was
remarked that the only hypothesis yet put forward which would explain these laws,

was that of " genetic relationship '' between species or their descent from a common
ancestral form. It was an acknowledged fact that the best naturalists were at

issue as to the precise limits between representative species and local varieties.

It was generally allowed that the latter were descendants of a common progenitor,
and the reasons given for the belief in the case of ''local varieties " might be shown

to be equally applicable to " representative species." Specific differences being once

granted to have originated from natural causes, it would be impossible to stop here,

and it must follow that greater divergences may have resulted from the operation

of similar agents acting through longer periods of time.

On some Peculiar Forms amongst the Micro-Lejndopterous Larva.

                    By H. T. Stainton, F.L.S.

   It is well known that the normal form of a Lepidopterous larva is a cylinder, flat-
tened beneath, and slightly tapering and rounded at each end. To this, the typical
form of a Lepidopterous larva, we have abundant exceptions in most groups; thus
we have the woodlouse-shaped larva? amongst the butterflies, and again amongst
the Bombycina and in the latter group we have also numerous instances of larvae

                                                                                     ;

adorned with humps or large protuberances on several of the segments, and in some
of the Noctuae larvae we observe a protuberance on the eleventh segment.

   The normal number of legs is sixteen, that is, six true legs and ten prolegs ; but
two of the latter are wanting in some of the Bombycina and in some of the Noctuina,
and in the whole group of the Geometrina from four to six of the prolegs are

wanting.

   In the group of the Torticina there are very few deviations from the typical form

of the larva ; but amongst the Tineina we find many genera which give instances

of very considerable deviation from the regular cylindric form.

  Among the most curious forms in this family, the larvae of the genus Phyllocnist in
may be mentioned ; in these the hinder extremity is so drawn out that it reminds

us of the rat-tailed larvae amongst the Diptera, though the object of the prolonged
tail in the Phyllocnistis larvae is very different. These larvae are also perfectly
apodal, and the structure of the mouth is peculiar: the jaws of all other Lepido-
pterous larvae terminate in two sharp-pointed mandibles ; the mandibles of a Phyl-
locnistis are perfectly blunt and rounded, like the points of lace-scissors. The

reason of this singular formation is pretty evident ; the larvae of the genera Coleo-

phora and Lithocolletis, which mine in the interior of leaves, feed on the parenchyma,

which they detach piece by piece hy their sharp mandibles and swallow ; but the

larvae of Phyllocnistis, though feeding beneath the cuticle of the leaf, do not eat the

parenchyma, and a leaf eaten by one of these larvae, if held up to the light, shows

no trace of the attacks of the larva. On what then do they subsist ? The larvae

mine rather rapidly forwards beneath the cuticle, raising the cuticle from the epi-

dermis, and they apparently devour something which they find between the two,

which, as they do not seem to remove any solid matter of the leaf, must be of a

juicy nature. It is no doubt essential to the comfort of these larva? that the cuticle

should not remain detached from the parenchyma in those parts of the leaf which

the larva has passed over, and accordingly we find that the cuticle again becomes

attached to the parenchyma immediately behind the larva, and that the cuticle

may be let down gradually and gently is, I believe, the cause of the prolonged

attenuated tail. The object of the blunt mandibles, in like manner, appears to be

to avoid any risk of the larva piercing the cuticle, which by letting in the external

air would probably be fatal to the existence of the larva, as these larvae have to

move their jaws in constant juxtaposition to the cuticle, which, in the aspen tree

(which is frequented by the commonest species of the genus, P. sitffusella), is re-

markably thin ; it must be a great convenience to the larva that the structure of its

jaws is such that it can eat its fill without any danger of piercing the cuticle.

Sharp-pointed jaws are necessary to a larva which feeds on the harder parts of

leaves                           but to  this,  which  only,  as  it were,  sucks  up  the juice,  sharp-pointed  jawa
                              ;

are quite unnecessary.

If a leaf eateu by this larva be held to the light no symptoms of its operations

will be apparent ; but if, instead of holding the leaf between us and the light, we
look down on it slautways, we shall perceive some slightly iridescent tracks, which

have very much the appearance as though a snail had been crawling across the leaf.

Another peculiarity of                                                                  this larva is     that it  never moults                                                                its skin is  apparently
                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

of so elastic a nature, that it grows with the larva; most larvae cast their snins four

or five times in the course of their lives, but this larva never once undergoes that

operation. Besides this, it never sleeps; most larvae, after enj oying a hearty meal,

may be found inactive and inert, in a position which conveys to us precisely the

idea of sleep, but a Phyllocnistk larva never sleeps, it is iilways eating ; from its
exclusion from the egg to its being full-fed, night or day, its jaws are perpetually

at work. This is not true only of the larva of Phijllocnistis, it occurs throughout

the extensive genus of Nepticula. I have had abundant opportunities of observing

these larvae at all hours of the day and night, and, unless they are ill or dying,

they are invariably eating. Their jaws have certainly solved the problem of per-

petual motion.

Ehrenberg expressed surprise that the Infusoria never sleep ; and Owen, after

long watching the motions of the Polygastrica, concluded they were generally of

the nature of respiratory acts, and not attempts to obtain food or avoid danger. He

adds, " Very seldom can they be construed as voluntary, but seem rather to be

automatic governed by the influence of stimuli, within or without the body, not
                                                        ;

felt but reflected upon the contractile fibre ; and therefore are motions which

never tire."

   But the motions of these small larvae are certainly not automatic you frequently
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

see the larva turning its head about from side to side of its mine, as though con-

sidering where it should eat a bit next, and immediately it has determined that
point it sets to work with a tcill, little indicative of involuntary action.

    On the Effect of Temperature and Periodicity on the Development of

             certain Lepidoptera. By Dr. Verloren, of Utrecht.

  A Table was exhibited showing the period at which the pupae of the Sphinx

Lic/ustri were hatched. From these tables it appeared that the great proportion of
the insects was produced in the middle of June, indepeudent of the state of the

temperature of the season ; and it appeared that in cases where the development of
the insects had been retarded beyond the fixed period in one year, they appeared
only during the limited period in the succeeding year. The observations had been
extended through a number of years, and had enabled Dr. Verloren to establish

several other interesting physiological facts connected with the species in question.

   Mr. Westwood gave an accoimt of an insect which, on account of its anomalous

character, had been referred to three different orders of the class Insecta, and which

forms the genus Aeentropus of Curtis, the type being the Phryganea nivca of Oliver,
regarded as Trichopterous by Curtis, and as Neuropterous by Stephens : Mr. West-

wood had many years ago endeavoured to prove it to be Lepidopterous from a con-

sideration of the structure of the perfect insect alone. The transformations of the
species having, however, been recently observed by Mr. Brown of Burton-upon-Trent,
the opinion of Mr. Westwood had been fully borne out, as was shown by a series of
highly magnified diagrams representing the details of the insect and its metamor-

phoses, contrasted with those of the orders Trichoptera, Lepidoptera, and N euro-

ptera. The genus appears to be most nearly allied to the family Crambiae.

On a Lepidopterous Parasite occurring on the Body of the Fulgora candelaria.

                      By J. O. Westwood, M.A., F.L.S.

    After some general remarks on parasitism, the author gave a detailed account of
the occurrence of the larvae of a species of moth on the body of the firefly (Fulgora
candelaria'), for which the name of Epipyrops anomala had been proposed by Mr.

Bowring, by whom the transformations of the insect had been observed in China.

Not only was the fact of the parasitism of the species as a Lepidopterous insect
extremely unusual, but also the circumstance that it was not upon the ligaments of
the body that the larva of this moth fed, but evidently upon the white waxy secre-
tion so common amongst the Fulgoridce, with which their abdomens are enveloped,
was quite anomalous, although wax-feeding habits were known to occur in the
larvse of the species of wax-moths. The insect in question appeared to belong to
the great family Bonibycida?, and specimens were preserved in the British Museum

and Hopeian Collection at Oxford.

Notes on Tomopteris onisciformis. By Dr. E. Perceval Wright, A.M.

          Dub. O.ron., F.L.S., Lecturer on Zoology, Dublin University.

In the summer of 1858, while investigating with Professor J. Beay Greene of

Cork, the marine zoology of the south-west coast of Ireland, I had an opportimity

of examining somewhat in detail the structure of that puzzling little annulose

animal, called Tomopteris oitisciformis. The tidal current sets in very strongly from

the Atlantic into the narrow entrance between Bere Island and the main land, and

carries along with it, in the summer season, whole fleets of oceanic swimming

creatures. The number of naked-eyed Medusa; and free Actinozoana is almost pass

belief to those who have not witnessed similar phenomena. Various little bays

with hollow caverns line the sides of this channel, and in these the water lies very

still and quiet ; here, too, vast numbers of the oce an swimmers congregate, imparting

to the water almost a milky hue, which sometimes changes and presents an appear-

ance as if oil had been cast upon it, owing to the highly prismatic colouring of the
Avarious Beroes, ^Equoreas, Cydippes, See.
                                                  retired nook of this sort is a very

paradise to the marine explorer, and such were to us places of very frequent resort.

After a little practice, one's eye got accustomed to the varied kinds of locomotion

that distinguished more or less each species, so that when I first perceived T.

onisciformis swimming swiftly with its very peculiar wriggling movements, small as

it was, I perceived it to be something new ; and a few seconds served to transfer it
to a glass collecting-jar. While the whole body was more or less employed, by
successive wrigglings, in locomotion, j et it was quite obvious that true locomotion

was assisted by the bipinnated scries of paddle-shaped organs which are attached

at each side of the body. When compared with the graceful floating and umbrella

movements of an iEquorea, or the headlong paddle-wheel-like movements of a

Beroe or a Cydippe, it could not be truthfully described as graceful ; nevertheless,

--there was something about it very characteristic something that even seemed to

point out its proper natural affinities. One of the little creatures lived in apparently

food health with me for about twelve hours, though incarcerated in a small glass

ar holding but ten ounces of water : and it would have probably Hied longer, but

i''. wanted its tail for examination, and the necessary compression of such an agile
and slippery creature between two pieces of thin glass hastened its end. The

author then alluded to the papers by Br. Carpenter, Messrs. Leuckart and Pagen-

stecher and others on this creature, and gave an outline of its anatomy, alluding to

the presence of cilia on the pharyngeal portion, to the peculiar structure of the

central portion of the antenna-like organs, to the tail-like extremity, and the

presence therein of masses of Spermatozoa; and finally expressed his conviction

that there could be no doubt as to its being a complete creature, and that its tail

is not a zooid form, as hinted by Dr. Carpenter.

          On the Ultimate Arrangement of Nerves in Muscular Tissue.

                      By Professor Beale, M.B., F.R.S.

          On the Leptocephalidae. By Professor V. Carus, Leipzig.

   Dr. Kaup places the European species of this highly interesting family in four

generic groups, Esunculus, Hyoprorus, Tihirus, and Leptocephalus. It strikes at
first, to find amongst the " Apodal" fishes a form with well-developed ventral fins,
viz. Esunculus, similar to the rest only in its transparency, and in wanting the
generative organs, differing from them also in the distinctness of the dorsal and anal.

Among the rest there are two well-established genera, Tilurus with its hair-like

tail, and Leptocephalus. According to Dr. Kaup, Tilurus contains two species, tri-
ck iitrus and Hissoi, but both are probably the same, as Rissoi is most likely founded
on a mutilated specimen. The chief character is taken from the tail here being
shorter ; Dr. Kaup adds, however, himself, " perhaps defective in the tail." The
species of the genus Leptocephalus are to be classed in two groups ; the type of the
first is L. Morrisii, that of the other is Helmichthys diaphanus of Ralinesque. The
former have the body compressed, the latter rounder, earth-wormlike body. L. Mor-
risii and L. Spallanzanii differ only by the height of the former, upon which

argument one cannot lav much stress, as exact measurements of many individuals

give very considerable differences in the relative height and length of the whole
bodv, as well as of the head and the other parts. The species of the second group,
L. punctatus, diaphanus, Kbttiheri, Gegenbauri, Bibroni, and Yarrelli, are representa-
tives of at most two species, punctatus and diaphanus. The chief distinction is
taken from the relative position of the intestinal outlet. I did not find in two
specimens out of some dozens the same position of this orifice ; nor are the row of
black points, which characterize the L. punctatus, always so well developed, that
they could be taken as a good character. However, the habits differ in some respect
from that of the rest. L. longirostris reminds of Hyoprorus ; the latter is probably
nothing but a further developed or an earlier form of the L. longirostris, L. stenops,

and L. brerirostris : the two last European species of Dr. Kaup's Synopsis I know
only by his figures, but I am very much inclined to believe that they are to be

judged like the others.
    Taking together the anatomical structure of the whole group, the absence of ge-

 nerative organs, the structure of their skin, their skull, their vertebral column, taking
 furthermore into consideration the variability of both the zoological characters and
 the proportional measurements, I cannot but come to the conclusion that all these

 fishes are nothing but larval forms of others. The developed full-grown species to
 winch all of them, except the Esunculus Costal, belong, are most likely among the

 Ophidians, or other compressed forms {Cepola, and so on). Although lam not yet

 able to state with certainty what species or even genera are to be studied in their
 development as giving Leptocephalideous larva?, yet I feel quite sure that the
 family under consideration will ere long be era?ed from the Sysiema Naturae, just
 as the Ammoccetes has been excluded from the benefit of being reckoned a full-
 grown member of the Animal family.

       On the Value of'" Development" in Systematic Zoology and Animal

                Morphology. By Professor V. Carus, Leipzig.

    Although there may be some who will object to ray bringing forward a topic of
 general bearing, and who would prefer to have stated some special facts and details
 new to science, yet I think that meetings of this kind afford the best opportunity
 of clearing up, or at least recalling to mind, questions which we are all familiar with,
 the true bearing of which, however, we are very apt to lose sight of. Since Cuvier
 laid the foundation-stone of our modern classification of animals, there has been
 within the last thirty-three years much labour bestowed upon the mending his
 system, and looking for new characters by which his classes and orders may be
  either altered and arranged in a somewhat different manner, or still better founded.
  However, we look up to him not only as the reformer of the classificatory branch of
 --126 REPORT 1860.

   zoology, but moreover as the founder of the natural system and of the science of
   comparative anatomy.

     As I intend to inquire into the value of one of the most striking characters of

  animals with regard to their classification, as well as to their typical organization, 1

  may be allowed to state, first, what is meant by a Systema Animalium, or in other
  words, what place the classification of animals takes among the branches of zoolo-

   gical inquiry.

    We are scarcely aware that we use the word system of animals in quite a differ-

  ent sense from that in which Linnaeus used it, and which was intended even by Cuvier
  when he arranged the animal kingdom anew according to its organization. Even
  Cuvier compares the system to a great catalogue of animals, in which every single
  one can easily be found and named. There is, however, one great feature stamped
  upon all forms of organized beings, which, although implied and even indicated in

 --the system of Cuvier, yet has given to the system of animals quite another aspect,
     I mean the relationship between different animals. Cuvier, and some later natu-
 ralists, and I may say some of the best, considered the system only as a servant to
  true science. Classification, according to them, is nothing more than, as Stuart Mill

  says, a contrivance for the best possible ordering of tbe ideas of objects in our minds,
  and at most " for causing the ideas to accompany or succeed one another in such a

 way as shall give us the greatest command over our knowledge already acquired."
 Although a classification worked out in the most perfect manner in this way must
 also be one of the aims of our endeavours, yet I may say that our present classifi-
 catory inquiries go further. They start from the very fact that the oldest fonns,

 and for this reason the forms nearest to the original creation, do not represent anv of

 those groups of individuals which we are used to call species nor can all of theni be
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

 classed under the now established genera, families, and orders, but only under the type
 to which all succeeding species belong. And although we cannot give the direct "ex-
 perimental proof, yet we are boundbylogicandbytruths forced upon us from all other

 branches of natural history, to say that these oldest original forms are tbe primaeval

 forms of all living animals, which originated from them by continued generation
 and by accommodation to external circumstances continually and progressively
 changing*. Hereby the general bearing of the system of animals is totally changed.

We consider it not only as an arrangement of the animals in such a manner as

 may help us best in gaining a general view of the animal world, and in placing
 and finding certain forms of it ; but we try to make it the faithful expression of

 the state of our knowledge respecting the relation of all animals to each other.

    Passing from the much spoken of differences between artificial and natural
 systems, I may only state, that even that arrangement, which is mainly founded on
the internal structure of animals, is nothing more than a somewhat modified form

 of artificial system, taking only one set of properties as basis of the classification.

 However, it is the best form hitherto proposed, because it takes into consideration
more characters than any other arrangement, and leads us naturally forward in the
 study of animal life. There is as yet one great chasm which severs the classifi-

cation of minerals from that of animals. In the mineral world we are justified in

 speaking of species, as the identity of physical and chemical properties grants us the

identity of all bodies endowed with these. In the animal world we have nothing
but individuals, and all sorts of groups are entirely and totally artificial. The law
of equal production of like from like through generations and generations, upon
which the notion of the species mainly is based, cannot be trusted to, as we have no

experience whatever that it holds good for the same animals under different circum-

 stances.

    Passing in review the leading characters upon which the different subkingdoms
of the animal world are founded, we perceive at once that they change almost in

every class. For although the general headings may be taken from the same system

of organs, yet the splitting of the classes and orders into minor divisions is de-

pendent on characters especially modified by these very classes and orders. And

even here our classification is not quite consistent. Amongst the lower classes of
animals, the comparatively simpler organization allows us to take the general form
of the bodies as a character to be relied upon, yet no person would be able to call a

ctenophorous medusa a radiated animal. Similar instances may be taken from the

higher divisions of the animal kingdom ; as they are known to all who are familiar
with our zoological system, I shoidd go too far if I were to specify what a little

attention paid to different orders of animals will tell in a moment. The simple

result of carefully looking through the established classes and orders of animals, is

that there is only a relative weight to be laid upon the different groups of zoolo-

gical characters. It depends entirely upon the whole typical organization, and on

the correlation of parts as modified by that type. This correlation of parts, which

allows us to draw a conclusion from the nature of one organ as to the nature of

another, must naturally be changed by the physiological dignity of an organ, which

in different types is not always the same ; and it will become uncertain whenever

the characters which we call specific are becoming indistinct themselves.

   I thought it necessary to state first in few words, that there is a difference in the

value of zoological characters according to different classes, and I am of opinion

that the progress of zoology as science depends mainly on the determination of

this value in a sharper manner than it has been stated. I published some years

ago some general remarks on this subject in a small pamphlet which will scarcely

have reached England.  mySince then  opinion has become still stronger, as I saw

that the progress, which zoology owes of late years especially to some eminent

British naturalists, was chiefly dependent on the circumstance that the point men-

tioned was, with or without purpose, taken into consideration.

The structure of animal bodies shows three different relations of complexity ; com-

mon to all three are these two points ; first, that a structure, at first simple, becomes

more and more diversified ; secondly, that all the differences which appear one after

the other make their appearance on a basis fundamentally equal and in itself not

changing. They differ according to the difference of this substratum. In one case

there is one and the same body changing and becoming more and more complex

in the second case different members of one great fundamental type of organization

constitute a series of forms, some less, some more diversified ; in the third case the

very types themselves are to be regarded as members of one great series, showing

less* and greater complexity. The practice of scientific inquiry has severed these

three different points of view into three different branches of science. The first is

the history of development, which may just as well be called the comparative

anatomy of the individual; the second is the comparative anatomy of the different

types ; the third is the general morphology of the animal kingdom. These are the

three different bearings which animals generally present to the zoologist with regard

to their structure. Now we must ask, what use can we make of them, and of the

first-mentioned especially P As the zoologist has nothing before him but individuals,

it is no wonder that the comparative anatomy of these will throw much light on

their nature, their life, and their morphology. As long as it is kept in mind that

all the facts of the history of development have relation to the individual, and to

nothing else, so long nobody will object to the manner of inquiring, which is quite

properly called the genetic method.

All our zoological classification, however, tends toward the establishment of

larger groups and types, and here comparative anatomy has its place. It is very

significant, that in the Cuvierian system, which we all follow, its later alterations

being quite irrelevant to the grand truths upon which it is founded, there is no

use whatever made of the history of development, not even in one instance. It

has been said that the emendations of this system, and the whole progress of

systematic zoology, depend, if not chiefly, yet for a great part, on the employment

of the genetic method. On this I may be allowed to make the following remarks.

As comparative anatomy rests entirely on the knowledge of the structure of indivi-

duals, everything which throws light on the individual will also throw light oh

comparative anatomy. But with regard to systematic zoology, we have not to

deal with larval forms and immature individuals, but only with such as are able

Weto propagate their individual, or if you like it better, specific form.  cannot,

of course, put aside all embryological data in our systematic endeavours. How-
Aever, there is great danger in overrating the help they give us.

on anatomy alone is an artificial one, however true it may be ; but its value is

animals from embryonic data, however, is still more artificial ; it takes only one
small group of properties of the animals, and just a group which, by its being con-

fined exclusively to individuals, forbids by itself the taking account of other pro-

perties. There are so many striking examples of different development in animals

related as nearly as possible, that by these alone the exclusive use of embryology

as a basis for classification is defended. And if the fact of frogs developing with-
out the intermediate stages of tadpoles be true (and I have no reason to doubt it), we

have in one and the same species differences of development which would in other

classes suffice to establish orders. By this very instance it is shown that embry-
ology also has only a relative value as zoological character. Our next inquiry ought

to be directed here, as well a 5 in all other eases, towards the establishment of the
characteral standard of embryology. Nature herself assists ns in the rightly
weighing of this character of animal bodies, as almost in all cases it serves only to
confirm and strengthen relations which have been found by other methods.

   While there is scarcely any difficulty in giving to embryology amongst the other
sets of properties its right place with regard to the classification of animals, there
is, I should not like to say difficulty, but some seemingly perplexing complexity of
phenomena and relations, when we are to make out the true bearing of embryology

on animal morphology. Here I have to answer two questions : How must we look

upon animal forms P and secondly, Are we allowed to explain analogous pheno-
mena by methods not correlate to each other ? Animal morphology, as the science

Aof animal forms, has to explain these, that is to say, to bring them back to laws.

law manifested on different forms cannot be that of cause and effect, but only one of
a constant repetition of the same phenomena under seemingly different conditions.
The object of animal morphology therefore will be to show the constancy with which
certain organs appear in certain groups of animals, and to showthat the relative posi-

tion of these organs is always one and the same in the larger and lesser groups. With

regard to the first part of these inquiries, there can be no doubt as to the utter failure
of embryology. Nothing but a simple anatomical investigation can tell us whether a
certain organ or system of organs is present in a certain division of the animal
kingdom or absent ; and respecting the second part of our morphological researches,

I am equally inclined to doubt whether embryology gives us an insight into the

anatomical specialities of a somewhat more complex animal by anything else, but
by bringing before us certain forms which are not quite as complex as the animal

which we dissect. And here we need not take embryological data ; we have before

us in every type of animals a whole series of more and more diversified forms, which

by themselves offer that same series of simpler forms which we find in the indi-
vidual, and even more clearly manifested, because an embryo is always endowed
with certain individual or specific peculiarities, which we cannot at present account
for at all. With respect to my second question, the embryologists say that two

organs which are developed in two different ways cannot be considered homologous.
Now, here I have to give a somewhat similar answer to that which I gave with
respect to the embryological classification. The homology of parts is determined

by the constant relative position of the organs in one and the same type. An artery

which rims up along the mesial line of the cervical vertebrae, is homologically dif-
ferent from an artery which runs along the jugular vein and the pneumogastric
nerve. The morphological relations of a certain class cannot be determined but by
comparing full-grown individuals, as all the organs do not work to the purpose of

these individuals before the development is finished. And in this respect I must

deny any influence of embryological researches on morphological questions. There
 is, however, another set of questions frequently brought before the inorphologist,
namely, whether two homologous organs are developed in the same way. It is
 easily seen that their homology must have beeu determined beforehand. It is of

course of the greatest interest to know the differences of the development of the
same organ in different representatives of the same type. But they show nothing
 more than the wonderful facility with which Nature arrives at the same results by
different ways. They give us additional proofs of that immense richness of means

with which "the Creator of all animal bodies works out his plans.

 On the Formation of Sugar andAmyloid Substances in the Animal Economy.

                     MBy Dr. Robert cDonnell.

    After briefly noticing the history of the discovery by Bernard and Hensen of the

 matter named by the former " glycogene," the writer observed that the term now

 very generally adopted to indicate this substance, viz. " amyloid matter," seemed in
 the present state of our knowledge preferable, as it did not 'involve any theory con-
 cerning the ultimate destination of the material in question. It was proposed to
 embrace under the generic term amyloid substance, two varieties of the starch-like

 material known to exist in the animal economy, viz. that of the first species, or the
 amyloid substance of Bernard, a ternary compound isomeric with dried grape-

sugar, convertible by contact with animal ferments into sugar capable of fermenting
on the addition of yeast--and that of the second species, or the amyloid substance of
 Virchow, a material, which, although in histological characters analogous to cellulose
and starch, yet as met with in the prostate gland, spleen, choroid plexus, &c, has
not yet been shown to be capable of conversion into sugar undergoing fermentation,
and which cannot be considered free from the intimate admixture of azotized

matters.

  MDr. cDonnell discussed at considerable length the question as to whether the

liver is endowed with the function of converting its amyloid substance into sugar
during life and health, or whether some at least of this substance has not another
destination, viz. that of becoming nitrogenized, and thus being, so to speak, raised
from the class of ternary to that of quaternary compounds.

   Admitting that this is one of the most delicate questions in physiology, and being
most unwilling to appear to dogmatize on the subject, the writer detailed a consider-
able number of experiments on blood drawn from the right side of the heart of
animals variously fed, which seem, on the whole, to support the view that trans-
formation into sugar is not the normal destination of the amyloid substance formed

in the liver.

paralytic cases the eras cerebri on the side of the cerebral lesion and the corresponding
anterior column below the pons, but only to the decussation, are both found much

In such cases the corresponding olivary body retains its plumpness, and these

--130 REPORT 1860.

          On the Structure of the Lcpadidas. Bij R. Garner, F.L.S.

   In this paper the author bore testimony to the high regard for truth with which
Mr. Darwiu has recorded his labours, in respect to these animals, though further
observation has modified some of his conclusions, and indeed is still wanted.

   From finding fragments of shells, small pebbles, &c. in the cesopbagus of the
Lepas anatifera, the. author supposes that this part acts as a gizzard, comminuting
the food. With Poli he believes in the existence of a heart, situated on the back,

a little posterior to the base of the second pair of cirri : however, these observers

stand alone with respect to this point. The heart can only be seen in some speci-
mens, according to the state of the tissues, which vary much. It receives its
supply at the sides, and gives off vessels before and behind : other large and lon-

gitudinal vessels exist.

   With respect to the canal running along the abdominal side of the peduncle,
and communicating with the body of the animal, on each side, behind the adductor
muscle, the author thinks that by meaus of it the cavity of the prosoma is distended

with fluid, thus acting as an antagonist to the adductor, parting a little the shelly
valves. The communicating opening lies between the nerves and oviducts as they
course between the peduncle and the body.

   Mr. Darwin thought that these oviducts conveyed the ova from his ovaries, or
the salivary glands of Cuvier, into the peduncle, where ova are found sure enough.
But in some specimens, where they are distended with ova, the oviducts are easily
traced from the peduncle down into the body of the animal, making a sweep, and

apparently ending at the cavities and apertures called acoustic by Mr. Darwin, who
informs us that Krohn has also made out this point. The little membranous,

buskin-shaped follicle, found in this acoustic cavity, is sometimes wanting.
   Cuvier did not often use the microscope, or he would have soon discovered that

his so-called ovaries are, in reality, testes.

   Little need be said, after Mr. Darwin, respecting the nervous system. The sub-
oral ganglion, besides being connected by a ring with the supra-oral ganglia, supplies
the salivary glands, the adductor muscle, the viscera, and the mantle by means of a
large anterior branch : also it gives others to the mouth and first cirri, and is con-
nected of course with the chain of ganglia between the other cirri. From the
supra-oral pair of ganglia, which are in close apposition, two large nerves (anten-
nary of Mr. D. ) go to the peduncle, and two minute twigs to the eye, described
exactly in the " Lepadidse. With respect to this eye Mr. Darwin observes, " in all
the genera the double eye is seated deep within the body ; it is attached by fibrous

tissue to the radiating muscles of the lowest part of the cesopbagus, and lies actually
on the upper part of the stomach ; consequently a ray of light, to reach the eye, has
to pass through the exterior membrane and underlying corium connecting the two
scuta, and to penetrate deeply into the body." This is not quite all ; the little
organ is made perfect in its adaptation, by a small oval or lozenge-shaped trans-
parent spot in these coverings to admit the light, and exactly behind this spot the

eyelet may always be easily seen or found. In specimens of Gonchoderma Hunteri,
parasitic on the carapax of a crab from Amoy, this visual organ is situated between
the mouth and the adductor.

   The so-called proboscis appears to act as an ovipositor, and probably in the pre-
hension of the food. The ova are finally attached to the " ovigerous fraena " as
broad sheets, with the assistance of a cement, which sometimes glues them unna-
turally together. The fatty matter with which the mantle abounds appears to go
to their nutrition, and is apparently taken in at the roots of the frsena. In this
mantle, in some species, the young animals are imbedded, and within its cavity

impregnation takes place.

    The author's specimens of Lepas came on shore last January at Ivimmeridge,
attached in vast quantities to a beam of pine. Some were a foot and a half in
length ; mostly simple, but others springing one from another. They are tenacious
of life, and appear to be generally cast on shore upon our coasts in rough winter
weather. The author has had large living JBalani picked up in the Mersey, and
 has Lepadidse attached to nuts of China, the small shells of a Sepia, and minute
ones on the shells of Ianthina and Spirilla from the Gulf-weed.

                                   On Saccharine Fermentation within the Female Breast.

                                          By George D. Gibb, M.D., M.A., F.G.S.

After referring to Voxel's discovery of vibriones in human milk, and the suspicion

he entertained that their origin was due to fermentation of the milk, but which was

denied by subsequent observers, the author proceeded to state that his own researches

into this question commenced in the latter part of 1854 At that time an infant seven
weeks old was brought to him in the most extreme state of emaciation, whose

mother had the appearance of good health. The child, although but skin and bone,
was healthy and plump at birth, and was in no way diseased ; it had plenty of its

mother's milk, but never was satisfied, and seemed ravenous. The most profuse

diaphoresis and diuresis had worn it to a shadow. The mother's milk was found

to be rich in cream, neutral, sp. gr. 1032, and contained a large quantity of sugar.
Examined under the microscope upon the instant of withdrawal from the breast, it

revealed numbers of living animalcules, those known as the Vibrio baculus, but
which he proposed to change to Vibrio lactis as more appropriate. These he con-

sidered the result of fermentation of the saccharine element within the gland.

There was an absence of mammary congestion and heat, which are usually present

in such cases, but much general nervous excitement, which it was necessary to

control by proper treatment. The child was supplied with an abundance of- good

cow's milk, and gradually weaned, after the lapse of some weeks, and ultimately

completely recovered. The mother's condition also improved ; the milk continued

to be rich in cream and sugar for some time, varying in sp. gr. from 1032 to 1035,
and always
                                   neutral                               the  animalcules  remained for   some     weeks, and finally disap-
                                                                      ;

peared; and when drawn from the breast, the milk invariably turned sour much

sooner than other examples of cows or healthy human milk.

   From 1854 to the present time the author has examined many hundred specimens
of human milk, chemically and microscopically, and has occasional!v found twospecies

of animalcules to be present in the glands of those whose general health was dis-

ordered from various causes during lactation, or where the process of lactation was

unusually prolonged, or again, where the quantity of milk secreted was small and

insufficient to satisfy the wants of the infant. At early lactation also, where the
milk was good and plentiful, but with constitutional symptoms present as already

referred to, both species were found, but not in the same individual.

These creatures consisted, first, of the Vibrio lactis, resembling little rod or
minute hair-shaped bodies, similar to those found in some of the other fluids of the
body
                     ;  and        secondly,                             of monads,  which ho  has found  to   be  far more  frequent and  com-

mon than vibnones, and which he proposed to call lianas lactis.

Both species were noticed at all periods of lactation, from a few days to upwards
of twelve months; the colour and specific gravity of the milk varied, but it was inva-

riably alkaline or neutral. The children were mostly skin and bone, resembling

little old men, and soon died of inanition unless other" food than the mother's milk
was supplied to them. It was not these little bodies that disagreed, but the healthy

properties of the milk for assimilation were destroyed, by constitutional causes in
the mother, which imparted as it were a galvanic shock through the agency of the

uterine nervous system, at the moment of its secretion, giving rise to fermentation

in the sugar alone, a substance the author believed the only one likely to produce
it within the breast. This process did not necessarily give rise to the formation of
                                   had
lactic  acid                            it done                          so,  it  would have   destroyed  the  animalcules ;  moreover,    in  no
                                ;

single instance was the milk ever found acid. He referred to some experiments of
Uerthelot to show that fermentation of sugar coidd take place in alkaline fluids;
and the rapidity with which milk containing these animalcules is decomposed and
turns sour out of the breast, now generating a large quantity of lactic acid, the
author considered a strong proof of fermentation having previously commenced
within the breast.                                                                                                            '

   He believed it very probable that the animalcules were generated from the sur-

face of the mucous membrane of the lactiferous tubes, bv the fermentation of the
sugar at the moment of its secretion from the blood, and this in some cases explained

the large numbers present. The necessary connexion subsisting between the mam-

mary glands and uterine organs, explained the influence of the latter in producing
the heat and internal congestion of the former by reflex nervous agency, giving rise
to the conditions described, in which the vitality of the milk was much impaired.

A Word on Embryology, ivith reference to the mutual relations of the Sub-

   kingdoms of Animals. By J. Re ay Greene, B.A., Professor of Natural

    History in the Queens College, Cork.

   In a communication bearing the above title, the author endeavoured to explain
that any real improvements in the arrangement of the animal kingdom which have
been made since the time of Cuvier accorded well with the corresponding advances
of comparative embryology. Thus only, indeed, were they shown to be true ; for
the method of gradations, whatever might be its value in suggesting affinities,
could not, of itself, be deemed sufficient to prove them ; while its exclusive employ-

ment had already, in too many cases, engendered errors, the further multiplication

of which coidd alone be kept in check by a continual appeal to the test of develop-

ment. From this point of view, the mutual relations of the five sub-kingdoms of

animals appear as in the accompanying analytical Table :

   The generalizations here expressed may, to a certain extent, be regarded as co-

--rollaries from the well-known proposition of J. F. Meckel : d. h. das hohere Thier in

seiner Entwickelung dem AVesentlichen nach die miter ihm stehenden, bleibenden
Stupen durchlauft, wodurch also die periodischen und Classenverscheidenheiten

auf einander zuriiekgefukrt werdenf. For a Vertebrate ovum, before segmentation,

differs but little, essentially, from an astomatous Protozoon. At a later stage,
when the division of the blastoderm into serous and mucous lavers has just taken

place, it admits of easy comparison with the permanent forms of Calenterata, the

simpler organisms of this group being little more than double-walled sacs of peculiar

form, with one extremity open for the purpose of alimentation.

   * This proposition is stated and commented on by Professor Huxley in his recent menaoir
" On the Agamic Reproduction and Morphology of Aphis." See especially § 5 of the same
paper, entitled " The Einbryogeny of the Articulata, Mollusca, and Vertebrata compared"

(Linn. Trans, vol. xxii.).

Recent researches on the structure of the Infusoria show that some members of

that group, for example Vorticella, present a more or less obvious differentiation of

Atheir primitively homogeneous tissue into imperfect layers.                                                mouth, also, is con-

stantly present. In these characters the higher Protozoa pre-indicate, as it were,

certain structural features which are seldom absent among the members of other

sub-kingdoms. So also do the more advanced Ccelenterata, and especially the

Ctenophora, foreshadow, in a manner, the anatomical peculiarities of some of the

higher types.

 _ All this may be admitted as true, without in any way neglecting the fundamental
distinction insisted on by Von Baer between the grade of development and the

type of organization.

   It is to be observed with reference to the Anntdosa, that the difficulty of enun-
ciating propositions which shall be equally applicable to the Articulate properly so

called (Art/iropoda), and those lower annulose forms known collectively as Anmdoida
or Vermes, is still so much felt, as to render it doubtful whether these two great

divisions should not be raised to the rank of separate subkingdoms. This, at
present perhaps the most important question in systematic zoology, has already
been answered in the affirmative by J. V. Carus, Gegenbaur, R. Leuckart, Siebold,
and Vogt.

   The three first-mentioned of these naturalists regard the Eckinodermata as con-

stituting a seventh subkingdom. Of the propriety of separating this group from
the Ccelenterata no doubt can any longer be entertained, although Prof. Milne-
Edwards and a few other zoologists of repute still continue to unite these widely
different foims under the old name of Radiata. So long, however, as the arguments
brought forward by Prof. Huxley remain unanswered, the author can see no reason
to dissent from his conclusion, that the Eckinodermata, while forming a distinctly

circumscribed class, are nevertheless connected by true affinities with the division
Anmdoida.

                       On the Mode of Death by Aconite.

               By Edward R. Harvey, M.A., B.M., Oxon.

Death by aconite has been attributed by different observers to its influence upon

each of the three vital organs, the heart, lungs, and brain. The following experiments

were made with a view of determining, if possible, the organ whose functions were

most directly interfered with by the poison. Fleming's tincture was always used.

In experiment 1, two minims of the tincture were injected beneath the skin of a

dog. In 2f koiirs after injection the dog died. There had been no convulsions,

no loss of consciousness, no apparent loss of sight, no change in the pupils, and no

disturbance of the respiration : the two marked symptoms were vomiting and great

prostration. On examination after death, the veins of the neck were seen to be

enormously distended. The heart contained blood partially clotted in both auricles.
The other organs were healthy. In experiment 2. on a rabbit, the heart was the

organ first affected (its pulsations falling in 5 minutes from 140 in a minute to 100,
and soon becoming laboured and irregular) ; the breathing then became distressed,

--and just before death there were convulsions. Post-mortem examination directly

after death : The veins of the neck and brain were distended with blood. The heart
gave, when exposed, two very slight quiverings, not to be called contractions ; all the

cavities contained blood. The other organs were healthy. In experiment 3,
similar symptoms during life and appearances after death we're observed. Experi-
ment .4. The heart of a frog having been exposed by removal of a portion of the

sternum, the pulsations numbered 60 in a minute, and were forcible and irregular.

After three or four drops of the tincture had been let fall into the thoracic cavity,

the pulsations became very rapid, feeble, and irregular, and soon could no longer

be felt: the beating here ceased: 10 minutes after death the heart was ao-ain

Apulsating, though much more feebly than in another frog killed by pithing. "Ex-
periment 5.    young rabbit was killed by aconite, and another yoimg one by a

blow behind the ears. In the animal killed by aconite, there was a slight fluttering

movement of the heart, but there were no regular contractions, and galvanism pro-

duced no  effect whatever                                                            in  the other rabbit,  the heart was contracting regularly
                                                                                  ;

after death; and when all contraction had ceased, galvanism occasioned slight but

decided contractions. Experiment 6. Five minims of the tincture were injected
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

beneath the skin of a rabbit. In 40 minutes the pulse was intermittent, and

had fallen from 108 in a minute to 36. The temperature within the ears, which

at the time of injection was 97°, was 03°. The animal at this time was ex-

tremely weak, and unwilling to move ; twenty minutes later it was more lively

the pidse beat 60 in a minute, and the temperature within the ears was 96°.

The heart's pulsation slowly and steadily increased, and the animal recovered.

Experiment 7. In a very young rabbit which received beneath the skin four

minims of the tincture, similar symptoms terminated in recovery. In the latter

case the temperature fell from 97° to 89°. In each case the only sign of cerebral

disturbance was an extreme weakness of the hind legs, which perhaps amounted

to temporary paralysis                                                                                                         the breathing was never distressed,  and but little hurried.
                                                                                                                            ;

Loss of power of the heart and of the muscles generally, with a fall of temperature,

was the marked symptom, and the condition of the animals improved or deterio-

rated coincidently with the state of the heart. Experiments 8 and 9. In two

rabbits poisoned by aconite the heart and large veins were distended with blood.

In experiment 10, where there had been during life no svmptoms of asphyxia, the

right side of the heart alone contained clots ; a little liquid blood escaped from

both ventricles. This is the only evidence throughout the experiments of death

from asphyxia. "With this exception, all the preceding experiments led to the

conclusion that aconite kills by its action upon the heart, and that the disorder of

the brain and lungs, when present, is due to the congestion consequent upon the

heart's failure. To discover if the circulation was affected by the outward application

of the tincture to an inflamed part, a frog's web was placed under the microscope,

and inflammation excited by a little mustard; the whole web was then moistened

with a few drops of the tincture : no effect whatever was observed for two hours

during wThich the web was under the microscope. It remained to be seen if the

poison acted directly upon the muscles or nerves. For this purpose experiments

were made upon  frogs                                                                                                          galvanism  was  applied  under  various  circumstances,  and
                                                  :

though the experiments were not sufficiently numerous to decide the point, the

conclusion arrived at was, that aconite acts immediately upon the nerves, and

-- --through them upon the muscles the heart among the number and that that organ

is the first of the vital organs whose function is interrupted. The latter experiment

will be repeated, as well as others which have been instituted on the antidotes of

aconite.

   Several very careful analyses of the blood and urine of animals under aconite
were made, but beyond the* increased quantity of urine, nothing worthy of parti-
cular comment was discovered.

a nearly complete anatomical monograph of this species. It was in the begin-

sented to me by a Surgeon in the service of the army of the Netherlands, then
residing at George d'Elmina. I placed them in the hands of a Candidate of
Medicine, P. A. W. van Canipen, to procure him a good argument for his disserta-

Monograph, which was edited in ltid by the Royal Academy of Sciences of the

Bosnian door F. A. W. van Campen, Med. Cand. Uit zesse nagelasen aau

seekeningen byeen gebragt door J. van der iloeven (Met due Platen Amsterdam,
4to, 77 pp.). Except the female organs of generation, a species, scarcely known

thirty years ago, is now more completely investigated than many species of the

mammalia living in Europe.

The little but very natural group of Mammalia called Lemuridce, is one with

whose investigation I have been often and at different times engaged. It is well

known that zoologists have given the name of a hand to every extremity in which the

thumb is opposable to the other fingers. Some have such only on the posterior ex-

tremities, as the opossum (Didelphis) of America and the Chironiya of Madagascar.

Those are called Pedimctna, or hind-handed. Others have this structure both in the

anterior and posterior extremities, as in the case in the greatest number of monkeys,

and in the lemurs (Quadrumana). Man is the only species of the order Bimana

where the opposable thumb exists on the anterior extremities only. Amongst the

Quadrumana the Lemuridae are distinguished by the nail of the second finger of the

hind feet, which is erected, compressed and sharp (of a subulate shape), while the

other fingers have flat nails. I found that in all the species the fourth finger, both

of the anterior and posterior feet, is the longest. In the apes, on the contrary, as in

most other mammals having five fingers, the third is the longest of all. To those
characters, sufficient perhaps for the systematic zoologist, we may add, after what

is known by the investigations of Cuvier, Fischer, Meckel, W. Vrolik, Burmeister,

A. Smith, Kingnia and myself, several anatomical characters, as, for instance, that

the lower jaw is divided into two distinct lateral parts (as in many other mammals,

but never in the monkeys) ; that the orbit is not closed by the interposition of the ala

magna ossissjrfwnoideihetween the malar and frontal bones, so that thefissura orbitalis

inferior is not distinct from the temporal fossa*; that there exists a flat, mem-

branaceous or aponeurotic tongue-shaped appendage beneath the tongue, terminated

in slender slips forming a pectinated tip that the first pair of cerebral nerves is
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

represented by large corpora mammillaria, and that the uterus (in those of which

the anatomy is known) has two eornua, and not that pyriform shape which it

assumes in the monkeys and in woman.

The whole group is confined to the eastern hemisphere of our planet. The

greatest number of species lives only in Madagascar; some are found on the continent

of Africa in tropical regions; and some in East India, chiefly in the isles at the

south and east coast of Asia.

I distinguish the Lemurina into two groups. In the first there is only one nail of

the hinder feet erected and subulate; in the other, not only the second, but also the

third has that shape. To this second group belongs only the genus Tardus, living

in Celebes, Borneo, and the Philippine Isles. It seems not to be proved that there

is more than one species of that genus. The tarsus is very elongated.

To the first group belong all the other Lemurina. In those the superior inci-

sors are placed by two pairs, and a vacant space is left between them in the middle f.
Some of those have the tarsal bones elongated like Tarsius the calcaneum and

in the slender and small Ceylonese species (Stenops gracilis). All species oyStenops

generic peculiarity, and the index has only two phalanges. The species is further

 Observations on the Teredo navalis, and the Mischief caused by it in Holland.

                         By Professor van der Hoeven.

    It is well known that the Teredo has been greatly destroying the piles which
 were employed in the construction of the dykes of Holland in the beginning of the

 preceding century, chiefly in the years from 1730 tol783. Since that period it is
 scarcely recorded that any mischief has been produced by that bivalve till the year

 1827, when in the province of Sealand it again became noxious. But it was chiefly
in the years 1858 and 1859 that the species increased very much, and the destruction
produced by it was the cause of a committee of members of the Royal Academy

of Science being formed, with the view of inquiring concerning the damages in
 different localities, and as to the best means of protecting timber against their ravages.
 I have the pleasure to place the Report of those gentlemen, published some weeks

before I left Leyden, in the hands of the gentleman who has given such an elaborate
dissertation on the Ship-worm to this meeting of the British Association. He will
I hope make known hereafter the chief contents to the English naturalist. From

 the comparison of different records, it seems to result that the species, which it is

well known now was not imported from foreign and warmer seas, exists always on

our coasts, but that there are some periods of greater occurrence, produced as it
seems by high temperature of the year and by dry summers.

    Different experiments have proved that some proposed means of preserving tim-
ber against the ship-worm are only useful for a short time, or even not useful at all
such are mixtures of fine fragments of broken glass and fat, different oil-paintings
and the like ; such is also the imbibition with different solutions of salts, sulphate
of copper, acetate of lead, and others. The best success, on the contrary, yet
obtained was by creosoting timber, a result also obtained in this country, as is
stated in the 'Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers.' I think myself

fortunate in having the opportunity of placing the book I have brought -with me in
the hands of a Member of this Association who has such a great knowledge of a

subject, to the elucidation of which, in a practical point of view, the Committee of
the Academy of Amsterdam has given its conscientious and laborious consider-

ation.

     On the Development o/'Pyrosoma. By Professor Huxley, F.R.S.

On the Nature of Death from the Administration of Anesthetics, especially

 Chloroform and Ether, as observed in Hospitals. By Charles Kidd, M.D.

   The author having collected and tabulated 109 deaths from chloroform, 22 from
ether, and 2 from amylene, believes himself to be in a position to offer some ex-

planation of these accidents.

   Of these 133 deaths, 90 occurred in male patients, and 43, or less than half that
number, in females, though anaesthetics have been largely used in midwifery practice.
Such occurrences are very rare in children.

   From 250,000 to 300,000 operations of all kinds have been performed under the

influence of anaesthetics, and chiefly of chloroform, and in some hundreds of severe
cases the patient has been more than an hour in a state of deep anaesthesia. In all
these latter cases not a single well-attested instance is on record in which death
has taken place from simple stoppage of the functions of life, or narcotism of the
system by the chloroform. Fully 80 per cent, of all the deaths, and nearly all
those from chloroform, have occurred from trivial operations, from very small doses,
and suddenly before the anaesthetic had produced its full effect. The author does

not contend that death cannot occur in the human subject from long-con-

tinued inhalation of chloroform, but only that it has not been observed to do so

in hospital practice. It seems probable that when anassthesia is once established in

a favourable surgical subject, respiratory action is diminished, and the breathing
for a definite interval proceeds on a diminished scale, almost as it does in the case

of hybernating mammals. On the other hand, if respiration by fresh pungent

chloroform, vomited matter, &c, be disturbed, slight spasm of the glottis may

take place through the recurrent laryngeal nerves. This occurs occasionally in

strong and healthy, but nervous subjects, and especially in trivial cases and the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

occurrence of death in such instances from a few drops of chloroform is to be

--attributed to this disturbance and stoppage of the respiratory muscles at the end

of the irritant or second stage this being the dangerous point in administration of

chloroform. It may be considered almost as an established law, that patients suf-

fering under old disease and severe nervous irritation or neuralgic pain bear chlo-

roform best.

Dr. Kidd thinks that statistics for future use ought to be examined in two ways

first inductively, and then by comparing the several groups of facts collected, and
deducing from them conclusions applicable to practice. Single " positive instauces "

lead only to false conclusions. Though a single instance in a case of pure physical
science may be all that is requisite, as in the case of measurements of atomic ele-

ments, angles, &c, this is not the case in so complicated a matter as the one under

discussion, in which it is necessary to generalize, not from single facts, but from a

comparison of groups of facts.

In surgical practice under chloroform we have to fear, not so much deep insen-

sibility as the production, first, of apnea from muscular inaction, or spasm of the

parts of the heck by irritation of the excito-motor respiratory apparatus. The

deaths from chloroform may be proved to be of an accidental character, and many

deaths during operations are charged to chloroform which would have occurred

equally before chloroform was used, and would then have been put down to some

other cause. For instance, of 45 deaths recorded by Dr. Snow, 6 were attributable

to fright. Those which really follow chloroform commonly occur before the ope-

ration, and seldom or never as the result of a long tedious operation : of 85 deaths

which have been classified, 9 were cases of delirium tremens, and of the remainder

not one followed a capital operation.

The fact also that in 300,000 operations of all kinds chloroform has saved from

6 to 10 per cent, of lives, as held by Prof. Simpson and the author, also tends to

prove that the cause of death, at least in hospitals, is of an accidental character.

From a general survey of the facts, the author finds that the deaths from chloroform
are all sudden, and many of the nature of " fit." Chloroform has a powerful irritant

action upon the pneumogastric nerve; and it is found that a similar irritation by

electricity causes vomiting and stops the action of the heart. Hence syncope may

possibly occur, if this irritation or (tetanoid ?') apnea of the respiratory muscles

and laryngeal nerves be reflected to the heart through the cardiac nerves of the same

pneumogastric  trunk                               this  mode  of  death  is  most remarkable,  for  instance,  under the
                                                :

analogous agent--amylene. The general effect of the introduction of chloroform into

surgical practice has been good ; and where it acts badly the author believes that

the cause may often be found in the tendency in patients themselves to defer sub-

mitting to an operation till too late. Upon a comparison of the present surgical

death-rate with that of 1846 immediately before the introduction of chloroform, it

appears 10 per cent, lower ; and further, of the deaths which have taken place,

one-fourth have been in persons who have previously taken chloroform without ill

effect. Both these facts support the author's view of the accidental nature of

death from chloroform.

   The fact of death from chloroform occurring in slight operations and early in

the administration, has been remarked by all the chief observers, viz. MM. Robert

of Paris, Denonvilliers, Paget, Snow, and Brown-Sequard. The opinion that this

is due to disease of the heart is erroneous. In most fatal cases the heart has not
been found diseased. Thus in 4 cases in London hospitals, the post-mortem ex-
aminations of which were attended by the author, the heart-fibres were examined

and found healthy, though one of them (at Guy's) was reported in the medical
Journals as a marked case of fatty heart. In 18 deaths reported in Journals which
presented some visible lesion, 3 only showed diseased heart. Again, in 24 deaths

from ether, the cause appears to have been extreme hebitude, muscular relaxation

and exhaustion, and in some consequent haemorrhage following operations.

   On the other hand, numerous patients known to have diseased hearts have taken

chloroform without any bad result, and in hundreds of animals death has been
                                                                                      --

observed to take place through the respiratory muscles first, the heart suffering as

a mere consequence. There have been probably 100 deaths from chloroform, and

twice as many patients saved from impending; death by the proper use of restora-

tives, the chief of which is artificial respiration, which "wakes up " the respiratory

muscles. These restoratives have been directed so as to excite the reflex and respi-

ratory system of nerves. Some patients have probably been lost by means used on

the theory of fatty or obstructed heart. Intoxication, delirium tremens, and hysteria

all- contraindicate the use of chloroform ; and it was also found during the Crimean

war, and more recently at three several seats of Avar in Italy, that nervous fright-

ened prisoners were particularly bad subjects for it. Any condition of violent

emotion (" exaltation of sensibility ") would appear to approach that state which

causes spasm of the glottis, trachelismus, &c, while depressing emotion (fright ?)

may lead to syncope. Dr. Snow does not seem to have noticed the effect of delirium

tremens ; but in 85 fatal cases, collected by the author in the hospitals, 9 appear

due to it, or to intoxication ; the mischief is probably owing to the cerebral hemi-
spheres, medulla, and reflex system in the spinal cord being weakened by alcohol.

In 4 well-authenticated cases the heart was still beating after respiration had

ceased                             this is also very often seen in experiments on animals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            and probably obser-
                                ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

vation only is wanting to establish the more frequent occurrence of this pheno-

menon in man. In the author's opinion the heart is one of the very last organs

which is depressed by chloroform, and this fact it is which renders its use compa-

ratively safe. He fears rather the implication of the " respiratory tract." The chief

conclusions at which Dr. Kidd arrives are as follows :

1. Ether is little if at all superior to chloroform. In " ether mixtures " the

ether is first inhaled pure. Ether causes the pidse to intermit, and is to be avoided

where we fear excessive haemorrhage or muscular relaxation but in dislocations
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and in midwifery it has some points in its favour, hut not in a mixture with chloro-

form. Ether, too, in a sick room may take fire, but chloroform does not.

   2. There is less reason to fear the effect of anaesthetics in women and children
and in severe operations, than on robust men ; especially if given to the use of intoxi-
cating liquors, or when the operation is connected with tendinous parts, in which
cases syncope often follows wnen no chloroform is used.

3. Hospital experience tends to prove that chloroform is less dangerous in pro-

portion as the operation for which it is used is more severe. "When once the pal-

pebral conjunctiva is insensible, there is a period of safety during which the respira-

tory action is diminished like that of hybemating mammals ; the heart remains unaf-
fected, but the pulse becomes larger. The many instances in which this has been

seen, seem to overpower isolated cases of death from diseased heart and chloroform,

and should encourage hopeful views on the use of anaesthetics.

   4. Idiosyncrasy has probably little or nothing to do with deaths from anaesthetics,

if we omit habits of intoxication, hysteria, and tendency to "fits." Thus re-

peated trials of chloroform (" trials cTcssai") on a patient are a mistake, and nowise

affect the chance of his safety on any given occasion.

   5. There are two, or perhaps three modes in which anaesthetics may cause death,
and which require watching, (a) Ether may do so at some uncertain interval

of time dining the first twenty-four hours after an operation. (/3) Chloroform in-
stantly, by an action on the laryngeal-recurrent and double respiratory centre in the

pneiunogastric nerves. In half these cases, probably, as in apnea or asphyxia, the

heart is still beating ; and (y) in other cases by syncope (as a coincidence*?).
   6. In several cases, e y. those of delirium tremens, the death probably occurs

because ordinary restoratives fail to act in consequence of the imperfect reflex ner-

vous system                                                            but  in cases  of impending death, we are to have recourse to artificial
                                                                    ;

respiration by pressure (rather than the Marshall Hall plan), since this also acts

upon the engorging cavities of the heart ; tracheotomy if we have reason to fear

spasm of the glottis or asphyxia ; sudden dashing (not too long continued) of cold

water; fanning of fresh air on the face, &c. ; but as the spasm may subside, we are
not to do too much at first. Acupuncture, quickly done, of the muscles of the neck

is recommended in order to irritate the spinal accessory and phrenic nerve, but not
the eighth pair ; and " Faradisation " here also is most valuable.

7. Our experience of oxygen gas, common galvanism, &c. as restoratives is not

encouraging at present. Injection of port wine into the rectum is better, or the

 On the Development o/Buccinum. By John Lubbock, F.R.S., F.L.S.

  In the year 1851 MM. Koren and Danielssen published a memoir* on the

Development of the Eggs of Buccinum undatum and Purpura lapilhis, in which
they gave an interesting account of the development of the young mollusks, and
especially excited the surprise of naturalists by certain statements regarding the
amalgamation of several eggs to form one embryo.

   The two above-mentioned species produce peculiar capsules, each containing
several hundred eggs. The capsules of Purpura are bottle-shaped, those of Buc-
cinum are like a round cushion, and are attached to one another in clusters, and
fastened to rocks, shells, or sea-weeds. Often, however, they are detached and
thrown up on the shore, so that they are familiar to all those who ever walk along
the beach near high-water mark. The egg-capsules of Purpura are attached singly
to the rocks. It was already known that, although each capsule contained a great
number of eggs, only a small number of embryos, from fifteen to thirty, came to

maturity.

  MM. Koren and Danielssen gave a very extraordinary account of the phenomenon.
According to them the eggs grouped themselves in masses, round which a common

skin was formed, and thus numerous ova combined to form one embryo. This
account of a process, so different from that with which we are familiar in other
animals, was not likely to pass long without either confirmation or opposition ; and
accordingly Dr. Carpenter f, having studied the development of the eggs of Purpura

lapillus, disputed some of the statements made by MM. Koren and Danielssen, gave

a very different explanation of the whole phenomenon, and added the high authority
of Messrs. Busk and Huxley in confirmation of his view.

   Dr. Carpenter had no opportunity of making any observations on the embryology
of Buccinum, but he convinced himself that the cgg-capsides of Purpura lapilhis
contain two sorts of bodies, namely true eggs and " yolk-spheres," which, however,
are at first undistinguishable from one another. After a while, however, "all the
egg-like bodies in the capsule begin to show signs of cleavage. In the greater part
of them, the two segments produced by the first cleavage are equal, or nearly so
and each of these again subdivides into other two, which are alike equal ;" after
which the division becomes irregular. These are the so-called "yolk-spheres."
Some few of the egg-like bodies, on the contrary, divide into two unequal segments.
These are the true eggs, and each embryo takes its origin from one of these. The
embryo then developes rapidly in itself a central hollow or stomach, a wide oeso-
phagus, and two lobes covered with cilia. It then commences to swallow the yolk
matter around it, and this is the reason that the number of embryos is so much
smaller than that of the egg and yolk-spheres.

   MM. Koren and Danielssen by no means gave up their theory, but after repeat-

ing their observations, they reiterated their statements J, giving, however, it must

be confessed, figures much more nearly resembling those of Dr. Carpenter than the

ones contained in their first memoir.
    Finally, Dr. Carpenter, in the 'Annals and Magazine of Nat. Hist.' for 1857, has

published some further remarks on the subject, and adds, in addition, the testimony

of Dr. Dyster to the truth of his assertions. This is the present state of the ques-

tion; and considering how common are the egg-capsules of Buccinum, it is remark-
able that no one has tested MM. Koren and Danielssen's statements in reference to

that genus.

   The whole subject is one of great interest ; and though I could not doubt the
truth of statements made from independent observations by four such excellent

authorities as Messrs. Carpenter, Busk, Huxley, and Dyster, yet MM. Koren and

Danielssen, though wrong as to Purpura, might still be quite correct in the case of

Buccinum, and I was very anxious to repeat their observations. It could not be
denied that it was a priori probable that what was true of Purpura, would also

apply to Buccinum. Still, if I had any bias, it was in favour of MM. Koren and
Danielssen. Many insects present us with a case in many respects parallel. In

Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Neuroptera, and the Geodephagous beetles,

each egg is accompanied by several vitelligenous cells, or as we might call them in

the words of Dr. Carpenter, yolk-spheres. After a while the walls of the vitelli-

genous cells disappear, and the whole group unites to form an egg. Here we have

undoubtedly a certain similarity with that which, according to MM. Koren and

Danielssen, occurs in Purpura and Buccinum.

   Buccinum undatum has been stated* to lay its eggs from the beginning of January

to the end of April. On our south coast of England, however, it begins earlier, for

I found some fresh ones at Brighton last November. I was not then able to examine
them with much care, but in February last I received from Mr. Lloyd two packets

of egg-capsules, iu which I have succeeded in tracing the development of the

embryos.

"When I received them, the germinal vesicle had already disappeared, and the

eggs consisted of yelk-particles immersed in a viscid substance. According to

MM. Koren and Danielssen, each egg is surrounded by a chorion and a vitelline

membrane, but I was as little able in the case of Buccinum, as Dr. Carpenter was in

that of Purpura, to discover any trace of these structures; and I think I can safely say,

from the appearance of the eggs, and from their behaviour when crushed, that they
were surrounded by no definite membrane. Many of the eggs, indeed, resembled

MM. Koren and Danielssen's fig. 16 (Ann. des Sc. Xat. 1852, vol. xviii.), in which

a thick outer membrane is apparently present ; but this arises, as will be presently

described, from a condensation of the yelk-particles leaving a clear border of the

viscid substance.

  The presence of a vitelline membrane certainly seems to me improbable, but
about the so-called chorion I am more doubtful. MM. Koren and Danielssen men-

tion (I. c. p. 258) that it early disappears, and this may have already taken place

in my specimens as well as in those of Dr. Carpenter.
  The eggs in my egg-capsules did not coalesce. They collected certainly in a heap,

but they remained quite separate from one another, and showed no tendency to unite.

  Very few showed any trace of segmentation. In this respect my observations,
so far as they go, are quite in accordance with those of MM. Koren and Danielssen.

There is, however, always a certain amount of suspicion attached to negative evi-

dence, and it seems a priori very improbable that Purpura and Buccinum, which

agree so closely in most points connected with their embryology, shoidd differ in

such an important matter.

Dr. Carpenter considers that the capsules of Purpura contain two sorts of egg-

like bodies, which, however, can be distinguished from one another only by their

modes of segmentation.

I was not able to perceive any difference in the eggs of Buccinum, except that in

some the yolk-granules were condensed, so as to leave a margin of the clear, glaiiy

substance ; but it must be remembered that in each capside only a very few eggs

undergo segmentation at one time ; .and the process appears to be altogether so

myirregular, that  observations do  not enable  me to  come to any satisfactory con-

clusion on this point. It would be desirable to investigate the formation of the

eggs in the ovary, both of Buccinum and Purpura, in order to determine whether

or no they are all originally alike, and if not, to determine the points of difference.

It would also be well worth while to ascertain the relation which the segmenta-

tion of the yolk bears to the development of the embryo.

It is so generally present throughout the animal, and apparently so universal in

the Mollusca, that strong evidence woidd be required to show that Buccinum forms

myany exception to the general rule ; and yet, as far as      observations went, the

process certainly seemed to be subject to considerable irregularities.

The whole subject of yolk-segmentation is one of great interest.

Among the Entozoa, it appears to occur in certain species of Stronyylus, Ascaris,

Gordius, Mermis, and Echinorlvjnchus, and in Filaria, Filaroides, and Sphceru/uriu.

   Van Beneden asserts that it occurs in the Cestoids generally ; but this is denied
by Kolliker, as far as concerns Tenia and Bothriocephalus. There is a similar differ-

ence of opinion as regards Cucullanus elegans, in which species Siebold (misled,
according to Kolliker, bv the large size of the two primary embryo cells) supposed
that there was a true segmentation. The figure given by Kolliker sufficiently

explains how such a mistake might have occurred*. Van Beneden also denies that
any segmentation occurs in Echinorhynchus, a difference of opinion which may have

arisen from different species having been examined, since, while segmentation has
been observed in Ascaris nigrovenosa, acuminata, succisa, osculata, labiata, brevi-
caudata, &c, it appears, according to Kolliker, to be absent in Ascaris dentata. It is
evident therefore that this species cannot be naturally included in the same genus
as the others, and that the two groups, however similar, are in reality very remote

from one another.
    Oxyuris ambiqua and Gyrodactylus have been also asserted to develope without

volk-seo-meutation, though in the' case of the latter there appears to be some doubt.
    In the Annelids it has been observed in Polynoe, Exogone, Clepsine, Nephchs,

Protula, Hcrmclla, &c, and is not known to be absent in any.

   It has also been observed in the Tardigrada and in Lacmulana. Among the
Articulata, it has been noticed in Nicothoe by Van Beneden, in Diaptomus and
 Cyclops by Claus (which I also can confirm). On the other hand, in Insects t and

Dapknia I have sought for it in vain, and it is unmentioned by Rathke and Heroldt
in their works on the development of Asellus, Oniscus, Astacus, and the spiders,

though in the two latter cases it may perhaps be represented by the dispersion and

reunion of the "Keinischeibe."

    Amono- the Mollusca it has been described in Actceon, Aplysia, uEohdia, Dentahum,

Boris, Umax, Limruea, Planorbis, Teredo, Tergipes, Tritonia, &c.

   Among the Bryozoa it occurs in Alcyonella.

    In Salpa it has been observed by Kolliker, while in Pyrosoma it would appear,

 according to the recent researches of Huxley, to be impossible.

   All this, however, is a digression, and I must return to my Buccinam.
   The egg-capsules were sent to me on the 19th of February, at which date the eggs

 in most "of them were diffuse, though in some they had already begun to collect

 together. At this time no embrvos had appeared. On the 29th the eggs were

 more closely compacted, and each capsule contained from five to twenty embryos.

    The eggs now adhered together in a more or less compact mass, but showed

 no tendency to amalgamate, and were very easily separable from one another by
 the point of a needle. Imbedded in and about the mass were the embryos; the
 smallest consisting apparently only of a clear substance, surrounding the almost
 unaltered yolk, and having oil one side an enormous orifice or mouth leading into
 a central cavity. The more advanced embryos already showed traces of the ears
 and the salivary glands, and began to swallow the other eggs whole. In spite of a

 careful search, I never found any collections of eggs simply surrounded by a mem-
 brane, as described by MM. Keren and Danielssen and figured, I. c. fig. 17. Embryos

 containing more than three or four eggs always possessed the salivary glands and
 auditory organs. Nevertheless, were Messrs. Koren and Danielssen's theory correct,

 such masses ought to be tolerably frequent.

    Nevertheless, the young embryos were so voracious and swallowed so many other

 eggs that they became greatly distended, and on a superficial view appeared some-

 times as in MM. Koren and Danielssen's fig. 17 (Ann. des Sc. Nat. 1852, pi. 5).
 By turning these over, however, with a little care, the ciliated lobes could always

 be discovered. At this period also the eggs sometimes adhered together so as to
 form rounded masses; but in such cases they were quite separate, were surrounded
 by no membrane, and were easily separable from one another. Nevertheless, if

 masses such as those described and figured by MM. Koren and Danielssen

 formed one stage in the normal development, it is very unlikely that I shoidd

 never have come across a single specimen in this stage.
    Moreover, even in the smallest embryos we see already a broad oesophagus, and

Moreover it is very common to see other eggs actually in the oesophagus of the
embryos in the act of being swallowed ; or we might almost say that an embryo is
seldom seen without an egg in its oesophagus. In Purpura, according to Dr. Car-
penter, the yolk is swallowed particle by particle ; in Buccinum, on the contrary,
the eo-o-s not having undergone any segmentation, are swallowed whole, and the
process of deglutition is therefore probably less rapid and more easily seen. The
presence of yolk matter in the oesophagus of Purpura may also be more plausibly
ascribed to accident than in Buccinum, where, from the large size of the egg com-
pared to that of the embryo, it cannot take place without a considerable tension of
the oesophagus, and the swallowing must therefore apparently be a work of some

   M. Milne-Edwards suggests (Ann. des Sc. Nat. 1. c. p. 26) that the so-called eggs

are probably only " des spheres vitellines, dout 1' envelope utriculiforme prdsente"

   It will be seen, however, from the preceding description, that though M. Milne-
Edwards was fully iustified in the scepticism with which he regarded the descrip-

tion given by MM. Koren and Danielssen, he was not equally happy in his

attempt to explain away the supposed anomaly.

On the Influence of Systematized Exercise on the Expansion of the Chest.

                         By Archibald MacLaren.

Exercise is the most important agent in physical growth and development, inas-

much as it qualifies the condition, the action and the influence of all the others. This

importance is not always appreciated, because the effects of exercise on any part of

the body but the muscular system are imperfectly understood. All exercises may

be classed under two heads, Recreative and Educational. The first of these em-

--braces all our school games, sports and pastimes, a most valuable list, but quite in-
--sufficient to produce the perfect development of the body : 1st, because the parts

of the body chosen to execute the movements of the game are those which can

do them best, not those which need the exercise most ; 2nd, because it is a distinc-

tive feature in the best and most ardently practised of them, that they give a large

share of employment to the lower half of the body, and but little (some not at all)

to the upper half; and 3rd, the little which they do give is almost monopolized by

the right side. The tendency of these exercises is therefore to develope the lower

half of the body to the exclusion of the upper. It must always be remembered that

while in developing a limb to its full power and perfect conformation, we do that

and nothing more                                                                      in developing the trunk of the body, we do that and a great deal

more, we directly aid in the development of all the organs which it contains. The

point to be desired is the uniform and harmonious development of the entire body;

because the strength of a man is but equal to that of his weakest part, while the

natural tendency is to gauge and estimate the general strength by the power of

the strongest part. This equal development is to be obtained only from systema-
tized exercise, prepared upon a clear comprehension of what is required, and based
upon a knowledge of the structure and ascertained functions of the parts of the
body to be employed, and of the laws which govern growth and development. The
inadequacy of recreative exercise to produce this development is fully borne out

by the frames of the youths who yearly arrive in this University from our public
schools. As the case now stands, every one who so arrives here does so with the

upper part of the body greatly in arrears. So distinctly is it in arrears, that an

average of 2 inches in girth of chest is obtainable in the very first term of his prac-
tice in the Gymnasium. This rate of increase is not sustained beyond the first term,
therefore it must be chiefly expansion of the cavity of the chest ; and it must be
an arrears of expansion, otherwise it woidd be sustained, seeing that the process
which produced it is increased and accelerated in the advancing courses of exercise.
The operations of systematized exercise are equally important and decided in other
directions, and especially in the rectification of abnormal spinal developments.

            On the Artificial Production of Bone and Osseous Grafts.

                                 By M. Ollier.

   M. Ollier exhibited some specimens illustrating the results of his experiments on
the production of bone, and summed up in the following propositions :

   1. When the periosteum is detached from a bone, one end remaining attached,

bone is formed in the direction of the periosteum, its form and size being deter-
mined by the size and position of the membrane.

   2. After union has begun to take place between the periosteum and the soft parts,

the pedicel may be divided, but bone will still continue to form.

   3. If the periosteum be removed altogether and inserted among the soft parts, it
will make an attachment, and bone will be developed.

   4. If the inner surface of the periosteum be scraped off in part, no bone will form
on the portion so treated.

   5. If the matter scraped from the inside of the periosteum be broug°ht into con-
tact with soft parts, bone will be developed from the periosteal cells.

   6. If a bone be taken out of its periosteal sheath, new bone will be produced*

but if a segment of such sheath be removed, no bone forms in that space.
   7. If a bone be removed entire witli its periosteum and inserted into soft parts,

adhesion will take place, and new bone will be deposited from the periosteum on

the old.

    8. If, in a piece of inserted bone, a part be deprived of periosteum, that part dies

or is absorbed. This latter process may take place bv the denuded portion becoming

either encysted or subjected to suppuration; as a general rule, in animals that are
healthy, and live in the country, the process of encysting takes place ; while in
feeble animals and those living in towns, suppuration is the ordinary result.

Experiments on Mtiscular Action from an Electrical point ofvieiv

                 On the Process of Oxygenation in Animal Bodies.

                     By B. W. Richardson, M.A., M.D.

   So soon as the discovery of oxygen by Priestley became an established fact in
the world of science, inquiries were set on foot as to the influence of this substance
on animal bodies. The term by which it was long known, " vital air," indicates
sufficiently the interest that was attached to it in a phvsiological point of view.
Priestley himself made various physiological experiments with oxyo-en in which

line of research he was followed by Lavoisier, Beddoes, Sir Humphry Davv Hill

and several other celebrities of the declining eighteenth, and rising nineteenth

century. From the researches of various experimentalists, it had been concluded
                                 --;

144 REPORT 1860.

that the inhalation of oxygen in the pure state, by giving rise to a greater absorption

--of the gas, sets up an increased oxygenation in the body,- hypercausis, and inflam-

matory conditions, general and local. This view, first promulgated by Dr. Beddoes,
and followed up by many contemporary writers, was probably the basis of the
chemical nomenclature of disease invented by Baume, in which disorders were

divided into those of oxygenation, of calorification, hydrogenizatiou, azotification,

and phosphorization, with remedies of the same names for their treatment.

  A second conclusion as to the influence of oxygen on animals, intimated (also

from experiment) that oxygen, wheu inhaled in the pure form, is even less active
than as it exists diluted in common air ; that, instead of increasing the combustion

of the body and its activity, it lessens these, and that animals exposed to it too long
die from coma attended with a steady and uudiminishing exhaustion. The idea
that less oxygen is absorbed wheu the gas is breathed in the undiluted state was
supported by Davy : the statement that the gas destroys by narcotic exhaustion
was doubtfully suggested by Priestley, and openly by Broughton. For years this
view of the question has been the one most commonly taught in this country.

   The last conclusion that had been drawn from experiment relative to the effects
of pure oxygen was, that it has no injurious influence on life. Lavoisier, in his later
experiments, seems to have drawn this inference, and Regnault has greatly con-

firmed it.
   In 1852, with these conflicting data before him, those of Regnault only excepted,

Dr. Richardson commenced an inquiry into the whole subject, which he had con-
tinued, with intermissions, to the present time. The author here narrated his earlier
experiments, from which he came to the conclusion that animals of active respiration,
as dogs, cats, and pigeons, on being subjected to a constant stream of freshly made

--oxv°'en, become subject to inflammation, owing to the rapid destruction of the

tissues, hypercausis. In further experiments, he found, however, that his rule was

not common to all animals ; for rabbits and frogs were kept by him even for weeks
in oxygen without apparent injury. On the data, therefore, he gave the following

as the first major proposition of his paper:

   The influence of pure oxygen, as an excitant, differs according to the animal
beinc most marked in animals of quick respiration and high temperature, and least
marked or nil in those of feeble respiration and lower temperature.

   Up to 1856 the author had felt assured that oxygen, when it destroys life in the

actively breathing animals, does so by causing a too rapid oxidation of tissue and
the so-called inflammatory process ; and he believed that the symptoms of narcotism
and paralysis, named by Broughton, were due without doubt to one or other of
two possible errors, introduction of carbonic acid, or modifications of the air-pressure
exerted on the animal. In 1857 he began to suspect that his view was not strictly
correct ; but he had no proof either one way or the other until the present year,

when a new observation opened a new phase of the question. Having made on one

occasion forty gallons of oxygen, and having, by the side of the reservoir containing
the oxygen, another reservoir of equal size filled with water, Dr. Richardson deter-
mined, in order to economise both labour and material, to collect the oxygen from
the supplying reservoir, after it had passed through the chamber containing the

animals. He arranged also to wash the oxygen in alkaline solution until it was

free of carbonic acid altogether, to pass it over sulphuric acid to remove any am-
 monia, and finally to charge the second reservoir with it and to use it again,
 sending it thus backwards and forwards from one reservoir to the other until it

 was all used.
    "When the apparatus was complete, he placed four warm-blooded animals, a cat,

 a dog, a pigeon, and a rabbit, with two frogs, in a large chamber, and at 11 o'clock
 in the morning commenced the transference of the oxygen, passing it through the
 chambers at the rate of 2000 cubic inches per hour. In six hours the whole of
 the primitive oxygen, minus nearly 1000 cubic iuches which had been lost in

 respiration, was transferred into the second reservoir. The gas was now tested,

 and havino- been found to give no reaction to lime-water, it was driven back
 through the chamber and washed again thoroughly with potash, to be received
 once more into the reservoir number one. As the first charge of oxygen was passing
 throuo-h the chamber, there were exhibited no signs different from those ofexcitement,
 which bad before bee« seen; but as the second cbarge passed through, all the
                                                                               ;;

animals became depressed and drowsy. After an interval of four hours, the current

was again changed, and the oxygen, purified most carefully of extraneous matter,

was a third time given to the animals. It now became more obvious that every

animal was under some peculiar depressing influence ; even the rabbit did not escape.
The symptoms were entirely different from those arising from carbonic acid. The

breathing was quick, but easy and tranquil. There was not the slightest approach

to convulsion. The pigeon buried its head under its wing, and simply drooped and

slept. The four-footed animals sat witli their four legs straight and their heads

between them, nodding as if in profound and pleasant sleep ; they were aroused

with difficulty, and fell oil' again in an instant. Then the fore-legs slowly gave way

forward, as if paralysed ; and, before the third charge of the oxygen was three parts
over, the pigeon was dead, and the kitten was so nearly dead "that it was not easy
to detect its chest movement ; the clog gave no sign of sensibility, but breathed

softly the rabbit was fast asleep.    The frogs alone were unaffected.
                                 ;

At this crisis, a little air was pumped out of the chamber through lime-water

it gave less indication of carbonic acid than the common air which the experiment-

alist was breathing.

   The animals were then removed, and a lighted taper was placed in the chamber.
The taper burnt with more brilliancy than in the air, but with a slight yellowness

of flame.

The animals were all nearly dead. The kitten died a few minutes after removal

the rabbit recovered in two hours ; the dog seemed paralysed in the limbs for the

greater part of the clay, but recovered. When the bodies of the pigeon and the kitten

were opened, there was found no indication of asphyxia. The lungs were inflated

and red ; the heart contained blood on both sides, but the blood in each side was

of the same hue, neither being very dark ; the brain was bloodless ; the other organs
were natural. The appearances in the pigeon corresponded with these with the

most minute accuracy.

Dr. Richardson next narrated the histories of several other experiments, from

which he derived, apparently to demonstration, the following and second major

--proposition : Oxygen, when breathed over and over again, although freed entirely

from carbonic acid or other known products of respiration, loses its power of sup-

porting life; the process of life ceasing, not from the introduction of a poison, but

as by a negation, or a withdrawal of some principle extant in the primitive oxygen,

which is essential to life.

The last section of the paper had reference to the influence of oxygen on muscular

irritability; and various experiments were again given. On them the author

founded the third major proposition.

Oxygen, while it is essential to muscular irritability and muscular power, exerts

its influence over muscle, not as a direct excitant of muscular contraction, but by

supplying to the muscle an agent or force by which the muscle is fitted for contrac-

tion on the application of an exciting cause.

The Action of Tea and Alcohols contrasted. By Edward Smith, 3I.D.,

   LL.B., F.R.S., Assistant. Physician to the Hospital for Consumption
  and Diseases of the Chest, Brompton, Sgc.

In this paper the author stated the results of a series of original inquiries into

the influence of these two substances which appeared in the Philosophical Trans-

actions for 1859.

The general expression of the action of tea is, that it increases all vital actions,

and causes the elimination from the body of more material than it supplies.

It increases the ease, frequency and depth of respiration, but does not much

affect pulsation.

It increases the action of the skin, as shown by the increase of perspiration ; and

as in the conversion of fluid into vapour there is a thousand-fold increase in the

absorption of latent heat, perspiration must cool the body.

It increases, and does not disturb, nervous, mental and muscular action, and it

is not followed by reaction.

Small doses often repeated have fourfold the effect of a large dose.

Large doses cause nausea and narcotism.

The addition of acids and fat, as cream, lessens its action on the skin and increases

pulsation.

The addition of an alkali, as soda, increases the action upon the skin and renders

it more soothing, but a caustic alkali destroys it.

Hence the author considers that it is inapplicable in the following conditions of

the system, viz. :

In the absence of food (except when a large meal has been recently taken), and

therefore at breakfast, unless the system be replete with food, as from a late and

large supper. In the ill-fed, and in those of spare habit.

In prison or other dietaries, in which it is a duty not to allow the supply to ex-

ceed the real wants of the system, except in the cases in which the powers of

assimilation are defective, and then as tea, like other nitrogenous matters, has been

shown by the author to promote the assimilation of starchy food, it may prevent

the waste of undigested food.

  When unusual muscular exertion is made, unless there be also an abundance of

food and the skin acting insufficiently.

In those who perspire too easily and profusely.

   In low temperatures, except in connexion with abundance of fat, since then the

action of the skin should be reduced to a minimum.
   In very early life, when all the vital actions are rapidly performed.

  He considers also that it is more suited to the following states :
   In the after part of the day, when the powers of assimilation have been shown by
him to be enfeebled, and when food has accumulated in the body.

In old persons.

In hot climates, with lessened powers of assimilation ; with excess of heat and

excess of food.

   In those who usually transform food imperfectly.
   In those who take too little exercise, and eat too much.

In conditions in which gout is likely to occur.

In those who have the skin inactive.

   In all states in which there is excess of food, not, perhaps, in relation to the
wants of the system always, but in relation to the power to transform it, and
especially where there is excess of heat, as to soldiers on march exposed to the

eastern sun.

   The author then compared these deductions from science with the actual instinct-

--ive habits of mankind in different climates the test to which all such inquiries
--must be ultimately subjected and showed that there is a most striking correspond-

ence, as, for example, the frequent use of tea alone by the sedentary, corpulent, fat

and starch-eating Chinese, and, with the addition of an acid, by the industrious poor

and exposed classes  in  that country, and  by all   classes in the cold of Eussia                                                                                                                                  the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

addition of milk or cream in our climate ; our habit of taking food with tea when

we regard it as a meal, and of drinking it after dinner in hot weather when we

would perspire more freely ; the enjoyment of it by the poor, who live chiefly on

bread, which is imperfectly digested ; and the large appetites of teatotallers.

Hence he was of opinion that tea had a more powerful action upon the body, both

for good and evil, than has hitherto been understood, and believed it to demand

the regulation which attends the administration      of a medicine                                                                      and especially
                                                                                                                                     ;

urged it to be supplied to soldiers in hot climates, to be drunk cold or hot in small

doses diuing exposure to heat.

In reference to alcohols, the author showed that ales, wines, and spirits differ

in their action, not only because thejT contain varying amounts of alcohol, but have

other ingredients, as volatile oils and ethers, salts, gluteu and sugar, and thence

each must always be discussed separately. He showed that neither the public nor

the medical profession substitute a given amount of alcohol and water for these

various substances, but admit that each substance has a special action, and that

even impurity and newness are held to be deteriorations in any member of the

same class.

  He showed that all alcohols lessen the action of the skin and increase the force

and frequency of the action of the heart, and that these are their true dietetic and

medicinal actions.

                                                TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.         147

  When the usual dose of a spirit or alcohol was taken duly diluted with water,

he had found, by numerous experiments, that the following sequence of pheno-
mena took place":

   1. Upon the heart, probably by the direct contact of the alcohol, and occurring

in 2 to 4 minutes.

   2. Upon the brain, in from 3 to 7 minutes, as shown by the effect upon conscious-

        mental and sensual perceptions.

   3. Upon the spinal cord, as shown by lessened tone, lessened power of controlling

and lessened desire to use the muscles, a sense of purring through the whole

system, and the sensation of heat and cold.

   4. Upon the respiratory nervous tract.
   5. Upon the secretory (sympathetic nervous) system.
   The exhilaration of spirits, accompanied by sense of heat, swelling and redness of
the skin, occurred in the first stage, and continued about 30 minutes, and this was

changed for taciturnity, chilliness, and sense of miserable depression in the second

stage.

Alcohol usually increases the activity of the respiratory actions in a moderate

degree                             as  did  also whisky in many instances,  and  rum  commonly, whilst brandy
                                ;

and gin lessened them.

Beers he believed to act also by their sugar and gluten, and thus tend to pro-

mote the digestion of starchy food ; but for this purpose only small quantities, as
by an ale-glass, should be taken at a time, so as to obtain this action apart from the

alcoholic action.

The author also appended a few remarks on the action of coffee, on account of

its parallel use with tea, and proved that whilst both agree in increasing vital
action, they differ in the important particular of their action upon the skin.

Coffee usually lessens the action of the skin, and thereby renders it dry and hot, at

the same time increasing the action of the heart, and, as a further consequence of

the former, increasing the action of the kidney, or tailing that, inducing diarrhoea.

Hence it is applicable in conditions widely differing from those suited to the

use of tea.

In contrasting tea and coffee with alcohols, the author found only one analogy

with tea, viz. that of beers, since both tend to promote the digestion of starchy

food, and therefore both the teatotallers and the anti-teatotallers may be equally

right. There is no similarity whatever between the action of tea and alcohols ; but
both are in their essential actions opposed, whilst there is an important correspond-
ence in the action of alcohols and coffee. The use of tea in the arctic regions

must be associated with that of alcohols, or the substance having an equivalent

but less perceptible and more enduring action upon the skin, viz. fats, whilst rum

is less injurious to the sailor of all countries than brandy or gin would be, by its

Whenspecial power of increasing the respiratory and other vital actions.              it is

conjoined with milk, it is the most perfect restorative known.

The author did not regard any of these substances as true food, viz. substances

which by their own elements directly nourish the system, but having the special

power of cm-tailing the power of assimilating other food. Hence, although there

may not be "more nutritive matter in a pint of beer than will lie upon a sixpence,"

there is a power whereby other food is made more useful to the system.

         The Physiological Relations of the Colovring Matter of the Bile.

                        By J. L. W. Thudichum, M.D.

   The author having convinced himself by experiment that the ordinary method of
purifying eholochrome (the colouring matter of bile) does not give a uniform
material, has sought for such a reaction as would give the rational composition of
this substance in order to establish its formula by metamorphoses. Such a reaction
he has obtained with nitrous acid, which, when passed in the gaseous state into
water, alcohol, or ether containing eholochrome in suspension in a finely divided
state, decomposes the latter with effervescence due to the evolution of nitrogen.
There remains in the vessel a new acid, viz. cholochromic acid, insoluble in water,
but soluble in alcohol, ether, and chloroform, and very changeable on exposure to
air. It crystallizes in dark-red rhombic octohedra when its solution in chloroform

                                                                                                         10*

is evaporated in a current of hydrogen or coal-gas, and the crystals much resemble
those of hsematoidine. The hsematoidine extracted by Valentiner and Briicke
from gall-stones and ox-bile has some resemblance to this new acid. From the

above reaction it is evident that cholochrome, like the other acids of the bile and like

hippuric acid, leucine and tyrosine, and many other substances connected with the

human economy in health and disease, is an amido-acicl, i. e. an acid in which the

(NHnitrogen is contained in the form of amide  2    this radical replacing one equi-
                                                );

valent of hydrogen in the hypothetical acid, of which the cholochromic is the oxy-

a?id, the radical (N IP) in the amido-acid being replaced by peroxide of hydrogen

(HO2) in the oxyacid.
   With nitric acid, cholochrome yields an amorphous yellow substance, little

soluble in water, nitro-cholochrome, a crystallizable acid easily soluble in alcohol,

perhaps nitrocholic acid ; and a colourless syrupy acid easily soluble in water, and
yielding a crystallized salt with ammonia, perhaps cholesteric acid or ahomologue.
Chlorine transforms the brown matter, cholophaine, into the green cholochloine in

the space of a few minutes. The pi'ocess of Ileintz required several weeks for
effecting the same transformation. The continued influence of chlorine produces

the red cholochromic acid, which exists, however, only for a moment, being trans-
formed into white chlorocholic acid, little soluble in water, more soluble in alcohol.

   These researches have been undertaken by Dr. Thudichum, partly with a view

of ascertaining the pathological process which gives rise to certain casts of the

biliary ducts, previously described by him in the ' British Medical Journal.' He

believes it to resemble the putrefaction of bile in a stoppered bottle. If the process
is acute, it constitutes "biliosity or biliousness;" if more chronic, it gives rise to

casts of the ducts and gall-stones ; if it extend to the liver-cells, it constitutes ma-

lignant jaundice.

   The author further intimates that, since the above reaction with nitrous acid is
now ascertained, the therapeutic effects of nitric and nitro-hydrochloric acids in
various forms of jaundice, which are already recognized hy many practitioners, are
deserving of further investigation and trial. His own experience is in favour of

these remedies.

                  GEOGRAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY.

 Opening Address by the President, Sir Roderick Impey Murchison,
   D.C.L., F.R.S., V.P.R.G.S. % V.P.R.G.S., Director- General of the
    Geological Survey of the United Kingdom.

During the last two years only, the President of each Section of the British Asso-

ciation having usually opened the business of the Meeting by a short address, it fell

to my lot to offer a few words to the Geographers and Ethnologists who were as-

sembled at Leeds in 1858. I there expressed the satisfaction I felt in proposing, at
the Edinburgh Meeting in 1850, the formation of a separate Section for Geography

and Ethnology, to occupy the place left vacant by our Medical Associates who had

seceded to found an Association of their own.
    Until that year Geography had been attached exclusively to the Geological Section,

in which it was almost submerged by the numerous memoirs of my brethren of the

rocks, whilst Ethnology, forming a Sub-Section, with difficulty obtained a proper

place of meeting. Now, however, both these sciences are, [ am happy to say, fully

represented, and I trust that the result of the coming week will show that the sub-
jects to be illustrated will attract so many members to our hall, as will prove that
Geography in its comprehensive sense is as popular in Oxford as it is in the metro-

polis.

   Before I enter upon the consideration of any memoirs which may be laid before
us, let me allude to a few of the subjects of deep interest which have been illustrated

by British Geographers in various parts of the world in the two years which have
elapsed since I had the honour of last presiding over you.

    In Africa, the earlier discoveries of that great traveller Livingstone have been fol-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  149

lowed by other researches of his companions and himself, which, as far as they go,
have completely realized his anticipation of detecting large elevated tracts, truly

 Sanatoria as compared with those swampy and low regions near the coast, which

have impressed too generally on the minds of our countrymen the impossibility of
sustaining a life of exertion in any intertropical region of Africa. The opening out
of the Shire river, that grand affluent of the Zambesi, with the description of its banks
and contiguous lofty terraces and mountains, and the discovery of the healthfulness
of the tract, is most refreshing knowledge, the more so as it is accompanied by the
pleasing notice, that the slave trade is there unknown except by the rare passage of
a gang from other parts. Again, this portion of the country so teems with rich
vegetable products, including cotton, and herds of elephants, as to lead us to hope

that the spirit of profitable barter, which powerfully animates the natives, may lead
to their civilization, and thus prove the best means of eradicating the commerce in
human beings.

   Whilst Livingstone was sailing to make his last venture, and to realize the promise
he had given to his faithful Macololo friends, that he would return to them, and
bring them kind words from the Queen of the people who love the black man, Cap-
tains Burton and Speke were returning from their glorious exploits in a more central
and northern region of South Africa, where they had discovered two great internal
lakes or freshwater seas, each of not less than 300 miles in length.

   I may here notice, to the honour of our Government, and particularly to that of the

present Secretary of Foreign Affairs, that the undaunted Captain Speke, associated
with another officer of the Bengal army, Captain Grant, has received ,£2500 to enable
him to terminate his examination of the great Nyanza Lake, under the equator, and

we have reason to hope that he will find one of the chief feeders of the White Nile

flowing out from its northern extremity, and thus determine the long- sought pro-
blem of the chief source of that classic stream.

    I also trust, that in the last and most arduous portion of his efforts in proceeding
northwards, he will be assisted through the cooperation of Her Majesty's Consul at
Khartum on the Upper Nile in traversing the country immediately to the north of
the equator, where no traveller, ancient or modern, has ever penetrated, and which is
inhabited by wild and barbarous natives. After a residence of sixteen years in that
region, and having made many trading expeditions to the confines of this unknown

region, that bold and experienced man, Consul Petherick, is, I am persuaded, the
only European who can afford real assistance to Captains Speke and Grant ; and

if by their united efforts the true source or sources of the Nile should be discovered,
Britain will have attained a distinction hitherto sought in vain from the days of the

Roman Empire.

    During the week of our meeting, Mr. Petherick will bring before us his project,
which I trust you will support*, either for ascending the Nile to its source or
affording effective assistance to Captain Speke, without which it is much to be feared
that the gallant officer will never be able to traverse the savage tracts which intervene
between the Nyanza Lake and the highest part of the Nile yet visited by any

traveller.

   If we turn to the Polar Circle, we see what individual British energy has been
able to elicit from the frozen North. There, indeed, notwithstanding many a well-

found expedition sent out to ascertain the fate of Franklin, all our efforts as a nation

had failed, when the energy and perseverance of a woman, backed only by a few
zealous and abiding friends, accomplished the glorious end of satisfying herself, and
of proving to her admiring country, that in sacrificing their lives, her heroic husband
and his brave companions had been the first discoverers of the North West Passage.

   For her noble and devoted conduct in having persisted through so many years
to send out expeditions at her own cost, until she at length unravelled the fate of
the ' Erebus' and ' Terror,' the Royal Geographical Society of London has rightly
judged in awarding to Lady Franklin one of its Gold medals, whilst the other has

been appropriately given to that gallant and skilful officer Sir Leopold M'Clintock,

who in the little yacht the ' Fox ' so thoroughly accomplished his arduous mission.
He not only ascertained the death of Franklin, and the subsequent abandonment of

burton and Sir Roderick Murchison,

his ships, but also showed that the great navigator had discovered vast breadths of

Arctic lands and seas which were entirely unknown when he left our shores, and

had even remained so until the truth was revealed by the expedition of the ' Fox.'

The geographer who compares the map of the Arctic regions as laid down by

Parry and others up to the year 1845, when Franklin sailed, and marks on it all that

he is now known to have added in the two brief summers before he was beset, and

then inspects any one of the most recent maps, even up to the year 1858 inclusive,

and traces the discoveries made by M'Clintock and his associates, Hobson, Young,

and Walker, will see what vast additions to geographical knowledge have been made

by the last expedition of Lady Franklin.

Such services are indeed worthy of the highest national reward, and I have, I am

happy to say, reason to know, that a monument in commemoration of the glorious

deeds of Franklin and of his having been the first to discover a North West Passage

will be erected, and also that the officers and crew of the ' Fox' will receive that recom-

pense to which they are so justly entitled at the hands of their admiring countrymen.

Whilst on this subject, I may well express the satisfaction and pride I felt as the

President of this Section, when the officers of the British Association asked us, the

Geographers, to bring forward one of our distinguished men to deliver a lecture

on one of our manifold subjects, before the body of men of Science assembled

at Oxford. As this is the first occasion since our foundation on which geographical

discovery has been considered to be of sufficient scientific importance to occupy the

attention of the whole meeting, I rejoice in the fact, and also in the knowledge that

Captain Sherard Osborn, so well known to us through his charming ' Arctic Stray

Leaves,' and other books, as well as by his laurels won in the Crimea and the Sea

of Azof, is to be the lecturer, and that he who is so experienced an ice-man is to

give us a sketch of the discoveries of Franklin, as laid open by the last researches of

Sir Leopold M'Clintock.

  And here I may well say, that every justice will be done to any subject connected

with the conditions of icy seas, including the proposed submarine telegraph by the

Faroe  Islands,  Iceland and Greenland to  Labrador                                               for never at  any of  our former
                                                                                               ;

meetings have I seen so many explorers met together who have rendered their names

eminent through Arctic and Antarctic discoveries. Under their observation the

paper which is to be brought before us by Captain Parker Snow of the Mei chant

Marine, warmly urging a further search after the missing crews and scientific records

of the 'Erebus' and 'Terror', will be ably scrutinized. The names of Admiral Sir

James Ross, Sir Edward Belcher, Captains Ommaney and Sherard Osborn, when

united with those of Sir J. Richardson and Dr. Rae, are truly guarantees that the

question will have so much light thrown upon it, as will either satisfy the public

that no additional important results as respects the lost expedition can be achieved,

or they will stimulate us to fresh exertions. For, though all the Arctic voyagers

with whom I have conversed are satisfied that there is now no longer the hope, which

I long cherished, of saving a human life, still every man of science must wish that
strenuous efforts should be made to recover, if practicable, some more of the many

scientific records of the lost expedition which may have been left in various places

around the spot where Franklin breathed his last.

In the vast possessions of British North America much additional knowledge has

been gained by the successful explorations of Palliser and his associates, Hector,

Blakiston, and Sullivan, not only as respects the great fertile prairies watered by the

Saskatchewan and its affluents, but also touching the practicability of traversing the

Rocky Mountains within our territories by passes lower than any which exist to

the south of the boundary of the United States.

At this stage of our inquiries it would be very hazardous to speculate on these

passes being rendered available for railroads ; the more so, as the wild region lying to
the west of the Rocky Mountains i. e. between them and those parts of British

-- WeColumbia which are gold-bearing, and are beginning to be inhabited by civilized people
is as yet an unexplored woody region.      may hope, however, that such routes of

communication will be established as will connect the Red River settlements with

the prairies of the Saskatchewan, and these last with the rich auriferous tracts of

British Columbia. And if the most northern lines be found too difficult for railway

communication, through the severity of the climate and physical obstacles, let us
                               --

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  151

hope that by giving and taking ground in an amicable manner with our kinsmen of
the United States, we may be enabled by a more southern railroad to traverse the
prairies on either side of the neutral boundary, and then pass down the river Co-

lumbia to Vancouver Island. By this operation the great Gulf of St. Lawrence and
Hudson's Bay on the east, may eventually be placed in communication with the
noble roadsteads of Vancouver Island and the adjacent mainland on the Pacific. At

all events, Britain will doubtless not be slow in establishing communications between
the Atlantic and Pacific, first by the electric telegraph, next by ordinary roads, and
finally, it is to be hoped, in part at least, by railroads.

   On these subjects we are to be favoured at this Meeting with a paper by Captain

Synge, in addition to the viva voce communications of Captain Palliser and his asso-

ciates.

   Having not as yet had access to many of the papers which are to be communi-
cated to this Section, I can allude to a few more of them only. In a Memoir on the

Geographical Distribution of Plants in Asia Minor and Armenia by my distinguished
friend M. Pierre de TchihatchefF, you will find some remarkable results as flowing

from the long-continued researches of that ardent and successful traveller. After
accounting for the absence of some plants and the profusion of others in given
localities as dependent on climatal conditions (an example of which is, that the grape
there flourishes in one tract at the great height of nearly 6000 feet above the sea),

M. de Tchihatcheff brings out some striking statistical data, showing the vastly

greater abundance and variety of vegetation in Asia Minor compared with that of

any other country. He points out that the plants of five mountains only amount

in number to double the entire quantity of British plants, and concludes with an
eloquent regret that these classic regions, so blessed by the hand of the Creator, and
which in the earlier history of mankind were replete with highly civilized communi-
ties, should now, through misgovernment, be the scene of oppression and barbarity.

   Another distinguished Russian geographer, M. N. Khanikoff, who has explored
large portions of Persia and the adjoining countries, will bring before us his maps

and descriptions of the mountainous tracts of the countries of the southern parts of
Central Asia, where the lofty mountains of Ararat, Demavend, and Savalan form the
chief elevations of the region to which we look as the cradle of our race.

    But, to revert to subjects connected with Britain. In no portion of the surface of
the globe have we made such great and rapid advances as in Australia. Doubtless

much of this progress in settlement and civilization, particularly in Victoria, is due to
the discovery of those enormous masses of gold which are producing far and wide
such powerful effects. But looking to the work of purely geographical pioneers, I can
declare, that some of the most valuable and daring researches from the earliest days

to the present time have been completed, wholly irrespective of profits gained
through the attraction of the precious metal. The great discoveries of Sturt, Eyre,

and Leichhardt were made before the existence of gold was known ; and even now,
when it is the most seductive of baits to entice the traveller, see what vast regions
the brothers Gregory have laid open in Northern, Eastern, and Western Australia

without the recompense of a single yellow nugget. Again, look to South Australia,
where gold is scarcely known, at least in any appreciable quantity, and see what its
inhabitants have done in pushing far into the interior, simply to acquire fresh pas-

ture-lands. In contemplating these recent discoveries, we read with astonishment

of what one individual, Mr. M'Dougall Stewart, has accomplished in so short a time,

and of the privations he underwent to realize the existence of freshwater streams

and oases on the borders of the great interior saline desert.

   Still more were we surprised when we learned that this great continent, the rivers
of which were so long considered to be useless, has had its one mighty stream, the
Murray, rendered navigable for 1800 miles. With its affluents, the Darling and
Murrirabidgee, this river may indeed be said to have been laid open for 2500 miles,
»'. e. between many new towns which have sprung up in the interior and the sea
and all this by the clearing away of the stems and stumps of trees, the result of ages

of decay.

   There are now indeed in England some of the eminent men, whether governors,
statesmen, or explorers of this great colonial region, who will, I hope, before we

adjourn, throw fresh light on these recent discoveries.
--152 REPORT 1860.

   Having presided for several years over the Royal Geographical Society, it has been

my duty to pass in review the progress made by the sons of Britain in different parts

of the world, and it has ever been to me a source of the sincerest gratification to

watch the rapid strides made by the colonists of Australia, and to observe how they

have carried with them all the energy of our race into the land of their adoption.

--If I traced with deep interest the explorations of their boldest travellers through the

bush and witnessed with delight the working out of that golden wealth, of which
perhaps, because I was a Highlander as well as a geologist, I had a sort of second

--sight or if I revelled in seeing their ports filled with ships, and abounding in com-
--merce not all these attributes have rejoiced me more than the knowledge I acquired,

that our Australian colonists are truly and sincerely attached to Britain and their

Sovereign.

  As it is out of my power on the present occasion to advert to all the recent ad-
vances in ethnology, I will now only say, that, besides many communications from
other gentlemen, including Mr. Lockhart's excellent notes on China, my eminent
and valued friend, Mr. John Craufurd, will give us two memoirs; the one, "On the
Relation of the Domesticated Animals to Civilization ;" the other, " On the Aryan,

or Indo-Germanic Theory ;" each of which will, I doubt not, be worthy of the Pre-

sident of the Ethnological Society of London.

    Let me, however, offer a few general observations on those sciences, to the culti-

vation of which the business of this Section is devoted. Geography, regarded only as

the description of the outlines of the earth, and the determination by astronomical

observations of the relative position of hills, rivers, valleys, and coasts, to be laid down
by the topographer on a map, is but the key-stone of that splendid science when
viewed in its most comprehensive bearings. For, of how much real value is it

deprived if not followed in its train by all "the affiliated sciences which relate to the

phenomena of our. mother earth! How infinitely is the important basis of our

science enriched by the descriptions of the animals and plants which, living on the

--surface of our planet, are distinguished by forms peculiar to each region such dis-

tribution being coincident with relative differences of climate!

Again, as a weather-beaten geologist, I know full well, that the science which I

have most cultivated would be void of a foundation if it did not rest on the principles

not in imagination, but by a positive appeal to data registered on tablets of stone,

the former outlines of sea and earth at different successive periods, whilst he marks

the various oscillations of land and water as well as the necessary accompaniments

of grand meteorological changes.

    If therefore the geographer is guided to the relative position of his localities by

the lights of astronomy, he also knows that accurate observation of all terrestrial

changes is of the highest value in enabling his ally the geologist to interpret and

read off the former conditions of the crust of the "earth. Just as geography in its

present phase is necessarily connected with ethnology, so its earliest features as a
science can best be thoroughly comprehended by the geologist. His is the province to

bring to the mind's eye various relations of land and water through the olden periods,

when most of our present continents were formed beneath the sea ; and to trace the

successive elevations and depressions which characterized epochs long anterior to

the existence of man. Even in those lerr.ote times when some lands were elevated
and others depressed, we have ascertained that the waters and the earth were occu-
pied by various animals which successively lived and died to be followed by other and
more highly organized races, until at length a being endowed with reason was created.

   And when, having gone through all the long epochs of geological time, we ap-
proach the period when man appeared, how interesting is it to endeavour to unravel
the changes which our lands underwent from that recent geological dale when the

British Isles formed part of the terra firma of Europe ! Then at a later period, how
inviting is it to mark the signs of the commixture of the rudest and earliest works of
man with the remains of animals, most of which are now extinct, vet mixed up with
others which have lived on to our own day !

   Thus, whilst the geological geographer visits the banks of the Somme, and sees

such an assemblage of relics beneath great accumulations formed bv water (as I have

recently witnessed myself), he is compelled to infer, that at the pe'riod when such a

phenomenon was brought about, the waters which have now diminished to an ordi-

nary small river, rose in great inundations to the height of 100 feet and more above

the present stream, and swept over the slopes of the chalk on which the primeval

inhabitants were fashioning their rude flint instruments--when, as I would suggest,

they might have escaped to the adjacent hills, and saving themselves from the sweep-

ing flood, have left no traces of their bones in the silt, sand, or gravel.

This linking on of geology with human history and the works of primeval art

comes legitimately under our consideration, and here we have just as full right to

mydiscuss and test this question as  dear friends the geologists, the more so as it

was to this connexion between geology and history that Lord Wrottesley has called

the attention of the Association in his Presidential Address.

Then, again, as we descend with the stream of time until we reach historical

records, the geographer next endeavours to throw light on the marches of the great

generals of antiquity and the sites of ancient cities ; and then truly the geologist,

geographer, and ethnologist become united with the antiquary and historian. Taking

our recent British example of the discovery of the Uriconium of the Romans at
Wroxeter in Shropshire--where is the geographer who has looked at the mounds of

earth which till recently covered that ancient city, and is not convinced, that causes

arising from the combined destruction by man and natural decay, have produced the

mass of overlying matter on the shores of the Severn, which has hidden from our

vision one of the famous Roman towns of Britain ?

As I have delighted in tracing the sites of the battles of our great British chief

Caractacus*, and in unravelling the age of those Silurian rocks in which he made

the chief defences of his own kingdom, so I can now bring back to my imagination
how the legions of Ostorius may have been reinforced from that Uriconium, which

has just been disinterred from its earthy covering by the zealous labours of the

enlightened antiquary Wright, now a Secretary of this Section.

   In this manner we see, that as our inquiries necessarily stimulate us on the one

hand to recede to the very earliest traces of man upon the globe, so, on the other,
we are led on into that department of Art and Archaeology which connects the present

with the past, and are thus enabled to offer to the consideration of our associates

--and auditors, subjects of prevailing and universal interest subjects which will, I

doubt not, be handled with redoubled zest, now that we are again happily met

together for the third time in this very ancient seat of learning.

In conclusion. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have now only to congratulate you on the

recent rapid extension of geographical science throughout the enlightened classes of

our countrymen. Brought up with a profound reverence for the works of God, and

a due admiration of the finest efforts of man, those sons of our gracious Sovereign

who are of sufficient age to profit by extensive travel, are already proving, that in

their spirit of adventure they are true Englishmen. The heir to the crown, after

rambles in our Scottish Highlands and travels on the continent, is about to quit this

his Alma Mater, and, to the great joy of our colonists, to visit North America, and

there rivet still more strongly the link which binds the loyal people of those pro-

vinces to the mother country ; whilst Prince Alfred, after cruizing in the Mediter-

ranean, is now sailing across the Southern Atlantic to Bahia, not without having
ascended on his way to the very summit of the Peak of Teneriffe. The willing co-

operation of the last and present President f of the Royal Geographical Society

demonstrates that our nobility are as much alive to the vast importance of our

subject as the middle classes of the community. On my own part, having laboured

zealously in diffusing geographical knowledge among my countrymen, I can truly say
that my gratification is now complete in seeing that this Section is second in popu-

larity and utility to no branch of the British Association.

On the Manufacture of Stone Hatchets and other Imj)le?jients by the Esqui-

Bymaux, illustrated by Native Tools, Arrow-heads, fye.  Captain Sir

E. Belcher, R.N.

   Sir Edward commenced by setting forth his belief in the connexion of the north-
ern littoral tribes of Asia, America, and Greenland in habits, customs, and language,

differing less in this latter point than in our counties in England, Wales, or Scotland.
Comparing the American with the Asiatics, the Tchutchi, he found the latter more

experienced or accomplished in music, manufacturing their own violins, and per-

forming wonderfully, imitating a la Paginini on one string the sounds of various
animals ; they were also good buffoons and actors as imitating the anctics of bears,

&c. But as regards the useful arts, or those calling for invention or energy in over-
coming difficulties, improving tools, weapons, &c, they were much inferior to the
Esquimaux of America, and certainly far below them in mental acquisitions. Sir
Edward then gave an interesting description of the habits and manners of the tribes

with which he lived in contact near Icy Cape. He obtained great influence over
them, and so long as he continued to teach them any new mode of working they
submitted to his direction. He had no doubt, if necessity had compelled him to re-

main there (as he was wrecked there), he might have existed and possibly become one
of their chiefs. This disposition on their part to associate with and be instructed
by white men, confirmed him in the notion he had entertained, that possibly one or

two of the crews of the 'Erebus' and 'Terror' might have escaped and be now
willingly living among them.

   The principal object of the paper was to explain the stone implements found
among them, and similar to those of Celtic origin, as well as their mode of manu-
facturing them from a vein of chert at hand. Sir Edward saw them obtain the
chert from the stratum, work them into spear and arrow-heads, and there purchased
the articles as well as the tools employed which were explained in detail to the Meet-

ing. No hammer or blow is used in splintering off the couchoidal splinters to form

the serrated edges, but a tool of deer antler effects this by pressure on the faces alter-
nately. Sir Edward also observed that the same process is adopted by the Indians
of Mexican origin in California, by the natives of the Sandwich Islands, as well as
Tahiti, 2300 miles asunder. Other curiously wrought and interesting instruments, as
planes, drill bows, &c, were exhibited, all manifesting great skill and a higher degree

--of mechanical ability than we could expect from an untutored race indeed a race

taking the lead pre-eminently in meeting scientifically those wants occurring in savage

life. With reference to their ornamentation of their drill bows, &c, Sir Edward
maintained that they exhibited proofs of record, which Dr. Rae considered to be
wanting in the tribes encountered by him some degrees to the eastward. Steam,
and the mode of using it, to bend or straighten bows or arrows, was constantly em-
ployed by them ; and Sir Edward concluded by expressing his conviction that these
people were in a condition to be rendered useful by civilizatiou, and thus open more
lucrative trade with the western and southern nations in the Pacific.

On the Aryan or Indo-Germanic Theory of Races.

           By John Crawfurd, F.R.S.

The object of the writer of this paper is a refutation of the Aryan or Indo-Germauic

theory, or that which supposes all the peoples from the eastern confines of Bengal

to the western shores of Spain and Britain to be of one and the same race of man, on

Athe evidence of a fancied identity of language.  few of the main objections advanced

by the author may be stated. The theory supposes a people, whose language was the

Sanskrit, to have migrated at some unknown time, spreading east in one direction

and west in another, and to have performed these prodigious migrations, although an

agricultural people, or in other words, one of fixed habits. The theory makes men

who are black like the Hindus, brown like the Russians, and fair like the Scandina-

vians, to be of one and the same race, insisting that the Greeks of Alexander and the

Englishmen of Clive had the same blood in their veins as the Hindus whom a hand-

ful of them vanquished. As to the supposed identity of race from the evidence of

language, the author considered it sufficiently disposed of by the notorious fact that

many of the languages of Hindustan spoken by people asserted to belong to the
Aryan stock, had no fundamental relation to the Sanskrit tongue of the supposed
Aryans. In Europe, the isolated Basque language was evidence to the same effect.

On the Influence of Domestic Animals on the Progress of Civilization (Birds).

                          By John Crawfurd, F.R.S.

   The object of this paper, one of a series on the same subject, was to show the
effect of the domesticated animals in the civilization of man, and was confined to
birds. The author showed that out of the vast variety of the feathered creation, not
above nine or ten species had been domesticated, while there was a wide range in
the quality and amount of the domestication which even this small number had
attained. The origin of a few of the species only could be traced to particular
countries, as the common fowls to India and China, the turkey to Mexico, and the
gallinre to Africa. But he seemed to think that the first domesticated of the greater
number was common to several countries, as the grouse, pigeon, duck, to most
countries of Europe and Asia. The author further showed that the numbers of
birds domesticated by a people might be considered a measure of their relative civili-
zation. Thus savages possessed no domestic bird at all ; barbarians very few, and
the most advanced only the whole number. Thus the savage tribes of America pos-
sessed none at all. The Mexicans possessed but one. The more advanced tribes of
the South Sea had one, the common fowl, while the Australians had none. The
Malayan nations were possessed of two, the common fowl and duck ; the Persians
of these and the pigeon, and Hindus of the last three with the peacock ; and the
Chinese of five, the common fowl, the goose, the pigeon, and two species of pheasant.
It is the more civilized nations of Europe alone that possess the entire number.

                      On a Set of Belief Models of the Alps, tyc.

               By Captain Cybulz, Imperial Austrian Artillery.

   The author desires to introduce to the notice of this Meeting a set of models, in-
tended to facilitate instruction in the manner of delineating the features of the ground
on topographical maps, and lately introduced into the technical schools of Austria.
It is the first aim of the author to lead the pupil, by means of these models, to a
correct understanding or appreciation of form, as the only way of producing a first-
rate topographical draftsman. Instead, therefore, of setting him to imitate drawings
from paper, his studies and copies will be made from models, and, at a more advanced
stage, from nature itself. These models represent, first, inclined planes or slopes,
separate, in combination, or intersecting each other. It is from these the pupil acquires
the first idea of the principle upon which depends a correct delineation of the ground.
Secondly, we have three models which represent the most characteristic and most
widely distributed features of the ground. Having acquired from the preceding a
thorough knowledge of fundamental principles, the pupil will proceed to delineate
upon paper the following models. These represent, first, an undulating country
secondly, a plateau formation, with deeply-cut valleys ; thirdly and fourthly, some
mountainous tracts. Contour lines have been laid down upon the whole of these
models with mathematical accuracy. The horizontal projection of some of the most
difficult sections has also been added, to illustrate the manner of filling up the con-
    --                                                                                                  --REPORT 1860.

tour lines and laying down auxiliary contours. It has not, however, been thought

advisable to do more, as otherwise the pupils would avail themselves of these facilities

Ato too great an extent.                                                                            small instrument for measuring the gradients, and a scale

showing the intensity of the shading (hachorres) for various degrees of acclivity, are

to be made use of in copying the models. The author believes that the use of

models, judiciously selected, will engage the pupil's uninterrupted attention ; he will
overcome mechanical difficulties with greater facility, and will not be so wearied as

by the tedious, but abortive, and, in reality, useless attempts to copy a topographical

drawing placed before him. The author would add, that his models have been made

of galvanoplastic copper, and are therefore not so liable to breakage as plaster-of-

Paris models.

        On certain Ethnological Boulders and their probable Origin.

                      By the Rev. Emv. Hincks, D.D.

The author began by observing that, if a geologist weie to see a mass of stone

lying in a place where all the rocks around were of a totally different character, he

would not be satisfied till he had accounted for its being there ; till he had found

whence it came, and at what period, and by what agency it was brought. He be-

lieved that like inquiries should be made, and might be answered, respecting ethno-

logical boulders                                                                          by which  he  understood  words  occurring  in writings of remote
                                                                                       ;

antiquity, which were of a totally different character from the words of which the

writings were mainly composed. He believed that it would be possible, by help of

these boulders, to trace the people to whose language the words belonged, along the

line by which they must have travelled, forward to the point where their migration

terminated, and backward to that where it must have commenced. In the pre-

sent paper he proposed to do this in a particular case, the discussion of which

was peculiarly appropriate to the present meeting, as it related to that language, a

proficiency in which was the acknowledged glory of Oxford.

The language of the Assyrian inscriptions is of the family called Semitic, that is,

of the same family with Hebrew ; and by the way it resembles this language in some

important particulars, such as having a Niphhal conjugation, more closely than it does

any other known language of that family. It is remarkable also that the copious

inscriptions which exist in this language were all written between the writing of the

earliest and the writing of the latest books of the Old Testament ; so that it would

seem that no language could be expected to clear up what is obscure in these books

so well as the Assyrian.

   In these Semitic inscriptions, however, numerous words are to be met with which
are evidently not Semitic. One class of such words was pointed out several years ago
by Sir Henry Rawlinson. They belonged to the language of Chaldea or Arcad, which
was spoken to the south of Assyria, and which he pronounced to be an Hamitic

language, akin to the Egyptian.

   In a paper read at the Dublin Meeting of the British Association in 1857, of which
a copious abstract is given, pp. 134-143 of the Report, Dr. Hincks took a very
different view of the matter. lie maintained that thisAccadian language represented

a sister language to that which is the common parent of all the Indo-European lan-
guages ; the common parent of these two, which he called the Japhetic language,
being a sister to the Egyptian language and to the common parent of all the Semitic
languages. He now affirmed that the views contained in that paper (with which he

must, for brevity, assume that his hearers were acquainted) were fully confirmed by
his subsequent researches, and that he had met with nothing inconsistent with

them. The linguistic pedigree there laid down was so fully established by induction
from a number of verbal pedigrees that it needed no further confirmation. Still,

comparisons of Indo-European words with words of one of the languages above
named, which was not Indo-European, would be found useful, and that in three
ways :

1. Such a comparison might establish the fact of a word having been in use in the
                     TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                          157

original family from which the Indo-European races have sprung. This fact may be

inferred from the word being used by remote subfamilies ; but its being used by two
subfamilies (or even by a single one), and being also found in one of the languages

that are cognate to the original Indo-European, but not derived from it, is still
stronger evidence. Thus the word horse, which is peculiar to the Teutonic family, but
which is cognate to the Latin enrro, " I go like a horse, i. e. I run," is shown to
have been in use in the original Indo-European family from its evident connexion
with the Accadian kurra. The original Indo-European root must have been kurs.

2. Such a comparison may determine the original form of an Indo-European root,

which varies in the  different  languages  known to us                                                                           as it may also  determine  the
                                                                                                                              ;

original Semitic form. For example, in p. Ul, Report for 1857, the facts that the

original Indo-European form of the second numeral was ihwi and the original Semitic

form thni, could only be established by a comparison of the different forms known to

exist with the Accadian mi, as explained in that paper. In treating of the words for

"lion," No. 14, he was ignorant that the Assyrian word was libbii. Comparing

this with the Accadian lig, he now thinks that the Semitic form must have been ligb,

and that this was also the Japhetic form. The Indo-European root would be ligw.

In Latin this would be declined lix, livis ; and, as (s)nix, (s)nivis gives snow in

English, and snig, sneg in the Letto-Sclavonian languages, so liiwe in modern and

lew in older German correspond to lix; and lig might be the ancient Letto-Sclavo-

nian root, equivalent to these.

   3. An etymological relation between Indo-European words may possibly be
established if both can be shown to correspond to the same word in a language

which is not Indo-European. Thus, the relation between yXuxuj and ykao-cra is not

generally admitted by Greek lexicographers ; though if the words be written as they
would be in the Cadmean alphabet (see p. 142 of the former paper), yXotc-Fes and

ykoK-ia, the resemblance is easily seen. But this relationship is established when
we find that ghlu is used in Egyptian both for " sweet " and for " tongue." The

Latin dulcis, originally dlucvis, is cognate to these.

   Enough, however, on the subject of the Accadian words occurring in the Assyrian

inscriptions. They present no ethnological difficulty, as the people who spoke the

language to which they belonged lived close to Assyria. The case is the same with

the Semitic words which occur in the Egyptian inscriptions. He pointed out one in
1845 rDDID " a chariot ; " used also for " chariots "; the Egyptians not generally

                              ;

expressing the vowels, and thus writing the terminations eth and 6th alike. Mr.
Birch has since found another meaning, " round bucklers," which appears to be the

Arabic .x& JLc. These are Canaanitish words, expressing objects brought from

Canaan.
   There were words, however, in the Assyrian inscriptions which Dr. Hincks be-

lieved to be Indo-European; and as no Indo-European people had been hitherto

recognized as existing on the west of Assyria, their existence presents an ethnolo-

gical difficulty which the author seeks to explain in this paper.
   The words in question were ligwindinas and lasanan. The former occurs on a

great slab or altar in the north-west palace at Nimrud (B. M. Series, pi. 44, 1. 17).
Every other word in the sentence is of known signification. " L. alive I took cap-
tive." From the context it must necessarily be the name of an animal, in the plural
number (being joined to a plural adjective) and in the accusative case (being governed
by a transitive verb). Every one who has the slightest knowledge of the grammar
of the Semitic languages must see that ligwindinas cannot be a Semitic accusative
plural ; and every one that knows anything of the grammar of the Indo-European

languages must see that it is a regularly formed Indo-European accusative plural.
Taking it as Sanskrit or Zend, the nominative singular would be ligwindi; taking
it as Greek, it would be ligwindis or ligwindin. Whatever be the particular language
to which it belongs, and whatever be the meaning, its being Indo-European ought
not to be questioned. The other word, lasanan, has puzzled the interpreters of the
Assyrian inscriptions as much as any other word. It occurs in several contexts :
'* king lasanan " after " king of Assyria " on Bellino's cylinder, 1.1; " ruler of the
tribes lasanan," on the Tiglath Pileser cylinder (I. 29), " wielder of the sceptre lasa~
nan," same cylinder (VI. 56). "Assur the great lord has mademetoyossMs (? yusad-

Olimanni ; the first radical may be T, or D) the kingdom lasanan," Bellino's cylinder,
--158 REPORT 1860.

I. 4. la all these contexts, a genitive of the name of a people who were not Assy-
rian seems required. Yet Uhanan is an impossible form for a Semitic genitive. The

word ]\D?, "a language, i. e. a people speaking a language," suggests itself at once;

but its genitive plural would be luandti. The idea that Uhanan should be resolved

into two words, the first being Id, the negative particle, suggested itself also ; but to

this also there were insuperable objections. Sanan is, no doubt, the theme of an

adjective                                          but when joined to a noun it must have a case ending.                         In the first con-
                                                ;

text the rules of grammar would require sannu, in the second sanndti, in the third

sanaiti euph. for sananti. In the fourth sarrut is in construction, and would require

a genitive after it, and not an adjective. The same might be said of kissat in the second
context. Besides, Id sanan would mean " not fighting," and would be the very last
title that a king of Assyria would apply to himself. The translation " unchanging,"
which has been suggested, would require Id sanah, in place of Id sanan, if the case

ending were to be omitted, which, however, it could not be. Whether, therefore,

Idsanan be regarded as one Assyrian word or as two, it presents insuperable diffi-

culties. These, however, disappear at once if it be considered as an Indo-European
word. It has all the appearance of an Indo-European genitive plural from a nomi-

native Idsas; and such a word is just what will suit all the contexts. Accordingly,

the recognition of ligivindinas as Indo-European led immediately to the recognition

of Idsanan as so too.

   The next question to be considered is to what country the Indo-European people
who used these words belonged.

The account of the hunting expedition in which the Assyrian king took the lig-

windinas is preceded by that of his receiving tribute from the people on the coast of

Syria, beginning with the Tynans and ending with the Arvadites. This renders it
probable that his hunting was on the west of Assyria; and indeed he states in the
Pavement Inscriptions that he hunted on the banks of the Euphrates. Again, if the

word Idsanan signified a people, other than the Assyrians, over whom Tiglath Pileser

acquired dominion, they must have been to the west or north of Assyria ; for he

mentions no                                        conquests  towards  the south                                                 and we know from the  inscription of
                                                                                                                              ;

Sennacherib at Bavian that he was defeated by his southern neighbours, his capital

taken, and his gods carried off by them. He could have had no dominion over the

Medians, or any neighbouring people that have been hitherto supposed to be Indo-

European.

This, leads to the inquiry whether the Egyptian or Assyrian inscriptions afford any

grounds for the supposition that an Indo-European population was located in Syria.

Fifteen years ago Dr. Hincks pronounced certain names published by Champollion

as those of the chiefs of the Khita, to be Indo-European. Four names terminating

with siro, as Champollion read the characters, were published by him, the former

part of the first name, which was that of the chief of the nation, being Khita, the
name of the nation. Dr. Hincks affirmed in 1845 that this name must be Indo-

European, and must mean " lord of Khita." He read the latter part of the name
swar, connecting it with Kvpios. M. de Rouge adopted this interpretation of the

name, but said that the second element in it was the Semitic sar ; to which it was

replied that no Semitic compound could be formed as M. de Rouge supposed.
" Lord of Khita" would be Sar-Khitti, not Khita-sar, according to the mode of

arrangement of the elements of a compound name adopted by all Semitic people.
   From the fact of these names being Indo-European, Dr. Hincks at first inferred that

the enemies of Rameses II. were Scythians, as Champollion had supposed ; but it
was subsequently proved that they lived within a short distance of Egypt ; and their

capital Kadish, formerly read Atisli, was identified with a place on the Orontes,

south of Emessa. They were, in short, the Khattaya of the Assyrian inscriptions,

and the Hittites of the Old Testament ; and their religion, as shown by the Egyptian

inscriptions, was clearly Canaanitish. How then could they have Indo-European

names ?

   Conceiving it to be certain that some of their chiefs had such names in the time of
Rameses II., Dr. Hincks reconciled this fact with the other by supposing that Indo-

Europeans had previously overrun their country, and acquired dominion over it;

but that they had adopted the religion and probably the language of the conquered

people                            at any rate they had        failed to impose upon them their own                               language,             The
                               ;

Khita had chiefs with Indo-European names, and doubtless of Indo-European race;

just as the English in the twelfth century had Norman chiefs with Norman names;

but the great body of the people had in both instances remained unchanged.

There was thus evidence that a body of Indo-Europeans had conquered the coun-

try north of Mount Lebanon before the reign of Rameses II. ; and on the other

hand, there was evidence that at the marriage of Amenholp III. the Egyptian empire

extended to Naharina or Mesopotamia. During this interval a peculiar form of

sun-worship was introduced into Egypt, and obtained a temporary superiority. That

this worship was of Aryan origin and that its introduction synchronized with the loss

of the foreign conquests of the Egyptians, are generally admitted by Egyptologists.

The middle of the reign of Amenholp III. must therefore have been about the time

when the Indo-European invasion in question took place ; i. e. according to Lepsius,

1506 b.c.                                               according to Bunsen,  1468;  according to Dr.  Hincks, about 1390.
                                                     ;

Of the four proper names of Hittite chiefs which, according to Champollion,

ended in siro, three are supposed by Dr. Hincks to signify lords of different people

the fourth (Sopa-siro of Champollion) he reads Asp- iswar, "lord of the horse." This

reading (which, as well as the worship of the sun which these Indo-Europeans prac-

tised, suggests their close connexion with Persia) is confirmed by the name of Kus-
taspi, king of Kummukh, or Commagene, who, along with Razin of Damascus

and Minikhimi of Samaria, paid homage to Tiglath Pileser II. It would appear

that this Indo-European immigration took deeper root in uorthern than it did in

southern Syria. The name Kustaspi is evidently a compound, signifying, like that
of the father of Darius, " having .... horses ;" the meaning of the participle wista

or kusta being uncertain. In Sanskrit and Zend such compounds require no suffix

at the end. Assuming that kusta signified "chosen," kustaspa gen. kustaspahyd
would signify " having a chosen horse, or chosen horses." Here, however, a suffix

is added. The name is kustaspi, which would have for its genitive kustaspinas. This

marked difference is an argument for the diversity of the Indo-Europeans of Syria

from the Persians, though they resembled them in their sun-worship and in using aspa

for "horse." Another argument to the same effect is derived from the impossibility

of a Persian population making an incursion into Syria. Not only is the Semitic

population of Assyria interposed, but either Media or Elymais would have to be

·traversed, in the latter of which the language was of a totally different character

from any Indo-European one ; while in the former a dialect of Persian was used, in
which we know that aspa did not signify " a horse." In the Behistun inscription,

which was in this dialect, "horse" is expressed by asma, instead of by aspa, as at

Persepolis. See lines 86, 87 of the first column, where dasha and asma (in pure

Persian dasti and asjm) are translated in the Scythic, or rather Elymean version,

published by Mr. N orris, by the well-known Accadian words habba and kurra,

which are constantly used in the Assyrian inscriptions for "elephants" and "horses."

AThe true translation of the passage is this : " I divided the army.                                   part I made to

be carried by elephants. The other part I made to swim with the horses."

These considerations lead to the conclusion that the Indo-Europeans in Syria did

not come from Persia; but that the Persians and they formed part of the same body

of immigrants, which divided into two bodies inArmenia or the neighbouring country.

The next thing to be considered is the evidence which may exist of such a people

having been settled in northern Syria and the country to the north of it.

This evidence consists of proper names of men preserved in the Assyrian inscrip-

tions, which appear to be Indo-European compounds ; and of names of districts

which end in a sibilant which disappears when the word is inflected, and which

must therefore be the sign of the Indo-European nominative singular ; also of names

of districts in the genitive singular, which also terminates in s.

  A series of proper names of princes which all terminate alike is found in the Tiglath

Pileser cylinder ; namely, Kaliardiru, Kiliantiru, and Sadiantiru. The fact of the

latter parts of the three names being the same, is strong presumptive evidence that
those names are Indo-European. To determine their respective meanings is, how-

ever, the part of philology and not of ethnology. The name Kashkash, which oc-

curs in the Sallier Papyrus No. 3, as that of a country in alliance with the Khita, is
manifestly the Kaskaya of the Assyrian inscriptions ; and the Muskaya of these last,
the ~|'\i;D of the Hebrew Scriptures, is the Mushush of the Egyptian inscriptions, or,

as it should rather be written, the Muskusk ; for in ancient times the Egyptians, like
                                                                                                                                "

the Assyrians, had no SH. They expressed that sound in foreign words by their
double letter SK. In both these instances the final sibilant, which is preserved in
the Egyptian, disappears in the Assyrian gentile adjective. In the name of Carche-

nish (Gargamusk of the Assyrian and Egyptian inscriptions) the case ending is pre-
served in Hebrew, Assyrian, and Egyptian. In Tarshish. it is preserved in Hebrew,
but lost in Egyptian. This name has not been met with in the Assyrian inscrip-
tions ; but the Greek form Taptr-os shows that the second sibilant in the Hebrew word
is a case ending. In the Tiglath-Pileser inscription names of districts are always
expressed in the genitive, the character signifying " country" which precedes them,

being to be read as a noun in construction, mat. Some of these genitives are Assy-

rian, as Kummukhi, " (the land of) Kummukh;" but others are to all appearance
Indo-European, as Ligrakhinas, Ammaus, Adaus, Skaraus. These last three have

a strong resemblance to the genitives of the Persian nouns in ush, such as Margaush,

Babilaush. The au was pronounced as two syllables.

   The next point investigated was the interpretation of the words of this language,

ligwindintis and lasanan, and their connexion with like words in other languages.

The former word was supposed to be equivalent to Xtovroei&els, and the latter to
\aS)v. It was observed that Xeaiv was a secondary word for " lion," the participle of
a verb, which was itself derived from the primitive word Wis, originally Xe/s. The
words first introduced were nouns, from which verbs were derived. Thus mus,
mouse, expressed the idea to which the name was first assigned. It had been stated,
and assigned as a reason why the Sanskrit language ought to be acknowledged as
the parent of the European languages, that Sanskrit was the only language in which
the verb "to steal," from which mouse, "the stealer," was derived, was known to
exist. It is very true that the Sanskrit noun signifying " a mouse " was derived

from a Sanskrit verb signifying "to steal;" but this verb was itself derived from

a primary noun signifying "a mouse," which was preserved in Greek, Latin, and
Teutonic, though unknown in Sanskrit. As in English we say "to ape a person,"
meaning " to do to him what an ape does," *. e. " to imitate him ;" so we might

say "to mouse a thing," meaning " to do to it what a mouse does," i. e. "to steal
it." In Wilson's Sanskrit dictionary four different forms of the verb " he mouses it

are given ; but the root, the primary noun mus, is not to be found in the language
at all. So much for this argument in favour of the antiquity of Sanskrit, as com-
pared with the European languages cognate to it ! Whatever weight it has is in the

opposite direction.

Using the primary for the secondary Greek word for " lion," and the uncontracted

form, we should have \wei8eas. In the Cadmean alphabet, in which i was only

used as a semivowel, this would be  written  \efoFeibeas                                                       and the word     preserved in
                                                                                                            ;

the Assyrian inscriptions, if expressed in the same alphabet, would be XeyfevSevas.

The other word lasanan, expressed in this alphabet, would be Xacrovov, or at least

might be so rendered ; for, as long a expressed the sound of a in fall or in father,

the corresponding short a might have the sound of o in folly (which would be ex-

pressed by o) as well as that of a in fat. So the Assyrian Aranta became 'Opovrrjs

--in Greek. In this same Cadmean alphabet, \aa>v would be \ao-6ov : the <r being here
" KifibrjXov," or deceptive ;  written, but  not  pronounced                                                        as  it was  so late as the
                                                                                                                 ;

time of Pindar.

   The dropping of the sibilant between two vowels being admitted to have taken
place in a great number of instances (if not in every instance where it was originally
unaccompanied by a consonant or semivowel) by all Greek grammarians ; and the
cov of the genitive plural being also admitted by Bopp and others to have been
originally avov and then oov (as M e 'TM was originally /iWfoi/a and then fj.ei(oa), there
is no difficulty whatever in deriving the second Greek word in classical use from that
preserved in the Assyrian inscriptions. The former of the two words, however,

requires some remarks.
   In the first place, it is not generally admitted that -eas, from a nom. sing, -tjs, has

sprung from evas. It is commonly supposed to be from etrns. The point suggested

not altogether correct. It is admitted that a compound adjective in -tjs, the latter
element of which is a noun in -oy -eos, such as hva-jxev^s, Si-en;?, would have originally

formed its genitive in ·e<ros. Such a word would correspond to a Sanskrit noun in

ds, as dur-mands. But the question now raised is whether there may not be com-

pounds, the last element of which is a verbal root, or a primary noun from which

this is derived, to which the suffix in was attached as implying possession ; and
whether the in of such compounds has not become in the nominative -779, -es ; so that
these adjectival terminations are in some instances the equivalents of the Sanskrit

adjectival terminations i, i. This is supposed by Dr. Hincks to have been the case

in such instances as p.v\o-ei5-i)s, d-Aijd-ijj, Tpi-rjp(ecr)-rjs, &c. ; the roots being id
(Pe8), \a8 and (pes. The original form of the suffix implying possession he supposed

to be ith, which was liable to pass both into is and into in. Thus, in the first person

plural of active verbs the original form meth, written -p.er, -p.eS (retained in the pas-

sive, where we have in classical Grsek -p.eda), became p,eu and dialectically pes. It is

this th, written in the old alphabet r or 8, which is so apt to be dropped between

vowels, and at the end of a word, and which in the latter position, if not dropped,
must be changed into a or v. In reality, the root which is above written ep(s was

epe8, ereth.

   The addition of the suffix in, implying possession, to a compound, is unusual in
Sanskrit; but instances may be produced. One is, according to Bopp, dmndya-sdr-

in, In Lithuanian, however, a suffix is generally added to the compound. It ap-

pears in the present languages as i, which Bopp supposes to have been ia, but which
may have been originally in, The usual form of a Lithuanian compound is did-burn-is,

rot-pon-is, tri-kamp-is ; na-baga-s, without the suffix, is spoken of by Bopp as

exceptional.

This is one reason for supposing that ths language to which these words belong

was of Lithuanian origin. The suffix in, which appears not only in ligwindinas, but

in the proper names nora. Kustaspi, gen. Liyrukhinas, may be connected with the

Lithuanian is and the Greek >;?, but is abhorrent to the genius of both the Sanskrit
and Zend languages.

The difference between Pev8 aud PeiS seems also to require some observations.

The root is Pe8                                                                                        and according to the custom of the Indo-European languages, and
                                                                                                    ;

especially of the eastern family, or families of them, a nasal may be introduced

between a short vowel and the consonant which follows it. The Greek et and of
were in the old Cadmean alphabet the representatives of the long vowels i and u.

They are equivalent to iy and uw, 1 and P being in that alphabet semivowels ; and

these long vowels were substituted for e and o followed by a nasal, when that nasal
was omitted. It is worthy of notice, however, that in the inscription on a broken
obelisk in the British Museum, in the first column, where the king enumerates the

animals that he had taken or killed, or rather designed to do so (blanks for the

number being left before each name of an animal, which were never filled up), men-

tion is made in the twenty-third line of "                                                                                     Ugwidiui " followed by the plural sign.

The omission of the nasal in the word, as here written, shows that it was not essen-

tial. The plural sign after ni is here substituted for the Indo-European termination

nas.   Possibly  Ugwidiui                                                                              is  intended  for  the  nominative  singular  feminine                                            or  it  may
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

be the nominative ligwidi with the Assyrian termination of the accusative plural.

The word wida is used in Old Prussian for "likeness;" sta-wida and ka-ioida

representing the Latin talis and qualis. This is another indication of a connexion

between the languages to which these words belong, and the old Lithuanian.

  A third indication of this is derived from the name Idsanan. As used in the

Assyrian inscriptions, it denoted the Indo-European tribes on the west of Assyria ;

those who called themselves by this name. Exactly in the same way, the Egyptians

applied the name \2>V to the Semitic tribes in whose language this word signified

Now" the peoples."                                                                                     this  word  Idsanan     was  originally  l&ihanan                                            and  while   its

stern is the same as that of the name of the Lithuanian people, it has other affinities,

which are very remarkable. The Lydians, AuSoi, were evidently a branch of the

same people ; notwithstanding the mythic derivation of their name given by Hero-

dotus. But their identity with the Lutan or Ludan of the Egyptian inscriptions is

equally certain, and still more important, as it shows us that for a considerable time

before they pushed their conquests to the neighbourhood of Egypt (viz. to Mount
Lebanon), they had been waning against them on their northern frontier, when

their empire extended to Mesopotamia.

The termination of this name requires some remarks. It may be the Semitic-

plural ending, which the Egyptians borrowed from those tribes which intervened

between them and these Ludan; or it may be the accusative plural of the Indo-

European name. It may be well, however, to compare it with the termination of

another proper name, which occurs in the Sallier Papyrus No. 3, and which appears

Ato refer to the very same people.  name is found there, which Champollion read

Iwan and took for the Ionians. It has since been ascertained that the character

which Champollion read i has for its value ari or iri. The name therefore is Arlwan,

the Aryans or noble people, a title which the Indian and Persian branches of this

people which descended from the north applied to themselves, and which (it would

seem) the Syrian branch of the same people also used. The an at the end of these

two names is probably the same element ; and the fact of its being preceded by w,
when not preceded by a consonant, suggests a third explanation of it. It may be the

suffix which appears in rdjan (nom. raja), haipwv, latron (nom. latro) and ahman

(nom. ahmd), which suffix was probably the theme of the first numeral, denoting a

noun of unity. Thus Arhoan would be 'Aplav, or 'lpicov, from the latter of which it

is just possible iha.t"la>v may be derived.

Whatever may be thought of this last derivation, it seems clear that the Indo-

European glosses, found in the Assyrian inscriptions, are in the language of a people

which had separated, some centuries before the date of the earliest Assyrian inscrip-

tion, from the Aryans of Persia, and which had probably accompanied these in their

migration from the northern region which they originally inhabited ; and that while

a portion of these western Aryans remained in Syria and the adjacent countries, the

main body of them proceeded westward through Asia Minor and across the Bospho-

rus or Hellespont, forming the Hellenic or Ionic people of the Greeks ; which mingled

with the Pelasgians (a more ancient Indo-European race akin to the Italian tribes),

and by their union formed the different dialects of Greek with which we are acquainted.

It is probable, but not so certain, that the language of the people from whom all these

Aryan tribes were derived, was Lithuanian in its oldest form.

   The different species of the tree which yields the bark known in commerce as
Peruvian bark, and from which the sulphate of quinine is obtained, grow on the
slopes of the Andes, at a height which varies according to the latitude and the topo-

graphical situation of the mountains where this precious vegetable production has

been found. In New Grenada it grows on the central branch of the Cordillera,

which extends from the province of Paito, and separates the two valleys of the Cauca
and Magdalena, being most abundant in the districts of Pitayo and Almaguer. It is
also found on the mountains above Finagamga, near Bogota. The Pitayo bark has
been the richest in quinine ; and as in that locality the cuttings have been carried on

to the greatest extent, the article is nearly exhausted. The same may be said of the

Finagamga variety, which, although not so rich as the Pitayo, is prized on account
of its being of easier labour. The Almaguer bark, which at first was hardly saleable,

is now used to a great extent in Philadelphia and London, on account of the scarcity
of the two former species. The best bark is found on the Pitayo mountain, at a
height of from 8000 to 1 1,000 feet above the level of the sea. The tree grows among

the numerous species of Alpine vegetation which cover those mountains with thick
forests, either in clusters or scattered about. For that reason it varies in size. Like

all trees of a cold climate, it is of slow growth, and requires a great many years to

arrive at a good height. Some of them have been found so large as to yield forty
arrobas of green bark, which, when dried up, is reduced to about a third of its
weight. Others only produce about ten arrobas. As this tree is chiefly found in
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.            163

 wild, cold, uninhabited mountains, constant!)' covered by clouds, there has been no

system in cutting, nor any study made to ascertain how long a spot should be left at
rest before undertaking new cuttings. It is known that the roots produce a great
many shoots after a tree is cut down, and that these require about fifty years to be-
come of a middling size. Young trees are also found growing from seeds. The

nature of the soil seems to determine the qualities of the alkalies contained in the

bark, quinine being most abundant in Pitayo, and cinchonine in Almaguer. But
rocky mountains and ravines are the spots where nature has placed this vegetable
species. The author is not aware that any bark trees have been found on the western
Cordillera, which separates the valley of Cauca from the Pacific coast, which ridge
never attains the elevation of perpetual snow in those latitudes. It only remains to

state, that the price of good sound Pitayo bark, which had gone down in London to
Is. 8d. per pound, is now as high as 2s. 6d., and some very inferior lots have been
sold at 3s. The Almaguer sort, which was entirely neglected two years ago, is now

accepted by manufacturers at from Is. to Is. \d. per pound. No mention is made

of the Bolivian bark, the most esteemed in commerce, as the author is not personally

acquainted with that trade.

On the Jaczioings, a Population of the Thirteenth Century, on the Frontiers

      of Prussia and Lithuania. By R. G. Latham, M.D., F.R.S.

In the middle of the thirteenth century, the Jaczwings were a powerful nation,

between the Vistula, the Niemen, and the Upper Dnieper. At the present moment,

a small population, called by the neighbouring Lithuanians Jodwezhai, and distin-

guished by a dark complexion and certain peculiarities of dress and manners, is the

Achief representative of the name.  few localities-- (1) Jatvis Pol=Jaczving Land,

(2) Jatvis Stara=Old Jatvis, (3) Jatvis Nova= New Jatvis, (4) MogiM-Jadzhvin-

gowski=Jaczving Graves, and (5, 6, 7) three villages named Jatvesk, complete the

fragments. The name, having come to us through Latin, Polish, German, Bohemian,

and Russian mediums, is hardly twice spelt alike, e. g. we have Jazuingi, Jasaingi,

Jacuingi, Jacwingi, Jaczwingi, Jatwingi in the German and Polish ; Jatvyagi, Jatviazhi,

Jatviezie, &c, in the Russian. To these add Getwezeu, Getuinzette, and even Getce.

In speculating upon the ethnological affinities and the former extension of these

tribes, in the direction of both the Gothini and the Gothones of the classical writers,

this multiplicity of variations must be borne in mind. In respect to the immediate

affinities of the nation at the particular time under notice, the evidence is very decided

to their being members of the same family, and to their speaking the same language

with the Prussians (i. e. the occupants of East Prussia before the German Conquest),

the Lithuanians, the Samogitians, and the Letts. Their locality supports these

statements, as do the few words which have come to us from their language. Whe-

ther they were equally Lithuanic in blood, is another question. The few, but im-

portant details of their history derive their interest (as do those of the Lithuanic

family altogether) from the peculiar character of the great religious contest which

they represent. With the Greek Christianity of Russia on the east, and the Papal

influences on the west, Lithuania and Finland were not only the last strongholds of

Paganism, but were acted upon as such in two directions. The resistance, however,

of the Lithuanians was most obstinate ; and the most obstinate of the Lithuanians

were the Jaczwings. Their annihilation, too, was most complete. In 1264, a

great battle broke their power. In the fifteenth century not even the name of the

Jaczwings remained. A more moderate notice simply says that the name of the Jacz-

wings was very rare and known to few. Conjointly with the special details of the
Jaczwings themselves, those of the populations with which they came in contact

--should be studied those of Russia and Poland, cut up into duchies; of Gallicia, a

powerful principality ; of Lithuania, a kingdom under Mindov, vacillating both in
creed and politics; of North-Eastern Germany under the Knights of the Teutonic
order; and, finally, of Volhynia occupied byComanian Turks, and partly overrun by
Mongols. Details, however, of this kind are beyond the pale of the present notice,
which is chiefly made for the sake of drawing attention to the history of a nation

--the pre-eminently Pagan nation of Europe once powerful, but now fragmentary,

the blood of which must still be found in more than one district where the language

is German, Lithuanic, Polish, or Russian.

                 On the latest Discoveries in South-Central Africa.

                            By Dr. D. Livingstone.

   The following letter from Dr. Livingstone was read to the Section :

                                                                                                      River Shire, Nov. 4, 1859.

   The River Shire has its source in the green waters of the great Lake Nyassa (lat.
14° 23' S., long. 35° 30' E.). It flows serenely on in a southerly direction, a fine
navigable stream, from 80 to 120 yards in breadth, expanding some 12 or 15 miles
from Nyassa into a beautiful lakelet, with a well-defined water horizon, and perhaps
5 or 6 miles wide ; then narrowing again, it moves quietly on about 40 miles, till it
reaches Murchison's Cataracts. After a turbulent course of 30 miles, it emerges
from the cataracts a peaceful river capable of carrying a large steamer through the
remaining 112 miles of its deep channel, and joins the Zambesi in lat. 17° 47' S.,
100 miles from the confluence of that river with the sea. The valley through which
the Shire flows is from 10 to 12 miles broad at the southern extremity of Lake
Nyassa, but soon stretches out to 20 or 30 miles, and is bounded all the way on
both sides by ranges of hills, the eastern range being remarkably lofty. At Chihisas
(lat. 16° 2' 3'' S., 35° 1' E.), a few miles below the cataracts, the range of hills on the
left bank of the Shire is not above 3 miles from the river, while the other range has
receded out of sight. If from Chihisas we proceed in a north- easterly path, a three
hours' march places us on an elevation of upwards of 1000 feet. This is not far
from the level of the Upper Shire valley (1200 feet), and appears to be its prolonga-
tion. Four hours' additional travel, and we reach another plateau, 1000 feet higher,
and in a few hours more the highest plateau, 3000 feet above the level of the sea, is
attained, arid we are on an extensive table-laud, which, in these three distinct divi-
sions, extends to Zomba (lat. of southern end 15° 21' S.). It is then broken ; and
natives report that, north of Zomba, which is 20 miles in length from north to south,
there is but a narrow partition between Lakes Nyassa and Tamandua (Shirwa).
Three islands were visible on the west side of what we could see of Nyassa from its
southern end. The two ranges of hills stretch along its shores, and we could see
looming through the haze caused by burning grass all over the country the dim out-

lines of some lofty mountains behind the eastern hills. On the table-land are

numerous hills anil some mountains, as Chicadgura, perhaps 5000 feet high, and

Zomba (which was ascended), from 7000 to 8000 feet in altitude. From this table-
land we can see, on the east of Lake Tamandua, the Milanje Mountains, apparently
hio-her than Zomba and Mount Clarendon, not unworthy of the noble name it bears.

All this iegion is remarkably well-watered ; wonderfully numerous are the streams
and mountain rills of clear, cool, gushing water. Once we passed eight of them
and a strong spring in a single hour, and we were then at the end of the dry season.

Even Zomba has a river about 20 yards wide, flowing through a rich valley near its
summit. The hill is well wooded also; trees, admirable for their height and the
amount of timber in them, abound along the banks of the streams. '* Is this country
good for cattle?" the head man of the Mr>kololo, whose business had been the

charge of cattle, was asked. " Truly," replied he ; " don't you see the abundance of

such" and such grasses, which cattle love, and on which they grow fat?" And yet

the people have only a few goats, and still fewer sheep. There are no wild animals

in the highlands, and but few birds ; and with the exception of one place, where we

saw some elephants, buffaloes, &c, there are none on the plains of the Upper Shire,

but the birds, new and strange, are pretty numerous. In the upper part of the

Lower Shire, in the highlands, and in the valley of the Upper Shire", there is a

somewhat numerous population. The people generally live in villages and in hamlets

near them. Each village has its own chief, and the chiefs in a given territory have

a head chief, to whom they owe some sort of allegiance. The paramount chief of

one portion of the Upper Shire is a woman, who lives two days' journey from the

west side of the river, and possesses cattle. The chief has a good deal of authority ;
he can stop trade till he has sold his own things. One or two insisted on seeing

what their people got for the provisions sold to us. The women drop on their knees

when he passes them. Mongazi's wife went down on her knees, when he handed

her our present to carry into the hut. One evening a Makololo fired his musket

without leave, received a scolding, and had his powder taken from him. " If he

were my man," said the chief, "I would fine him a fowl also." The sites of their

Avillages are selected, for the most part, with judgment aud good taste.                                     stream or

spring is near, and pleasant shade-trees grow in and around the place. Nearly

every village is surrounded by a thick high hedge of the poisonous Euphorbia.

During the greater part of the year the inhabitants could see an enemy through the

hedge, while he would find it a difficult matter to see them. By shooting their

already poisoned arrows through the tender branches, they get smeared with the

poisonous milky juice, and inflict most painful if not fatal wounds. The constant

dripping of the juice from the bruised branches prevents the enemy from attempting

to force his way through the hedge, as it destroys the eyesight. The huts are larger,

stronger built, with higher and more graceful roofs than any we have seen on the

Zambesi.  The  Boabab  (spreading  place)  is  at  one  side  of the  village                                the ground is

made smooth and level, and the banians, the favourite trees, throw a grateful shade

over it. Here the people meet to smoke tobacco and bang ; to sing, dance, beat

drums, and drink beer. [In the Boabab of one small village we counted fourteen

drums of various sizes, all carefully arranged on dry grass.] Some useful work, too,
is performed in this place, as spinning, weaving, making baskets and fish-nets. On

entering a village, we proceeded at once to the Boabab, on which the Strangers' hut

is built, and sat down. Large mats of split bamboo are politely brought to us to
recline on. Our guides tell some of the people who we are, how we have behaved

ourselves since they knew us, where we are going, and what our object is. This

word is carried to the chief. If a sensible man, he comes as soon as he hears of

our arrival ; if timid or suspicious, he waits till he has thrown his dice, and given

his warriors, for whom he has sent in hot haste, time to assemble. When the chief

makes his appearance, his people begin to clap their hands, and continue clapping

until he sits down ; then his councillors take their places beside him, with whom he

Aconverses for a minute or so. Our guides sit down opposite them.                                            most novel

scene now transpires ; both parties, looking earnestly at each other, pronounce a word,
as " Amhinatu" (our chief or father), then a clap of the hands from each one

-- --another word, two claps a third word, three claps and this time all touch the

--clap, clap allowing the sound gradually to die away. They keep time in this most

perfectly, the chief taking the lead. The guides now tell the chief all they please,

and retire, clapping the hands gently, or with one hand on the breast; and his own

people do the same, when they pass the chief, in retiring. The customary presents

are exchanged, after a little conversation with the chief, and in a short time his

people bring provisions for sale. In some villages the people clapped with all their

might when they approved what the chief was saying to us. In others, the clapping

seems omitted in our case, though we could see it was kept with black strangers who

came into the village. The chief at the Lake, an old man, came to see us of his own

-- --accord, said he had heard that we had come, and sat down under a tree, and he

came to invite us to take up our quarters with him. Many of the men are very

intelligent-looking, with high foreheads and well-shnped heads. They show singular

taste in the astonishingly varied styles in which their hair is arranged. Their

bead necklaces are really pretty specimens of work. Many have the upper and

middle as well as the lower part of the ear bored, and have from three to five rings

in each ear. The hole in the lobe of the ear is large enough to admit one's finger,

and some wear a piece of bamboo about an inch long in it. Brass and iron bracelets,

elaborately figured, are seen ; and some of the men sport from two to eight brass

rings on each finger, and even the thumbs are not spared. They wear copper, brass,

and iron rings on their legs and arms ; many have their front teeth notched, and

some file them till they resemble the teeth of a saw. The upper lip ring of the

women gives them a revolting appearance; it is universally worn in the highlands.

A puncture is made high up in the lip, and it is gradually enlarged until the pelele

can be inserted. Some are very large. One we measured caused the lip to project

two inches beyond the tip of the nose ; when the lady smiled the contraction of the

Whymuscles elevated it over the eyes. "  do the women wear these things ?" the

venerable chief, Chinsurdi, was asked. Evidently surprised at such a stupid ques-

tion, he replied, " For beauty !  They are the only beautiful things women have
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

men have beards, women have none. What kind of a person would she be without

the pelele ? She would not he a woman at all with a mouth like a man, but no

beard." One woman having a large tin pelele with a bottom like a dish, refused to

sell it, because, she said, her husband would beat her if she went home without it.

--These rings are made of bamboo, of iron, or of tin. Their scanty clothing the

prepared bark of trees, the skins of animals (chiefly goats), and a thick strong cotton

--cloth are all of native manufacture. They seem to be an industrious race. Iron

is dug out of the hills, and every village has one or two smelting houses; and from

their own native iron they make excellent hoes, axes, spears, knives, arrow-heads, &c.

They make, also, round baskets of various sizes, and earthen pots, which they orna-

ment with plumbago, said to be found in the Hill Country, though we could not

learn exactly where, nor in what quantities : the only specimen we obtained was not

pure. At every fishing village on the banks of the river Shire' men were busy spin-

ning buaze and making large fishing-nets from it ; and from Chihisas to the Lake,

in every village almost, we saw men cleaning and spinning cotton, while others were

weaving it into strong cloth in looms of the simplest construction, all the processes

being excessively slow. This is a great cotton-growing country. The cotton is of
two kinds, " Tonji manga," or foreign cotton ; and " Tonji cadji," or native cotton.

The former is of good quality, with a staple from three-quarters to an inch in length.

It is perennial, requiring to be re-planted only once in three years. The native

cotton is planted every year in the highlands, is of short staple, and feels more like

wool than cotton. Every family appears to own a cotton patch, which is kept clear

Weof weeds and grass.  saw the foreign growing at the Lake and in various places

for 30 miles south of it, and about an equal number of miles below the cataracts on

the Lower Shire. Although the native cotton requires to be planted annually in the
highlands, the people prefer it, because, they say, " it makes the stronger cloth."
It was remarked to a number of intelligent natives near the Shire lakelet, " You

should plant plenty of cotton, and perhaps the English will come soon and buy it."
" Surely the country is full of cotton," said an elderly man, who was a trader and

travelled much. Our own observations convinced us of the truth of this statement.

Everywhere we saw it. Cotton patches of from 2 to 3 acres were seen abreast of

the cataracts during the first trip, when Lake Tamandua was discovered, though in

this journey, on a different route, none were observed of more than half an acre.

They usually contained about a quarter of an acre each. There are extensive tracts

on the level plains of both the Lower and Upper Shire, where salt exudes from the

soil. Sea island cotton might grow well there, as on these the foreign cotton be-

comes longer in the staple. The cotton-growers here never have their crops cut off

by frosts. There are none. Both kinds of cotton require but little labour, none of

that severe and killing toil requisite in the United States. The people are great

cultivators of the soil, and it repays them well. All the inhabitants of a village,

men, women, and children, and dogs, turn out at times to labour in the fields. The

chief told us all his people were out hoeing, and we saw in other parts many busy

at work. If a new piece of ground is to be cultivated, the labourer grasps as much

of the tall dry grass as he conveniently can, ties it into a knot at the top, strikes his

hoe through the roots, detaching them from the ground with some earth still adhering,

which, with the knot, keeps the grass in a standing position. He proceeds in this

Whenway over the field.  this work is finished, the field exhibits a harvest-like

appearance, being thickly dotted all over with these shocks, which are 3 feet high.

A short time before the rains several of these shocks are thrown together, the earth

scraped over them, and then the grass underneath is set on fire. The soil is thus

treated in a manner similar to that practised in modern times among ourselves on

some lands. When they wish to clear a piece of woodland, they proceed in precisely

--the same way as the farmers in Canada and the Western States do, cut the trees

down with their axes, and, leaving the stumps about 3 feet high standing, pile up the

logs and branches for burning. They grow lassaver in large quantities, preparing

ridges for it from 3 to 4 feet wide, and about a foot high. They also raise maize,

rice, two kinds of millet, beans, sugar-cane, sweet potatoes, yams, ground-nuts,

pumpkin, tobacco, and Indian hemp. Near Lake Nyassa we saw indigo 7 feet high.

WeLarge quantities of beer are made, and they like it well.          found whole villages

on the spree, and saw the stupid type of drunkenness, the silly sort, the boisterous

talkative sort, and on cne occasion the almost up-to-the-fighting-point variety, when

a petty chief, with some of the people near, placed himself in front, exclaiming,

"I  stop  this  path                  you must go back."  Had he not got out of the way with greater
                                   ;

speed than dignity, an incensed Makololo would have cured him of all desire to try

a similar exploit in future. It was remarked by the oldest traveller in the party

that he had not seen so much drunkenness during all the years he had spent in

Africa. The people, notwithstanding, attain to a great age. One is struck with the

large number of old grey-headed persons in the highlands. This seems to indicate

a healthy climate; for their long lives they are not in the least indebted to frequent

ablutions. "Why do you wash yourselves? our men never do," said some women

at Chinsurdi to the Makololo. An old man told us he remembered having washed

himself once when a boy, but never repeated it ; and from his appearance one could

Ahardly call the truth of his statement in question.      fellow who volunteered some

wild geographical information followed us about a dozen miles, and introduced us to

the chief Moena Moezi by saying, "They have wandered ; they don't know where
they are going." " Scold that man," said a Makololo head to his factotum, who

immediately commenced an extemporary scolding ; yet the singular geographer would
follow us, and we could not get quit of him till the Makololo threatened to take him

to the river and wash him. The castor-oil with which they lubricate themselves

and the dirt serve as additional clothing, and to wash themselves is like throwing

away the only upper garment they possess. They feel cold and uncomfortable after

Wea wash.       observed several persons marked by the small-pox. On asking the

Athey are somewhat superstitious.     person accused of bewitching another and

On our way to the lake a chief kindly led us past the next two villages, whose chiefs

had just been killed by drinking the Maiori. When a chief dies his people imagine

Athat they may plunder any stranger coming into their village.       chief, near Zomba,

at whose village we took breakfast on our way up, drank the Maiori before our

return, and vomiting, was therefore innocent. His people we found manifesting their

joy by singing, dancing, and beating drums. Even Chibisa, an intelligent and power-

ful chief, drank it once, and when insisting that all his numerous wars were just,

and that his enemies were always in the wrong, said to us, " If you doubt my word,

I am ready to drink the Maiori." On the evening of the day we reached Moena

Moezi, an alligator carried off his principal wife from the very spot where some of

Weus had washed but a few hours before.                   learned on our return that he had sent

messengers to several villages, saying, " He did not know whether we had put

rnediciue on the spot, but after we had been there his wife was carried off by an

alligator." The first village refused to sell us food, would have nothing whatever

to do with us, and the chief of the next village, who happened to be reclining in the

--Boabab, ran off, leaving his wooden pillow and mat behind. The women seldom

run away having more pluck perhaps than the men. When a person dies, the

the Upper Shire. The chief's father had died some time previous. They had not
washed themselves since, though washing is practised more or less on these plains;
and they would not wash until some friends at a distance, who possessed muskets,
had come and fired over the grave. The badge of mourning consists of narrow
strips of Palmyra leaf, tied round the head and arms, sometimes round head, neck,
breast, knees, ankles, arms, and wrists. They have the idea of a Supreme Being,

whom they name Pambe, and also of a future state. The chief Chitisurdi said they

--all knew that they lived again after death. " Sometimes the dead came back again,
    they appeared to them in dreams, but they never told them where they had gone
to." This is an inviting field for benevolent enterprise. There are thousands needing
Christian instruction, and here are materials for lawful commerce, and a fine healthy
country, with none of the noxious insects with which Captains Burton and Speke
were tormented, and, with the single exception of 30 miles, water communication

all the way to England. Let but a market be opened for the purchase of their
cotton, and they can raise almost any amount of it, and the slave trade will speedily

be abolished.

On the Mountain Districts of China, and their Aboriginal Inhabitants.

                             By W. Lockhart.

Much of the empire of China with which we are best acquainted, consists of the

plains that lie near the mouths of the rivers, as they find their way to the sea-board,

and it is here that the important ports for our trade are situated. The interior of

the country is richly diversified ; the land rises considerably towards the hilly districts,

that slope from the chains of mountains that traverse all the western provinces and

spread themselves out through the central part of the country, being in fact the east-

ern spurs of the Kwan-lun and Himalaya ranges, that rise in Northern India to a

vast height, and gradually pass down through the north and south of Tibet towards

China. The Kwan-lun range passes into the northern and central provinces of

China, and the Himalaya into the southern and south-western provinces, while

the Tien-shan or Celestial Mountains and the Altai chain pass into Mongolia and

Mantchouria, commonly called Chinese Tartary.

In the mountainous regions of China the country is very beautiful, and combines

the varieties of scenery found in other similar districts ; many of these portions of the

empire are brought into communication with the sea coast, by means of the large

rivers that flow through all the rich and fertile central provinces, offering great

facility for the interchange of the various commodities of different parts of the em-

piie. These rivers form in fact the high roads of the country.

For purposes of communication in the mountain districts, and to facilitate the

transit of goods, many roads have been cut at great expense and with much labour

over the passes between the high ridges. The great road from Pekin to the south-

west through Shen-si to Sze-chuen, is by a mountain route, whichrequired great ability

and skill to make passable; many years were spent in this work, and it is a monu-

ment of the  patience  and perseverance by which it was accomplished                                                                                                                                                                                                                      by this road
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

merchants and officers constantly travel between the capital and the western frontier.

The road from Shan-si to Kan-suh is one of the most extensive works of the kind in

China. Besides these great trunk roads, there are several other mountain routes, by

which goods are carried from province to province across the mountains, one of

which may be mentioned, as the well-known Mei-ling pass between Kwang-tung

and Kiang-si; it is 24 miles long, and over it all the tea and silk that go to Canton

are carried on men's shoulders. Much might he said regarding these mountain

roads ot China, hut it is impossible to enter on the subject here.

It is among these mountains and in the valleys they enclose, that many tribes of

people dwell who are probably the aborigines or natives of the land. The great

mass of the people who inhabit China are those who dwell in the cities and villages,

cultivating the land, following the pursuits of commerce, and acknowledging the

authority of one emperor; these may be considered to be the Chinese of the present

day ; but in the islands of Formosa and Hainan, as well as in the western frontier,

dwell those native savage tribes, who acknowledge no submission to the Emperor of

China, dwell among their own hills, and have ever maintained their independence.
                                                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                  169

   The island of Formosa is divided from north to south by a chain of mountains
that cuts the island in two. On the western side live the Chinese, who passing

from the opposite coast of Fuh-kien, have gradually driven away the aborigines to the

eastern side ; some barter is kept up betvveen these two parties, but they are generally
in a state of hostility, and constant vigilance is required on the part of the Chinese

to guard against the attacks of the natives, and this interferes very much with their
intercourse. The natives are governed by their own chiefs, who keep up a kind of
government. The occupations are tilling the ground, working in the mines in the

mountains, weaving coarse cloth, fishing, and washing the sand of certain districts

for gold.

The Aurelia Popyrifera, from the pith of which rice paper is made, grows in For-

mosa. These native tribes also inhabit the mountain districts of the island of Hai-

nan. The Chinese live on the eastern coast,' where they have large fishing stations,

for the supply of Southern China with salt fish ; and the natives dwell by themselves
on the western side, and maintain their independence and separation from the in-

truders on their coast.

   The mountainous regions of the Nan-ling and Mei-ling between Kwang-si and

Kwei- chau give lodgment to many clans of these aborigines, who are called Miau-

tsze, or " children of the soil," which they no doubt are. It is singular that any of

these people should have maintained their independence so long and not been com-

pelled to submit to Chinese rule, surrounded as they are by the Chinese people.

This race presents so many physical points of difference to the Chinese, as to lead
me to infer that they are a more ancient people than the latter, and the aborigines

of Southern China. They are smaller in size and stature than the Chinese, have
shorter necks, and their features are more angular. The degree of civilization they

have obtained is much below that of the Chinese. It b not known what language

they speak, but the names given to the parts of the body and the common articles

about their boats, by some boatmen who visited Canton some years since, showed

that it was evidently not Chinese.

r                               are  about                                                           forty tribes of these Miau-tsze     scattered  over  the  mountains of

l here

Kwang-tung, Kwang si, Hu-nan, and Kwei-chau, speaking several dialects, and dif-

fering among themselves in their customs, government, and dress. The Chinese

government keep troops at the foot of the mountains to restrain these tribes, who,

though often hostile, are on the whole inclined to live at peace, but resist every attempt

to penetrate into their fortresses. The tribes are often at strife among themselves,

which becomes a source of safety to the Chinese, who are ill able to resist these hardy

mountaineers. It would appear that the race called the Chinese people, spreading

over the magnificent country they had found, drove back the Miau-tzse or "sons of

the soil," those on the coast taking refuge on the islands of Formosa and Hainan,

while those to the westward sought their homes among the mountains in their

neighbourhood                                                                                        and  there  they have  remained a  separate  people, divided  into various
                                                                                                  ;

tribes, ruled over by governors or chiefs of their own ; the larger number of these

Miau-tsze have maintained their independence, but some have taken office in the

Imperial army, and have associated themselves with the Chinese. Various opinions

are entertained as to the religious doctrines of these Miau-tsze, who appear not to

be wholly idolaters; some of the tribes have a tradition of a Supreme God, who

created the world, but their knowledge is very indistinct and imperfect. The chief

source of information about these people is deiived from a series of coloured draw-

ings                            one of the                                                           most  perfect of such  series that  has been   obtained   was  exhibited
                             ;

in the Section ; the drawings were evidently taken by some Chinese traveller who

visited the mountain tribes. Each drawing illustrates one of the tribes, and presents

a group of the people in some characteristic occupation or amusement, and is accom-

panied by a short description of the tribe to which it refers.

   These people are interesting from the fact that they must have a variety of ancient
customs among them, and also because they are the sons of freedom ; and however
great may be the difference between us and them, they have a certain affinity with

us, and may some day bid us a hearty welcome to the land of their forefathers.

They are dispersed over the mountains cf Southern and Central China, and live in
a changeable state of relationship to the Chinese around them; sometimes they fight

in open war, at others they rob and plunder, and sometimes they buy and sell.

   These Miau-tsze live to a great extent on the eastern slopes of the mountains,
whose western slopes, in South-Eastern Asia, are peopled by the numerous tribes of

Laos and Shans, and more particularly of the Karens, who are our tried and faithful
adherents in the territory of Burmah ; and there are probably strong marks of simi-

larity of origin and identity of race between the Miau-tsze of China and the Karens

of Burmah and Pegu.

On the Course and Results of the British North American Exploring Expe-

  dition, under his Command in the years 1857, 1858, 1859. By Captain J.

   Palliser.

   The first part of this paper was occupied with a sketch of the course of the expedi-

tion, illustrated by a large map. Starting from England in May 1857, the expedi-
tion reached Lake Superior by New York and the United States, from whence they

travelled in canoes to the Red River settlement, then with horses and carts across

the Plains to the north-west to Carlton, where the first winter was spent. During

that season Captain Palliser travelled back to the States on business, and Dr. Hector

reached as far west as the Rocky Mountains. In June 1858 the expedition resumed

its westward course, and in August reached the line of the Rocky Mountains. The
remaining two months before the winter set in was occupied in exploring the Moun-

tains, resulting in the discovery of four passes. The second winter was spent at

Edmonton, where the expedition reassembled in October. Captain Blakiston returned

to England from this place. The winter of J 858-59 was spent in various explo-

rations into the Rocky Mountains with the purpose of learning their winter aspect.
The furthest of them reached almost to Mount Brown. In spring of 1859 M. Bourgeau

returned to England, his term of engagement having expired ; and the rest of the party,
accompanied by two English gentlemen, the late Captain Brisco and Mr. Mitchell,

proceeded through theBlackfoot country along the South Saskatchewan and bound-

ary  line, till  in  August  they again  separated  to  explore  the  mountains                                                    Captain

Palliser and Mr. Sullivan undertaking the west slope, and Dr. Hector to endeavour

to pass direct to the valley of Eraser River. The party again rejoined at Fort Colvile,

Aand from thence descended the Columbia river to the sea.             necessary delay at

Vancouver Island allowed of a visit to the coal mines at Nanaimo, and also to Fraser

River, after which the expedition returned to England by California, Panama, and

the West Indies, having been absent exactly three years.
   The territory which has now been examined and mapped by this expedition ranges

from Lake Superior to the eastern shore of the lesser Okanagan Lake, and from the

boundary line to the watershed of the Arctic Ocean. This large belt of the continent

was explored in three seasons.

The first season was devoted to the examination of its south-eastern portion

between Lake Superior to the elbow of the south branch of the Saskatchewan, and

from the British boundary line or 49th parallel to Fort Carlton, in lat. 52° 52' N.,

long. 106° 18' W.

The second season was devoted to the examination of the territory between the

two Saskatchewans, to the exploration of the Rocky Mountains, and to the discovery

of the passes available for horses in the British territory.

The third season commenced with a long journey from our winter quarters at Ed-

monton in lat. 53° 34' N., long. 113° 20' W,, through the Blackfoot country to the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                             171

most western point in the neighbourhood of the boundary line, previously reached

Aby the expedition from the eastward in 1857.  westward course was then resumed

along the country between the South Saskatchewan and the British boundary line,

thence once more across the Rocky Mountains. Finally, the connexion of a route

practicable for horses was effected the whole way from Red River settlement across

the continent to the Gulf of Georgia, entirely within British dominions.

This large belt of country embraces districts, some of which are valuable for the

purposes of the agriculturist, while others will for ever be comparatively useless.

   The extent of surface drained by the Saskatchewan, and other tributaries to Lake
Winipeg, which we had an opportunity of examining, amounts in round numbers to

150,000 square miles. This region is bounded to the north by what is known as the

" strong woods," or the southern limit of the great circum-arctic zone of forest,

which occupies these latitudes in the northern hemisphere. This line, which is in-

dicated in the map, sweeps to the north-west from the shore of Lake Winipeg, and

reaches its most northernly limit about 54° 30' N., and long. 109° W., from where

it again passes to south-west, meeting the Rocky Mountains in lat. 51° N., long.

115° W. Between this line of the "strong woods " and the northern limit of the

true prairie country there is a belt of land varying in width, which at one period

must have been covered by an extension of the northern forests, but which has been

gradually cleared by successive fires.

   It is now a partially wooded country, abounding in lakes and rich natural pasturage,
in some parts rivalling the finest park scenery of our own country. Throughout

this region the climate seems to preserve the same character, although it passes

through very different latitudes, its form being doubtless determined by the curves

of the isothermal lines. Its superficial extent embraces about 65,000 square miles,

of which more than one-third may be considered as at once available for the pur-

poses of the agriculturist. Its elevation increases from 700 to 3500 feet as we ap-
proach the Rocky Mountains, consequently it is not equally adapted throughout to
the cultivation of any one crop ; nevertheless at Fort Edmonton, which has an altitude

of 2000 feet, even wheat is sometimes cultivated with success.

   The least valuable portion of the prairie country has an extent of about 80,000
square miles, and is that lying along the South Saskatchewan, and southward from
thence to the boundary line, while its northern limit is known in the Indian languages
as " the edge of the woods," the original line of the woods before invaded by fire.

   On the western side of the Rocky Mountains, in the country which we examined,

there were but few spots at all fitted for the agriculturist, and these form isolated
patches in valleys separated by mountain ranges.

   As the next result of our explorations, I shall briefly mention the different passes
through the Rocky Mountains which we explored, alluding to the chief advantages

and disadvantages of each.

   The Kananaskis Pass and the British Kootanie Pass were examined by myself.
Of these I consider the Kananaskis Pass the preferable one, both on account of its

direct course through the mountains and its easier ascent.

   The ascent to the height of land from the east is through a wide gently sloping
valley, and the immediate watershed is formed by a narrow ridge, which, if pierced by
a short tunnel, would reduce the summit level to about 4600 feet above the sea. The
descent to the west, into which Kananaskis Pass opens, is comparatively easy.

   The British Kootanie Pass also opens out into the Kootanie River valley, but the
altitude here to be overcome is much greater, amounting to 6000 feet. There are
likewise two ridges to be passed, which fact would form a very strong objection to

this pass.

   The Vermilion Pass, which was traversed by Dr. Hector, presents on a whole the

greatest natural facilities for crossing the mountains without the aid of engineering

work, as the rise to the height of land is gradual from both sides, a feature which
seems to be peculiar to this pass. It would thus be impossible to diminish its summit
level (which is less than 5000 feet), as is proposed in the case of Kananaskis Pass,
but on the other hand it would be the most suitable for the construction of an easy
waggon road.

   This, like the other two passes I have mentioned, also strikes the Kootanie River
close to its source ; but last summer Dr. Hector crossed the mountains bv another
              --

--172 REPORT 1860.

pass from the head of the north branch of the Saskatchewan, direct! y to the Columbia
River, in the vicinity of the boat encampment.

    Leaving this latter pass out of consideration for the present, as all of the others

open to the Kootanie River, it becomes necessary to consider the course by whch it
may be practicable to reach the coast of the Pacific without crossing to the south or
American side of the boundary line. It was with great difficulty for this purpose
even a partial examination of the country could be effected, owing to the rugged
valleys which intersect it in a direction parallel to the mountains, and which, though

not formidable themselves, are covered with such dense forest as to present obstacles
to the traveller. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Mr. Sullivan succeeded in making

his wav on the north side of the boundary line, and at the same time following a
system of transverse valleys, which might allow of the construction of a road with-
out much trouble from the mouth of Kananaskis Pass to the Columbia, above Fort
Colvile. From this point westward I myself ascertained that it would be possible

to reach the valley of the Okanagan, by which I believe the Americans have already
commenced to connect the waggon road of the Columbia with the upper country of
the Frazer River. While pointing out the circumstances that seem to favour the
possibility of carrving a road through British territory, from the Saskatchewan to
the Pacific, I wish to refrain from expressing any opinion as to the expediency of
undertaking at the present time a work which would involve a vast amount of labour

and a corresponding heavy expenditure. For how long a time in the year such a

road would remain open, is a question as yet unanswered, and which has a most
important bearing on the subject. In addition, the difficulty of direct communication
between Canada and the Saskatchewan country, as compared with the comparatively
easy route through the United States by St. Paul's, renders it very unlikely that the
great work of constructing a road across the continent can be solely the result of

British enterprise.

   Not the least important results of the expedition are the meteorological observa-

tions,which have been carefully conducted during the whole period of the explorations,

both in the winters and summers, whether we were stationary or travelling. I lay
stress upon this fact, as it affords materials for ascertaining the exact nature of the
climate, and means for a correct comparison between its nature and that of Canada.

  The hourly magnetic observations were conducted by Lieutenant Blakiston, R A.,

assisted by the other members of the expedition, during the winter of 1857-58.
These were not, however, carried on during the winter 1858-59, owing to the return
of Lieutenant Blakiston with the instruments; the magnetic declinations however were

attended to.

   The astronomical observations and computations were placed in the hands of Mr.
Sullivan, and the geographical position of the several salient points of the map are
determined principally by his lunars, the rates cf chronometers being, of course, too
unsteady to be depended on while travelling through so rough a country.

   The large botanical collection of our botanist, M. Bourgeau, has already been sent

to Kew Gardens, where the specimens have been carefully arranged by himself under
the inspection of Dr. Hooker, who highly values them.

    Dr. Hector's specimens of fossils, &c. were from time to time transmitted to Sir

Roderick Murchison at the Jermyn Street Museum, but from the nature of the subject
much time must elapse before the results can be laid before Her Majesty's Government.

   In conclusion, I have great pleasure in bearing testimony to the unceasing zeal and

energy of my companions, whose valuable assistance has been instrumental in bringing

the expedition to so successful a termination.

    Addendum 1. Remarks concerning the Climate of the Saskatchetca?i

                            District. By Dr. Hector.

   The winter temperature is about 21° Fahr., ranging, however, in regular succes-
sions from high to low temperatures. In January 1858 it was as high as 40° above
zero for a few hours, accompanied by rain and high wind *. In that instance, how-

--ever, between 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. it fell from +37° to 13, a difference of 50° in five

hours. The greatest depression of the thermometer in both years was about the 1 2th

of February. Throughout the winter the snow falls in storms, which seldom last
more than two to three days. The first fall generally occurs in the month of October,

but that always disappears again before the snows of November commence, which

are permanent for the winter. From the open country the snow evaporates very

rapidly, so                             that  the prairies are never deeply covered                                                                                                                                                          but  in the woods it accumulates
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

till spring. In some districts of the country more snow falls than in others ; for
instance, at Fort Pitt, about 400 miles east of the mountains, there is generally 3 feet

to 4 feet of snow in spring, while close along the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains

it seldom exceeds 6 inches, and disappears very early. At Fort Edmonton the snow

always disappears fully a fortnight sooner than at Fort Pitt, although both places are

in the same latitude, but the former 3° further to the west.

The rivers generally freeze up about the 12th of November, and it is curious that the

Saskatchewan *' lakes," as the local term has it, on the same day both at Edmonton

and Carlton, places distant from one another nearly 500 miles. In 1858 the ice

broke up on the 7th of April, but in 1859 not till the 26th of that month. But this
does not show the whole of the remarkable difference in those two seasons ; for in

the former the ice rotted away gradually, while in the latter it "gave" in a single

night from a sudden flood which followed the first warm weather.

  A spring season hardly exists in the Saskatchewan, for in a few days everything

bursts into full verdure after the breaking up of winter. June is generally a wet

month                                   and much rain also falls during the first half of July, but alter that period
                                     ;

the summer is very dry. There is little or no thunder in the higher country, unlike

the Red River settlement, where for a certain season thunder-storms are of daily

occurrence.

   The nature of the snow-line on the Rocky Mountains gives a clew to the climatal
arrangement of the country to the east. Although there are many of the mountains

in the eastern part of the range which exceed those to the west in altitude, only few
of their valleys are filled with glaciers. The great glaciers at the source of the north

branch of the Saskatchewan are fed from fields of ice and perpetual snow, that may

be considered as lying on the western slope, of the range. The diminished altitude

of the snow-line towards the west is thus proved. The reason is, that the prevailing
winds are from the west, and in rising to cross the mountains they are cooled, and
so deprived of their moisture, which ceases to be deposited after they pass over the

greatest altitude.

    Concerning the Indians of the west side of the mountains, he stated that the tribes
are very numerous, and principally support themselves on fish. In most of the

tributaries of the Columbia the salmon swarm in such numbers as to taint the air at
a certain season of the year when their bodies are cast up on the banks. These fish-
eating Indians are of very low grade, as wherever Indians obtain their living easily
they invariably become debased. Thus the Indians to the east of the Rocky Moun-

tains, that dwell in the strong woods, and live by the chase of animals, such as the

Moose-deer, which requires great skill and sagacity, are vastly superior to the Indians

of the plains, who, living on buffalo, with ease obtain abundance of food.

  Mlie adduced the case of the Sarcees, who belong to a tribe of c Kenzie River

Indians, called the Chepeyans, who are perhaps the finest Indians on the continent;

and yet these Sarcees, from having left their natural course of life some centuries
back, and taken to the plains, where they live among the Blackfoot tribes, have be-
come the worst Indians of the Saskatchewan. Their constitutions have become en-
feebled, as is shown by the prevalence of goitre among them, the whole tribe being

affected with this disease almost without exception, whereas it seldom or never occurs

among other Indians. The half-breeds who live in the Forts of the Upper Saskat-
chewan are very subject to goitre, the cause for which is very obscure.

  Addendum 2. Remarks concerning the Tribes of Indians inhabiting the

         Country examined by the Expedition. By Mr. Sullivan.

   Mr. S. pointed out that the northern portion was occupied by the Crees, which are
the most prominent tribe of the country, and best known to white men. The district
along the South Saskatchewan and towards the boundary line, he stated was inhabited
by a collection of allied tribeis, all speaking nearly the same language, and known as
                                  --

 174 REPORT 1860.

 the Blackfoot. This term comprises the Blackfoot proper, the Blood Indians,
 Peagans, Gro Ventres, Sarcees, and several others. The Sarcees, however, are really
 very different Indians, and have their relations far to the north on M'Kenzie River.

 He next spoke concerning the languages of the tribes, of which he has prepared voca-

 bularies, stating that that of the Crees is very perfect, having a very effective system

 of grammar, which has been ably developed by the missionaries, who ha\e also

 invented a system of syllabic characters, by which the Indians soon learn to read

 and write in their own language. These characters could also be applied to all the

 other Indian languages he examined east of the mountains, excepting Sarcee, which is

 too guttural.

    He remarked that a very interesting, though small tribe, known as the Mountain
 Stoneys, had been induced by the Wesleyan missionary to commence a little agricul-

 ture. It does not amount to much, however, their principal crop being turnips,
 which they generally pull and eat raw before they are nearly grown. Of the very
 different habits of Indians which inhabit the woods from those of the plains, he men-
 tioned in addition the curious circumstance, that in a camp of the former Indians
 there is never any noise ; and even in conversation they talk almost at an inaudible
 pitch, a habit derived from their stealthy habits in hunting; whereas a camp of Plain
 Indians resembles a fair, as drums beating, whooping, and singing is continued all
day and all night.

On the Formation of Icebergs and Ice Action, as observed in the Hudson's

                        Bay and Straits. By Dr. J. Rae.

   The manner in which icebergs are generally formed is so well known that it would
be out of place to mention it here, but I have observed in Hudson's Bay and Straits
these ice-islands formed in a mode different from that usually described.

    Along these shores there are high and steep cliffs fronting the tea, and having deep

water at their base. Many of these cliffs face to the south-eastward. In the winter

falls of snow are frequent, and as almost every snow-storm is followed or accompanied
by a gale of northerly or north-westerly wind, the snow is blown over the cliff and
deposited in deep drifts at the cliff- foot on the ice, which is forced down by the weight.

   As I have known a drift-bank of 20 or 30 feet formed bv one gale of wind of as
many hours' duration, it may be readily understood how in the course of a winter an
accumulation of snow to the depth of several hundred feet may be formed, extending

in a sloping direction to seaward thus :

   As soon as warm weather comes on in spring the surface snow is thawed ; the

water percolates downwards until it reaches the snow, which is colder than the
freezing-point, and the whole is frozen into a solid mass of ice.

    This process goes on to a greater or less extent according to the severity of the
season, the quantity of snow, and the amount of windy weather, until the snow-
formed ice attains great thickness and breaks off in large masses in the form of ice-

bergs.

    In Hudson's Bay the icebergs formed in this manner are small and scarcely de-
serving the name, but in the Straits they are large and lofty.

   When passing through the Strait near to the north shore, I have seen some of

these lying close to the cliff from which they had become detached, and showing
projections and hollows corresponding to the form of the rocks from which they
had broken away.

   Whilst wintering at Repulse Bay on the Arctic circle in 1846-47 and 1S53-54,
I had an opportunity of observing the manner in which boulders are taken up and

transported by ice.

   In the early part of winter, when the sea-ice has attained considerable thickness,
it adheres at low water to any stones it may rest upon, and as the tide flows, raises
these from the ground. As the ice increases in thickness, these stones, some of them
3, 4, or 5 feet in diameter, are gradually imbedded in the ice, which attains a depth

of 8 feet or more.

   In the spring the surface-ice wastes away by the combined action of thaw and

evaporation, whilst it is still acquiring fresh thickness underneath.

   In the month of June, the boulders, which in the autumn were under the ice, now
appear on its surface, and may be floated off to great distances, when the ice is broken

up whilst still strong, by the action of winds and currents.

  Remarks on some of the Races of India and High Asia (in connexion with

             Casts exhibited). By Robert von Schlagintweit.

    Mr. Robert de Schlagintweit gave a short sketch of the aboriginal tribes of Cen-
tral India, as also of the race inhabiting the country between the Karakorim and

Sayan Shan, which go by the name of the Turks. He also presented, in illustra-

tion of his remarks, some metal casts* of native faces taken from life. The tribes
composing the population of the mountain regions of Central India are the Kols,
the Gods, the Bils, and the Santals.

    In physical conformation these people differ most distinctly from either Hindoos
or Mussulmans. In their religious observances also, and the habits of domestic life,

they have nothing in common with their neighbours. The language originally
spoken by them is now almost entirely lost, and it was only with great difficulty
that we could collect from old people any remains of their former idiom.

   Though there exist many affinities amongst the four tribes above mentioned, yet
each preserves its peculiar and characteristic features. The complexion is remark-
ably dark, nearly approaching the colour of Negroes ; the mouth is extremely large,

though the lips, which are scarcely ever parallel to each other, are not very fleshy;
the nose is broad and flat, and the hair, which is generally shaved off or cut very

short, stands out, stiff and straight. Though at first glance these tribes may show a

superficial resemblance to the African race, yet a closer examination will disclose

characteristic differences, especially with reference to the lower part of the head,

which is more prominent and considerably stronger with the Negroes. By some

ethnographers a remote affinity with Australian tribes has been pointed out ; but
the likeness, on closer comparison, proves merely an apparent one.

   The mountainous countries inhabited by the Kols, Bils, and Santals are, for the
greater part, covered with dense jungles, and at certain seasons of the year become

--so unhealthy as to prove extremely dangerous for everyone except the natives them-

selves, a most remarkable instance of the fact, that some human tribes are capable

of living under conditions altogether fatal, or nearly so, to others.

    Cultivation can only be carried on to a very limited extent ; and the inhabitants
chiefly occupy themselves in cutting clown trees, and in hunting the wild animals
with which their country abounds.

   The clothing of this rude people is very scanty, consisting merely of a small piece
of unbleached cloth for the loins, and another piece of the same wound round the
temples, so as to leave a great part of the head exposed to the powerful rays of the
sun. They have no shoes, but sometimes wear a kind of sandal made of rough
wood, and shaped to the foot, with another small round covering of wood at its
upper end, to afford a hold for the toes.

   Their sole weapons are axes, in the use of which they display considerable expert-

ness. For dwellings, they erect for themselves miserable huts constructed of bam-
boo and the leaves of various trees.

   The contempt with which they are universally treated by their neighbours, the
Hindoos, has rendered them extremely shy and suspicious ; whenever I approached
one of their villages, they invariably left their huts and tried to conceal themselves
in the dense jungles of the neighbourhood. Though I had the necessary supply of
guides with me, yet their services in this respect were indispensable on many occa-

sions.

   M. de Schlagintweit passed on to the Turks, a people particularly recommending

themselves to his notice, as presenting marked differences from all the tribes he had
had occasion to observe.

   This remarkable race inhabits those parts of Central Asia which to the north of
Tibet are interposed between the Komakorinn, the Sayan Slian, and considerably to

the east of it. In many respects they show points of resemblance to the Mongols,
but nevertheless form a separate and distinct tribe, and may be considered as the

original stock from which the Turks in Europe have sprung. Even at the present
day the true Turkish language holds its ground amongst them ; and though, on com-

parison with the kindred idiom used by the European Turks, there are many dialectic

deviations to be observed, yet it is evident that the Turks in Central Asia have pre-
served the purity of the original tongue, whilst the related race in Europe have
modified it with a considerable admixture of Persian and Arabic words.

   Like their European brethren, the Asiatic Turks are fanatic Mussulmans, honest,
active, and hospitable, and far more civilized than their neighbours the Tibetans.
Their manners are characterized by the strictest observance of punctilious etiquette,
some of the ceremonies being so complicated as to raise up an almost impassable

barrier for all strangers.

   The native dress is rather handsome and rich, varying according to the seasons.
For winter, or when travelling over the mountains, the Turk wears a long fur coat,
woollen trowsers, and a round fur cap. The stockings are of felt, and so long that
they can be drawn over the trowsers, when they are fastened by an ornamental
ribbon above the knee. So far, the dress, which we had to assume ourselves when

disguised, is very convenient ; but the shoes are so thin as to offer but a slight

protection to the feet. The summer costume consists also of a coat and trowsers, a
light cap for the head, and boots reaching up to the knee worn without any stock-

ing ' -

           ,

    Yarkand, their chief place, as also Kashgar, is one of the most important and
flourishing places of Central Asia. The population is in general a wealthy one, and
live in good solid houses.

   The inhabitants of the mountainous parts are mostly shepherds ; the principal
occupation of those in the plains is trade, which they carry on with horses and
Bactrian camels along routes apparently impracticable for loaded animals. The
merchants travel as far south as Ladak and Pesham, and to the north find their way

to the shores of the Issikul lake. On the west they penetrate beyond the Russian

frontier ; but towards the east commercial intercourse is restricted by the large
desert, stretching along the eastern part of the Kuenluen.

   It may here be mentioned, that the caravan route from Yarkand to Ladak lead3
for more than fourteen days' march over uninhabited mountain country, at an eleva-

tion of from 14,000 to 16,000 feet. Passes above 18,000 feet in height occur; and
the whole district is so bare and sterile, possessing so little vegetation, that the
traders are obliged to carry with them even the food for their animals.

   By far the greater part of the trade betsveen India and High Asia, including the

adjoining parts of Russia, is carried on by the Turks.

   In conclusion we may remark that, besides our special geographical observations,
we had occasion to collect various specimens of manufacture, mostly from Turkish
and Tibeto-Indian parts; and we consider ourselves fortunate in being able to add
more than 207 specimens to the splendid general collection now accumulated, under
the energetic direction of Dr. Forbes Watson, within the walls of the India House
Museum.

               On the Tribes composing the Population of Morocco.
                    By Lieutenant Edward Sciilagintweit.

   This paper was read by Mr. Hermann Sciilagintweit, who stated that his brother
El warJ, First Lieutenant in the Bavarian Army, had joined the Spanish forces
during their iate campaign in Morocco. Subsequently he had made a second visit
to Morocco in furtherance of certain scientific purposes of his own, when he received

the most valuable assistance from the well-known British Resident in that country,

Mr. James Drummond Hay*.
   The principal population of Morocco, the Moors, are a mixed race, deriving their

origin partly from the Berbers and partly from the Arabs. They form the most
numerous section of the inhabitants of the towns. Their complexion is compara-
tively fair, not unlike that of the inhabitants of Southern Europe, while the colour
of their hair is various, comprising both light and dark shades ; the form of the face,
as well as of the figure in general, betrays a tendency to stoutness. With regard to
character, but little can be said in the way of praise. Like most Orientals, the
Moors are false and covetous, grovelling in the lowest servility before their superiors,
and full of arrogance and cruelty to those below them. This race took very little
part in the late war, while the following ones showed themselves as possessing much
greater energy, and capable, under proper guidance, of quitting themselves well in

active service.

   The various tribes of the Berbers or Brabers must hi considered as the original
inhabitants of this district. They were found already in possession of the country
on the arrival of the Romans, as appears from the geographical terminology used by

the latter in reference to these parts. The interesting work of "Al Hasem" of

--Granada better known under his name, when a Christian, of "Leo Africanus,"

shows, moreover, that during their conquests in North-western Africa (650-700
a.d.) the Arabs were frequently engaged in conflict with these primitive tribes.

   Like the Fellahs in Egypt who have succeeded in preserving the ethnographical
type of the ancient inhabitants, so here also it occurs that, in spite of the many

changes in the dynasties of the country, the pure type of the Berbers is still repre-

sented by a considerable proportion of the population. They chiefly inhabit Mount
Atlas and its spurs, but have also extended themselves as far as Fez, Mekinez, and

the towns along the sea-coast.
   In Morocco two principal tribes of the Berbers can be distinguished : the

Shlockhs, who are settled in villages and towns ; and the Amazirgens, forming a

migratory and unsettled population.
   The Kbilas (Kabiles) and the Shayvas in Algiers must also be considered as be-

longing to the Berber race. In person they are thin, but sinewy; their hair brown,
occasionally reddish, and with those from the southern provinces rather dark.

Though in general character not unlike the Moors, they are a much more active
people, are good cultivators of the soil, and make hardy soldiers. One tribe in par-

ticular of the Berbers, the Hudnyas, have played an influential part at various
times in the military history of Morocco. Like the Ianichars, they formed a strong
and formidable guard, though often in opposition to the government ; but were at
last disbanded and scattered throughout various cantonments of the country.

   The Riffers inhabit the mountain ranges along the Mediterranean, which begin
at Tetuan and reach to Cape "Tres Forcas." Confined as they are to their almost
inaccessible mountains, they form a distinct and well-marked race, their language

--even differing considerably from the Arabic. There are six principal tribes into

which they are divided, the Ghoniaras, Aksenayas, Bukone'a, Tems'manes.Gvelayas,
and Kebdanas. They are almost entirely independent of the Emperor of Morocco,
the small yearly tribute paid to him being offered rather to the head of their church
than to their Emperor. The greater part of them are robbers and pirates ; and, in-

deed, in the late war, when posted in the town of Tetuan for its defence, they
exercised their native calling with a zeal and cruelty which considerably accelerated

the surrender of the place.

casts, besides making numerous detailed measurements.

and general proportions, but their character is better than that of the preceding
races. They are very active both in trade and agriculture, and evince great dexterity
in the manufacture and use of arms. Their dependence upon the Emperor is of the
same nature as that of the Riffers.

                     Geography of the North Atlantic Telegraph.

          By Colonel Tal. P. Shaffner, of the United States.

-- --The Route Lands and Seas. The route of the telegraph is from Scotland via

Faroe Isles, Iceland, Greenland, and Labrador, to Quebec, there connecting with,

other lines to different parts of America.

The sea sections of the proposed telegraphic route are as well known to nautical

geographers, excepting, perhaps, the places sounded by the Telegraphic Expedition

last autumn (1859) between Labrador and Greenland, and between Greenland and

Iceland. The bottoms of those seas were found to be deep mud, and a cable once laid

thereon will lie undisturbed for all time. Icebergs float, and there is no part of the

sea in which the cables will be laid where the bergs will reach the bottom. Arctic

navigators, with whom the author has had the pleasure of conversing since his arrival

from the voyage of last autumn, agree that if the cable can be carried into deep

fiords on the respective coasts, there will be no danger of interruptions from icebergs.

The author has seen such fiords on the coasts of Labrador and Greenland, and

therefore regards the problem as solved.

AThe land sections are not of serious importance.                                                                                                                telegraph line can be con-

structed on land wherever the foot of man can be placed. Lines have been built

over hills and valleys where neither waggon nor beast could go, and these regions

were in the great Mississippi valley, a country having great variety of soil, surface,

and climate.

  --Faroe Isles. The cable will be landed at Thorshaven, the capital of the Faroe

group, and from thence a few miles by land to Westerman's haven. The island is

hilly, the roads  inferior;  there is but little cultivation                                                                                                     pasturage good ;  the people

intellectual; religion Lutheran ; it sends one member to the Danish Parliament; it

has a governor, sheriffs, and other officers of state : the climate is about the same as

Copenhagen, more mild than Stockholm, Quebec, Montreal, or Boston.

Icelund will be traversed by the line from Berufiord or Portland to Reikiavik.

The people are highly educated, and a considerable trade is carried on between them

and the Europeans. The French have some 120 vessels fishing on the south coast.

They have free trade with foreign countries, and all the fisheries are free. The in-

habitants are industrious and religious, and have their own local Parliament. The

country is partially cultivated, but much of the island is covered with lava. The

climate is moderate ; the ice never interrupting navigation on the south and west

--coasts. There will be no difficulty whatever in running the telegraph across Iceland.
   Labrador. The cable will be landed in Hamilton Inlet, lat. 54° 30' N. The

line will then be run either to the Gulf or to the River St. Lawrence. This country

is rolling or hilly, and covered with timber, principally pine, spruce, and juniper.

The trees are large, many being 15 or 20 inches in diameter at the base. There is
much grass where the country is open. Turnips, potatoes, and other vegetables are

cultivated to a limited extent. The inhabitants are mostly Esquimaux. They are

civilized, under the teachings of the Moravian missionaries. There is a station of

the Hudson's Bay Company on Hamilton Inlet, about 50 miles from the sea. The

coast is hilly and barren. Fishermen from Newfoundland are scattered along the

coast, and many are employed in Hamilton Inlet. The cod and herring fisheries

are the most profitable. The country is not much settled. There will be difficulties

to be met in the construction of the line, and maintaining it across Labrador ; but

these difficulties will not be so great as those which have been overcome in other

countries ; for example, in Newfoundland, and the Southern and Western States of

America. The line across Newfoundland traverses marshy and uninhabited regions,

wholly unknown to the world until a few years ago, when it was explored for the

telegraph.

  --Greenland. The section of the route the least known is Greenland ; and

although that part of the country proposed to be traversed is not so cold as the

climate of St. Petersburgh, a city of some 700,000 inhabitants, yet there prevails

the most erroneous impressions in regard to the temperature of that interesting and

wonderful country. Whether it is a continent, or numerous islands extending to the

North Pole, is a problem yet to be solved. In the southern portion we find green

valleys, covered with grass and vegetation, surrounded with mountains towering into

the heavens ; and these in the morning are covered with white glittering snow, which

with the mid-day sun disappears, leaving exposed their blackened minarets and spires.

The scenery is grand and picturesque.

   The coasts of Greenland are barren hills and mountains. Along the shore are
many islands. The fiords penetrate to the interior 10, 20, or 30 miles. Some of

these bring out ice, others do not. Into one of the fiords which are free of ice will

be carried the telegraph cable, as indicated in the map. The water is very deep, and

no iceberg can reach the bottom, or go far up their meanderings to their heads.

They do not freeze, except in narrow places, where there is still water. A cable can

be easily laid from the sea into one of these fiords, and when brought to land it can
be well secured against native ice, as is the case at many places in America, and on

the belts and sound of the Baltic Sea.

The exact locality where the line is to cross Greenland has not been determined,

but it will be in the southern portion, not 60 miles north of Cape Farewell. The

--particular kind of surface to be traversed whether green valleys, or mountain ranges
-- is not fully known, but in either case no insuperable difficulties can be foreseen.

What it is in the interior, or whether there be ice there or not, no one knows.

Col. S. found alluvial soil on the ice several miles distant from the sea, and it may

have been blown there from the interior. Some 12,000 deer are killed in the Holsten-

berg district every year. They disappear in winter. Whither do they go ?

   The ice travelled over by Colonel Shaffher was solid freshwater ice. The snow

falls in small quantities. On the plateau some considerable collections of water were

seen. There were many deep crevices. The thickness of the ice no one has been

able to determine. The author does not believe it entirely rests upon the earth, but

it forms bridges, and perhaps where he went it was 4000 feet above the level of the

sea ; or perhaps there was a cavern beneath, 1000 feet between the ice and the earth,

exceeding in grandeur the great Mammoth Cave of America, with its 200 subterranean

avenues. This may seem most wonderful, but he had many reasons for believing

that it was possible. He had been in some of the caverns, and heard a waterfall

resembling the rushing of a river over rocks. The bergs from the fiord blinks, he

noticed were clear and clean ice ; no gravel or earth either in or on them, excepting

those that were near the shore. If the ice were upon the earth in the interior, we

might expect to find some earth in the bergs. He has seen boulders on bergs, but

they came from the glaciers of the north, or from the sides of the blinks crushing

against the mountains as the ice moved from the interior. The inhabitants are Danes

and Esquimaux. The Julianahaab District is the most southern in Greenland, and

has about 2600 Esquimaux. They are all civilized, and mostly members of the

Lutheran Church. There are a few Moravians. The children are baptized, and at

fourteen years old confirmed. They have churches and schools, and they preach,

sing, and pray. In the principal churches they have organs and some fine paintings.

The town of Julianahaab has about 300 inhabitants. The people received the

visit of the party last autumn with much joy. The houses were stone and frame,

and covered with slate. It is not cold enough for double windows. They had cows

and sheep. The Esquimaux lived in stone huts covered with earth, fully as com-

fortable as many log cabins that Colonel ShafFner has lived in when in the western

forests of America.

The Esquimaux are honest and good-hearted. They never steal unless on the

verge of starvation. The men treat their wives well. The children aie never

whipped. Peace, love, and domestic happiness seem to be more common to them

than to the more civilized races. It will not be difficult to have a telegraph line

maintained  in Greenland,  with  the  aid  of  such  people                                         and,  in  fact,  a  telegraph

it can be maintained thereafter with much more facility and certainty than has been

done across the plains of Russia, the mountains of Norway, the swamps of New-

or the Alpine ranges of Europe.

On the Lost Polar Expedition and Possible Recovery of its Scientific

               Documents. By Captain Parker Snow.

   Captain Parker Snow, in addressing the audience upon the subject of his paper,
stated that the great object he had in view was to keep before the public the fact
that we had not yet done all that might be done as regarded the lost polar expedi-

tion. Thuse who went out in that expedition ought, none of them, ever to be for-
gotten ; and it was our duty to persevere in ascertaining their real fate until posi-
tive evidence came forward concerning it. This evidence, he asserted, had not yet
been found ; and he was prepared to show that more could be obtained if right mea-

sures were taken.

   He then commenced his arguments by giving an analysis of Franklin's instruc-
tions, and pointed out how certainly numerous scientific observations of great value
must have been made by the officers in that expedition. He enumerated the differ-
ent searching expeditions, and with much pleasure dwelt upon the exertions made
by the several leaders and subordinates engaged upon this work, many of whom he
named. He next pointed out Dr. Rae's discoveries, and then those of the ' Fox'

under the present Sir Leopold M'Clintock, doing full justice to one and all. After
this, he dissected the whole information that had been obtained by making the fol-

lowing remarks :

"First of all," said he, "what do we know for a certainty concerning the lost

Whyexpedition?    this: 105 persons landed at Point Victory in April 1848, and

Captain Crozier (one of their chiefs) said that he or they, or some of them, were going

to start on the 26th for Back's Fish River. They do not say a word about being in

want of assistance, nor yet that they are suffering. They have abandoned their

ships and are going southward, even as Captain M'Clure had intended to do with a

part of his crew.

   " This is all we positively know from any written evidence. What else we know

-- --is from other testimony. It is as follows s Three skeletons perhaps belonging to
--the 105, perhaps not have been found ; also a boat. Forty of our countrymen

were seen by the natives in the spring of 1850 walking to the Fish River, where,
later in the year, it is said that some of them died. Traces of others have been

found part of the way up the Fish River, and along the Boothian Isthmus, the coasts
of Boothia, and King William Island. Rumours of white men, going westward
along the coast of America, have been heard for several years past. To Cape War-

ren, the Peel River, the Fish River, and, about the Melville Peninsula, strange tales
attach great interest. These places have yet to be searched, and the mystery con-

nected with them examined.

  --" Such is what we know. Now what is it we suppose ? Briefly this : From

April 1848 to the spring of 1850 is two years. Clearly the party must have been

wandering about during that interval. What so likely as that, in the summer of
1848, they found open water for their boats, and went away to the westward (or at
all events one party did), and tried to reach the Mackenzie or Peel River. Some may
have perished, some have gone another way than by the coast (possibly by a direct

channel yet undiscovered by us), and finally, being unsuccessful in their western
route, they return to the eastward for Fish River, and perhaps a few of them to-
wards Lancaster Sound, or the channels leading into Baffin Bay; in fact, to any
place, where a hope of relief, and where good hunting would be presented.

   "This hypothesis would explain away the lapse of time, and account for only

forty being seen by the natives in 1850. It is further strengthened by other circum-

stances founded on negative facts.

   "Thev did not take away any of the Fury Beach stores, though well known to

them as'existing at only about 200 miles' distance : they did not send information
of distress through the Esquimaux or Indians, as we now know could have been done,
even as Captain Collinson and Captain Maguire sent notices of relief: they did not
sav a word about being starving or in want of immediate aid ; and many other
things thev did not do, which we should expect would have been done, in case of
great distress. Hence we may infer that in April 1848 they were not so badly off
as is supposed. Had they been so, why did they not visit the Fury Beach stores
and get relief? Those stores are even now in excellent order, as may be known from
Captain M'Clintock's published Journal. Yet we find them unused, at all events
                                                                                    TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                                                                   181

for any large supply, though it is possible they may have been visited by a few of

the lost party.

   " Remarks have been made about the Franklin Expedition suffering from Goldner's

provisions. But, independent of all other argument on this point, there is one fact to

--be got over, before we can agree to such an idea ; the ships wintered at the threshold

of their explorations, yet afterwards went onward into unknown regions instead of

returning, as wisdom would have dictated, on finding their stores defective!

"Another fact to be well considered is, that close attention to all the information

obtained from the natives, leads to a belief that the actual ground where the whole

truth could be known has not yet been examined. The natives told Captain M'Clin-

tock that the white people had gone to a place where there was plenty of salmon.

Now we know the lakes of South Boothia abound in salmon.

late explorers, perhaps from not knowing where they were. But a careful reading

of the various Arctic Voyages of Parry, Ross, Simpson, and Back, would have

shown that the places named, all exist about the Boothian Isthmus southward ; and
it is there, and in adjoining localities, we find all the plate and other articles in pos-

session of the natives.

" More argument could be brought forward                                                                                                                                                                     but it is enough to call attention to
                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

one other important fact, viz. that Ross and his small crew, after being frozen in
for three years, managed to escape from a position almost identical with that of

Franklin's ships, and then get home by way of Lancaster Sound.

"That we have no traces of the Franklin crews attempting the same thing is very
Wesingular.
                                                  must therefore infer either that they were not in absolute distress,

or else that one party did visit Fury Beach without being able to leave a notice. Be

it as it may, assuredly the Expedition would never have abandoned their journals

and other documents, without first placing them in some sort of security. When

Ross escaped he carried even minerals with him ! These with other things he had to

abandon                                      but he deposited them in a secure place, and they were afterwards brought
                                         ;

home to England in a whaling ship sent expressly to the locality for them. Can we

--suppose that the officers and crew of a national expedition like Franklin's and withal
--a scientific one would not take equal care to preserve the records of their labours?

The question needs no answer. There can be little doubt about it in the minds of all

impartial persons                                                                   and it only requires a good summer search to know the truth."
                                                                                 ;

Captain Snow then brought forward evidence to show that life could be prolonged

in the arctic regions, and that the place was not so destitute as generally supposed.
Sir R. Murchison himself had given good reasons in support of this "view ; and
Lord Wrottesley, Baron von Humboldt, Sir Francis Beaufort and others had ex-
pressed something similar. The burial of the dead, too, was another thing not to be
forgotten. Three sailors were buried suitably on shore, therefore it is almost certain
Sir John Franklin would have been interred in like manner; and as the Esquimaux

are very superstitious concerning the dead, it is possible important records can be

found near the locality where the illustrious chief is known to have died.

Other arguments were brought forward by Captain Snow, who stated that he had

a committee formed of well-known names to aid him in a renewed search he was

prepared to make in a small vessel of from 75 to 100 tons if sufficient means could
Abe raised.
                                             brave American (Mr. Hall) was already on his way there to try and do

the work                                     and it was for our credit and honour that another attempt should be made

STATISTICAL SCIENCE.

Opening Address by Nassau W. Senior, M.A., President of the Section.

In 1856 the General Committee of the British Association decided that the Section
over which I have the honour to preside should be entitled " The Section of Econo-

mic Science and Statistics."

   I have looked through the papers which since that time have been commu-
nicated to us, and I have been struck by the unscientific character of many of them.

I use that word not dyslogistically but merely distinctivingly, merely as ex-

pressing that the writers had wandered from the domain of science into that of art.

' I need scarcely remind you that a Science is a statement of existing facts, an

Art a statement of the means by which future facts may be brought about or in-
A Afluenced.
Science deals in premises, an Art in conclusions.                         Science aims

only at supplying materials for the memory and the judgment. It does not pre-

suppose any purpose beyond the acquisition of knowledge. An Art is intended to

influence the will : it presupposes some object to be attained, and it points out

the easiest, the safest, or the most effectual conduct for that purpose.

The subjects to which the British Association has directed our attention are

Economic Science, and Statistics.
   Economic Science, or, to use a more familiar name, " The Science of Political

Economy," may be defined as " The Science which states the laws regulating the

production and distribution of wealth, so far as they depend on the action of the

human mind."
   I say, " so far as they depend on the action of the human mind," in order to

mark to which of the two great genera of sciences, the Material, or, as they are

usually called, the Physical, and the Mental, or, as they are frequently called, the
Moral, sciences, Political Economy belongs.

   Unquestionably the political economist has much to do with matter. The

phenomena attending the production of material wealth occupy a great part of his
attention ; and these depend mainly on the laws of matter. The efficacy of ma-

chinery, the diminishing productiveness, under certain circumstances, of successive

applications of capital to land, and the fecundity and longevity of the human

species, are all important premises in political economy, and are all laws of matter.
But the political economist dwells on them only with reference to the mental

phenomena which they serve to explain ; he considers them as among the motives
to the accumulation of capital, as among the sources of rent, as among the regulators
of profit, and as among the causes which promote or retard the pressure of popula-

tion on subsistence.
   If the main subject of his studies were the physical phenomena attending the

production of wealth, a system of political economy must contain a treatise on me-

--chanics, on navigation, on agriculture, on chemistry in fact, on the subjects of

almost all the physical sciences and arts, for there are few of those arts or sciences

which are not subservient to wealth. All these details, however, the political
economist avoids, or uses a few of them sparingly for the purpose of illustration.

--He does not attempt to state the mechanical and chemical laws which enable the

steam-engine to perform its miracles he passes them by as laws of matter ; but
he explains, as fully as his knowledge will allow, the motives which induce the

mechanist to erect the steam-engine, and the labourer to work it. And these are
laws of mind. He leaves to the geologist to explain the laws of matter which

occasion the formation of coal, to the chemist to distinguish its component elements,

to the engineer to state the means by which it is extracted, and to the teachers of

many hundred different arts to point out the uses to which it may be applied.
What he reserves to himself is, to explain the laws of mind under which the owner

of the soil allows his pastures to be laid waste, and the minerals which they cover

to be abstracted ; under which the capitalist employs, in sinking shafts and piercing

galleries, funds which might be devoted to his  own  immediate enjoyment                                                                                                       under
                                                                                                                                                                            ;

which the miner encounters the toils and the dangers of his hazardous and laborious
occupation ; and the laws, also laws of mind, which decide in what proportions the
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                      183

produce, or the value of the produce, is divided between the three classes by whose

concurrence it has been obtained.

  When he uses as his premises, as he often must do, facts supplied by physical

science, he does not attempt to  account for them                                                                                  he is satistied with stating; their
                                                                                                                                ;

existence. If he has to prove it, he looks for his proofs, so far as he can, in the

human mind. Thus the economist need not explain why it is that labour cannot

be applied to a given extent of land to an indefinite amount with a proportionate

return. He has done enough when he has proved that such is the fact; and he proves
this by showing, on the principles of human nature, that, if it were otherwise, no

land except that which is most fertile, and best situated, would be cultivated. All

the technical terms, therefore, of political economy, represent either purely mental

ideas, such as demand, utility, value, and abstinence, or objects which, though some

of them may be material, are considered by the political economist so far only as

they are the results or the causes of certain affections of the human mind, such as

wealth, capital, rent, wages, and profits.

The subject matter of political economy is, I repeat, wealth. The political

economist, as such, has nothing to do with any of the other physical or moral

sciences, or with any of the physical or moral arts, excepting so far as they affect the

production or distribution of wealth. Whether wealth be a good or an evil, whe-

ther it be conducive to human morality or to human happiness, that it be hoarded

or that it be consumed, that it be accumulated in masses, or that it be generally

diffused, are questions beyond his science. His business is to state what are the

effects on the production and distribution of wealth, or, to use a shorter expression,

the economic effects, of accumulation and of expenditure, of the different kinds of con-

sumption, and of the aggregation in a few hands, or the division among many, of the

things of which wealth consists. Whenever he gives a precept, whenever he ad-

vises his reader to do any thing, or to abstain from doing anything, he wanders

from science into art, generally into the art of morality, or the art of government.

   The science of statistics is far wider a3 to its subject matter. It applies to all
phenomena which can be counted and recorded. It deals equally with matter and
with mind. Perhaps the most remarkable results of the statistician's labours are
those which show that the human will obeys laws nearly as certain as those which

regulate matter.

   There are countries in which we find year after year the same number of marriages
at the same ages and in the same proportion to the population, the same number
of children to a marriage, the same number of bankruptcies, and the same number
of crimes and suicides, committed at the same ages, and by each sex in permanent
proportions ; in which the average height, the average weight, the average con-
sumption and production of commodities, and the average longevity, of men and of
women, continue for long periods unaltered.

   There are others in which the number or the proportion of these events varies
in which marriages, births, deaths, crimes, consumption and production, and even

the average stature are different at different periods. This uniformity, or these

differences, are detected by the statistician. His task is over when he has stated and
recorded them. It is the business of the legislator to draw from the figures of the
statistician, practical inferences. To ascertain the circumstances, moral, commercial,
or political, under which the tribute paid by his countiyruen to insolvency, crime,

sickness and death, has been increased, has been diminished, or has remained
stationary--these circumstances will often appear to be under control, and by
watching the statistical results of every attempt to control them, he will ascertain
whether they are under control or not.

  We have been told that a statesman " reads his history in a nation's eyes."

 I should rather say that he reads it in a nation's figures.

    But it is not only to the statesman that statistics are useful, many of the most

important and most useful employments of capital depend on them. Vital statistics
 are the base of life insurance. They decide the value of annuities, of life estates,

and of reversions. Every man in the management of his property has to consult
them. The statistics of fires regulate fire insurance, those of wrecks regulate
 marine insurance. Wherever the success or failure of an undertaking depends on
184 REPORT-- 1860.

the calculation of chnnees, and wherever the events subject to those chances have
been observed and recorded in numbers sufficient to afford an average, the prudence
or imprudence of the undertaking depends on that average. To give that average
is the business of the statistician. To act on it is the business of the speculator. If

in London one house in two thousand were burnt down every year, nothing would
be gained or lost by insuring houses in London at a shilling per cent, per annum.

If one in a thousand were burnt down, such insurance would be ruinous. If only one

in three thousand, it would be very profitable. But, I repeat that the observation,

the recording and the arranging facts, which is the science of statistics, and the

ascertaining, from observation and from consciousness, the general laws which

regulate men's actions with respect to production and exchange, which is the

science of political economy, are distinct from the arts to which those sciences are

Wesubservient.  cease to be scientific as soon as we advise or dissuade, or even

approve or censure.

I said, that I had been led into this train of thought by looking through the

papers which have been communicated to this Section since 1856. I find that we

received during that year " Suggestions on the education of the people."

We had a paper, " On the general principles by which Reformatory Schools
Weought to be regulated."
                             had another, " On the importance of open and public

Competitive Examinations."

In  1857 we had one on the prevention of crime                                                                                                                                                                                                      one on the reasons for extending
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

limited liability to joint-stock banks                                                                                                                                                                     and one on the apprenticeship system in re-
                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

spect to freedom of labour.

In 1858 we had one on the principle of open competition ; one on public service,

academic and teacher's examinations ; one on the importance of a colonial penny

postage to the advancement of science and civilization ; and one on the race and

language of the gvpsies.

If it be said that in all these papers, except indeed the very last, there was a

reference to statistical facts, or to economic principles, and that therefore they were

properly communicated to this Section, the answer is, that there is no province of

the great arts of legislation, of administration, of commerce, of war, indeed, of any

of the arts which deal with human feelings, in which frequent reference must not

be made to political economy, and occasional reference to statistics. There is
scarcely a moral art therefore of which we should not be able to take cognizance.

But I do not think that such an extension of our jurisdiction would be advi-

sable. I believe that in mental, as in manual arts, the division of labour is useful.

Within the strict limits of economic science and statistics a large field is open to us.

It appears to me that we shall do well, if, as far as may be practicable, without
much inconvenience, we confine ourselves within it, and deviate as little as we can

into the numerous arts to which those sciences afford principles.

On Educational Help from the Government Grant to the destitute and neg-
         lected children of Great Britain. By Mary Carpenter.

The educational movement, as such, is of comparatively recent date in our

country. The importance of popular education was not generally acknowledged in

England fifty years ago : but yet as early as in the sixteenth century there were

distinct efforts made to give instruction to the very poorest, as is proved by the King

Edward and many other endowed Charity Schools. These gradually became

employed by a higher class than the children for whom they were originally in-

tended, and a part of the population were uncared for. In 1781 Raikes began the

first Sunday school for outcast children ; in 1800 Bell and Lancaster began day

schools, to give gratuitous instruction to the very lowest. Now the Sunday schoofs

no longer receive the vagrant children, and the Bell and Lancaster schools have

Agradually merged into the National and British pay schools.                                                                                                                                                                                        large class of the

people are instructed by these schools, but those who most need instruction are not

able to attend them.

At the Educational Conference in 1857, H.R.H. Prince Albert stated that there
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                   185

are 2,200,000 children in England and Wales not at school, whose absence cannot
be traced to any legitimate cause. If Government educational help is given to
any portion of the population, it ought, for the good of society, to be directed
efficiently towards these. From this uneducated mass spring the pauperism and
crime which are so great a national burden. Union Inspectors find the state of
degraded ignorance in which children usually come to the workhouse indicative

of the existence of a large portion of the population untouched by existing institutions;

in Liverpool, out of 19,336 persons apprehended in 9 months, only 3 per cent, could
read and write. Industrial and Ragged Schools alone have attempted distinctly to
act on this class. Wherever they have been well conducted and efficiently siqjported

they have completely effected the object intended, but many have failed from want
of teaching power. The children of this class, in addition to ordinary instruction,
must have much moral and industrial training, and schools capable of acting on
them must be adapted to their wants, and of a very different character from the

ordinary pay schools.
   The Committee of Council on Education, in administering the Parliamentary

Grant, have adapted their regulations to the pay schools ; in 1859, 0222 Certifi-
cated Teachers for them were partially paid, receiving £80,328 ; Assistants, £6244;
Pupil Teachers, £252,550; thus providing a good teaching power for 9555 schools.

No teaching power (except a gratuity to certified masters, who very seldom are

qualified for such schools) and no educational help is allowed to the schools for the

destitute and neglected children.
   The importance of giving an efficient teaching- power to the lowest and most

ignorant children was acknowledged by Parliament in 1849, when an annual grant of
.£30,000 was made to teachers in union schools, with a much lower test than that
required for certificated masters. The Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry, in

1853, into the Condition of Criminal and Destitute Juveniles, reported the " bene-
ficial effects produced on the most destitute classes " by the Ragged and Industrial
schools, and their need of help from the Educational Grant ; that aid is still re-
quired, to carry out efficient action on the destitute and neglected children of

Great Britain.

   On the Physiological as well as Psychological Limits to Mental Labour.

                       By Edwin Chadwick, Esq., C.B.

The business of education still requires for its successful prosecution, scientific ob-

--servation, and the study of the subject to be operated upon the human mind. Even

to empirical observation, it should have suggested itself that the mind has conditions
of growth which are required to be carefully noted, to adapt the amount of in-
struction intended to be given to the power of receiving it. It is a psj'chological law
that the capacity of attention grows with the body, and that at all stages of bodily
growth the capacity is increased by the skilful teacher's cultivation. Very young
children can only receive lessons of one or two minutes' length. With increasing

growth and cultivation, their capacity of attention is increased to five minutes ; then
to ten, and at from five to seven years of age, to fifteen minutes. With growth and

cultivation, by the tenth year a bright voluntaiy attention may be got to a lesson

of twenty minutes ; at about twelve years of age to twenty-five minutes ; and from
thence to fifteen years of age, about half an hour : that is to say, of lessons requiring
mental effort, as arithmetic, not carried beyond the point at which the mind is

fatigued, with the average of children and with good teaching. By very skilful
teachers and with very interesting lessons, the attention may be sustained for longer

!>eriods ; but it is declared by observers that prolonged attention beyond average
 imits is generally at the expense of succeeding lessons.

   The preponderant testimony which I have received in the course of some inquiries
into educational subjects, is that with children of about the average age of ten, or
eleven, or a little more, the capacity of bright voluntary attention, which is the

cises requiring mental effort of half an hour each in the forenoon, even with inter-

vals of relief. After the mid-day meal the capacity of voluntary attention is gene-

rally reduced by one-half, and not more than two half-hour lessons requiring mental

effort can be given with profit.

The capacity of attention is found to be greater in cold weather than in hot, in

winter than in summer.

I collect that the good ventilation, lighting, and warming of a school-room will

augment the capacity of attention of the pupils by at least one-fifth, as compared

with that of the children taught in school-rooms of the common construction.

   I also collect, that the capacity of attention varies with bodily strength and

weakness. It is reported to me that school-boys, of nearly the same ages and con-

ditions, of the same school-rooms, and under the same tuition, being weighed, and

divided into two classes, the light and the heavy, the attainments, as denoted by

the number of marks obtained, were found to be the greatest with the heaviest,

that is to say, those of the greatest health and bodily strength.

   These were chiefly of town-bom children, of common habits. The robust

children of rural districts, of less cultivated habits of attention, are found to be

slower in receiving ideas ; but with cultivation they are brought up to equal

capacities of attention, and to greater retentiveness of the matter taught, than the

common classes of town-born children.

There are differences in the capacities of attention in different races, or in the

habits of attention created previously to the school-period by parents of different

races. The teacher of a large school in Lancashire, who had acted as a school-

teacher in the southern counties, rated the capacity of attention of the native Lanca-

shire children as 5 to 4, as compared with those in Norfolk. In other instances the

differences were wider.

  Experienced teachers have testified to me that they can and do exhaust the

capacity of attention, to lessons requiring mental effort, of the great average of

children attending the primary schools in England, in less than three hours of

daily book instruction, namely, two hours in the morning, and one hour after the

mid-day meal.

Infants are kept in school, and the teacher is occupied in amusing and instruct-

ing them, for live or six hours, but the duration of mental effort in the aggregate

bears only a short proportion to the whole time during which they are kept

together. So in schools for children of more advanced ages. Even the smaller

amount of mental effort in infant schools is, however, subject to dangerous excess.

I am assured by a teacher in the first infant school established in Scotland, that he
did not know a pre-eminently sharp child who had in after life been mentally

distinguished.

In common schools, on the small scale, the children will frequently be not more

than one-half the time under actual tuition ; and in schools deemed good, often

one-third of their time is wasted in changes of lessons, writing, and operations

which do not exercise, but rather impair the receptive faculty.

   It may be stated generally that the psychological limit of the capacity of attention

and of profitable mental labour is about one-half the common school-time of

children, and that beyond that limit instruction is profitless.

This I establish in this way. Under the Factories Act, whilst much of the in-

struction is of an inferior character and effect, from the frustration of the provi-

sions of the original bill, there are now numerous voluntary schools, in which the
instruction is efficient. The limit of the time of instruction required by the statute

in these half-time schools for factory children is three hours of daily school teaching,

the common average being six in summer and five in winter. There are also

pauper district industrial schools, where the same hours, three daily, or eighteen

in the week, or the half-time instruction, are prescribed ; which regulation is in
some instances carried out on alternate days of school teaching and on alternate

days of industrial occupation. Throughout the country there are now mixed schools,

where the girls are employed a part of the clay in needlework, and part of the day

Nowin book instruction.  I have received the testimony of school inspectors and

of school teachers, that the girls fully equal in book attainments the boys who are-

occupied during the whole day in book instruction. The preponderant testimony is
that in the same schools, where the half-time factory pupils are instructed with the

full-time day scholars, the book attainments of the half-time scholars are fully equal
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  187

to those of the full-time scholars, i. e. the three hours' are as productive as the six

hours' mental labour daily. The like results are obtained in the district pauper
schools. In one large establishment, containing about six hundred children, half
girls and half boys, the means of industrial occupation were gained for the girls
before any were obtained for the boys. The girls were therefore put upon half-
time tuition, that is to say, their time of book instruction was reduced from thirty-

six hours to eighteen hours per week, giren on the three alternate days of their

industrial occupation, the boys remaining at full school-time of thirty-six per week

--the teaching being the same, on the same system and by the same teachers, the

same school attendance in weeks and years, in both cases. On the periodical
examination of the school, surprise was expressed by the inspectors at finding how
much more alert mentally the girls were than the boys, and in advance in book attain-
ments. Subsequently industrial occupation was found for the boys, when their
time of book instruction was reduced from thirty-six hours a week to eighteen ; and

after a while the boys were proved upon examination to have obtained their previous
relative position, which was in advance of the girls. The chief circumstances to

effect this result, as respects the boys, were the introduction of active bodily exer-
cises, the naval and the military drill, and the reduction of the duration of the

school teaching to within what appear to me to be the psychological limits of the

capacity of voluntary attention.

   When book instruction is given under circumstances combining bodily with

mental exercises, not only are the book attainments of the half-time scholars proved
to be more than equal to those of the full-time scholars, but their aptitudes for
applying them are superior, and they are preferred by employers for their superior

alertness and efficiency.

   In the common course of book instruction, and in the average of small but well-
managed long-time schools, children after leaving an infant school are occupied on

the average six years in learning to read and write and spell fairly, and in acquiring

proficiency in arithmetic up to decimal fractions. In the larger half-time schools,
with a subdivision of educational labour, the same elementary branches of instruc-
tion are taught better in three years, and at about half the annual expense for

superior educational power.

    The general results stated, I have collected from the experience during a period of
from twelve to fifteen years of schools, comprising altogether between ten and twelve
thousand pupils. From such experience it appears that the general average school-

time is in excess full double of the psychological limits of the capacities of the
average of children for lessons requiring mental effort.

   I have not hitherto been enabled to cany my inquiries to any sufficient extent

for a statement of particular results, to the schools for children or youth of the
higher ages, but I believe it will be found that the school and collegiate require-

ments are everywhere more or less in excess of psychological limits. 1 gather that
the average study, continuous and mental liibour, of successfid prizemen at the uni-
versities is fromfive hours and a half to little more than six hours of close mental

labour or exertion from day to day. An able Oxford examiner informs me, that if

he ever hears that some one is coming up for examination who has been reading
twelve or thirteen hours a day, he is accustomed to exclaim, " that man will be

plucked!" and during his experience of thirteen years as an examiner at Oxford,

he has never known an instance to the contrary. In respect to the mental labour
 of adults, it is observed by Sir Benjamin Brodie in his 'Psychological Inquiries,'--

"A mail in a profession may be engaged in professional matters for twelve or

thirteen hours daily, and suffer no very great inconvenience beyond that which may
be traced to bodily fatigue. The greater part of what he has to do (at least it is so

after a certain amount of experience) is nearby the same as that which he has done

many times before, and becomes almost matter of course. He uses not only his

 previous knowledge of facts, or his simple experience, but his previous thoughts,
 and the conclusions at which he had arrived formerly ; and it is only at intervals
that he is called upon to make any considerable mental exertion. But at every step
 in the composition of his philosophical works Lord Bacon had to think, and no one

 can be engaged in that which requires a sustained effort of thought for more than

 a very limited portion of the twenty-four hours, &c.

    "But great things are accomplished more frequently by moderate efforts persevered

in with intervals of relaxation during a very long' period. I Lave been informed
that Cuvier was usually engaged for seven hours daily in his scientific researches
but these were not of a nature to require continuous thought. Sir Walter Scott,

if my recollection be accurate, describes himself as having devoted about six hours

dailv to literary composition, and his mind was then in a state to enjoy some lighter
pursuits afterwards. After his misfortunes, however, he allowed himself no relaxa-
tion, and there can be little doubt that this over-exertion contributed as much as
the moral suffering which he endured to the production of the disease of the brain,
which ultimately caused his death. Sir David WilMe found that he was exhausted,
if employed in his peculiar line of art for more than four or five hours daily ; and
it is probable that it was to relieve himself from the effects of too great labour that
he turned to the easier occupation of portrait-painting. In fact, even among the
higher grades of mind there are but a few that are capable of sustained thought,

--repeated day after day, for a much longer period than this." P. 9-13.

   Sir Benjamin Brodie has stated to me that he subsequently ascertained that in

the above passage he had rather exceeded the limits of the mental labour of Sir
Walter Scott, who, in a conversation on the topic, in the presence of Sir Charles
Lyell and Mr. Lockhart, had declared that he worked for three hours with pleasure,

but that beyond about four hours he worked with pain. Sir Benjamin states to me

that he is of opinion " that for young children three or four hours' occupation in
school must be even more than sufficient, and that they will be found in the end to
have made greater progress, if their exertions are thus limited, than if they are
continued for a longer period."

   In large public establishments in which I have had an executive direction, I have
not found it practicable to sustain, on the average, for longer than six hours per
diem, from day to day, continuous and steady mental labour on the part of adults.

   I find ground for the belief that as more and more of mental effort and skill is
required in the exercise of the manual arts, the hours of work must be more and
more reduced for the attainment of the best economical results without waste of
the bodily power.

   The psychological limits to mental labour are governed by physiological limits,
which in the case of young children are first indicated by bodily pain experienced,
in continued sedentary constraint, from suppressed muscular activity, or from mus-
cular irritability. As respects children, the physiological case is put in the follow-
ing letter which I wrote to Professor Owen, and in his answer :

  --" Dear Owen, Permit me to submit to you for your consideration and for my

instruction, some questions on topics of observation made from time to time offi-
cially on the common practice of popular education, whether, in the duration of
sedentary attention which its theory requires, it is not at variance with elementary

principles of physiology ?

   " First, let me observe upon the very young of our species, their mobility at the

--periods of growth, particularly in infancy, their constant changes of bodily position,
-- --when free to change, their incessant desire for muscular exertion, their changes,

short at first, longer as growth advances,--these changes being excited by quickly
varying objects of mental attention, and forming incessantly varying alternations of
exertion and repose, with manifestations of pleasure when allowed free scope for

them, of pain when long restrained. Now to what physiological conditions do

these alternations of exertion and repose subserve ?

   "When obstructed and subjected to constraints for long periods, and when pain

and mental irritation and resistance are excited amongst classes, are not the pain and
resistance to be taken as a remonstrance of nature against a violation of its laws ?

   u The theory of the common practice of school instruction is of five and as much

as six hours' quietude, and for intervals of three hours each, perfect muscular inac-
tivity and stillness of very young and growing children from seven to ten years old,
 and during this constrained muscular inactivity, continuous mental attention and

 labour.

    " To ensure these conditions of continued bodily inactivity and prolonged mental
labour, the common office of the schoolmaster is everywhere a war for the repres-
sion of resistances and incipient rebellions. But are not these resistances excited
by nature itself? Are not desk cutting, whittling with knives, mischief, conditions
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  189

of irritability, manifestations of excessive constraints against physiology ? If the

condition of muscular inactivity were completely enforced, what does physiology

tell us may be expected from these restraints ? I might ask you, indeed, 'whether
much of the insanitary conditions of our juvenile and very young populations are
not consequences following from them ?

   " First, there is the proverbial pale-facedness of the young scholar, and a lower

bodily condition of those who are subject to the confinement of schools, even of the
best construction and ventilation, than of those who are free from them and at

large, at liberty to follow natural instincts.

   " When the weakly fail in health in a marked degree under the restraints of the

school, the remedy is restoration to natural freedom, which commonly leads to
improved health. I cannot but attribute to the lowering of the system and bodily
debility produced by this excessive school constraint (even where there is good ven-
tilation), and the consequent exposure to epidemic conditions and other passing

causes of disease, a large share of our juvenile mortality, especially between seven

and ten years of age, when the opportunities of retrieving the effects of the school

Constraints by athletic exercises are less than at later periods.
   " But the constraints of a school are accomplished most fully in girls' schools, more

especially in boarding schools, where the sedentary application of young children
is extended to eight hours daily, and diseases are attendant upon them, which I
cannot help ascribing largely to violations of the laws of physiology. In Manchester,
with the increase of prosperity, an increased proportion of females have been sent

to boarding schools and high class schools with long hours; and I am assured
by Mr. Roberton, who is especially conversant with the diseases of females, that
the proportion of the mothers of the middle class who cannot suckle their own
children is increasing. He has shown me statistically that, with all the care be-
stowed upon females who have been so highly educated, the failures and deaths

in childbirth are full sevenfold greater than amongst females of a lower condition

in life, who have had less school restraint and sedentary application, and more

freedom and muscular development in childhood. Cases of spinal distortion, ner-
vous disorder, nervous mania, and hysteria, prevail peculiarly amongst the middle
and higher class of females, whose education has been of prolonged sedentary occu-

pation, even under the best sanitary conditions in other respects. As applied to
them, it is a proverbial observation that ' ailing mothers make moaning children.'

A lady who was eminent as a boarding-school teacher, but who has retired from

business, has observed painful evidence of the injury done by the prolonged hours
of sedentary application which custom and the demands of parents require, and

she confirms the experience of the best half-time schools, that better instruction

might be given in shorter hours. I have received a body of evidence from able
teachers, that they can and do exhaust the capacity of attention to book instruction
in half the time for which sustained attention to such instruction and bodily in-
activity is demanded by custom.

    " But what I seek is the sanction of your opinion, as to whether, if the laws of
physiology be duly consulted for providing a sound body for a sound mind, other
treatment is needed than that which prevails in schools, of requiring five or six

hours of sedentary occupation for children in the infantile stage, and seven or eight
for those in the juvenile stage? I appeal to you more particularly from the fact,
that in lectures and papers the teaching of physiology is insisted upon as an addi-
tional element of popular education, and an additional demand of time in those
schools, the whole condition and theory and attempted practice of which, though

not yet so recognized generally by professors of the science, appears to me to be a

large violation of it, and an offence against infantile nature.

                                                                                          "Yours ever, &c."

  My --" dear Ciiadwick, I have perused and carefully considered every point in

the inquiry which you have addressed to me, and I concur completely with your
belief in the agreement with nature of the changes you recommend in the distribu-

tion and change of the periods devoted to school restraint and studies, and to bodily
 exercise and relaxation.

    " All the nutritive functions and actions of growth proceed more vigorously and

--rapidly in childhood and youth than in mature life, not merely as regards the
--190 REPORT 1860.

solids and ordinary fluids, but also in the production of those imponderable and
interchangeable forces which have sometimes been personified as · nervous fluid,'

' muscular force,' &c. Using the latter term to exemplify my meaning, the excess of

nervous force is in the child most naturally and healthily reduced by its conversion
into muscular force ; and at very short intervals, during the active or waking period
of life, the child instinctively uses its muscles, and relieves the brain and nerves of
their accumulated force, which passes, by the intermediate contraction of the mus-

cular fibre, into ordinary force or motion, exemplified by the child's own movements,
and by those of some object or other which has attracted its attention.

   " The tissues of the growing organs, braiu, muscles, &c, are at this period of
life too soft to bear a long continuance of their proper actions ; their fibres have
not attained their mature tone and firmness : this is more especially the case with
the brain-fibre. The direct action of the brain, as in the mental application to learn-

ing, soon tires ; if it be too long continued, the tissues are unhealthily affected ; the
due progress of growth, which should have resulted in a fibre fit for good and con-
tinuous labour at maturity, is interfered with ; the child, as an intellectual instrument,

is to that extent spoiled by an error in the process by which that instrument waa

sought to be improved.

   " The same effect on the muscular system is exemplified in the racers that are

now trained to run, at 2^ or 3 years' old, for the gi-and prizes at Doneaster or Epsom.
The winner of the ' Derby ' never becomes an ' Eclipse ' or ' Flying Childers,' because

the muscular system has been overwrought two or three years before it could have
arrived at its full development, which development is stopped by the premature

over-exertion.

   " If the brain be not stimulated to work, but is allowed to rest ; and if, at the
same time, the muscles be forbidden to act, there then arises, if this restraint bo
too prolonged, an overcharged state of the nervous system. It is such a state as

we see exemplified in the caged quadruped of active habits, when it seeks to relieve
it by converting the nervous into the muscular force to the extent permitted by its

prison, either executing a succession of bounds against the prison-bars, like the agile
leopard, or stalking, like the lion, sullenly to and fro.

   " If the active child be too long prevented from gratifying the instinctive impulse
to put in motion its limbs or body, the nervous system becomes overcharged, and

the relief may at last be got by violent emotions or acts, called 'passion' or 'naughti-

ness,' ending in the fit of crying and flood of tears.

   "But all these impediments to a healthy development of the nervous system
might be obviated by regulations, based on the system which you rightly advocate,
providing for more frequent alternations of labour and rest, of study and play, of
mental exertion and muscular exercise ; in other words, by briefer and more frequent
periods allotted to those phases of educational procedure, and modified to suit two

or three divisions of the scholars, according to age.

   " The powers and workings of the human frame concerned in the complex acts
and influences, which you have asked me to explain physiologically, are amongst
the most recondite and difficult in our science. You will therefore comprehend

and excuse my short-comings in trying to fulfil your wish. But, on the main point,

I have no doubt that your aim is in close accordance with the nature of the delicate,
and, for good or evil, easily impressible organization of the child.

                                                        " Believe me, ever truly yours,

                                                                                  " Richard Owen."

    It is difficult to separate distinctly the evils arising from the excess of simple

bodily inactivity, from the results of the common insanitary conditions of schools-

bad ventilation, bad lighting, bad warming, and overcrowding. These, however,
are attended by epidemic and eruptive diseases, which ravage the infantile com-
munity. Simple constraint appears to be attended by enervation and obstructed
functions, and thence maladies of another class. The preventive of these is the
occupation of children, with means of physical training, with systematized gym-

nastics, including swimming, and the naval and military drill. Where there have

been good approximations to the proper physiological as well as the psychological
conditions, as in the half-time industrial district schools, epidemic diseases have
been banished, and the rate of mortality reduced to one-third of that which prevails

amongst the general community, and in England and Wales alone, where upward

of a quarter of a million of children are annually swept away from preventible
disease, which enervates those who survive. Four labourers, -who have had the
advantage of this improved physical and mental training-, are proved to be as effi-

cient as live or more of those who have not. I am prepared to show that by ad-

ministrative improvements in the application of the principles in question, double

the population may be physically and mentally trained well at the expense of

educating the existing numbers ill.

tion to the great national importance of the Herring Fishery on the British coasts;
and stated that the propriety of affording every encouragement and protection to
it has been already affirmed by this Association, in its proposing for one of its
objects " The improvement and extension of the British Fisheries ; " and the author,
in pointing out its importance, quoted the following extract from Baron Cuvier's
' Natural History of Fishes,' vol. xx. pp. 30, 31 :

    <· Far son inepuisable recondite le hareng est ime de ces productions naturelles

dont l'emploi decide la destinee des empires. La gTaine du cafier, la feuille du the",

les Apices de la zone torride, le ver a soie, ont moins influe sur les richesses des

pides, des navigateurs experimentes. L'industrie que s'empare des produits de ce
peche sait en faire l'objet d'un commerce, source des richesses inepuisables."

   Many Acts of Parliament for the purpose of encouraging the fishery, from an
early period downwards, had been passed by the Legislature; but, owing to the

want of the knowledge of the natural history and habitat of the herring, they
proved either injurious or abortive, although bolstered up with bounties and pre-
miums ; and the fishery would not have become of any importance had not a local
board of unpaid Commissioners been established, with efficient officers acquainted
with the localities, so that the fishery might be prosecuted with success at the

properly ascertained seasons. The Board was established in 180S, and its beneficial
operations would be proved by the statistics of the progress of the fishery ; and it
will be seen that this fishery became, and is now, one of the greatest and most
prosperous iu the world, and is now only in danger from improper interference, if it
is not guarded and controlled by the influence and opinions of scientific and intelli-

gent men, such as are found at this Association.
   To prove the great interest that is taken by other maritime nations in the Herring

Fishery, he stated that an interesting discussion took place at the French Academy

in 1855, on the question of the migration of the herring, with no satisfactory
results, from the want of the knowledge of facts : also, that the Government of
Norway had been occupied for several years past in legislating with the view of
promoting the Herring Fishery on the coasts of that country; and that in Sweden
an elaborate report had been prepared, by the authority of the Government of that
country, by one of the heads of the civil department, M. von Wright, with the
view of obtaining information as to the cause of the total disappearance of the vast
shoals of herrings that formerly visited the Swedish coasts; and that the Govern-
ment of Holland is anxiously occupied in obtaining information on the subject, and

has employed scientific men to investigate the subject of the visits of the herrings,
and to prepare reports. The results of these observations, made on board of forty-

five of the Dutch fishery busses, are given in a work published by the authority of
the Dutch Government, which has been thought of such importance that the
British Board of Trade has ordered a translation of it to be made and published for
general information ; and it is important that it should be known that this move-
ment of the Government of Holland is caused by the lately rapid declension of the
Dutch Fishery, and that Government, seeing the rapid progress of the British Fishery
on our coasts, has established a system of superintendence and regulation similar to
that so successfully promoted by the Fishery Board.

   He said that there were many subjects for inquiry which do not properly belong

to our Fishery Board, the Commissioners of which and their officers have special

duties to perform under legislative enactments, and it may therefore be considered

as a reproach to this country, which gains so abundant a supply of food of the best
description, while at the same time securing a large force of useful mariners ready

to defend our coasts, and in the day of peril to man our navy, that no efficient
efforts have yet been made to elucidate the natural history of the herring.

   At the present time we seem to pay too little attention to the fostering of our

native industry ; it is surely obvious that in encouraging the search for gold in our

colonies, we are losing, or sending away from our own country, some of the most

enterprising and industrious of our inhabitants, not easily to be replaced ; while by
encouraging the search for the golden treasures on our own coasts, as truly said by

the distinguished author, Cuvier, we create those men of so much value to a
maritime country "intrepid and iiobust mariners," besides adding every year
additional supplies of food and "inexhaustible biches."

    To prove the great advantage of the system of superintendence and inspection of
the Fishery Board and their officers, some statistics were given of the progress of the
Fishery : among others the following :

   When the Fishery Board was first established in 1803, the quantity of herrings

cured and salted in barrels was 93,185 barrels, while in 1855 the quantity cured

was 766,703 barrels ; and adding the quantity sold fresh, 130,759 barrels, we find

--the total quantity of herrings caught in that year was 897,462 barrels yielding at

a moderate calculation the value of one million sterling, which may be safely taken

 as the average annual value of the herrings fished on the coasts of Scotland, without

calculating the quantity caught at Yarmouth and other places on the English and
Irish coasts, which are principally sold fresh or smoked.

    Before an efficient system of legislation and regulation was adopted in this
country, the demand from abroad was inconsiderable, but it has annually increased
 since : for instance, in 1812 the quantit}- exported to the Continent was only 4720;
in 1815 it amounted to 35,891 ; in 1840 to 82,351 ; in 1845 to 143,754 ; in 1850 to

257,108 ; and in 1855 the quantity exported was 344,029. And to show how rapid

 the progress has been in foreign markets of the sale of British herrings, he gave the
amouut of the British, Dutch, Danish and Norwegian herrings imported into one of

the largest exporting towns in Prussia (Stettin) in successive years.

and in 1855 the quantity of British herrings amounted to 160,572 barrels--about
nine times the quantity sent in 1825 to Stettin ; and as the herrings are carefully
separated, assorted and packed into proper-sized barrels, cured under the eye of the
inspecting officers, the British herrings haye become known, in consequence, as
a safe and staple article of commerce, and are imported into various other ports;
for instance, there were exported to the following ports in 1855

       Konigsberg                                           14,417

And it is interesting to know that at the fishery stations in Scotland there were

employed in the year referred to, Fishing Boats 11,251, the tonnage being 77,794;
and the fishermen, coopers and others employed, amounted to 91,139, of which
91,139 people directly employed, 39,266 were fishermen. These statistics apply to
the Scottish coasts only, where the greatest shoals of herrings resort ; but there are

other places, as already stated, such as Yarmouth, where many of the fishermen are

occupied in fishing herrings in the usual seasons.

   It is necessary that the truth should be known as to the progressive prosperity

and increase of the Herring Fishery, because there are some authors who are in-

clined to depreciate our national productions and progress ; for instance, we find

McCulloch, in his 'Dictionary of Commerce,' which is considered a text-book and
standard work by a certain class of readers, saying " the Dutch have uniformly
maintained their ascendency in the Herring Fishery since the earliest period," and
that " ours remains in a very unhealthy and feeble state."

   As already stated, the Dutch Herring Fishery is in a declining state, and instead
of 300 busses proceeding annually to the fishery, as was the case not many years
ago, the number has been gradually decreasing, .and does not now exceed 60 busses
but on our coasts great prosperity is evident from the progress of the population,

the increase of towns and villages, and from the comfortable state of the fishermen
and their families, and the great circulation of wealth that must exist by an annual

increase of one million sterling taken out of the sea on our own coasts.
   The value of this great fishery should teach us the propriety of carefully fostering

and protecting it ; and to enable us to do so efficiently, we must have some know-

ledge of the natural history and habits of the herring, as well as accurate statistcis.

He said he was prepared to prove tbat the herring was a native of the seas adjacent

to the coast to which it resorted ; and in conclusion, he said that to promote its

prosperity, or even to protect it, legislation was necessary, and power should be
given to prevent the disturbance of the spawn, and the indiscriminate destruction
of the young herring or fry. The fishery grounds during the proper season shonld

be attended by the proper number of ships of war, to prevent disputes and disturb-
ance among the fishermen, and to prevent the large fishing vessels from driftino-

into the smaller ones. He recommended that the Fishery Board established in

Scotland, should be extended to England and Ireland, as calculated to increase the
prosperity of the fisheries and the number of fishermen and seamen suitable for

the navy.

Before concluding he produced a copy of a letter written by him to the Rio-ht

Hon. the Lord Advocate of Scotland, to prove that it is absolutely necessary°for

the protection of the fishermen and the merchants that the system of inspection by
the Fishery Officers be continued to preserve order among the fishermen during the
fishing season, to prevent the fishermen u?ing illegal nets, and to prevent the
fishermen being defrauded by illegal measures; and more particularly as the
merchant buys perhaps several thousand barrels at a time, that the necessity of

--opening the barrels and seeing the herrings may be avoided ; and the various onerous

 duties of the officers he thus enumerates :

    " 1. They are the police of the fishery, who maintain and have the power to en-
force order. Much fraud and disorder existed before the officers were appointed
at present such cannot exist without being repressed. [This may be said to be the

 only constabulary force paid out of the national funds in Scotland, and costs only
 £14,000 per annum. The constabulary force in Ireland, paid out of the national
 funds, costs £050,000 per annum.]

  --" 2. They protect the fishermen in this way, the measure or cran by which they

 are paid for their fish must be of legal size and branded. Formerly it was often
 made too large, and the fishermen were defrauded.

    " 3. They prevent the meshes or squares of the net from being made below the
 proper size, which, if so made, would take the young and inferior herring.

    " 4. They see that the fishermen do not fish during the day and on Sunday.
 In a paper I read at the Literary Institute the other day, I proved that three im-
 portant fisheries were annihilated by this practice of fishing during the day.

    "5. They prevent, as far as they are authorized by law, the destruction of the
 fry and spawn, which would diminish or annihilate the herrings.

    "6. They point out to the tjTO fish-curer the mode of cure.
    " 7. They see where the fishing localities rise into importance, so that they can
point out where creeks may be improved, by forming fishing harbours and shelter

 for the fishermen.

    "8. They see that the herrings are cured within twenty-four hours after being

 caught.

    " 9. They see that the different kinds of herrings are properly separated .and
 packed in different barrels.

    " 10. They see that they are properly gutted.
    "11. They see that a sufficient quantity of salt is put into the barrels with the

 herrings.

    " 12. They see that they are properly packed in the barrels.
    " 13. They see that they are, after ten days, properly filled up with a sufficiency
 of herrings and pickle.
    " 14. They see that the barrels are of the proper legal size.
    " 15. They see that the barrels are of the requisite materials and strength, which
they formerly were not.
    " 16. They see that no branded barrel is used a second time to cover inferior

 fish.

   " 17. And when all the requirements are attended to, they apply the brands to

the various descriptions of herrings as they have been assorted. There are several

--brands applicable to the different kinds the highest being the crown brand and the

word ' full.' The applying the crown brand is a proof of the officer having watched

--the progress of the cure. It is, in short, the mere Finis coronal opus the opus, or

work, has been going on since the herrings were fished, and the crown proves that
the herrings are merchantable; but the various operations require careful attention
during the whole year."

           Hints on the best Plan of Cottage for Agricultural Labourers.

                     By Henry John Ker Porter, M.R.I. A.

   The present condition of the dwellings of farm labourers requires, I believe, with
some exceptions, improvement no less than the abodes of the labouring classes in
large towns. The drainage and ventilation are generally admitted to be imperfect

but the evil of too much cold air is severely felt in some districts with which 1 am

acquainted ; I have found cottages built of what I have seen in New Zealand and

Australia, and there called " wattle aud dab'' or wicker work, covered withuntem-

pered mortar: these walls cannot keep out the piercing cold in winter; the frame-

work on which the roof rests frequently gives way, and the doors and windows can-

not be kept water-tight.

  I have turned my attention towards their improvement. I have had the large

heavy thatched roofs, where they are good, supported, while new brick walls

have replaced "the wattle and dab," and new doors andjWindows have been added.

I found this alteration cost from £10 to £12 each cottage, and the occupiers were

quite willing to have 5 per cent, on the outlay added to their rent.

  With reference to new buildings, I have the pleasure to present to this Section

of the British Association the drawings of a cottage which I found from practical

experience to be the best suited to the labourer in rural districts. It combines the

advantages of at least three airy bed rooms, a lofty kitchen or living room, and an

apartment which may be turned either into a parlour or a bed room, where the

family is large ; or if neither of those apartments are required, it may form an outer

Akitchen or scullery.  lean-to is added to the end of the house, which forms

a barn to hold the gleaning, the fuel, or other matters, without which no labourer's

cottage can be kept neat and comfortable. Two peculiar features in the cottages I

have built I beg to refer to. Ventilation is secured by a 4-inch square opening near

the ceiling in each apartment; this opening leads the foul air into a small flue of the

same size carried up to the gable of the house, and finding egress in a narrow open-

Whening in the outer side of the wall.  the cottage is built of brick, this adds

nothing to the expense ; when built of stone, it is only the additional cost of the
round tiles for forming the flues. Several of these flues may lead to the upper one,

which of course must be proportionally enlarged to carry oil the increased quantity

of air. In Ireland I built twenty dwellings in a double row of houses, at one side

opening into a court yard, the other into the street of a large market town. Fevers

prevailed in the following year, and several deaths occurred amongst the labouring

classes, and not one death amongst the 100 individuals occupying those houses.

I built two villages ou the same estate, and the medical gentleman whose duty it

was to visit the labouring classes on that property, bore testimony to the value of

the system adopted for ventilation. The other peculiarity in these houses was the

mode in which the window-sashes were made. Every one acquainted with English

cottages of the last half-century, is aware of the misery and expense of lead lights,

never keeping out cold and always wanting repair. Metal has been substituted,

and these are often so imperfect that they fit badly and neither exclude wet

nor cold ; it is the case in school-houses in the parish in which I reside, and there

was no expense spared in their erection. To avoid these difficulties, I adopted

wood for the outer part of the sash, the inner divisions being formed of § inch
hoop iron cut half through where they intersect, and thus forming one of the

strongest sashes possible, with the advantage of being able to add to or take from

the outer sides of the sash, to make them fit tightly ; they open on a pivot let into the

sash ou each side, thus giving the whole size of the window, when necessary, for the

admission of fresh air. I have made a very rude attempt at a model before breakfast

this morning, but it will serve to show the plan of forming the window with the

hoop iron. I have erected one such cottage in the county of Huntingdon, upon the

estate which is placed under my management as agent ; and so manjr tenants have
requested two houses each on their farms, that I am about to build several more,

the money being advanced by the Land Improvement Society, to be paid by instal-

ments in 31 years, thus giving the estates, the tenants, and the labourers the imme-
diate benefit of the improvement, while the proprietor of the estate, who is only

tenant for life, will not be obliged to expend so very large a sum, which might

have the effect of curtailing other improvements. The tenants in every case have

agreed to pay 5 per cent, increased rent for the outlay, and these rents will be paid

by labourers, who gladly settle down where they find constant employment and

comfortable and healthy dwellings.

      Notes on various Efforts to improve the Domiciliary Condition of the

              Labouring Classes. By Henry Roberts, F.S.A.

   It is only within the past fifteen or twenty years that much attention has heen di-

rected to this subject, and considering- its importance in regard to a very numerous
class of the community, I trust that a brief statement of facts, drawn from experience,
and tending to show by what means the object is most likely to be obtained, will not
be deemed foreign to the investigations of that branch of the British Association
which is devoted to Economic Science and Statistics.

   That an undertaking which in its commencement may appear very easy should
in its progress encounter some unexpected difficulties, is of such common occur-

rence, that it would be almost an exceptional case were it otherwise in this
instance. But to be daunted by difficulties is foreign to the character of Britons, and
it should be so especially when the object aimed at is the benefit of our fellow-

creatures.

   I assume that something of the actual domiciliary state of vast masses of our
fellow-subjects is known to most, though but few have soimded the depths of its
misery or of its degradation, and none can fully estimate its evil residts. Whilst
on the Continent for the recovery of health, I have seen and heard it so often

referred to, that, when recommending the subject to the attention of influential

persons in different countries, I coidd not but think of those words, " Physician,

heal thyself."

   The first associated efforts of a practical character were commenced in England,
shortly after the investigations made by Government authority into the state

of the poor, subsequent to the first outbreak of cholera in the metropolis. Two

societies were then formed by philanthropic individuals, with a view to work out

--and to exhibit a practical remedy for the great social evils resulting from the con-

dition of the dwellings of the working classes, a remedy which would commend
itself to extensive adoption, and be the means of stimulating the owners of existing
houses from self-interested motives, to improve and render them healthy abodes,

and afford the evidence of practical results in support of an appeal to the legisla-
ture for a somewhat unprecedented interference with private property.

    The first established of these Societies, though the second to commence building,
which it did in 1845, is the Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings

of the Industrious Classes. Up to the present time it has expended on its ten

 distinct ranges of dwellings £89,613 14s. 10tf., of which £71,328 2s. Qcl, has been
 laid out on six separate blocks of dwellings in different parts of the metropolis, which
 accommodate 395 families ; the net return received from them, for the year ending
 31st March last, after deducting all current expenses and repairs, amounted to

 £2687 4s. M., being about 3f per cent, on the outlay. On two lodging houses

--for single men,--one of them new, which has accommodation for 234, and the other

 old, which provides for 128, the return, owing to the want of sufficient occupants,
 has been very unsatisfactory ; such indeed as to involve a considerable loss, which
 proves that the buildings are'eithei too large, or in some way unadapted to the class

 of men frequenting their neighbourhood.

    It is worthy of observation that the same result has attended a similar lodging
 house at Marseilles, built outside the town, for 150 men, too far from their daily
 occupation, whilst many such houses elsewhere, on a smaller scale, accommodating
 from 50 to 100 men, and near to their work, have fully succeeded; in some instances
 they have been gradually increased, which is the case at Leeds and at Liverpool.
 Of two adjoining houses, built on the Boulevard de Batignolles in Paris, to accom-
 modate together 203 men, and having on the ground floor a restaurant and cafe,
 one wa3 closed two years since. Li this instance, however, the failure is doubtless
 in some degree attributable to defective management.

     The second established Society in London, that for Improving the Condition of
 the Labouring Classes, commenced its first building in 1844. It has constructed
 four distinct ranges of new buildings, which accommodate 97 families in separate
  dwellings, provide 94 rooms for single women, and lodgings for 104 single men, as

  well as a public wash-house with baths. It has also renovated and fitted up, in

  three distinct localities, old houses which lodge 158 single men. These several
  dwellings and lodging houses have all been in full occupation since 1851. Within
                                                                        --

the past six years, three entire courts in different localities have been taken by
the same Society ; and the condition of the houses, which were indescribably filthy,
and occupied by the lowest class of tenants, has been completely changed. The
number of rooms collectively contained in these courts is 275, and there is also a

single men's lodging house with 40 beds. The total expenditure on these new

and old buildings, with the land, has been £43,031 17s. 3d.
   The form in which the accounts of this Society are presented does not afford the

same facility for ascertaining the pecuniary return on the capital invested, as those

--of the Metropolitan Associations do ; and one of its undertakings, that in Portpool

Lane, the Thanksgiving Model Buildings, which was commenced in 1850 with

--contributions received after the removal of the cholera, was avowedly of so

experimental and mixed a character, that the pecuniary results are not a criterion

applicable to other cases, excepting as a caution against providing largely in one

building for single women. The average occupation of 64 rooms, which progressed
very slowly at the commencement, has not exceeded 50 to 52 ; and more stringent
regulations, with regard to the hours of closing, and more constant supervision
than in the men's lodging houses, are proved to be indispensable. The public wash-
house and baths, though a boon to the neighbourhood, have not been remunerative.

which 1 can personally speak to the management of this Society, having then acted

on its committee and as its honorary architect, were,

   The rents received from these houses have varied but slightly since they were
opened, up to the present time, and they are generally well-filled, the families chan-
ging but seldom. The cost of repairs is not included in the expenses which are
above stated ; they shoidd be taken as averaging f per cent, on new, and generally
from 1 to 2 per cent, on old buildings.

   Calculating 4 per cent, interest on the cost of the land, the clear return on the out-

lay of £19,467 16s. 0t?. on the three first-named piles, which are new buildings, is

5y per cent., from which, deducting f per cent, for repairs, leaves 4|- per cent. net.
It should, however, be observed, that the return from the Streatham Street family
houses is higher than from the other two, amounting to 5 per cent, net, and the
rents of the family houses were mostly fixed below those usually paid for similar
accommodation. The two lodging houses, which were old buildings and lease-
hold, yielded a return of about 17 per cent. ; and deducting 2 per cent, for repairs,
they gave a net return of 15 per cent.

 able fittings, including the lodging Louse, has been £7226 Is. 4tf. ; and the clear
 return for the year ending 31st December 1858, was £203 14s. 3d., from which
 deducting li per cent, for the expense of repairs, leaves about 1} per cent, net on

 the outlay.

    From these figures it would appear that whilst in the metropolis old buildings
 maybe renovated and fitted up for men's lodging houses, with the prospect of at

 least a fair remunerative return, although this has not been the case invariably,
 the putting of old courts and blocks of dwelling houses for families into a good
 sanitary condition, unless they are obtained at an unusually low price, is not likely
 to yield a satisfactory return on the outlay, even taking 4 to 5 per cent, as the lowest

 rate of interest which such investments should yield, after provision has been made
 for repairs, and a sinking fund to pay off the capital, which there should be, espe-

 cially in the case of leasehold property.
    It is well also to notice that the actual benefit resulting from these efforts has

 not been conferred to the extent which might be supposed, on those who were the
 occupants of the courts, when they were taken by the Society, as a considerable
portion of them have been ejected, in order not only to reduce the number of occu-

 pants to a due limit, but also to secure a more eligible set of tenants.
    It may, however, be stated here, that a Society has for the past three years been

 successfully in operation at Hastings, established mainly through the instrumenta-
 lity of Dr. Greenhill, and called the Hastings Cottage Improvement Society, which
 avowed "the fixed determination to spare no pains in seeming the main object of
 benefiting the tenants, and at the same time not to discourage the good cause by a
 commercial failure." AYith an expenditure to the present time of £9246 in pur-
 chasing and putting old dwelling-houses into good condition, a dividend of 6 per
 cent, has been paid. Judging from what I have seen of the Society's labours at an
 early stage, it is simply that of putting the acquired property into the condition

which any kind-hearted considerate landlord would desire for his own tenants

 and this has been done with as little disturbance of the existing occupants as pos-

sible. The operations of this Society derive much advantage from the appointment
 of two visitors, whose duty is to inspect the houses every fortnight, lhe forma-

 tion of a reserve fund at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum, and also of a benevo-
 lent fund amongst the tenants, deserve notice.

    The physical results obtained by the two Societies in the Metropolis have been
of a very marked character. For the four consecutive years 1850 to 1853, the
average number of deaths in all their houses was only 136 per 1000, as compared
with 27 to 28 per 1000 in the districts immediately around them, and of 25 per
 1000 in the Metropolis generally, whilst there has been an almost entire freedom
from the special diseases to which the lower classes are more peculiarly subject,
not even excepting cholera. That such returns should not have been regularly

continued by the second named of these societies, is cause for regret. A very beneficial

influence has been exercised on the localities in which the houses are situated,

especially those occupied by families : and it may be confidently asserted that the
most sanguine expectations of their projectors have been realized in every respect,
excepting that of their financial returns, and the extent to which it was anticipated

that the example would be followed.

   Had the returns generally proved more remunerative, doubtless a greater number

of similar houses would have been built ; yet, although they are but a drop in the
bucket, when the extent and vast population of London is considered, they are not,
as compared with what has been done at Paris, encouraged by a large governmi nt
subvention, by any means as insignificant as might be inferred from a remark made
in the last number of the Quarterly Review, that " the wants of the displaced poor
have with us been utterly neglected.'' It is too true that in the Metropolis of
Great Britain, as well as in that of France, the foimation of new streets, and the
removing masses of miserable dens, has only increased the e\ il, by crowding yet more
those that remain. I can, however, after minutely examining all which had been
done or commenced in Paris two years ago, and ascertaining the additions since
made, confidently assert that England, which took the Lad in this effort of prac-
tical benevolence, has done much more through the unaided force of that motive,
than has been accomplished in France, with the stimulus of a government subven-

tion of 10,000,000 francs.

   The number of improved dwellings for working people which have been con-
structed in London, either by local associations, or by individuals, following more
or less closely the plans of those built by the two societies before referred to, for-

bids their detailed notice ; they may be learnt from my paper on " the Improvement

of the Dwellings of the Labouring Classes," given in the Transactions of the

National Association for the promotion of Social Science for 18-38. On this occa-
sion I shall only allude to such of them as especially illustrate the points which it

is the main object of this paper to prove.
   At Shadwell, close to the line of the Blackwall Railway, a number of miserable

dwellings, tenanted by the lowest class of persons, came by inheritance into the

Eossession of a private gentleman, W. E. Hilliard, Esq. of Gray's Inn : actuated

 y the most philanthropic views, he decided on endeavouring to improve, not only

his own property, but also by example the immediate neighbourhood, and his
efforts have been crowned with signal success. The old dwellings have been
replaced by an entire street of considerable length ; on both sides of which houses

for accommodating in the whole 112 families have been built, on the general plan
of H.R.H. The Prince Consort's Exhibition Model Houses 1851, with an open stair-
case, giving access to each pair of upper floor tenements. The twenty-eight blocks
of four houses cost £487 each ; and after allowing for ground rent and all charges,
I can state, on the authority of the owner, that " they continue to pay upwards of

six, in fact nearly seven per cent, as a net return on the investment; and what," he
adds, " is perhaps of more consequence, they are almost constantly let, and are ap-

preciated by the tenants, who, as a rule, are pretty stationary, and not migratory,

as that class frequently are.

  "We have before us in this case, an outlay of nearly £14,000 on new buildings

which contain 448 rooms, kitchens or sculleries included, yielding from G to 7 per
cent., whilst we have seen that the cost of obtaining and putting into sanitary con-
dition three old courts, which contain 275 rooms, and a lodging house with 40 beds,

has been upwards of £7000 ; and in that instance the return on the outlay has been
ly per cent., after deducting per cent, for repairs, but making no allowance for a

                                                                                                 1-J-

sinking fund."

   The Strand Building Company, on their houses for 25 families in Eagle Court,

has last year paid a dividend of 4i per cent, to the shareholders.

   The Victoria Lodging House for married soldiers, built by an association of officers

of the battalion of Guards, near the Yauxhall Bridge Road, and containing 54 tene-

ments or 112 rooms, was the first pi-actical result of the interest manifested in this

object by H.R.H. The Prince Consort in connexion with the Great Exhibition.
I allude to it partly as showing how justly the late Duke of Wellington estimated

the probable effects of placing that small building in the barrack yard at Knights-

bridge, when, as Commander-in-chief, he objected to the situation lest it should
cause a feeling of dissatisfaction in the army, with the want of any accommodation

for married soldiers ; an evil which the Marquis of Auglesea told me His Grace

apprehended the country to be then unprepared to remedy. Since that time,

separate dwellings for the married non-commissioned officers and men of the regiment

stationed at Chatham garrison, as well as for the engineers, have been built ; and
during the present session of Parliament £30,000 have been voted for married

soldiers' quarters.

   The Windsor Royal Society, established in 1852, has now £9000 invested in new
cottages and in two lodging' houses; the net returns from which enable them to

pay a dividend of 4 per cent, to the shareholders.

   At Liverpool, on a range of dwellings for 23 families, built in Upper Frederick
Street after the general plan of The Prince Consort's Exhibition model-houses,
4| per cent, is realized. The Association at Brighton has also built one block of
six houses on the same plan, and they pay a fair return on the cost.

    Not fewer than twenty societies for providing improved dwellings for the work-

ing classes have, to my knowledge, been established in various provincial towns in

England ; and whilst their operations are, without exception, beneficial in regard to
 the occupants, the pecuniary results have varied considerably. In such under-
takings, competent skill and watchful supervision are most important elements

of success. In order to show what may be done with sound judgment and care-

fid management, I instance one example, in addition to those already given ; and

as that is taken from Scotland, I may observe that the urgent necessity for such

efforts is as great in the two sister kingdoms as it is in England.

The Pilrig Model Buildings, near Leith Walk, Edinburgh, were commenced in

1850 ; they consist of forty-four dwellings in three blocks, with access on both sides,

the upper floor tenements being approached from the opposite side to that on which

the ground floor tenements are entered. The greatest economy, consistent with

fitness and durability, was maintained in the construction, so that the total cost of

the forty-four houses, including drains, &c, was only £4052 15s. Or/., being on an

average about £92 per house, with scarcely any extras. The rent of the whole is

£303 19s. 0^/., varying from £5 5s. per house up to £9 15s., one half of them not

exceeding £6 6s. per house. Higher rents might have been charged had not the

--committee desired to benefit a class of persons who could not afford to pay more.
After deducting all expenses,  feu duty £22 14s. lOd.                                                                                                     insurance £5 12s. Or/. ;  rates

and taxes £13 lis. 2±d. ; repairs £13 4s. Id. ; management £21 6s. 3d., and paying

--a dividend of 5 per cent, (less income tax) amounting to £196 16s. 6d., a balance

of £30 13s. Id. was last year added to the sinking fund, from which sundry expenses,

such as painting and papering, are defrayed. This fund now amounts to about £150.

Having had the opportunity of seeing these houses when returning from the

Aberdeen Meeting last year, I refer to them with pleasure, as in many respects
worthy of imitation, and am not surprised at hearing that the demand for them is

generally at least six times equal to the supply.

The facts given thus far, refer exclusively to buildings in towns : with regard to

country districts, in which there is an equal necessity for exertion, the number

of improved cottages built by landed proprietors, as well as by other large em-

ployers of working people, such as manufacturers, railway and other public com-

panies, owners of collieries, mines, quarries, &c, has within the past twelve years

been very considerable ; and it is to the increased feeling of responsibility in this

respect, as well as to more enlarged views of their own interest on the part of

employers, that we must mainly look for the much needed improvement in the

domiciliary condition of our rural population, and of those whose industrial em-

ployments are remote from towns.

In thus saving I do not forget that in many places Benefit Building Societies

present a useful machinery for enabling the working classes to obtain improved

dwellings, and that much good may result from judicious advice given to their
members in the selection of such plans as will enable them to obtain a healthy

and convenient home. In many places on the Continent, societies have, within

the past ten years, been formed by philanthropic persons to build suitable houses

for working people, and likewise to afford facilities which enable their occupiers,

by small periodical payments in addition to the rent, to become the owners of their

own dwellings ; the parties who advance the money being satisfied with 4 per

cent, interest, and the security of a sinking frmd to pay off the capital. Such

buildings act as a savings' bank, promoting sobriety and habits of forethought.
   The beneficial effects resulting from a diffusion of sanitary knowledge amongst

the working population generally, and the importance of their being led to under-

stand and feel how greatly they are personally interested in the possession of a
wholesome dwelling, ought on no account to be overlooked by those who seek to

promote this object. Great evils which have arisen out of 'the selfish system,

pursued in some close parishes, of pulling down cottages in order to obtain relief

from a burden which is thereby thrown on a neighbouring parish, loudly call for

legislative interference.

   In regard to popidous towns, and the metropolis more especially, the facts which
have been stated lead to the conclusion, that the evils of overcrowding which
result from a demolition of large masses of dwellings of the working classes, effected

for the carrying out of public improvements, can only be prevented by a parlia-

mentary enforcement of the construction of suitable buildings in the place of
Athose destroyed.
                   standing order of the House of Lords for the investigation of

such cases exists, but it appears thus far to have been practically a dead letter.

   ~V\ hilst the pressure consequent on these destructions is felt by all classes of the
working population within their influence, facts have been brought to light by
experience, which conclusively prove that no efforts of societies, or of individuals,
can remedy the existing state of wretchedness, which is a consequence of sanitary
               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  201

defects and of overcrowding in the lowest class of dwellings. Nothing can effect

this much-needed remedy, but the extension to all tenements in towns and thickly

populated neighbourhoods, which are let at low weekly rents, of such legislative

interference as is universally admitted to have been of the greatest benefit in the

case of common lodging houses. "Within the limited jurisdiction of the Corporation

authorities in the City of London, such a power was conferred in 1851, and it is judi-

ciously exercised under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, to the great

benefit of the poor, and with a marked diminution in the returns of mortality,

which have fallen since that date from 25 to 23 in 1000.

   In the case of idl new buildings, proper drainage should be enforced by authority,

prior to their commencement ; the want of it is a most fruitful source of sickness,

and consequent expense to the public.

  In the preceding notes my aim has been to draw only such conclusions as are

fully supported by the facts adduced. I cannot, however, omit glancing at this

subject from one other point of view, and that the most important in which it can

be presented for consideration, its bearing on our fellow-creatures as moral and

accountable beings. The experience of a right rev. prelate, when formerly rector

of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, one of the most thickly-populated and poverty-struck

parishes in London, must give peculiar weight to the following words : " The

physical circumstances of the poor paralyse all the efforts of the clergyman, the

schoolmaster, the scripture reader, or the city missionary, for their spiritual or then'

moral welfare  Every effort to create a spiritual tone of feeling is counteracted by

a set of physical circumstances which are incompatible with the exercise of common

morality. Talk of morality amongst people who herd, men, women and children

together, with no regard of age or sex, in one narrow confined apartment ! You

might as well talk of cleanliness in a sty, or of limpid purity in the contents of a

cesspool I"

   Our prisons are no longer hot beds of fever* and of moral contagion as they

formerly were : may it not be asked in this Association, whether, with the advance

of science, the reproach to which England is justly amenable on account of the

domiciliary state of our labouring population, ought not to be effaced ? and, whilst
self-interested motives might be urged on many, the divine command, " thou shalt

love thy neighbour as thyself," lays a serious responsibility on all who have it in

then- power to promote an object so indispensable to the well-being of our poorer

neighbours.

                        MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

The President, in opening the business of the Section, took occasion to refer

to the great loss Mechanical Science had sustained, since the last Meeting, in the

deaths of Brunei and Stephenson. He then made some brief remarks on the recent

progress of Mechanical Science, especially in the use of heat to produce motive
power.

   The writer remarked, that to make an efficient rifled gun, no more was needed
than to copy any good small rifle in the number and shape of the grooves, degree
of twist, and other details, provided one difficulty was overcome, viz. that of

making the barrel strong enough. Taking Sir W. Armstrong's SO-pounder as a

standard, Capt. Blakeley gave several examples of large rifled cannon on the model

of successful small ones, which had given satisfactory results in every way, except

that they had failed after a short time for want of strength. Mr. J. Lawrence, in

1855, rilled a 6|-inch gun with three shallow broad grooves, like an Enfield, and

--fired a lead and zinc bullet, like the Enfield. At an elevation of 5°, the range was

2600 yards 150 more than Sir _W. Armstrong's ; but the gun burst after about

50 rounds. Mr. Whitworth, after making some excellent small arms and nine-

pounders, tried a large gun with 4 inches bore, and sides 9 inches thick; but

it burst. He then tried another, 11 inches thick, and it too burst. He had, how-

ever, since made a stronger cannon, whose success was absolute proof that the one

thing wanting in the other was strength. Capt. Blakeley explained his own

method of obtaining strength, which consists simply of building up the gun in

concentric tubes, each compressing that within it. By this means the strain is

diffused throughout the whole thickness of the metal, and the inside is not unduly

strained, as in a hollow cylinder made in one piece. As the whole efficacy of the

system depended entirely on the careful adjustment of the size of the layers, Capt.

Blakeley said he was not astonished that Sir W. Armstrong had lately failed

utterly in his attempts to carry it out, because he did not put on the outer layers

and rings with any calculated degree of tension ; " they were simply applied with

a sufficient difference of diameter to secure effectual shrinkage," to quote his own

words at the Institution of Civil Engineers. To show that the late failure by Sir

W. Armstrong did not disprove his, Capt. Blakeley's, theory, he quoted official

reports of a trial of a nine-pounder made by himself in 1855, which showed an

endurance sevenfold that of an iron service gun, and threefold that of a brass gim,

as well as of an 8-inch gun, from which bolts weighing 4 cwt. had been fired, and

of a 10-inch gun which had discharged bolts weighing 526 lbs. Mr. Whitworth's

last new 80-pounder was another instance of the successful application of Capt.

--Blakeley's prmciple. To quote Mr. Whitworth's own words, " It was made of

homogeneous iron. "Upon a tube having an external taper of about one inch, a

series of hoops, each about 20 inches long, were forced by hydraulic pressure. Ex-

Eeriments had enabled him to determine accurately what amount of pressure each

oop woidd bear. All the hoops were put on with the greatest amount of pressure
Athey would withstand without being injured.
                                              second series was forced over

those first fixed." This gun was so made at Capt. Blakeley's suggestion, except-

ing that the rings were put on too tight, which might prove a cause of weakness.

The method of rifling adopted by Capt. Blakeley cannot be made intelligible with-

out a diagram ; but it may be described as a series of grooves of very shallow
depth, so arranged as to exert a maximum force in the direction of the rotation of

the bullet with a minimum force in a radial or bursting direction. Capt. Blakeley

exhibited in the court of the building in which the Section met, a 56-pounder,

constructed on his own plans, from which he had thrown shells to a distance of

2700 yards, with only 5° of elevation, which was stated to be a range 300 yards

greater than that of Sir W. Armstrong's 80-pounder.

      On a deep Sea Pressure Gauge, invented by Henry Johnson, Esq.
                       Head by the Rev. Dr. Booth, F.R.S., fyc.

   In deep sounding the pressure is too intense to admit of measurement by the com-
pression of any highly elastic fluid in a small portable instrument. Water, however,
possesses a slight degree of elasticity, and an instrument recording the compression
of an isolated portion of water by the pressure of the sea, will show the compression
of the water at the depth to which it has been lowered.

   Mr. Canton, who in 1761 communicated his observations to the Royal Society,

found in water, compressed under a glass receiver, by the pressure of an additional
atmosphere, a diminution in bulk equal to one part in 21,740; and in water placed

under a receiver a similar expansion when the air in the receiver was exhausted.
Mr. Perkins, more recently, found a diminution of bulk of /jths in water under a
pressure of 1120 atmospheres. The theory of increased pressure at great depths is
corroborated by a very interesting experiment made by the distinguished voyager
Rear- Admiral Sir James Clark Ross, who lowered, to a great depth, a bottle fitted

with a tube, with a cork suspended so as to enter the tube, if, as anticipated, the
water in the bottle, condensed under heavy pressure, should expand upon the raising

of the bottle and the removal of the pressure. Upon the return of the bottle to the

surface, it was found that the cork had been forced some distance along the tube, and

the amount of compression and of subsequent expansion were thus roughly estimated.

   The pressure gauge exhibited, may, in its present form, be considered as a small
hydraulic press ; of which the ram is forced into the
cylinder by the increasing pressure of the sea when

sinking, and expelled by the expansion of the water

in the cylinder when rising. It consists of a small

tube or cylinder having at one end a tap through

which water is admitted ; the tap having in addition.
to the opening admitting water, a smaller opening

for the escape of air. At the other end of the cylin-

der is a packing-box, through which a round bolt or

Asolid piston passes.          scale by the side of the pis-

ton contains the degrees of compression, and an

index at the further end of the scale is drawn along

the scale by the piston when forced by increasing

pressure into the cylinder, and secured by a spring

in its position, where it remains when the piston

is pushed back by expansion of water in the cylinder

to its former position. The scale and index are pro-

              On Road Locomotives. By the Earl of Caithness.

   The author referred to what had hitherto been done in this direction, and the
importance of attention being given to the construction of them as feeders to the

Railway system. He described the arrangement adopted in one which he had had
built for his own use, and which was successful. The carriage was exhibited in

action, and made several trips in the street under his Lordship's guidance. In the
discussion which took place, great stress was laid on the importance of Parliament
reducing the turnpike tolls in respect of such carriages, which, in reality, were in
no way injurious to the road.

 On Water Meters. By David Chadwick, Assoc. Inst. C.E., Manchester,

   After pointing out the defects in some of the water-meters at present in use, he
described the high -pressure piston water-meter of Messrs. Chadwick and Frost,
which obviated these defects, and secured the correct measurement of water at all
pressures and velocities of discharge, without the use of tumbling -levers, springs,
or flexible diaphragms, by a more compact and simple arrangement than any other
piston meter; but, without a diagram, it would be impossible to make its con-

struction intelli'g-i'ble.

A New Mode of obtaining a Blast of very High Temperature in the

               Manufacture of Iron. By E. Cowper.

The blast is obtained by an adaptation of the principle of Siemens's regenerative

Afurnaces.  hot blast of a temperature of 18003 Fahrenheit can readily be obtained,

and this without the destruction of iron tubes- -the Bubstance used in contact with

the air being the most refractory fire-brick. This mode of obtaining a blast was

in successful operation at Messrs. Cochran's iron-works. The temperature of the

blast could be regulated to any required degree. The heat might be obtained with

far greater economy than by any method hitherto known.

              The Cylindrical Spiral Boiler. By John Elder.

     [A communication ordered to be printed entire in the Transactions of the Sections.]

   The object of the construction of this boiler is to obtain a form with all the useful
properties of the simple cylindrical high-pressure boiler on shore adapted to steam-

ships.

   The following advantages appear to be attained over the ordinary marine boiler,
namely :

   1. A form of boiler capable of carrying higher pressure, and presenting more

heating surface, and of a more effective description from a given weight of material.

  A2. boiler capable of being easier cleaned and repaired in both water and fire

spaces.

  A3. boiler capable of producing superheated steam to any practical temperature.
  A4. less average specific gravity of water whilst working at sea with the usual

amount of feed and blow-off, and a more perfect combustion chamber, and better

formation of flue surface.

   5. The pressures being altogether internal, the boiler is not liable to collapse, a
danger lately ably demonstrated by Mr. Fairbairn ; and as the diameters of the various
cylinders are reduced to the minimum size for permitting the tradesmen to pass
through, clean and repair them, the boiler, when formed of ordinary thickness,
possesses enormous strength without stays.

   6. The expense of the boiler per square foot of heating surface is about the same
as that of the ordinary boiler, and is capable of carrying five times the pressure.

   The general construction. of this boiler is as shown in the accompanying plans,

and as follows :
    There are twenty- four round boilers or tubes, of not less than nineteen inches in

diameter, twenty-two of these forming, when bound together, a cylindrical vertical
shell ; the twenty-third, a centre boiler concentric to that shell ; and the twenty-
fourth, a spiral coil-boiler winding spirally round between the centre boiler and those
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  205

composing the circumference shell : these boilers contain the water, and the spaces
between them the fire.

   The feed water passes first into the spiral compartment, or No. 24, and from it
into the centre compartment, or No. 23, and then into each in rotation, and blows
oft" at the last compartment, or No. 1, thus rendering the water in No. 24 nearly pure
sea- water, and gradually from compartment to compartment more dense, till it blows
off at No. 1 at the usual density, and thus makes the average specific gravity of the
water less than usual.

   The twenty-two outside boilers are 24 feet long, 19 inches diameter, and yV of an
inch thick ; the bottom ends are conical for 3 feet, and kneed outwardly to give a

larger diameter of furnace, say 12 feet diameter. There is a furnace-door for every

alternate tube, or say, eleven furnace-doors, equally divided round the base of the
boiler, giving great facility to the firemen for doing their work efficiently. In firing

it is proposed to charge all the fresh coal round the circumference of the fire, in order

that the hydrogen of the coal may be consumed separately from the carbon ; and as

the furnace has great altitude, the combustion will be completed in vertical flames
from the coals, and will thus prevent the carbonic acid gas, given out from the com-

bustion of the carbon, coming so much in contact with and preventing the com-

bustion of the hydrogen, as is usual in ordinary furnaces.

   The centre compartment, or No. 23, is 30 feet long, 34 inches diameter, and f of
an inch thick, with 3 feet at the bottom and top, conically reduced to 18 inches
diameter, forming a man-hole door ; the upper end of tbis vertical tube forms a
reservoir for the steam of the whole twenty-four compartments, and acts as a super-
heating apparatus, and may be carried up the funnel to the extent necessary to
superheat the steam to 400 degrees ; the steam-pipe is taken from the top of this
boiler to the safety-valve chest, fastened on the front of the boiler low down, which

serves as a water-trap during the discharge from the safety-valve chest, the steam-
pipe to the engines being taken off the same pipe at a higher level than the escape
steam. The spiral compartment, or No. 24, is about 100 feet long, 34 inches
diameter, and § of an inch thick, made of best iron boiler plate ; the ends are conical
for 3 feet, formed into man-hole doors this spiral boiler makes four or five con-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

volutions close round the centre one, and is bound close to the circumferential
boilers by hollow stay-bolts, and fastened to the centre one at each end only ; in the
same manner the steam and water flow through the whole boiler by these hollow
stay-bolts or rivets, and complete the entire circulation of water and steam ; the
whole of these twenty-four compartments or boilers terminate at the bottom, about
1 foot below the fire-grate, and are supported on six stanchions from the ash-pit
beneath, making a free passage for the air under the great bar ; the circumferential
compartments or boilers terminate at the top 6 feet above the ship's deck, and have
each a man-hole door forming the cover; the funnel is made conical at the bottom
to embrace the internal diameter of the boiler-shell and draw off the smoke in the

usual manner : this completes the whole boiler proper ; but in order to prevent
radiation of heat, a thin outer casing of iron is made (9 inches) clear of the boiler all
round, terminating about 7 feet from the stoke-hole floor ; and above, at the level of the
galley or funnel-house, this casing is lined with felt and thin wood to keep the deck
and the adjacent parts cool, and retain the heat. The twenty-two straight cylindrical
boilers or compartments are constructed in the sides by four plates 24 feet long and
]6 inches broad, rolled to a 9|-inch radius curve at the iron works, leaving no plate
setting for the boiler maker of this description.

    The plates of boiler No. 24, or the spiral compartment, are delivered flat by the
iron-maker, and are bent to the spiral curve by one blow of a large spiral concave
block falling upon a counterpart convex one, prepared by the constructors of the
boiler. This operation has been found to simplify the making of this spiral cylin-
drical boiler to about the same amount as the straight cylindrical boilers. The
conical ends are bent in the same manner as the spiral plates,'and the whole work of
plate bending is reduced as far as possible to machine work. The products of com-
 bustion, after leaving the furnace, have to travel spirally upwards a distance of 100
feet, and must of necessity be continually rotating during that time, and prevent the
 possibility of any portion passing off without being brought frequently in contact
with the heating surface of the boiler; and will therefore be cooled down to the
                                                                                                                                                                                                   --

--20(3 REPORT 18G0.

minimum temperature compatible with a given amount of cooling surface, or the

greatest quantity of heat extracted from the products of combustion, before their

escape to the atmosphere. The soot forming usually inside of boilers will not be so

injurious in this arrangement, as it will fall down through the external crevices, and

also between the spiral and the centre boilers into the furnace below, and be thrown

overboard with the ashes.

This spiral coil and all the heating surfaces will keep more clear of flue dust than

usual, and will consequently be more efficient in that respect, as well as save the

usual trouble and loss by sponging experienced in the ordinary tubular boilers at sea.

Also as the products of combustion must pass off at the rate of at least 7 feet per second

in this as in the ordinary boilers, it will take upwards of 14 seconds from the time

it leaves the furnace till it arrives at the top of the boiler ; whilst if the boiler were

of the ordinary tubular type, it would pass in about two seconds along the whole

heating surface of the boiler ; the gas has therefore seven times more time to give

out its heat, and its revolving tendency will not admit of the same strata of gas

passing along the passages after it is cooled down, as is the case with the ordinary

boiler, but will bring the hot products of combustion usually occupying the centre

of the tubes of a tubular boiler in contact with the cooling surfaces, and reduce the

whole products of combustion to one temperature before entering the chimnev.

In cleaning the salt or sludge out of these boilers, the man- and sludge-hole doors

are taken off the top and bottom (and the hose with fresh water may be played down

through from the top, and the refuse run out at the bottom). The man in charge

can also pass down through the whole boiler, the dimensions necessary for this pur-
pose being made the minimum and maximum of the various compartments of the

boiler; and are specially constructed to maintain to the engines steam at much

higher pressure than usual, in order to admit of a much larger amount of expansion

to be developed by the engines, which are all on the double cylinder expansive prin-

ciple. The constructors are now making the boilers for three steam-ships on this

principle, two of which are for carrying Her Majesty's mails on the Pacific between

Valparaiso and Panama (as described by the writer at the meeting of the British

Association at Leeds) ; and it has long been his desire to be able to construct boilers

for marine purposes without stays, and with no surface exposed to the collapsing

tendency, which in so many cases has been the cause of loss of life aboard of steam-
ships. The boilers now described have no large flat surfaces and no stays, the whole

tendency of the pressures being to inflate the boiler plates, and, if possible, to give

them a stronger form ; the smallest diameter is large enough to give access to the

--men in charge, and the largest diameter 34 inches and -} thick, dimensions that can

carry several hundred pounds pressure on the square inch before rupture could take

place. Such a form the writer adopts, with great satisfaction to himself, as a con-

structor sending machinery abroad, where the usual form of boiler gives him consi-

derable anxiety. In comparing the construction of this boiler with that of the

ordinary tubular one, in the latter angle-iron ribs and stays now compose a large

portion of the weight and expense                                                                                                                                contribute no heating surfaces ;  and if one stay

and if it gives way, the whole may follow in rotation, and a serious accident be the

result. In the former boiler, however, the plates may be reduced to a very small

amount of thickness by tear and wear before explosion could be expected.

Having thus described the objects of the spiral boiler, it may not be out of place

to give the following statement of the comparative evaporative power and temperatures

of the gases in the furnace and chimney of the spiral boiler, with three of the ordi-

nary types of boiler now in general use.

Fig. 1 is a vertical section of the cylindrical spiral boilers as fitted on board the

Pacific Royal Mail Company's steam-ships * San Carlos' and 'Guayaquil,' by

Messrs. Randolph, Elder, &c. Fig. 2 is a sectional plan of the same, taken near the

level of the water-line in fig. 1. Fig. 3 is a vertical elevational view of the same

the exterior casings which surround the circumferential vertical tubes (and which
are shown in figs. 1 and 2) being in this view removed.

It will be seen from these figures that there are in these boilers 21 tubes in all,

viz. 19 circumferential vertical tubes, 1 central and 1 spiral tube.

diameter through the centre ; this boiler had 40 feet of heating surface to the nominal
horse-power of the engine : the two flues contained 20 feet, and the shell 20 feet per
nominal horse-power ; the furnace was below the boiler at the fore-end, had a fire-grate
of 26 square feet; the fire passed underneath the boiler to the opposite end from the
furnace, and returned along the sides, and then passed back again through the flues
to the chimney. The temperature above the centre of the fire was found to be, upon

one occasion, 3200°; at the top of the bridge 1730'; the temperature of the gases

gradually reduced as they passed back the remaining length of 26 feet under the
boiler and along the side flues, till they entered the centre flues at 1 163°, and left
tbem at about S00°. Thus the furnace containing a surface of 2 feet per nominal
horse-power reduced the heat about 1500°; the shell of the boiler behind the furnace,
of about 18 feet per nominal horse-power, reduced the temperature about 600°; and
the flues containing a surface of 20 feet per nominal horse-power reduced the tem-
perature about 350°. The temperatures of the gases in the flues were found to be
about the same in the centre as at the top ; but at the bottom of the flue the tempe-
ratures of the gases were at the fore-end rather less than at the top, but towards the

temperature at the top to the extent of 300°. Upon another occasion the tempe-

the amount of heat taken out of the gases per square foot of heating surface is very
small ; and that the natural conclusion is that the gases pass along in straight lines,
and only the thin stratum in contact with the surface is cooled down. In the results
of the spiral boiler (fig. 6) three times the quantity of heating surface was found to
reduce six times the quantity of gas from the same temperature of 3200°, to a tem-
perature of 4800 instead of 800°, showing that a more complete turning over of the
gases is much wanted in our land boilers. The water evaporated per hour in the
land boiler referred to was found by meter to be 2000 lbs., and the coal, best
Glasgow quality, found to be 300 lbs. per hour ; making about 6i lbs. of water per

pound of coal. During the measuring of the water evaporated by the meter, indicator

diagrams of the engine were taken with a view to cal-             Rk. 6.
culate the weights of steam by the ordinary method, and

the calculations were found to agree with the meter

these calculations can be repeated and substantiated at

any time. The second type of boiler tested was that of

the ordinary steam-boat horizontal tubular boiler (fig.

4) ; the example chosen was one in a first-class ocean
steamer; the temperature of the furnace was found to

be 3200°, and the inside of the funnel about 1100°. The

heating surface of this boiler was 22 feet per nominal

horse-power, and the water evaporated about 8i lbs. per

pound of coal, according to the calculation from the

diagrams. The coal consumed was about 20 lbs. per

square foot of fire-grate, of the best Glasgow coal.

The next example taken was that of a first-class ver-

tical tubular boiler (fig. 5), on Mr. David Napier's

principle, now universally selected on the Clyde for river

steamers. This boiler had a surface of about 22 feet

per nominal horse-power; the temperature of the fire

was found to be about 3300°, and in the funnel 1 160°

the weight of water evaporated was found by calculation to be 8| lbs. per pound of

coal consumed, and the weight of combustion about twenty pounds square foot of

fire-grate. In the spiral boiler (fig. G) of the ' San Carlos,' ' Guayaquil,' and ' Prinz

--van Orange' the boilers were found to give the following peculiar results: first,

that even with Scotch coal there was no smoke emitted from the chimney, and no

carelessness on the part of the fireman seemed to occasion the formation of smoke ;
second, that the boilers showed a bright furnace, indicating first-class draught; the

temperature of the funnel was found to be 480°, whilst the fire was at its greatest

energy. The heating surface was, in the case of the ' San Carlos ' and ' Guayaquil,'

2200 square feet, the coal consumed 1400 lbs. per hour, and the water evaporated

11 lbs. per pound of coal consumed; the fire-grate contained about 76 square feet,

and the rate of combustion about twenty pounds per square foot of fire-grate. The

heating surface of the boiler was 18 feet per. nominal horse-power; the coal consumed

was Glasgow best steam coal. The stoke-hole was found to be remarkably cool,

and the boiler, which was loaded to 52 lbs. on the square inch steam pressure, and

tested to 150 lbs. on the square inch water pressure, was found to be perfectly tight.

In the case of the ' San Carlos,' I may mention that that ship has now steamed about

20,000  miles, and  the vessel  has  not been  in  any one  port  more than three days
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

duiing that time she has been consuming soft Chili coal for a considerable part of

her voyage, and the merits of the long flue show a decided advantage in this boiler

over the ordinary tubular boiler for the native bituminous coal of South America.

In order to give a more extended form of the comparative evaporative power of

various flues and tubular boilers, the writer begs to lay before this Association the

accompanying Table. It shows several proportions of heating surface and evapora-

tive powers of several ships that have come under his notice. He can certify the

accuracy of most of these particulars, except that shown in the last column, wThich

is taken from Professor Rankine's report on the performance of the 'Thetis.' This

vessel has about six times more heating surface in her boilers in proportion to the

coal consumed, than any example the writer is aware of. The boiler is Craddock's

patent boiler, though that inventor's name appears rarely to be mentioned in con-
                         .

nexion with the said vessel. Efficient, however, as this boiler must be as an evapo-

rator, it cannot possibly accomplish the quantity shown in this Table.

       The theoretical quantity of water capable of being heated from 90°, and evaporated

at, say 212°, with an infinite quantity of heating surface and a perfect fire, is some-

where about 13^ lb3. per pound of coal; whilst from the diagrams represented in

Professor Rankine's report of the 'Thetis' performance, 18 lbs. weight appear to

be about the quantity of water per pound of coal. This calculation I have made

from the diagrams published, and any party interested may repeat the calculations.

       The calculation is made as follows : the area of the large cylinder, as shown in the

diagram, is 1380 square inches, or9'583 square feet. The four revolutions of piston

marked on the diagram 49i, 52, 53, and 52 revolutions per minute, with a stroke of

2£ feet, or say 25S'12 feet per minute, gives 25S-12X 9'583X 60=146433 cubic feet
per hour. And if we take the average pressure shown in the four diagrams at the

end of the piston stroke, supposing the barometer to be 14*5 lbs., we find the weight

of that steam to be about 44 cubic feet per pound: this number therefore, divided

by 44, gives the quantity of steam as 3300 pounds per hour ; to this must be added

V·     for   contents       of ports  and  clearance,  which  makes   3465  pounds      of steam.

a

       This clearly gives the weight of the steam per hour given out of the cylinders

after the work is performed, to this therefore must be added the quantity of heat

that must have disappeared during the performance of the work ; this, in the case

of the 'Thetis,' is about \ of the entire heat; we must therefore add \, or say

+3465 693 = 4153 pounds of water must have been raised from a temperature of

about 100° and evaporated, or say 18 lbs. of water to the pound of coal said to be

consumed ; this result is about equal to 20 lbs of water evaporated at 212°, to the

pound of coal consumed ; a quantity quite absurd.

   It therefore appears that in the report referred to, the indicated power of the said

210 REPORT 1860.

consider that the report of Professor Rankine was based upon one hour's consumption
of say 230 lbs. of coal, and compare that with a mass of boiler, water and firebrick,

weighing 20 tons, at a temperature of say 300°, it is evident that the mass of heat in
proportion to the coal consumed is so great, that no conclusion should be made from
such an experiment ; also, that when the quantity of coal said to be consumed, viz.
230 lbs., is compared with area of fire-grate, say 40 square feet, it is evident that

the result should not be depended upon, as no ordinary comparisons could be made
of the condition of the fires before and after the experiment. In conclusion, let me
ask of every party present to consider the trial trips of steam-ships and boilers in
their true lights, and before drawing any inferences from such short trials, make a
perusal of results obtained from sea voyages. The evaporative power and economy

Weof boilers is one of the most important subjects for this Society to consider.

need only refer to the able Report drawn up by the Steam Shipping Committee of
the British Association, to show how mixed up the question of the relative efficiency
of the boiler and engines is generally considered. Indeed the American navy
returns form the only reports showing the evaporative power of the boilers in this
list, and the whole merit of a good evaporating boiler is often sacrificed to the cha-
racter of the engines. With regard to the ' Thetis,' I would recommend any mistake
to be remedied as soon as possible, as there are many contracts, involving much
responsibility, formed in consequence of this report, that will lead to serious loss and
disappointment to the steam-shipping interest, and the engineering profession of this

country.

On the Density of Saturated Steam, and on the Law of Expansion of Super-
       heated Steam. By William Fairbairn, LL.D., F.R.S. fyc.

    This paper contained a continuation of the experiments detailed in a paper read
by Mr. Fairbairn at the Aberdeen Meeting-, and which had been earned on in con-
junction with Mr. Tate. Experimental determinations had been obtained of the

density of steam fully confirming the anticipations of Mr. Thomson and Mr. Ran-
kine, that the vapour of water does not exactly obey the gaseous laws. They show
that the density of saturated steam is always greater than that given by the gaseous
laws, even for temperatures as low as 130° Fahr., and at pressures below that of the
atmosphere. The experiments at present extend over a range of temperature from
136° Fahr. to 292°, or from 2-6 to 00 lbs. pressure per square inch. The general
result obtained is expressed in the following formuke, which closely agrees with the

experiments,

,=25-62+1^,              (1.)

P = v---^S25I-r0,2-0-72  (2.)'

where v is the specific volume or ratio of the volume of the steam to that of the
water which produced it, at the pressure P, expressed in inches of mercury.

   On the subject of superheating steam, the experiments throw some light, which

the author hopes to follow up by a special series of experiments. They show that

within a short distance of the maximum temperature of saturation the rate of ex-

pansion is variable, being higher than that of a perfect gas near the saturation point,
and rapidly decreasing, till at a point at no great distance above the temperature of

saturation it becomes sensibly identical with that of a perfect gas.

         On an Atmospheric Washing Machine. By John Fisher.

   The action of this machine was derived from streams of air forced through the
water from below. The author in his paper observed, that for effectual use the water
must never be of a higher temperature than 140° of Fahrenheit. It was stated
that machines on this principle, driven by steam-power, had been for some time
past in successful operation for cleansing the soiled laces at Messrs. Fishers' manu-
factory at Nottingham.

On Giffard's Injector for Feeding Boilers. By William Froude.

In this instrument a jet of steam taken from the boiler and issuing from a pro-

perly tapered orifice, is met by and enveloped in a regulated supply of water, either

cold or of limited temperature.

   The column formed by the combination of water and steam is made to impinge

on the aperture of a similarly tapered orifice, of rather smaller area, connected with

the feed-pipe ; and penetrating this orifice, it flows in a continuous stream into the

--boiler.
   The rationale seems to be as follows : were it possible to condense such a jet of

steam by a simple abstraction of temperature, it would collapse into a jet of water

y^having only  tn of its previous sectional area, its particles, however, retaining

the same weight and velocity, and therefore the same momentum for each unit of

time which they had possessed as steam. And since the momentum of a jet is the

exact dynamic equivalent of the pressure which produces it, this water-jet would

possess a momentum equal to that of a jet of equal diameter taken from a boiler

having 1700 times the pressure of that from which itself had issued as steam, and

would be capable of penetrating a boiler having a pressure enlarged almost in the

same proportion.
   In the injector the water which is added condenses the steam and becomes incor-

porated with it, forming a compound jet which possesses for each unit of time the
same momentum which the jet of steam possessed. And if tbe supply of water be
duly regulated, the sectional area of the compound jet may be precisely adapted to

the orifice of the feed-pipe.

  Now were that orifice equal in area to the steam-jet orifice, and were a jet of

water allowed to issue from it under the same pressure which discharged the steam,

the water-jet would have the same momentum for each unit of time as the
steam-jet had, and therefore as the compound jet derived from it ; and the two
would precisely neutralize one another when brought into opposition. If, however,

the steam-jet orifice be the larger of the two, then the jet derived from it, if reduced
by condensation to the diameter of the smaller, will be the stronger in the same

proportion, since it will possess the momentum due to the larger area of pressure

it will therefore drive back the water which is striving to escape from the feed-pipe,

and will pass as a continuous stream into the boiler.
   The water supply is considered to be correctly adjusted when the passage takes

place without an overflow of steam or water ; but the test is deceptive ; for an over-
flow of steam merely implies that the supply of water is barely sufficient to condense
the steam into a jet as small in section as the feed-pipe orifice ; an overflow of water

merely implies that though the steam is fully condensed, the supply of water has

enlarged the compound jet to a section exceeding that of the feed-pipe orifice.

    In reality the operation should be brought as near as possible to the latter limit
for though it will indeed seem to be proceeding quietly and properly in all the inter-

mediate stages, it will be found that the compound jet, when not so enlarged as to
fill the feed-pipe orifice, possessing its full momentum in a smaller section, will have

energy enough to take up with it and carry into the boiler a considerable quantity of

air, wasting thus not only its own power, but in a high degree that of the engine

also, when it is a condensing one, since it encumbers the air-pump with extra duty.

        On a Process for covering Submarine Wires with India-rubber

              for Telegraphic purposes. By Walter Hall.

   The author exhibited a model of his machine, which effected the object by wind-
ing- strips of rubber, and moistening- the same with naphtha during the process of
covering ; the wire thus formed being covered with a thread of vulcanized India-
rubber, and the whole afterwards subjected to a temperature of 140°. The wires
thus covered were protected with a plaited covering of hempen cord, into which
longitudinal steel wires were introduced for the purpose of giving strength.

                      Suggestions relative to Inland Navigation.

from those of sea navigation, shows that a totally different construction may be
adopted for the vessels employed. The short heavy barges with clumsily rounded
bows and broad sterns should be entirely abandoned. Boats of very great length,
compared to their breadth cf beam, may be used for cauals with considerable economy
of power in proportion to the cargo. The highest perfection of lines may thus be
attained so as to secure the smallest amount of resistance to motion, and the least
disturbing effect to the canal banks. For this object also a selection might be made
among the varieties of the screw propeller, which would obviate any lateral disturb-
ance of the water and drive it backwards rather than sideways. In some cases the

above suggestion as to the shape of boats could not be realized without lengthening
locks, and wherever these are numerous, jointed vessels, like those proposed for the
Indian rivers, might be employed. The loss of water in passing locks would be the
same as for a train of entirely separate boats, while the resistance to propulsion
would be considerably less. Steam-propelled boats thus constructed would proba-
bly realize the twofold result of economy in power and increase of speed to the
highest limit advisable for traffic in heavy goods.

On the Character and Comparative Value of Gulla Percha and India~
  rubber employed as Insulators for Subaqueous Telegraphic Wires. By
   S. W. Silver.

After pointing out some of tile mistakes prevalent on the subject of the insula-

ting properties of india-rubber, a comparison was made by the writer between the

relative advantages and the insulating power of india-rubber and gutta percha

--respectively. Insulation in the case of a submarine cable depends upon two causes

or properties of the bodies used : 1. The specific non-conducting power of the

substance                                                2. its impermeability, by which the original insulating conditions may
                                                      ;

be maintained. The insulating power of gutta percha is very high ; but, in the

case of a submarine telegraph cable, its porosity renders it a very imperfect insulator

in practice. India-rubber, with lower specific insulating properties (as would

appear from experiments made in dry air), is, nevertheless, practically a far more

efficient insulator, by reason of its complete impermeability, while in addition it

possesses a lower inductive capacity. It was pointed out that impermeability is as

important a question as specific non-conductility in an insulator of such cables ; and

that even if a substance could be found insulating perfectly in dry air, it still might

in practice be of questionable utility for submarine lines, owing to its porosity, as

was the case with gutta percha. There was now no difficulty in covering wires

with india-rubber.

clamps; and along the centre of the 'tween decks are secured in long lengths along

the inside of the frames, strong, angle, back-to-back iron clamps. For these beams,

various degrees of obliquity may be adopted                                                                                                                                                                                               but the angle chosen by the author (re-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

presented in a plan which was exhibited) will probably best answer the combined

purpose of a beam and diagonal truss.

It is a well-known fact that the beams, as at present placed, do not prevent the

straining of a vessel, but merely form a connexion between the vessel's sides and a
framework to support the deck.

The hatchways and mast partners are framed in the usual manner, and the masts

are wedged on both the upper and lower decks.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  213

   The decks may be laid also diagonally in a reverse direction to the beams, and may
be edge-bolted throughout and made of hard wood.

    This system of decks, by which the objcctional butts are entirely avoided, i3
more particularly adapted for 4 or 5-decked battle-ships, where the strain from the
weight of the guns and action of propeller is found to strain and twist them so
much.

   Iron Waterways are formed in the following manner. Every iron beam is made with
a vertical projection on its upper edge at both ends ; this projection is about 7 inches

deep and 20 to 40 inches broad, according to the tonnage of the vessel. On the
upper edge of these projections are riveted double-angle iron. On the front or bosom

of these projections is riveted, in long lengths along the beams, heavy angle-iron,

+say 6 5. Over this are then placed the plates which form the waterway ; these are

rounded over on their inside edge, which is riveted to the heavy angle-iron inside ;
the top of the plate is double riveted down to the double angle-iron on each beam
end : the outer edge is riveted to the angle-iron along the sheer strake, where it is

securely iron-caulked.

   Round any angle-iron frames necessary to project through the waterway is fitted
exactly a doubling piece, which is securely caulked round the frame.

   The usual iron stringer and wood water-ways are thus superseded, and this iron

water-way, it is submitted, forms a serviceable and complete box gunwale.
   The beam-end projections form also stronger and improved knee fastenings, par-

ticularly to the upper part of the beam, where hitherto in iron vessels such a knee
has not yet been adopted, although considered essential in timber vessels.

    In fact, for the convenience of stowage and passengers' berths, the knee or the
under side of all iron beams on this principle might be dispensed with. Of course,

this waterway can be adopted with either diagonal beams or common beams.

    Plating diagonally with two tbicknesses of plate, each in the reverse diagonal
direction to the other, or with one thickness in combination with frames arranged in

the reverse diagonal direction.

    In the former case, both thicknesses of plating will be riveted together, and the
butts arranged to make shifts with each other ; by this mode of construction the
present vertical frames become unnecessary, and even the keel not essential. In

place of these are substituted, in long lengths, internal longitudinal stringers,
clamps and keelsons, about 5 feet asunder; these would have the advantage over the
present internal longitudinal fastenings, of being fitted and secured directly to the

skin of the fabric through which they may be fastened every 3 inches ; by this

system it is not requisite that the plate butts be more securely riveted than the rest
of the external skin, as it will be evident that such a vessel could not break asunder
at the butts or vertical joints like a postage-stamp, as was described in the case of

many late wrecks of iron ships constructed on the present mode.

    Timber vessels of 2000 tons have been planked on this principle with complet

success.

    Keelsons made in the following manner have greater strength as a backbone, and the

 necessary rigidity to receive the thrust of diagonal central hold stanchions or trusses.

Every floor, or alternate floor, is made to project up in the middle in the form of a
square. Round these projections are fixed angle-iron, to which the upper and side
plates of the keelson are secured in the form of a box. Bilge and sister keelsons may
be also formed on the same principle.

    The keelson required by Lloyds for their highest classed iron vessel, has only four
rivets to secure it to the top of each floor ; consequently, when by accident the strength
of the bottom is tested, these rivets of course break, leaving the strength of the floors
 and keelson as a backbone untested, while with the above improved keelson, the
 floors are so well fastened to the keelson, that they must break before the keelson

will yield.

  --Diagonal Central Hold Stanchions or Trusses. In place of the common vertical

hold and 'tween-deck pillars or stanchions in two lengths at present in use in wood
and iron vessels, most of which are made portable, and intended merely for the sup-

 port of the deck, the inventor forms, from stem to stern, a range of diagonal trussing
in bars of one length, the joint object of which is to strengthen he fabric and sup-

port the deck.
--214 REPORT 1860.

   These trusses are placed to cross each other in a reverse diagonal direction, so as

to resist either a tensional or compressive strain ; they are made of 5 X 2 flat iron, are

securely riveted above to every second or fourth upper deck-beam, and below, a butt
on, and are secured to the upper side of the keelson. They are riveted together at
their points of intersection, and where they cross the line of the old beams, a double

central back-to-back 7X6 angle-iron clamp is riveted to every truss and beam. If

desired, a similar angle-iron clamp may be riveted along at the junction of their

upper extremities with deck beams.
   The angle of these stanchions is about 60°, that being found best suited to the

convenience of the hatch arrangement. The hatchways and masts can easily be left

clear.

    It is submitted, these stanchions form a central range of diagonal trussing at a
part of a vessel requiring support, and which hitherto has not had such ; they will be
of great service in connecting together two strong frameworks, namely a vessel's
bottom, and her upper deck platform. The writer also places the diagonal stanchion
in athwartship direction ; this he has found reduces vibration in steamers, besides

clearing the screw-shaft. On these principles of construction, the writer's firm have

nearly completed at Glasgow a 900-ton iron Indiaman, named ' The R. Mackenzie ;'
and he is glad to state that the result of such practice has more than realized the
expectation formed from the theory ; and respecting the element of expense, he finds
that such a vessel costs £2000 less than a Thames or Mersey-built timber ship of
the same size and class.

  --Plate Butt Frames. In an iron vessel plated in the common manner, the writer

uses butt-frames. In the place of the usual mode of securing the vertical joints of
 the external plating on an iron internal strop between the frames, they are secured
 upon a frame in the following manner. There is bent round the exterior of every
 alternate angle-iron frame, a long continuous plate of some breadth and thickness,
 as the ordinary butt-strop ; this plate is punched before being fixed to the frame ; the
 plate-butts or vertical joints are then arranged to be riveted only on this continuous

 butt-frame.

    If longer outside plating be desired, every third frame may be constructed as a

 butt-frame.

    If preferred, the continuous butt-strop may be placed between the frames, in one

 length, from keel to gunwale.

   By either of these modes of securing the butts of common plates, no short butt-

 strops are required, and it is evident that a vessel having her butts or vertical joints
 so secured, is greatly increased in point of strength, and that there is little or no
 liability to break asunder at those points.

  --Ceiling. For the purpose of increasing the strength of iron vessels, the ceiling

 from the bilge keelson up to the gunwale is made of angle-iron or flat iron in one
 length placed diagonally and from 12 in. to 10 ft. apart, tailing from the centre of
 the vessel to the extremities. The port side of a ship being reverse to the starboard

 side, these diagonal ceiling bars are riveted to the reverse angle-iron of every frame,
 and their extremities secured to the gunwale angle-iron and bilge keelson.

   These iron ceiling side trusses, in conjunction with my central range of stanchion

 trussing, yield great strength without occupying space, and both can be adopted
 with advantage in timber vessels and in battle-ships. If preferred, these diagonal

--ceiling bars may be of wood in iron vessels.
    Iron Masts. The writer plates iron masts and spars diagonally from top to bottom,
 the plates winding round the entire length and riveted together. He also forms an
 iron mast of diagonal spiral lattice-work riveted together at their points of inter-

 section.

    If desired, such a mast may be stayed transversely in its interior throughout. The

 writer also fixes winches to iron masts, with their spindles through the sides of the
 mast, the aperture required for such spindles being compensated by an internal
 doubling plate.

  --War Ships. Between the seams of the external planks of wood battle-ships

 exposed to shot, the writer inserts iron or steel plates, in thickness from l^ to 2 inches,
 and in breadth the entire thickness of the planks to which they are secured ; these
 being in long lengths, are bolted vertically to the planks above and below them, and
                                                                                                  :

                         TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                   215

besides increasing the strength of the vessel, will form a resistance to shot or shell

they may be placed from 6 or 8 inches asunder.

In wood battle-ships, he also fastens along the interior sides of their gun decks,

vertical  iron  plates,  from    J  to  2|  inches  thick,  close  secured  and  bolted  through  the

                               1

side. Such are for the purpose of resisting the shot after it has spent its force in

penetrating the external wood side.

For the same purpose, he places fore and aft along the interior of the gun decks

of wood battle-ships, angled metal shields, the apex of each being in the centre line

of the gun ports, and bolted there through the side of the ship : where the upper and

lower edges of these shield plates join the beams above and below, they are strongly

bolted to the beams and to each other.

In an iron battle-ship or ram, he builds the side of the hull above water and plates

it with 2 or 2i-inch thick iron or steel. Outside of this he timbers, planks, fastens,

and caulks the wood side of a battle-ship, not for the purpose of strength, but for a

resisting medium, in which a common ball may spend its force before coming into

contact with the internal angle- plated shields, which it is submitted will then turn

aside the ball from penetrating into the interior.

These angled shields answer also for beam knees, the weight and cost of which

may be dispensed with.

It is submitted, that owing to such angled shields, the reduced thickness of shield

plates protected by the timber side, the diagonal arrangements of four tiers of beams,

and the central diagonal trussings, an iron battle ram so constructed would have less

displacement, greater strength, more buoyancy, greater speed, and be more credit-

able to the engineering science of this country than those now building at an expense

of 1^ million, the designs of which were not thrown open to public competition,

although the Exhibition building, St. George's Hall, and some of the first engineer-

ing structures in England, are the result of such a course.

On Street Railways as used in the United States, illustrated by a Model of a
  Tramway and Car, or Omnibus capable of conveying sixty persons. By

G. F. Train, of Boston, U.S.A.

In America such a car is drawn by a pair of horses. The tramway is laid in

the centre of the street, and the rail is so shallow that it offers no obstruction

whatever to carriages crossing" it. In wide streets two such tracks are laid down,

one for the going- and the other for the returning traffic. Mr. T. stated that in the

cities of America the system was in constant use, and was now an absolute neces-

sity there. He saw no difficulty in carrying out the system in our English

towns or in London. Where there were inclines, an extra horse would be used
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and where a street was not wide enough for two tracks, he would put down a single

Hetrack there, and bring the traffic back by a line laid in a parallel street.                    had

received a concession to bring out his system in Birkenhead, and he hoped by

September to be able to show it in operation there. All he required was leave from

the authorities in any town to lay down his trams and run his carnages.

                 On a Mode of covering Wires with India-rubber.

                  By Messrs. Werner and C. W. Siemens.

   The authors exhibited a very ingenious machine for accomplishing this object.
These gentlemen use no solvent or heat whatever, but take advantage of the pro-
perty which india-rubber possesses of forming a perfect junction when newly-cut
surfaces are brought together under pressure. The core or wire, with the ribbon
of rubber applied to it longitudinally, is pushed into an orifice, which serves as a
guide to carry them into the machine, so that the superfluous rubber is cut off by
what may be termed a revolving pair of scissors, formed by a disc of steel with a
sharp edge revolving excentrically against a stationary plate, and immediately, by

means of two grooved wheels, the edges are pressed together, and thus the wire
becomes encased in a perfect tube of india-rubber. As many additional tubes as

may be desired can be then put on. The machine is also applicable to the coat-
ing of wires with what is Known as Wray's Compound, with vulcanized India-

rubber and other compound substances containing India-rubber.

                       On the Deglutition of Alimentary Fluids.

                      By Professor J. H. Corbett, M.D.

   In this paper the author describes two distinct forms of deglutition ; that while the
alimentary bolus is propelled with rapidity over the epiglottis, fluids can flow in
two streams, one at each side of the epiglottis and of the aryteno-epiglottic folds,
without the danger incidental to its passage over the central aperture of the larynx.

lie believes that such occurs in the newly-born infant and mammal during suction

it can take place in the sipping of fluids, swallowing of the saliva, and even during
drinking in a continuous draught. Ordinary drinking is accomplished by gentle
muscular movements, which should not be confounded with the gulping of fluids.
In gulping, the fluid is rapidly and forcibly propelled backwards through the
isthmus of the fauces, each gulp requiring a separate act of deglutition ; such act

much resembles the deglutition of solids. The author contends that when the infant
or mammal seizing and retaining the nipple, sucks in the fluid in an almost con-

tinuous stream, the process of respiration is not totally interrupted, as should
occur if the fluid absolutely passed in the middle line over the epiglottis ; it is
argued that the salivary secretion is swallowed safely during sleep ; fluid carefully

introduced into the mouth of persons in a state of insensibility, passes into the
pharynx ; fluid poured geutly into the mouth of a patient whose head rests upon
one side, flows backwards by a gentle act of deglutition, which is chiefly performed
in this instance by the muscles of the corresponding side ; fluids cannot be shaped
like solid food into a definite form ; alimentary drinks must be subject, in their course,
to the laws which regidate the passage of fluids in other cases ; the root of the
tongue being narrow and the organ convex on its upper surface, fluids must naturally
have a tendency to flow from the middle line to either side ; during the mastication
of solid aliment, the juices expressed by the action of the teeth aud pressure of the
tongue, rapidly escape backwards, so that the bulk of the mass is considerably

diminished before the deglutition of the solid part is attempted ; during inflam-
matory affections of the tonsillitic glands, the swallowing of fluids is attended with
difficulty, while a moderately sized portion of solid aliment, which proceeds in

the middle line, may be transmitted with comparative facility ; when a single
gland is much inflamed, deglutition is chiefly performed at the opposite side.

   In experiments made by the author on the dead body, fluid poured upon the
dorsum of the tongue passes backwards into the pharynx in two streams, through the
grooved channels situated at each side of the epiglottis and aryteno-epiglottic folds.

   From all these considerations, it is inferred that in the living body, during the

deglutition of fluids, the inula falls forward upon the tongue in front of the epi-
glottis; thus both uvula and epiglottis afford protection to the respiratory apparatus.
The fluid is divided by the uvula into two currents, which descend at each side
of the root cf the tongue, under the half arches of the palate, as water flows under
the arches of a bridge ; aud such is the principal use of the uvula. The anato-

mical arrangements in the human body are perfectly adequate for the transmission
of fluid in this safe manner. The anatomy of the porpoise, in which the larynx

rises for several inches above the level of the tongue, affords a strong confirmation of
this view, which is further sustained by instances in which the epiglottis has been

destroyed, wounds of the throat, &c. The distinctness of the two forms of deglu-
tition is also indicated by the fact that the mouth may be filled with food, and yet
drink can be swallowed without displacement of the solid aliment; the newly-bom
infant can perform suction in a perfect manner ; on the other hand, the power of
swallowing solid food is gradually acquired, and the organs of deglutition are trained
by successive steps to the safe performance of this process,
